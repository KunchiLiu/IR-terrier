	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effectiveness pioglitazone , new diabetes medicine , decrease insulin resistance improve liver disease patient nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) . NASH chronic liver disease unknown cause involve fat accumulation inflammation liver , lead liver cirrhosis 10 15 percent patient significant liver scar another 30 percent . Although similar condition affect people drink excessive amount alcohol , NASH occur people drink minimal alcohol . It often see patient insulin resistance . Pioglitazone decrease insulin resistance improve blood lipid ( fat ) level , may improve liver disease NASH . Patients NASH 18 year age old may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination routine blood test . They see dietitian counsel diet weight reduction , need . They stop take medication liver disease take daily multivitamin pill . After 2 month , eligible participation enrol study . Participants admit Clinical Center 2 3 day complete medical history , physical examination , blood test , urinalysis , chest X-ray , electrocardiogram , abdominal ultrasound liver biopsy . After diagnosis NASH confirm , follow procedure perform : - Echocardiography - image test use sound wave show heart structure function - Resting metabolic rate - measure amount oxygen ( calorie ) use maintain body function rest . While lie , patient wear clear plastic hood head 20 minute amount oxygen use measure . - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan - show size liver organ . The patient lie table metal cylinder contain magnetic field ( scanner ) 30 minute organ image . - Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan measure whole body composition , include amount fat . The patient lie X-ray scan machine 2 minute . - Oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) - measure blood sugar insulin level . The patient drink sweet drink contain glucose ( sugar ) , blood sample collect various interval 3-hour test . The blood drawn catheter ( thin plastic tube ) place arm test begin . - Intravenous glucose tolerance test ( IVGTT ) - determines tissue respond insulin glucose . Glucose inject vein , follow short infusion insulin . Blood sample collect catheter various interval 3-hour test . When procedure complete , patient start take pioglitazone mouth day 48 week , keep track medication side effect . They see clinic every 2 week first month every 4 week rest treatment period . The visit include interview examination physician blood draw laboratory test . Female patient pregnancy test clinic visit . At end treatment period patient admit Clinical Center repeat medical evaluation include procedure describe .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis With Pioglitazone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) clinicopathological entity recognize frequently recent year . It characterize histologic change similar alcoholic hepatitis , absence excessive alcohol consumption . It typically associate type 2 diabetes mellitus , obesity dyslipidemia insulin resistance . It may progress cause severe hepatic fibrosis cirrhosis significant number patient . Currently , effective therapy condition . In pilot , open label study , propose treat 30 patient nonalcoholic hepatitis pioglitazone 48 week . Pioglitazone show improve insulin sensitivity , possible underlie mechanism nonalcoholic steatohepatitis . Pioglitazone antidiabetic drug belongs thiazolidinedione group . The mechanism action think mediate activation peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors-gamma ( PPAR-gamma ) . After initial evaluation insulin sensitivity , fat distribution liver biopsy , patient receive 30 mg pioglitazone , orally 48 week . Patients monitor regular interval symptoms liver disease , side effect pioglitazone , serum biochemical metabolic index . At 48 week , patient repeat medical evaluation liver biopsy . Pre post treatment liver histology , fat distribution insulin sensitivity compare . The primary end point successful therapy improvement hepatic histology determine reduction least three point NASH activity score . Secondary end point improvement insulin sensitivity , reduction visceral fat , liver volume liver biochemistry .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Age entry least 18 year . Serum alanine aspartate aminotransferase activity upper limit normal . Evidence chronic steatohepatitis , liver biopsy do within previous 12 month . Histologic criterion steatohepatitis : diffuse , chronic liver disease characterize ( 1 ) macrovesicular steatosis , ( 2 ) inflammation evidence hepatocellular dropout , ( 3 ) acinar zone 3 hepatocellular injury ( balloon degeneration ) . Additionally helpful , require , feature include presence Mallory 's hyalin pericellular/sinusoidal fibrosis predominantly involve zone 3 . Absence form liver disease . Absence significant alcohol consumption ( le 7 drink per week previous year ) . Written informed consent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA Evidence another form liver disease . Hepatitis B define presence hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) . Hepatitis C define presence hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) RNA serum . Autoimmune hepatitis define antinuclear antibody ( ANA ) 1:160 great liver histology consistent autoimmune hepatitis previous response immunosuppressive therapy . Autoimmune cholestatic liver disorder define elevation alkaline phosphatase antimitochondrial antibody great 1:80 liver histology consistent primary biliary cirrhosis elevation alkaline phosphatase liver histology consistent sclerosing cholangitis . Wilson disease define ceruloplasmin limit normal liver histology consistent Wilson disease . Alpha1antitrypsin deficiency define alpha1 antitrypsin level less normal liver histology consistent alpha1antitrypsin deficiency . Hemochromatosis define presence 3+ 4+ stainable iron liver biopsy homozygosity C282Y compound heterozygosity C282Y/H63D . Druginduced liver disease define basis typical exposure history . Bile duct obstruction show imaging study . History excess alcohol ingestion , average 30 gm/day ( 3 drink per day ) previous 10 year , history alcohol intake average great 10 gm/day ( 1 drink per day : 7 drink per week ) previous one year . Contraindications liver biopsy : platelet count less 75,000/mm ( 3 ) prothrombin time great 16 second . Decompensated liver disease , ChildPugh score great equal 7 point . History gastrointestinal bypass surgery ingestion drug know produce hepatic steatosis include corticosteroid , highdose estrogen , methotrexate , tetracycline amiodarone previous 6 month . Presence diabetes mellitus define : fasting plasma glucose great equal 126 mg/dl diabetic symptom random plasma glucose great equal 200 mg/dl . Use antidiabetic drug , include insulin , biguanides , sulfonylurea , thiazolidinediones previous 6 month . Significant systemic major illness liver disease , include congestive heart failure , coronary artery disease , cerebrovascular disease , pulmonary disease , renal failure , organ transplantation , serious psychiatric disease , malignancy , opinion investigator would preclude treatment pioglitazone adequate follow . Positive test antiHIV . Active substance abuse , alcohol , inhale injection drug within previous one year . Pregnancy inability practice adequate contraception woman childbearing potential . Evidence hepatocellular carcinoma : alphafetoprotein level great 200 ng/ml and/or liver mass image study suggestive liver cancer . Any condition , opinion investigator would impede competence compliance possibly hinder completion study . History hypersensitivity reaction thiazolidinediones .</criteria>
