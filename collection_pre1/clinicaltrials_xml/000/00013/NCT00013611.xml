	<brief_summary>This study examine whether interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) plus antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) slow HIV disease progression patient low CD4+ T cell count compare patient take ART alone . CD4+ T cell subset lymphocytes-white blood cell part body 's immune system . IL-2 protein naturally produce lymphocyte . Given intermittent cycle , IL-2 raise CD4+ T cell count HIV-infected patient take antiretroviral drug . This study examine whether increase CD4+ T cell lower risk AIDS-related illness death . HIV-infected patient 18 year age old viral load 10,000 copy per milliliter CD4+ T cell count 50 299 cell per cubic millimeter take antiretroviral therapy previously receive IL-2 therapy may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test . Participation study 4.5 6 year , depend point duration study individual patient enrol . Patients randomly assign receive IL-2 plus ART ART alone . All participant advise individually best ART regimen . Patients IL-2 treatment group teach self-inject IL-2 skin ( similar insulin injection ) . They inject IL-2 twice day 5 day every 8 week first year ( week 49 study ) . From week 49 may receive 5-day cycle IL-2 every 4 month need maintain CD4+ T cell count elevation . An extra cycle may give 2 month week 49 follow-up visit ( see follow-up schedule ) , depend CD4+ T cell count . Patients whose cell count increase 12 16 month IL-2 treatment discus doctor possibility stop IL-2 . Those stop IL-2 treatment ask remain study follow-up evaluation . All patient follow clinic every 2 month first year study ( week 1 , 9 , 17 , 25 , 33 , 41 49 ) every 4 month year 2-6 brief history physical exam , urine blood test , return diary card ( record drug side effect ) medication review . During visit second year , patient also ask ability certain ordinary task , take care ; ...</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study compare clinical result individual live advance HIV infection treat interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) plus active antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) control group individual treat stable ART alone . The primary objective study determine intermittent cycle IL-2 delay occurrence opportunistic infection progression advance HIV disease compare ART alone . Patients assign randomly 1 2 group . Patients Group 1 receive subcutaneous IL-2 twice day 5 day , every 8 week , addition ART . Patients Group 2 receive ART . In group , CD4+ T cell count viral load monitor .</detailed_description>
