	<detailed_description>The long-term goal research program develop method clinician predict benefit satisfaction individual hearing-impaired patient derive amplification daily life . The present proposal continue research direction pursue several cycle previous RR &amp; D funding 1986 1996 . This proposal three primary objective : ( 1 ) To determine influence extra-audiological variable , personality attribute expectation , subjective outcome hear aid fitting , ( 2 ) To establish scientific basis selection , administration , interpretation self-report measure hear aid fitting outcome , ( 3 ) To resolve long-standing debate efficacy use clinically measure loudness perception data hearing aid prescription . HYPOTHESES : 1 . Inter-subject difference personality trait , cop style , and/or expectation account significant substantial amount variance hearing aid fitting outcome , independent hearing impairment fit strategy . 2 . Prediction hear aid fitting outcome substantially improve prediction model include extra-audiological data well data impairment hearing aid . 3 . The post-fitting time course hearing aid fit outcome data different different outcome variable . 4 . Self-report hearing aid fitting outcomes stable 3 month hear aid use . 5 . Fitting outcomes optimize individual unpredictable loudness perception clinically measure loudness data use hearing aid fitting protocol . PROCEDURES : Investigations explore : ( 1 ) determinant characteristic subjective outcome variable , ( 2 ) value individual loudness data hearing aid fitting . Subjects elderly men woman bilateral sensorineural hearing loss . The work perform Memphis VAMC Hearing Aid Research Laboratory . Determinants characteristic subjective outcome variable . When self-reports use evaluate hearing aid fitting outcome , assume data primarily reflect efficacy hearing aid fitting strategy . There lack information extent variable might impact self-report data . We explore topic 120 potential hearing aid wearer , follow initial expression interest amplification entire fitting process six month fit . Data describe range pre-fitting variable well hear impairment , hear aid fitting collect consortium six clinical site ( include 5 VA site ) coordinate Memphis laboratory . The Memphis research team complete data collection subject collect outcome data three post-fitting interval .</detailed_description>
