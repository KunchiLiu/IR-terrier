	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect drug riluzole Parkinson 's disease symptom dyskinesias ( involuntary movement ) develop result long-term treatment levodopa . Riluzole block action chemical messenger glutamate , think involve produce Parkinson 's symptom . The drug currently approve treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , another neurologic condition . Patients relatively advance Parkinson 's disease 20 80 year age may eligible 4-week study . Participants complete medical history physical examination , detailed neurological evaluation . The evaluation include blood test electrocardiogram , possibly brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , CT scan , chest X-ray . Participants , possible , stop take antiparkinsonian medication except levodopa ( Sinemet ) one month study begin throughout duration . For first 1 3 day , patient admit NIH Clinical Center undergo levodopa `` dose-finding '' procedure . For study , patient stop take oral Sinemet instead levodopa infused vein 8 hours/day . During infusion , levodopa dose increase slowly either 1 ) parkinsonian symptom improve , 2 ) unacceptable side effect occur , 3 ) maximum study dose reach . Symptoms monitor frequently find two infusion rate : 1 ) one less need relieve symptom ( suboptimal rate ) , 2 ) one relieve symptom may produce dyskinesia ( optimal rate ) . When dose-finding phase complete , treatment begin . Patients take riluzole placebo ( look-a-like pill active ingredient ) twice day , along regular Sinemet , 3 week . ( All participant receive placebo time study , patient receive placebo throughout entire 4 week . ) At end week , patient readmitted hospital receive previous week 's dose riluzole placebo combination levodopa infusion rate determine dose-finding phase study . The procedure infusion dose-finding phase . The dose riluzole increase optimum dose achieve side effect occur ( time dose lower drug stop ) . Throughout study , parkinsonian symptom dyskinesias evaluate use standardized rating scale blood sample draw periodically measure drug level .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective study evaluate acute effect nonselective inhibitor glutamate mediate synaptic transmission severity parkinsonian sign levodopa-associated motor response complication patient moderately advance Parkinson 's disease . In controlled proof-of-principle clinical trial , efficacy glutamate release inhibitor riluzole assess use validate motor function scale . Safety monitor mean frequent clinical evaluation laboratory test .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Males female age 2080 eligible study . Women must either least one year postmenopausal , use adequate contraceptive method least one month prior participation study . All carry diagnosis idiopathic Parkinson 's disease base presence characteristic clinical history neurological finding . All relatively advanced disease levodopaassociated motor response complication , include peakdose dyskinesia wearingoff fluctuation . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : The presence history medical condition reasonably expect subject patient unwarranted risk . Any clinically significant laboratory abnormality include liver enzyme elevation two time upper limit normal , neutropenia ( wbc less 3000 ) . Parkinson 's disease patient exhibit diphasic endof dose dyskinesia disable dystonia exclude . Patients unable treated levodopa/carbidopa alone single , relatively shortacting dopamine agonist also exclude . Patients form parkinsonism idiopathic PD diagnosis dementia ( MMSE less 24 ) major psychiatric disorder ( UPDRS [ Part I Item 3 ] great equal 2 ) . Patients unacceptable prior/concomitant medication also exclude . Since influence investigational compound unborn child reproductive organ unknown , pregnant woman practice effective mean birth control exclude well . Patients prior bilateral surgical intervention treatment parkinsonian symptom , i.e . deep brain stimulation , pallidotomy , fetal tissue transplantation well patient must risk hypotension , cardiac arrhythmia , and/or myocardial ischemia secondary intravenous levodopa challenge exclude .</criteria>
