	<detailed_description>Background : Sleep-activity rhythm disturbance prevalent , disable symptom cognitively-impaired ( CI ) elder . Their nocturnal sleep light inefficient frequent awakening . Multiple short daytime nap episode interfere daytime activity functioning . Daytime disruptive behavior , pace , hit , curse relate significantly sleep-activity rhythm disturbance . Medical treatment sleep behavior disturbance benzodiazepine antipsychotic medication prove minimally effective serious side effect impairment cognition , memory , coordination , balance , tolerance severe rebound insomnia , tardive dyskinesia . Objectives : The degree daytime sleepiness elder may reflect reduction purposive physical , cognitive , affective activity previously sustain daytime alertness promote psychological well-being .

Our research show engage resident meaningful activity improve psychological well-being decrease certain type disruptive behavior . Methods : We test effect Individualized Activity Intervention time occur resident usually nap daytime nocturnal sleep measure actigraphy CI nursing home resident . Examples individualized activity include object tactile visual stimulation , art craft , game . We also test effect intervention psychological well-being disruptive behavior , measure cost . After collection baseline sleep , disruptive behavior , psychological well-being data five day , resident randomly assign Individualized Activity Intervention usual care control condition 21 day . On day 17-21 , research assistant repeat outcome measure . Status : Secondary data analysis psychological well-being , disruptive behavior , cost intervention progress .</detailed_description>
