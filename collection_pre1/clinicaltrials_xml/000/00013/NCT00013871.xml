	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine 2 dos Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine ( PCV ) follow 1 dose Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine ( PPV ) HIV-infected child anti-HIV therapy helpful safe fight pneumococcal infection group child . This study also look protection provide childhood vaccination measles , pertussis , hepatitis B virus . Pneumococcal infection common AIDS-related infection HIV-infected child . PCV may help reduce chance HIV-infected child get pneumococcal infection . This study look whether pneumococcal vaccine safe effective HIV-infected child receive HAART . It look whether HIV-infected child protect childhood vaccine receive previously dose safe improve protection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Infection Streptococcus pneumoniae frequent opportunistic infection observe HIV-infected child . PCVs immunogenic efficacious normal child offer hope reduce pneumococcal infection HIV-infected child . The degree child HAART protect prior immunization responsive new immunization still largely undefined . This study design answer whether PCV immunization safe effective . The immune response prior immunization responsiveness booster dos vaccine measles , pertussis , hepatitis B virus child HAART also examine . Answers question determine whether child likely protect clinically relevant pathogen whether routinely receive booster dos vaccines period HAART . Patients stratified basis CD4 percentage age . Patients previously receive primary hepatitis B vaccine ( HBV ) series receive HBV immunization entry . Other vaccination may give ( base age and/or CD4 cell measurement , immunization status ) PCV entry 2 month , measles-mumps-rubella ( MMR ) vaccine PPV 4 month . Some patient may administer DTaP 6-month visit basis age , previous immunization history , negative tetanus antibody status . Follow-up visit do 8 , 12 , 24 month . Blood sample collect clinic visit assessment HIV RNA , immune response pneumococcus , measles , pertussis , hepatitis B virus , well laboratory evaluation .</detailed_description>
