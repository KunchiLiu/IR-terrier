	<detailed_description>The purpose research evaluate efficacy structure program physical therapy ameliorate adverse consequence Chronic Venous Insufficiency ( CVI ) . A secondary purpose investigate interrelationship among measure chronic venous disease : low limb muscle strength , mobility , symptom CVI important quality life . Sixty patient randomize 6 month physical therapy program control group . All subject undergo complete hemodynamic psychiatric assessment . Key measure repeat twice quantify trend stability baseline measure . Skin biopsy obtain select patient demonstrate response physical therapy evaluate ultrastructural response therapy . Physical therapy conduct 1-3 time per week . Participants visit home program tailor individual maximize compliance . Validated , standardized questionnaire ( FIM , SF-36 , OARS , CHART ) functional rating employ commencement,3,6 12 month . Evaluations hydrodynamics , muscle strength , ankle motion conduct monthly active physical therapy . Participants active therapy offer wait list control group 6 month .</detailed_description>
