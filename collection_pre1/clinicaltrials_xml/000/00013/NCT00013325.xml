	<detailed_description>The purpose three-year study determine prevalence incidence different type cardiac disease ECG abnormalities SCI patient see PAVA SCIC association . Study goal include : ) delineation specific type heart disease occur SCI population manifest pre-clinically clinically ii ) demonstration association ECG finding . This enable validation score algorithms use inexpensive widely available ECG prevention heart disease well 's early treatment rehabilitation SCI patient . Our finding helpful demonstrate cardiological test appropriate mandate annual evaluation SCI patient . There two component study : An outcomes component complete information previously gather clinical computerized database 800 SCI patient convenience sample age-matched able-bodied veteran perform follow cardiac event . A screening component identify pre-clinical disease include Holter ECG recording echocardiograms patient without symptom evidence heart disease see SCI center course study age-matched able-bodied veteran . Hypothesis ( ) : The prevalence incidence cardiac disease include coronary artery disease cardiomyopathy high SCI population age-matched sample able-bodied population valvular disease arrhythmia similar . ( b ) : The prevalence incidence cardiac disease SCI individual associate level completeness injury ( ie , high occurrence high lesion level complete injury . ) ( c ) The ECG helpful SCI patient early identification secondary prevention ischemic cardiomyopathic heart disease . ( ) Continuous Holter ECG recording echocardiograms indicate screen specific SCI patient identify clinical electrocardiographic feature .</detailed_description>
