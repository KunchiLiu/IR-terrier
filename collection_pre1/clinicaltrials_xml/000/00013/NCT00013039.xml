	<detailed_description>Background : Physician compliance practice guideline imperfect . Computer-generated reminder electronic medical record system show increase compliance guideline , often require symptom history data , limit computer facilitation . Heart failure serious condition compliance establish guideline suboptimal . Physicians� compliance heart failure guideline may improve reminder use symptom history data . Objectives : 1 ) Program standard computer-based guideline heart failure use data electronic medical record system Indianapolis Seattle VAMCs . 2 ) Establish system capture data symptom history heart failure patient schedule primary care visit . 3 ) Incorporate data enhance computer reminder . 4 ) Conduct randomize , control trial compare two type reminders� effect physician prescribing , patient objective subjective outcome , health care utilization . Methods : This control trial target patient objective evidence leave ventricular dysfunction cardiac image study current outpatient diagnosis heart failure . Primary care physician Indianapolis Seattle VAMCs randomize receive either standard heart failure treatment reminder reminder enhance history/symptom data . Study data come VAMCs electronic medical record system ( i.e. , clinical data , utilization , cost ) patient interview ( heart failure symptom medication compliance , heart failure-specific quality life , patients� satisfaction primary care ) . Data analysis perform patient level use general estimate equation account patient physician characteristic cluster patient within physician . Status : Data Collection : Enrollment complete , 503 patient enrol Roudebush VAMC Indianapolis 250 VA Puget Sound Health Care System Seattle . The trial continue without irregularity place . More 80 percent eligible patient enrol site . Subjective data collect prior schedule visit 95 percent enrol subject .</detailed_description>
