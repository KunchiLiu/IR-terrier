	<detailed_description>Background : Despite grow array therapeutic option efficacious treatment strategy prevent delay severe complication type 2 diabetes , continue many individual outcomes far optimal . Interventions improve diabetes care educate provider patient disappoint . In past several year , case management widely advocate cost-effective approach coordinate diabetes care improve outcomes , although little rigorous evidence demonstrate benefit type intervention . Objectives : This study follow specific aim : 1 ) evaluate effect target , proactive case management intervention high risk veteran type 2 diabetes : ) glycemic control , b ) intermediate cardiovascular outcome , c ) satisfaction , ) adherence specific care standard , e ) short-term resource utilization ; 2 ) use Monte Carlo simulation model , estimate expect impact change key process care intermediate outcome end-stage outcome . Methods : This study conduct prospective randomize controlled trial . Participating veteran diabetes ( N = 246 ) receive care two VAMCs randomly assign , stratify site baseline hemoglobin A1c ( A1c ) , intervention control group . The intervention consist two nurse practitioner actively monitor coordinated patient care , guide approve treatment algorithm . Data study collect baseline exit examination , baseline exit survey , VA medical information system . The primary outcome measure change glycemic control , measure A1c . Secondary outcomes include serum LDL , blood pressure , satisfaction , resource utilization . The data analyze use univariate bi-variate ( t-test , Wilcoxon rank-sum , chi-square ) method well multivariable regression . Status : Completed Manuscripts</detailed_description>
