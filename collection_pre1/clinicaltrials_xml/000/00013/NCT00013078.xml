	<detailed_description>Background : Falls lead cause nonfatal injury United States second lead cause unintentional injury death . Each year fracture hip account 200,000 hospitalization among elderly fall contribute factor 40 percent admission nurse home . About 30 percent community-dwelling elderly fall year , 10 percent seek emergency medical help fall injury . Data CDC-funded study ass fall among elderly ( SAFE ) suggest many 41 percent elderly patient fall home year follow discharge hospitalization due part deconditioning associate inactivity . Objectives : The controlled trial physical restoration ( PR ) intervention ( Geriatric Rehabilitation Intensive Program , SAFE-GRIP ) design improve physical functional capacity reduce likelihood fall elderly period follow discharge hospitalization inactivity/bed rest . Methods : This four year randomize trial SAFE-GRIP , design improve physical functional capacity , reduce likelihood fall decrease chance injury fall . Patients home recently discharge home randomly assign one two group , PR control , upon receive medical clearance ( time=0 ) . This project provide mechanism establish well-designed innovative physical restoration ( PR ) protocols Miami VAMC test effect intervention rate falling/sustaining injury sequelae home . Our anticipated sample 105 male 105 female age 60+ year inactive home recently discharge home Miami VAMC neighbor community hospital . Study participant randomly assign one two group , PR control , upon receive medical clearance . Baseline measure physical function , health care utilization , ADL/IADL performance health-related quality life take following assignment treatment condition . These measure take eight week follow medical clearance , six month . The incidence fall track throughout funding period subject . Self-report number fall year prior hospitalization , assessment in-home hazard , assessment participant ' post-hospitalization medication regimen obtain baseline assessment use covariates analysis outcome . Status : All subject complete study intervention phase . The projected submission date final report September 30 , 2001 . Analysis prospectively collect study data underway . We acquire HCFA Denominator Files , Inpatient Files , Part B Provider Service Files year 1997 , 1998 , 1999 . The extraction 1997 , 1998 , 1999 Part B Provider Service Files almost complete analysis Inpatient Files underway .</detailed_description>
