	<detailed_description>Background : The goal research determine provide specialist input primary care provider ( PCPs ) mean informal consultation could improve process outcome care diabetes . Several study support role specialist specific knowledge expertise variety disorder include diabetes . A variety method design optimize use specialty expertise include practice guideline disease management approach well consultation/referral process . The referral-consultation process important mechanism obtain clinically useful information . At one end spectrum process , informal consultation involve discussion patient colleague without consultant see patient ; end spectrum , care patient transfer another physician process formalize . Because much specialist expertise reside specialist , expansion primary care sit include community-based outpatient clinic implication access specialist locate elsewhere . This study design evaluate computer-assisted voice mail system relatively inexpensive convenient video-telemedicine system , make practical easily exportable . Diabetes care delivery choose model ass informal consultation base frequency among veteran , management challenge , emphasis improvement diabetes care VA. A secondary goal project well characterize consultation process . Objectives : Patients diabetes mellitus complex may benefit input multiple specialist PCPs must determine need coordinate input multiple specialist . With mind , three objective study : 1 ) To assess impact computer-assisted access specialist expertise ( CASE ) process care patient diabetes mellitus ; 2 ) To assess impact CASE outcomes care patient level ( clinical outcome satisfaction ) , provider level ( satisfaction ) system level ( health service utilization cost ) ; 3 ) To characterize consultation-referral process community-based outpatient clinic ( CBOCs ) . Methods : Randomized control trial access CASE system constitute intervention descriptive study consultation process . The major outcome variable consultation type , adherence diabetes practice guideline , clinical outcome diabetes care ( glycemic control ) , patient provider satisfaction . Status : Project work complete . The final report submit .</detailed_description>
