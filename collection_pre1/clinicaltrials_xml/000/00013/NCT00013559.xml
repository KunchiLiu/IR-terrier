	<brief_summary>This study examine rare disease call Smith-Magenis syndrome ( SMS ) affect people change time . SMS cause small chromosome 17p11.2 deletion ( miss piece ) . The syndrome associate distinct physical , developmental behavioral characteristic , fully understood . To learn disease , multidisciplinary research team study : - The range type medical , behavioral , learning problem people SMS - The deletion chromosome 17p11.2 find gene gene cause SMS - Whether certain specific genetic change cause certain specific medical problem - What sign symptom must present make diagnosis SMS - The impact child SMS family member . Patients age SMS may eligible study . They evaluate team medical specialist NIH Clinical Center course several day . Parents patient ask provide copy past medical record test result review . They provide family medical history information child prenatal , developmental , behavioral medical history . The study may involve follow evaluation : physical , neurological psychological exam ; ear , nose throat evaluation ; speech , language swallow evaluation ; hear test ; eye examination ; image study ( e.g. , X-rays , ultrasound , MRI ) ; developmental behavioral assessment ; rehabilitation evaluation gait ( walk ) analysis ; urinalysis , blood , and/or skin cell study ; sleep study ; consultation require . A tissue sample ( blood cheek swab skin biopsy ) may take genetic study . To obtain cheek swab , small brush rub inside cheek wipe cell . For skin biopsy , small area skin numb local anesthetic small circle skin , usually 1/8 inch , remove biopsy tool . Parents may ask complete questionnaire child growth development , therapy , medication , sleep , development behavioral concern . They also may ask bring child NIH follow-up visit every 6 month 3 year , depend child age . The purpose visit see child change time conduct additional test . Parents may also ask enroll child SMS Research Registry provide tissue sample SMS Research Core Tissue Bank . The research registry confidential database individual diagnose SMS . Its purpose facilitate SMS research initiatives promote development improve treatment SMS . Enrollment require complete 30-minute questionnaire . The tissue bank store tissue culture cell line create future SMS research . About 2 teaspoon blood drawn adult patient 1 3 teaspoon child , depend size . Tissue sample obtain skin biopsy schedule surgical procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project investigate clinical manifestation molecular genetic defect Smith-Magenis Syndrome ( SMS ) , rare ( 1/15,000 1/25,000 ) clinically recognizable yet often diagnosed multiple congenital anomaly/intellectual disability ( MCA/ID ) syndrome ( OMIM # 182290 ) . The syndrome characterized distinct pattern minor craniofacial skeletal anomaly , expressive speech/language delay , psychomotor growth retardation , strike neurobehavioral phenotype include circadian sleep disorder . The majority case ( ~90 % ) due de novo interstitial deletion chromosome 17p11.2 include RAI1 ( retinoic acid induce 1 ) gene ; however , heterozygous RAI1 mutation account 10 % case . While clinical variability exists , haploinsufficiency RAI1 ( deletion mutation ) believe responsible common feature characterize syndrome . Individuals confirm clinically suspect SMS , parent , and/or unaffected sibling enrol comprehensive longitudinal natural history study . An NIH interdisciplinary SMS Research Team ( SMS-RT ) clinical basic science researcher , collaboration extramural investigator , conduct comprehensive clinical molecular analysis delineate physiological , developmental ( cognitive ) , behavioral , biochemical , cellular process characterize syndrome . The protocol aim : characterize phenotypic variability , natural history underlie pathophysiology SMS ; delineate neurobehavioral phenotype respect sleep disturbance , cognition , mood maladaptive behavior sensory process dysfunction ; investigate physiologic functional aspect specifically underlie delay speech/language motor development ; explore genotype/phenotype correlation identify gene ( ) modifier contribute phenotypic variability ; determine potential intervention therapeutic strategy likely improve outcome ; evaluate psychosocial impact SMS family system . Offsite enrollment two pediatric comparison group participate Home Assessment Sleep ( HAS ) also enrol : 1 ) unaffected siblings/control group ; 2 ) DD/ID-comparison group child developmental/intellectual disability associate sleep disturbance .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR LONGITUDINAL SMS NATURAL HISTORY STUDY : Persons know suspected SMS ( male/female , age , ethnicity ) , parent and/or unaffected sibling eligible enrollment . In case , screen evaluation confirm diagnosis may occur NIH and/or via blood sample send deletion screening , prior enrollment . Subjects may exclude participation diagnosis SMS rule initial SMS screen evaluation and/or inability obtain voluntary informed consent . INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR HOME ASSESSMENT OF SLEEP ( HAS ) DD/MRSYNDROME COMPARISON GROUP : Children ( male &amp; female , ethnicity ) less than18 year confirm diagnosis ( base current accept diagnostic criterion ) specify developmental disability ( DD ) /MRsyndrome report include sleep disturbance . These include : PraderWilli syndrome ( PWS ) , Down syndrome ( DS ) , Cornelia deLange syndrome ( CDLS ) , and/or behavioral diagnosis autism , ADHD fragile X syndrome . EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR HOME ASSESSMENT OF SLEEP ( HAS ) DD/MRSYNDROME COMPARISON GROUP : Failure meet established/accepted diagnostic criterion and/or inability obtain voluntary inform consent ( i.e . parental consent child developmental delay/MR ) reason exclusion . INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR SMS RESEARCH REGISTRY AND CORE TISSUE BANK : Individuals ( male &amp; female , age ethnicity ) confirm diagnosis SMS &amp; parent voluntarily give informed consent eligible inclusion . EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR SMS RESEARCH REGISTRY AND CORE TISSUE BANK : Individuals confirm diagnosis SMS . There exclusion base age , gender , ethnicity factor . Decisionally impaired subject may enrol parent , legal guardian , durable power attorney ( DPA ) consent ; assent obtain deem appropriate .</criteria>
