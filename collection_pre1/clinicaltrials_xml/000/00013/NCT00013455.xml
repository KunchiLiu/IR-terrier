	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine relate physiological , behavioral , self-perceived change period hearing aid use function auditory training . The project focus follow question : 1 ) Is experience-related behavioral change hearing aid performance reflect neurophysiologic change ? 2 ) Does neurophysiologic change occur prior conjunction experience-related behavioral change ? 3 ) Does behavioral train modify neurophysiologic representation speech follow provision hear aid ? 4 ) What relationship physiologic , behavioral , self-perceived change impact behavioral training ? 5 ) Are neurophysiologic change limit trained stimuli auditory training alter neurophysiological response ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study examine relate physiological , behavioral , self-perceived change period hearing aid use function auditory training . The primary objective study determine physiological change may relate functional change . The design experiment also allow evaluation training effect , particular , whether train enhances physiological change whether specific train transfer functionally physiologically similar stimulus . The propose project focus follow question : 1 ) Is experience-related behavioral change hearing aid performance time reflect neurophysiologic change central auditory system ? 2 ) Does neurophysiologic change occur prior conjunction experience-related behavioral change hearing aid performance time ? 3 ) Does behavioral training extend period time modify neurophysiologic representation speech follow provision hear aid ? 4 ) What relationship physiologic , behavioral , self-perceived change time relationship impacted behavioral training ? 5 ) Are neurophysiologic change acoustic representation pre-attentive level limit trained stimuli auditory training follow provision hear aid alter neurophysiological response novel speech sound acoustic content similar train stimulus ? Forty-eight hearing-impaired adult age 18 60 hearing aid experience serve subject . Subjects randomly assign one two experimental group : a. individual receive auditory exposure real-world ; b. individual receive intense , control auditory practice feedback , addition auditory exposure real world . Dependent variable include measure behavioral function ( frequency specific speech recognition confidence different level noise ) , physiological function ( amplitude latency mismatch negativity ) , self-perception ( Abbreviated Profile Hearing Aid Benefit ) time . Data analyze evaluate relative change time dependent variable also examine relationship dependent variable consider hour hear aid use audibility potential covariates .</detailed_description>
