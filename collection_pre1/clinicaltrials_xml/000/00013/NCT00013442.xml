	<detailed_description>Over one million person United States aphasic subsequent stroke . Most individual improve spontaneous recovery treatment . However , precise method predict patient improve , , much improvement occur . There need improve prognostic precision aphasia . Currently employ prognostic method miss improvement level substantial margin . Prognostic information could great economic social impact patient , family , treatment . The purpose investigation test precision auditory evoke response ( AERs ) provide prognosis improvement aphasia subsequent leave hemisphere thromboembolic infarct . We hypothesize presence , absence , pattern AER response predict severity aphasia prognosis improvement . Phonemic , phonologic , semantic , syntactic language task use elicit AERs , include auditory late response , mismatch negativity response ( MMN ) , N400 , P600 . Twenty moderately aphasic subject , 20 severely aphasic subject , 20 age-matched , normal subject test . All aphasic subject evaluate AER test battery language test battery : Western Aphasia Battery ( WAB ) , Porch Index Communicative Ability ( PICA ) , Token Test ( TT ) , Auditory Comprehension Test Sentences ( ACTS ) , ASHA Functional Assessment Communication Skills Adults ( ASHA FACS ) . All test repeat 6 12 week , aphasic subject receive treatment . Aphasic subject receive follow-up test 3 6 month treatment phase complete . The patterns AERs examine . Correlations analyse variance ( ANOVAs ) use assess relationship AER measure improvement aphasia quantify behavioral measure . A multiple regression technique use determine best predictor ( ) improvement aphasia . Correlations analyse variance ( ANOVAs ) use ass relationship AER measure severity aphasia . Correlations assessment composite CT/MRI reconstruction subject group use determine relationship size ( correlation ) site lesion , AERs , severity improvement aphasia .</detailed_description>
