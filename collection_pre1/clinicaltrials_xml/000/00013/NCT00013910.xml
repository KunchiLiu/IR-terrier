	<brief_summary>The purpose research study investigate mechanism action new investigational medication ( drug ) , NNC 90-1170 , develop treatment type 2 diabetes ( adult onset type diabetes . NNC 90-1170 modify form hormone , Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) , important control insulin level . Insulin , another hormone , also important control blood glucose level , high normal people type 2 diabetes . This study measure effect NNC 90-1170 , active investigational drug , cause insulin release pancreas response increase blood glucose concentration . These result compare group healthy volunteer similar age body weight diabetes . Also , various hormone substance know control blood sugar measure blood sample draw . One dose NNC 90-1170 give subject type 2 diabetes study , effect dose compare placebo ( inactive substance look like active drug ) . This crossover study , mean subject treat NNC 90-1170 placebo . The order subject receive treatment determine chance ( randomly ) . The study conduct so-called `` double-blind '' study , mean neither subject study doctor know order subject give treatment study . The study include approximately 15 healthy volunteer 15 volunteer type 2 diabetes , conduct 1 clinic ( University Michigan Health System ) United States .</brief_summary>
