	<detailed_description>Because close association sensorineural hearing loss , tinnitus prevalent issue veteran proportionally hearing-impaired civilian population . The VA system disburse $ 110 million per year 115,000 veteran service-connected tinnitus disability , thus clearly problem veteran VA . Unfortunately , VAMCs systematic clinical care available veteran suffer tinnitus . The obvious need develop effective treatment methodology veteran , standardize procedure quantify disorder . Each concern focus laboratory , present proposal address latter need continuation study develop reliable technique measure tinnitus . The goal propose study fully functional system , document response reliability ready clinical implementation VA audiology clinic outside Portland . To achieve end goal , study conduct three concurrent project : ( 1 ) Further laboratory development automate technique comprehensive tinnitus quantification ; ( 2 ) Development technique test tinnitus `` malingering '' ; ( 3 ) Evaluation automate technique clinical environment . For Project 1 , series experiment propose reduce time test , add new measurement capability . Each experiment involve specification , design , implementation program modification , human subject testing , analysis result , modification indicate . Another series experiment ( Project 2 ) conduct develop tinnitus malinger exam . With test , veteran true tinnitus would provide reliable response , feign tinnitus would difficulty respond reliably . For Project 3 , duplicate measurement system instal Portland VA Regional Tinnitus Clinic . The automated technique use quantify tinnitus veteran patient tinnitus evaluation . Patients invited return repeat testing , provide reliability data clinical response . This project promote clinical feedback important final development system clinical tool . The three project outline design develop efficient clinical technique quantify tinnitus perception . Because technique computer automate , implementation VA clinic involve minimum training expenditure . The technique expect impact medical care non-VA clinic , could</detailed_description>
