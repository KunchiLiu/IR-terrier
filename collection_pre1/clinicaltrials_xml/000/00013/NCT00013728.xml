	<brief_summary>We test follow two hypothesis : 1 ) Peaks hourly exposure airborne particulate matter ( PM ) outdoor origin closely associate acute asthmatic response particles 24-hour average exposure susceptible individual ; 2 ) Personal exposure PM , estimate particle dose lung , closely associate daily asthma severity standard outdoor particle concentration measure 24-hour average governmental monitoring site .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We test follow two hypothesis : 1 ) Peaks hourly exposure airborne particulate matter ( PM ) outdoor origin closely associate acute asthmatic response particles 24-hour average exposure susceptible individual ; 2 ) Personal exposure PM , estimate particle dose lung , closely associate daily asthma severity standard outdoor particle concentration measure 24-hour average governmental monitoring site . Toxicological data asthma exacerbation particulate matter ( PM ) suggest particle deposition lower respiratory tract cause inflammatory lung function change suggestive asthma pathology . There scientific need explain epidemiological finding ambient PM effect asthmatic mass concentration expect ( toxicological data ) harmful . One possibility study participant encounter unmeasured short-term excursion particle mass level capable induce adverse reaction lung , effect capture somewhat regulatory standard 24-hour average . Our research southern California vital current controversy regard regulatory standard give health-based scientific rationale specific PM averaging time establish .</detailed_description>
