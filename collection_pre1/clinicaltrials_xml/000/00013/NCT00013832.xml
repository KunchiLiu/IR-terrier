	<brief_summary>This study examine tongue strength endurance , tongue applies pressure swallowing , chin muscle react swallow healthy volunteer patient dysphagia ( difficulty swallow ) . The information study may helpful develop good treatment people swallow problem . Healthy volunteer history speech , swallow breathe problem patient difficulty swallow neurologic disorder , musculoskeletal disease head neck cancer cause tongue weakness dysphagia may eligible study . Such medical condition may include stroke , Parkinson 's disease , multiple sclerosis corticobasal degeneration , progressive supranuclear palsy , Gaucher 's disease , leukodystrophy , cerebral palsy , myositis , mouth , throat neck cancer . Volunteers participate NIH protocol 1 year screen brief medical history physical examination . Dysphagic patient currently enrol NIH protocol also brief medical history physical examination . In addition , modify barium swallow determine nature degree swallow difficulty . Participants 15-minute examination movement tongue , lips jaw fill questionnaire swallow ability . They begin tongue pressure test . To monitor record tongue pressure , thin rubber strip air-filled pressure bulb attach roof mouth dental adhesive . The pressure bulb connect external pressure-reading device . In addition , small plastic pad adhesive backing place chin . Electrodes ( wire ) attach pad record chin muscle activity . With pressure bulb chin electrodes place , patient perform tongue pressure task test tongue strength , long patient maintain certain tongue pressure , fast tongue pressure drop . The task include saliva swallow , water swallow cup-drinking .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The tongue enact complex mechanical event swallow , important propulsion bolus oral cavity pharynx . Successful bolus transport require tongue interact oral structure , especially hard palate , generate sufficient impulsive force pressure gradient drive bolus toward oropharynx . Our knowledge deglutitive lingual pressure dynamic best incomplete . The available data oral tongue pressure phenomenon base exclusively command single swallow . Oral pressure change important everyday eating activity ( e.g. , cup drink ) study date . Past investigation reveal rapid sequential swallowing continuous drinking , contrast command discrete swallow , unique tongue-palate contact pattern , surface electromyographic response characteristic , hyoid displacement profile . Given different biomechanical property motor strategy , hypothesize oral lingual pressure profile sequential swallow also different , sequential swallow require less impulsive force , select dysphagic patient , especially whose swallow deficit associate reduce tongue strength , perform sequential swallow efficiently discrete swallow . This protocol , therefore , propose test hypothesis healthy individual different age , patient reduce tongue strength oral-oropharyngeal dysphagia associate neurologic disorder , musculoskeletal disease , head neck cancer . Our goal : ( ) acquire good complete understanding normal tongue pressure phenomenon function swallow task , ( b ) characterize interrelationship task-induced lingual pressure difference result clinical diagnostic test swallow function patient population , ( c ) differentially identify profile dysphagic patient benefit sequential swallow compensatory/rehabilitative strategy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Eligible healthy volunteer must : 1. least 21 year age ; 2. speech , swallow , respiratory problem ; 3. good general health ; 4. medication would adversely affect swallow ability . Eligible dysphagic patient must : 1. least 21 year age ; 2. neurologic disorder ( e.g. , CVA , PD , PSD , CBD , MS , Gaucher , leukodystrophy , cerebral palsy ) , musculoskeletal disease ( e.g. , polymyositis ) , head neck cancer cause impairment tongue function swallowing ; 3. present oral oropharyngeal dysphagia without aspiration base result standard modify barium swallow study . 4. sufficient auditory comprehension cognitive skill follow test instruction understand nature study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : For healthy volunteer : 1 . History swallow problem condition adversely affect swallow function , tongue motility control , hearing , language , cognition . 2 . On medication ( e.g. , anticholinergic , antidepressant ) adversely affect swallow function , tongue movement , comprehension , cognition . 3 . Oral dryness interferes swallow . 4 . Unsatisfactory performance status , judge examine speechlanguage pathologist , indicate poor compliance plan task ( e.g. , undiagnosed oral motor deficit ) . For dysphagic patient : 1 . Aspiration , identify via modified barium swallow study . 2 . Pregnancy , determine via urine pregnancy test prior MBS test .</criteria>
