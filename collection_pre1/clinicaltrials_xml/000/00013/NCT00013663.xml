	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine HIV-specific canarypox vaccine and/or interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) control viral load ( amount HIV blood ) HIV treatment withdrawn certain time period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immune Therapies Anti-HIV Therapy Withdrawal Controlling Viral Load</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Step I : In addition continue HAART , patient randomize 1 follow 4 arm : A : Immunization placebo ; B : Immunization canarypox HIV-vaccine ( vCP1452 ) ; C : Daily low-dose IL-2 + immunization placebo ; D : Daily low-dose IL-2 + canarypox HIV-vaccine ( vCP1452 ) . Patients Arms A , B , C , D receive vaccine ( vaccine placebo ) injection Weeks 0 , 4 , 8 , 12 . Patients Arms C D receive IL-2 self-injection . HAART provide part study . Step II : Patients arm ( A , B , C , D ) meet inclusion criterion advance Step II interrupt HAART minimum 12 week . The efficacy immunological therapy determine monitor dynamic viral rebound upon cessation antiviral therapy . After 12 week Step II , patient whose viral load remain 30,000 copies/ml remain Step II , HAART , continue weekly viral load monitoring . Patients terminate Step II resume HAART unless viral load increase 30,000 copies/ml 3 successive determination , CD4 count decrease less 200 cells/mm3 less 50 percent baseline CD4+ T cell concentration 2 successive occasion .</detailed_description>
