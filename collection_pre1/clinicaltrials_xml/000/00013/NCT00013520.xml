	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare effectiveness , safety , tolerability 3 anti-HIV combination treatment use protease inhibitor ( PIs ) . The current rule start treatment HIV infection combine member different class anti-HIV drug , 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) either PI nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) . However , combination complicate difficult take , cause number side effect , may become ineffective . Combinations simpler , well tolerate , effective need . Because PIs cause long-term side effect HIV become resistant many time , anti-HIV combination treatment use PIs test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Three Different Initial Treatments Without Protease Inhibitors HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current treatment guideline recommend combination regimens 2 nucleoside analogue either PI NNRTI initial treatment HIV infection . However , efficacy current regimen limited complexity , pharmacokinetic characteristic , short- long-term side effect , drug-resistance profile time virologic failure . Consequently , identification new initial regimen simpler , well tolerate , preserve treatment option event failure , improve antiretroviral potency need . In addition , recent concern long-term toxicity PIs extensive cross-resistance among available PIs lead test PI-sparing regimen . Participants study minimum 120 week maximum approximately 4 year . In Step 1 , patient randomly select receive 1 3 blind treatment regimen : abacavir ( ABC ) /lamivudine ( 3TC ) /zidovudine ( ZDV ) /efavirenz ( EFV ) , ABC/3TC/ZDV , 3TC/ZDV/EFV . Patients confirm virologic failure Step 1 two successive plasma HIV RNA level 10,000 copies/ml great must register Step 2 . Patients confirm virologic failure Step 1 whose plasma HIV RNA 10,000 copies/ml may remain Step 1 register Step 2 . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 04/11/03 : Discontinuation Arm B recommend . Consequently , Arms A C unblinded EFV ABC . A number option available patient originally randomize Arm B . ] Step 2 open label . Regimens include 2 3 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) combination EFV , atazanavir ( ATZ ) , ritonavir-boosted ATZ , tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) . Patients Arm B treatment HIV RNA level le 200 copies/ml within past 8 week eligible randomization open-label intensification Arm B Step 3 . Step 3 regimen include ABC/3TC/ZDV plus either EFV TDF . Patients evidence treatment-limiting toxicity Step 3 study drug option substitute d4T ZDV , ddI ABC TDF , and/or NVP EFV . Patients confirm virologic failure Step 3 whose plasma HIV RNA le 10,000 copies/ml may either remain Step 3 register Step 4 . Patients two successive plasma HIV RNA level 10,000 copies/ml great Step 3 must register Step 4 . Step 4 open label . Regimens include two three NRTIs plus EFV , ATV , ritonavir-boosted ATV , TDF . Clinical assessment laboratory evaluation do entry , Weeks 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , every 8 week thereafter duration study . Evaluations also require protocol-allowed drug substitution make . In addition , 3 substudies conduct : neurology substudy efavirenz , pharmacology substudy atazanavir , viral dynamic substudy .</detailed_description>
