	<brief_summary>This study evaluate whether drug call T-20 slow prevent rapid return HIV blood HAART ( highly active antiretroviral therapy ) stop temporarily . HAART multi-dose regimen effective suppress HIV perhaps slow halt progression viral infection towards AIDS . However , treatment problem-oriented . It completely rid body virus , long-term therapy carry risk toxicity ( harmful side effect ) . Moreover , treatment difficult adhere many pill capsule must take daily . When patient stop take HAART , viral level climb . This study see T-20 prolong time take HIV blood level rise patient stop HAART temporarily . The result may provide insight possible new HAART-sparing treatment . HIV-infected patient 18 year age old receive HAART least 1 month may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test possibly chest X-ray electrocardiogram ( EKG ) . Participants receive either 100 Mg. T-20 twice day 200 Mg. day , inject skin , normal HAART regimen 3 day . ( Patients caregiver taught give T-20 injection . ) On fourth day , HAART stop patient receive 100 Mg. T-20 twice day 6 week . Blood drawn weekly second sixth week stop HAART check viral level CD4+ T cell count . At end 6 week , T-20 stop HAART restart . Patients evaluate month viral level less 50 . The final clinic visit one month time . In addition blood draw , patient undergo leukapheresis begin T-20 possibly restart HAART end study . For procedure , whole blood collect needle place arm vein , similar donate blood . The blood circulates machine separate component . The white cell remove , red cell , platelet plasma return body , either needle use draw blood second needle place arm . The white cell use study T cell function level detect hide virus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HIV Maintenance Therapy With T-20 During HAART Interruption</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) effectively suppress HIV replication , clear completely eradicate HIV infected individual . We also recently begin appreciate fully scope toxicity inconvenience associate HAART medication lead difficulty adherence . Thus , long-term use HAART may problematic many HIV-infected individual . These realization lead search strategy shift focus eradication suppression HIV replication reduce toxicity enhance compliance . One approach achieve goal attempt find strategy allow prolong period HAART medication . Recently , Trimeris corporation develop T-20 , inhibitor HIV fusion T-cells , step require spread virus cell cell . This new class therapy , little recognize toxicity , could use allow patient discontinue HAART medication prolong period time . In intent treat pilot study , propose evaluate ability T-20 slow prevent rebound plasma HIV RNA HAART medication interrupt single 6 week period . The information obtain investigation could provide important insight novel therapeutic strategy HIV infection .</detailed_description>
