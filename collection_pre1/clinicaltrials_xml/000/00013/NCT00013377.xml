	<detailed_description>There two disease particular may serious consequence drive mobility due potentially severe impact visual function : glaucoma diabetic neuropathy . Both disease potentially result significant peripheral visual field loss , sometimes couple decreased visual acuity . We previously demonstrate visual loss alone significant impact drive mobility performance . In project develop predictive model drive patient apply extensive expertise training patient use low-vision aid improve drive mobility . A second question address best train scan patient hemianopic field loss due cerebral vascular accident . We propose configure prism bioptic form similar previously use amorphic lens RP bioptic telescope patient macular disease . The third problem address identification predictor long-term success use low-vision aid .</detailed_description>
