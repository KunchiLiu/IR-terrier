	<detailed_description>Background : Chronic heart failure ( HF ) syndrome impair ventricular function result clinical symptom fatigue , dyspnea , decrease exercise capacity . These symptom lead cyclical pattern increase sedentary lifestyle accompany deconditioning deterioration muscle function . Until recently , prescription individual HF rest minimization physical exertion . Objectives : The primary objective randomize clinical trial determine whether subject , moderate severe chronic HF , complete 12-week individualized program cardiopulmonary training ( exercise group ) would significantly great ( ) quality life , measure Rand Short Form-36 , ( ii ) aerobic fitness , measure oxygen uptake symptom limit maximal metabolic treadmill test , subject meet weekly investigator receive vital sign measurement ( non-exercise group ) . Methods : A randomized control clinical trial utilized . Individuals meet inclusion criterion randomly assign either exercise control group . Individuals exercise group receive 36 week exercise training ( primary outcome variable measure 12 week ) . Participants control group receive weekly visit nurse 12 week . Status : Ongoing data analysis publication . Final report submit .</detailed_description>
