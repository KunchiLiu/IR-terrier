	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effect drug cyclophosphamide ( CY ) inflammation immune response individual Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) . Inflammation immunologic response appear contribute neurodegeneration people AD . In process call gliosis , brain immune cell microglia astroglia undergo activation possible proliferation , promote neuronal injury death . Activated microglia astroglia produce compound cytotoxic neuron , express molecule greatly amplify immune inflammatory process brain . Excessive glial activation proliferation think pivotal event hasten demise synapsis neuron AD . Fortunately , increase understanding immune inflammatory pathology AD provide new opportunity design disease-altering treatment AD . Studies suggest medication nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) immunomodulatory agent may important role alter course AD . CY potent anti-inflammatory immunomodulatory drug inhibits proliferation immune cell . This study evaluate effect CY individual mild moderate AD . Participants study randomly assign receive either two different dos CY placebo ( inactive pill ) 6 month . Participants receive placebo 6 month option receive CY additional 6 month . Participants undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan brain . Measures cerebral spinal fluid biomarkers neurodegeneration , neuroinflammation , neuroimmune activation take . In addition , peripheral lymphocyte subset peripheral marker inflammation assess .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives . The protocol focus immune inflammatory reaction Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) possibility block inflammatory response may alter course illness . The specific plan evaluate biologic clinical effect two dos cyclophosphamide ( CY ) immunotherapy AD patient compare clinically available cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor ( COX-2 ) , rofecoxib . The study test hypotheses CY : 1 ) Is safe tolerable AD patient meaningful clinical dos , 2 ) Can modify central nervous system inflammation immune response AD , 3 ) Inhibits neurodegeneration AD brain indicate peripheral biomarkers AD pathology , 4 ) Is different quantitatively qualitatively effect immune marker placebo clinically-available anti-inflammatory drug COX-2 inhibitor , rofecoxib . Rationale . Inflammation immunologic response appear contribute significantly neurodegeneration ( AD ) . In pathological process term gliosis , brain 's resident immune cell ( microglia astroglia ) undergo chronic activation possible proliferation , promote neuronal injury death several mean . Activated microglia astroglia produce compound directly cytotoxic neuron , express molecule greatly amplify immune inflammatory process brain . Excessive glial activation proliferation think pivotal event hasten demise synapsis neuron AD . Conversely , grow understand immune inflammatory pathology AD provide new opportunity design disease-altering treatment AD . Preliminary clinical trial anti-inflammatory drug AD patient , epidemiologic study anti-inflammatory drug use , experimental model link neurodegeneration neuroimmune/neuroinflammatory process suggest strongly medication nonsteroidal-anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) immunomodulatory agent may important role alter course AD . CY potent anti-inflammatory immunomodulatory drug act primarily inhibit proliferation immune cell . Moreover , immune cell proliferation appear important aspect AD pathophysiology disease progression , exploratory , dose-finding trial cytotoxic/cytostatic drug CY appropriate , especially since CY already widely use treatment immune-mediated illness . Furthermore , preliminary European trial CY AD patient already demonstrate improvement cognitive function correlate highly degree immunomodulation achieve . Design . Study subject include 60 male female patient mild-moderate AD . In randomized , placebo-controlled trial , two dos CY rofecoxib compare 6-month period . While primary outcome measure safety immunologic data , cognitive behavioral measure also collect . The biological outcome measure include measure brain volume ( assessed magnetic resonance imaging ) cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers neurodegeneration , neuroinflammation , neuroimmune activation . In addition , peripheral lymphocyte subset peripheral marker inflammation assess . This design mean provide dose-finding data help design definitive efficacy trial CY safety/tolerability parameter acceptable pilot study .</detailed_description>
