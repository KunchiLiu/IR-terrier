	<criteria>Males ( nonpregnant ) female great equal 12 year age . Patients must one follow systemic invasive fungal infection baseline : systemic invasive infection due fungal pathogen currently license treatment systemic invasive fungal infection , evidence failure and/or intolerance/toxicity treatment approve systemic antifungal agent . Definitions failure treatment approve systemic antifungal agent : For invasive aspergillosis invasive fungal infection lack clinical response least 7 day systemic antifungal treatment adequate dos ; For candida esophagitis lack clinical response least 14 day fluconazole dose great equal 200 mg/day . Definition intolerance/toxicity treatment approve systemic antifungal agent : Intolerance infusionrelated toxicity amphotericin B preparation despite appropriate supportive therapy , OR ; Nephrotoxicity define serum creatinine increase great 1.5 mg/dl receive amphotericin B therapy , OR ; Preexisting renal impairment define serum creatinine increase great 2.0 mg/dl due reason amphotericin B therapy . The systemic invasive fungal infection must present baseline document within four week precede study entry follow : positive histopathology evidence tissue invasion fungal element positive serology diagnostic ( CSF cryptococcal antigen ; serum CSF Coccidioides antibody ; serum , CSF urine Histoplasma antigen ) positive mycologic culture normally sterile site , take current episode infection . Women child bear potential ( less 2 year postmenopausal ) must negative serum pregnancy test baseline , must agree use barrier method contraception study . Women may pregnant lactate . Signed write informed consent must obtain baseline . Assent obtain minor capable understanding . Subjects may previously participate trial . Patients may receive unable discontinue follow drug least 24 hour prior randomization : terfenadine , cisapride astemizole ( due possibility QTc prolongation ) . Patients may receive unable discontinue sulphonylureas least 24 hour prior randomization ( compound narrow therapeutic window increase plasma level may lead hypoglycemia ) . Patients may receive follow drug within 14 day prior randomization : rifampin , carbamazepine barbiturate potent inducer hepatic enzyme result undetectable level voriconazole . Patients may participate blind trial investigational drug . Patients may AST , ALT , total bilirubin alkaline phosphatase great 5 time upper limit normal . No patient serum creatinine great 3.5 mg/dl endstage renal disease require chronic dialysis . Patients may allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis , aspergilloma , zygomycoses , isolated candiduria , and/or catheterordevicerelated candidemia . Patients may fungal infection consider invasive systemic include dermatophytosis oropharyngeal candidiasis . Patients may receive likely receive investigational drug ( unlicensed new chemical entity ) , except one follow class medication : cancer chemotherapeutic agent , antiretrovirals , therapy HIV/AIDSrelated opportunistic infection . Patients may receive likely receive follow medication treatment study period : GCSF GMCSF ( treatment granulocytopenia ) ; Any systemic antifungal medication ; White blood cell transfusion . Patients may hypersensitivity intolerance azole antifungal agent include miconazole , ketocanazole , fluconazole , itraconazole . Patients must life expectancy great 72 hour . Patients may condition , opinion investigator , could affect subject safety , preclude evaluation response , render unlikely contemplated course therapy complete .</criteria>
