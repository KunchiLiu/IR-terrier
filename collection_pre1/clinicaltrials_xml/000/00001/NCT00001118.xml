	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine best dose T-20 , new anti-HIV drug , treat HIV-infected child . T-20 , unlike anti-HIV medication , lessen ability HIV infect certain cell ( T cell ) body . Doctors hope good treat HIV add T-20 anti-HIV drug combination include 1 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) plus nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) and/or protease inhibitor ( PI ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study New Anti-HIV Drug , T-20 , HIV-Infected Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>T-20 first drug develop specifically inhibits function gp41 transmembrane glycoprotein . By inhibit essential protein-protein surface interaction , T-20 able block process virus-to-host cell membrane fusion . Combination antiretroviral regimen ( reverse transcriptase inhibitor plus PIs ) benefit many HIV patient , heavily pretreated patient often develop multi-drug resistance via multiple gene mutation . A pharmacologic agent , T-20 , effective alternative point virus replication cycle make valuable addition treatment HIV infection . This Phase I/II open-label , dose-escalating , randomize study divide 2 part . Patients may participate Part A and/or Part B . Part A ( single dosing ) : 12 patient sequentially assign receive 1 3 dos T-20 give Day 0 SC injection abdomen , deltoid area , anterior aspect thigh Day 1 IV infusion . Provided safety criterion meet , patient complete Part A , new enrollee participate Part A , enroll Part B. Doses Part B determine pharmacokinetic data obtain Part A . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 4/20/00 : Current data project pediatric dose . Each child move chronic dose Part B provide child Grade 3 high toxicity study drug Day 7 Part A . ] Part B ( multiple dosing ) : Patients randomly assign 1 3 dose cohort receive 24 week [ AS PER AMENDMENT 12/7/00 : 48 week ] treatment ( optional extension 48 week [ AS PER AMENDMENT 12/7/00 : 96 week ] ) bid SC injection T-20 . Cohort 1 receives dose identify Part A ( Dose 1 ) low dose well tolerated achieves target trough plasma concentration . Cohort 2 receives next high dose Dose 1 ( Dose 2 ) . Cohort 3 receives either Dose 1 Dose 2 , depend tolerability antiviral activity dose . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 4/20/00 : Cohort 1 receive 30 mg/m2 SC bid ( Dose 1 ) ; Cohort 2 receive 60 mg/m2 SC bid ( Dose 2 ) ; Cohort 3 receives Dose 1 2 SC bid . ] On Day 7 T-20 dosing , child begin new antiretroviral therapy regimen choose site investigator base study parameter . ( Abacavir amprenavir allow regimen . ) [ AS PER AMENDMENT 1/6/00 : Abacavir amprenavir allow . ] The first injection give clinic parent/guardian train give successive injection . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 4/20/00 : The 2 dos give prior obtain trough level Days 1 7 must directly observe medical personnel . ] Patients undergo clinical laboratory evaluation monitor viral load , HIV-related symptom , pharmacokinetics time point throughout study . Patients participate Part A evaluate clinic Days 0 , 1 , 7 . Patients participate Part B evaluate clinic 6 time first 3 week every 4 week Week 24 . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 12/7/00 : Patients participate Part B evaluate clinic 6 time first 3 week , every 4 week Week 24 , every 8 week Week 48 . ]</detailed_description>
