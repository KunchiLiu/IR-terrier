	<brief_summary>This study examine safety effectiveness Zenapax ( laboratory-manufactured antibody ) treat multiple sclerosis . Multiple sclerosis may cause abnormal immune response white blood cell call T lymphocytes attack myelin sheath cover nerve part spinal cord . Zenapax bind protein receptor lymphocyte , keep interact interleukin-2 , substance necessary growth . Patients multiple sclerosis least one relapse within 18 month start study interferon-beta treatment successful may consider study . There two study phase : baseline treatment . During baseline phase , patient three magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan 2 month evaluate disease activity . During treatment , patient receive seven intravenous ( I.V . ) infusion Zenapax clinic . The first two infusion give 2 week apart ; next five give month . Patients MRI scan infusion . The MRIs do use standard procedure use contrast agent , gadolinium , inject vein . Gadolinium help identify new multiple sclerosis lesion brain . Blood urine sample take clinic visit . In addition , patient skin test , similar tuberculin test , evaluate immune status , ask undergo two lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ; optional ) -one treatment phase begin , another treatment complete . Lymphocytes also collect patient , treatment . The lymphocyte obtain procedure call apheresis : pint whole blood drawn needle arm , lymphocytes separated remove machine , rest blood return needle arm . These study hopefully allow conclusion safety Zenapax MS , also address effectiveness respect modify inflammatory activity brain MS patient inhibit autoimmune T lymphocytes involved disease process .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) inflammatory demyelinate disease central nervous system ( CNS ) preferentially affect young adult . While etiology unknown , current concept assume CD4+ helper T cell specificity component myelin sheath initiate pathogenetic process . The activation expansion autoreactive T cell involve secretion autocrine growth factor , particularly interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) , concomitant expression receptor , IL-2R , surface T cell . Since activate T lymphocytes migrate blood brain barrier CNS induce inflammatory process , block IL-2R impact disease activity MS . In trial , humanize antibody IL-2Ra subunit ( Zenapax ( Registered Trademark ) ) use inhibit T cell activation MS patient fail conventional therapy interferon-b . We focus latter group patient , since substantial number patient conventional therapy respond partially completely fail treatment long period time . Up 10 patient fulfil criterion enrol baseline-to-treatment , cross-over , MRI-controlled single-center phase I/II trial ass safety Zenapax ( Registered Trademark ) treatment , time , examine clinical course particularly inflammatory activity CNS monthly magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Furthermore , immunological study perform parallel trial order ) identify impact Zenapax ( Registered Trademark ) treatment immune parameter affect block IL-2R , b ) improve understand relevance activate autoreactive T lymphocytes MS .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Between age 18 65 year , inclusive . Subjects relapsingremitting secondary progressive Multiple Sclerosis 1 relapse within 18 month precede study enrollment . EDSS score 1 6.5 , inclusive . Give write informed consent prior test protocol , include screening/pretreatment test evaluation consider part subject 's routine care . Patients fail standard IFNbeta therapy . To eligible proceed treatment phase study , subject must least 2 Gdenhancing lesion great 3 pretreatment MRI scan ( average least 0.67 Gdenhancing lesion per scan ) . In patient high inflammatory activity high relapse rate experience requirement steroid therapy treatment relapse may prolong baseline phase . In patient high disease activity require steroid therapy quickly afterwards demonstrate disease activity , investigator retains option enroll patient less stipulated baseline month order initiate daclizumab therapy quickly possible . Since treatment escalation would otherwise require therapy mitoxantrone cyclophosphamide , substantial toxicity , step best interest patient . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Diagnosis primary progressive MS , define gradual progression disability onset without relapse . Abnormal screening/pretreatment blood test exceed limit define : Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) aspartate transaminase ( AST ) great two time upper limit normal ; Total white blood cell count le 3,000/mm ( 3 ) ; CD4+ count le 320/mm ( 3 ) ; Platelet count le 80,000/mm ( 3 ) ; Creatinine great 2.0 mg/dL . Concurrent , clinically significant ( determined investigator ) cardiac , immunologic , pulmonary , neurologic , renal , and/or major disease . Any contraindication monoclonal antibody therapy . Patients HIV+ since effect antiTac defined patient . If prior treatment receive , subject must treatment required period prior enrollment . Prior treatment investigational drug procedure MS. History alcohol drug abuse within 5 year prior enrollment . Male female subject practice adequate contraception . Female subject postmenopausal surgically sterile must use acceptable method contraception . Acceptability various method contraception discretion investigator . Written documentation subject postmenopausal surgically sterile must available prior study start . Unwillingness inability comply requirement protocol include presence condition ( physical , mental , social ) likely affect subject 's return followup visit schedule . Previous participation study . Breastfeeding patient .</criteria>
