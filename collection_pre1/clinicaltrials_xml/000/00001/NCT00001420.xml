	<brief_summary>This study examine genetic immune factor involve cause development psoriatic arthritis-a disease skin joint . It describe medical feature natural course disease determine participant ' eligibility experimental treatment protocol . Patients know suspected psoriatic arthritis 5 year age old relative may enroll study . Patients evaluate medical history physical examination , electrocardiogram , blood test X-rays . Additional procedure may include : 1 . Leukapheresis-Collection white blood cell genetic analysis . Whole blood collect needle place arm vein . The blood circulates machine separate component . The plasma remove cell return body second needle place arm . 2 . Skin biopsy-Removal small skin sample microscopic analysis . An area skin numb anesthetic one three small circular portion ( 1/4 inch diameter ) cut remove . 3 . Joint aspiration-Removal small sample synovial fluid ( lubricate joint fluid ) . An area skin around biopsy site numb anesthetic , needle insert joint pull small fluid sample . 4 . Synovial needle biopsy-Removal small sample synovial tissue ( tissue line joint ) . An area skin around biopsy site numb anesthetic large needle insert joint . A small needle attach syringe place inside large needle small piece synovial tissue remove . 5 . Genetic studies-Saliva blood sample collect gene test . Saliva collect rinse mouth tablespoon salt water spit test tube . Patients follow twice year may evaluate participation experimental treatment study . Participating relative patient fill brief medical history questionnaire provide DNA sample ( blood sample tissue swab inside cheek ) .</brief_summary>
