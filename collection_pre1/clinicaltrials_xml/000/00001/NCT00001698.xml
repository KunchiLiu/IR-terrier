	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must objective evidence oral leukoplakia . This include subject previous diagnosis head neck oral cancer , currently free evidence know cancer least three month . Patients must bidimensionally measurable lesion . Patients must consent serial photography biopsy document response treatment . All patient old enough give inform consent ( great equal 18 year old ) eligible . Subjects must excellent performance status ( Performance Status 01 ) . In addition , must otherwise medically fit opinion PI uncontrolled medical condition . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients hypersensitivity aspirin , lidocaine nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent retinoids ineligible . Patients use antibiotic , steroid , NSAID , aspirin , probenecid antihistamine extend regimen least 10 consecutive day , immunosuppressant , anticoagulant , dilantin , lithium , methotrexate , phenothiazine , investigational drug pharmacological activity could compromise test product safety 30 day immediately precede first treatment visit . Patients serious debilitate oral condition require extensive dental procedure order safely participate trial . This trial envision need dental procedure ( root canal gingival procedure ) order allow potential participant enroll study . Individuals social psychiatric situation interfere study compliance unwillingness undergo serial oral biopsy exclude . Patients compromise respiratory function manifest shortness breath mild exertion dependency supplemental oxygen . Patients compromise cardiovascular status include poorly control angina congestive heart failure . ELIGIBILITY FOR ORAL IMAGING SUBSTUDY : Participation substudy require patient enrolled parent trial . Subjects must give consent sign supplemental informed consent pilot study involve oral imaging .</criteria>
