	<brief_summary>This study investigate gene mutation ( change DNA ) cause abnormal bone fibrous dysplasia-a condition area normal bone replace fibrous growth similar scar . The bone abnormalities fibrous dysplasia occur single bone ( monostotic fibrous dysplasia ) , multiple bone ( polyostotic fibrous dysplasia ) , McCune Albright syndrome , associate glandular abnormality . This study also examine calcinosis sample surgically remove patient juvenile dermatomyositis . Patients schedule orthopedic surgery treatment polyostotic fibrous dysplasia may participate study . A small sample bone tissue remove surgery give investigator study research test . DNA extract tissue test mutation . Investigators attempt grow cell sample laboratory evaluate ability grow make protein normal bone cell make . These test design help scientist understand mutation lead abnormal bone formation provide information might lead good treatment fibrous dysplasia . Patients juvenile Dermatomyositis calcinosis sample surgically remove also eligible participation . The removed tissue examine composition microscopic appearance , good understand pathogenesis dystrophic calcification disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Studies Abnormal Bone From Patients With Polyostotic Fibrous Dysplasia McCune Albright Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia ( PFD ) sporadic disorder multiple sit bone replace abnormal fibrous tissue . PFD may occur alone part McCune Albright syndrome ( MAS ) . We previously identify somatic activate mutation gene encode alpha-subunit Gs , G protein mediate action hormone work increase intracellular level cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) , affected tissue patient PFD MAS . The objective study determine activate mutation Gs alpha-subunit lead change PFD , determine intervention block biochemical effect activate mutation vitro vivo animal model system could prevent cellular change characteristic PFD . To carry study , plan obtain pathologic bone tissue patient either isolated PFD PFD context MAS . In one phase study , archival pathology specimen affect bone retrospectively analyze use variety immunohistochemical technique . In second phase study , specimen affect bone obtain prospectively patient undergo clinically indicate orthopedic procedure . Specimens place primary culture , culture cell analyze Gs alpha-subunit activate mutation , mutant-bearing cell study variety cell biologic pharmacologic technique .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All patient schedule orthopedic surgery treatment polyostotic fibrous dysplasia ( PFD ) . Tissue obtain patient procedure clinically indicated standard reason treatment prevention fracture , disfigurement result abnormal growth facial and/ skull bone . The diagnosis PFD establish standard radiologic criterion patient McCune Albright syndrome ( MAS ) , also characteristic skin endocrine manifestation associate form disease . Patients meet criterion juvenile dermatomyositis undergo surgical removal calcinosis eligible . The tissue surgery would use research study .</criteria>
