	<brief_summary>The ability chemotherapy cure cancer , include breast cancer , limited drug resistant residual tumor cell remain chemotherapy generally result relapse . Additional therapeutic strategy eradicate residual tumor cell need . The augmentation specific anti-tumor immune response , mediate T-cells , might represent additional strategy control elimination residual tumor cell . This approach might especially effective T-cell mediate response enhanced period T-cell repopulation follow acute T-cell depletion set minimal residual tumor burden present dose intensive chemotherapy . Such chemotherapy know result severe T-cell depletion . This pilot study design examine feasibility combine dose intensive chemotherapy intervention aim reconstitution T-cell immunity . Metastatic adjuvant breast cancer patient receive dose intensive chemotherapy subsequently receive combination autologous chemotherapy-naive T-cells , patient-specific tumor antigen vaccine , recombinant human interleukin-2 . These intervention assess ability modulate T-cell number , T-cell function , T-cell specificity period T-cell repopulation . Such modulation may result effective reconstitution generalize T-cell immunity generation vaccine-specific anti-tumor T-cell response .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The process T cell immune reconstitution post-chemotherapy breast cancer patient impair . Such deficit T cell immunity likely represent important obstacle tumor vaccine therapy breast cancer patient . In attempt enhance T cell immune reconstitution , administer cryopreserved T cell interleukin-2 breast cancer patient post-chemotherapy . Initial data first 13 patient enrol study suggests administration T cell IL-2 result improved T cell reconstitution relative untreated patient patient receive IL-2 . Importantly , recipients combination T cell IL-2 enhance recovery CD4+CD45RA+ T cell ; T cell subset represent naive T cell phenotype generally maintain capacity respond antigen , enhance regeneration population may result improve immune function may allow successful immune response tumor vaccine . It important evaluate effect T cell administration alone ( without IL-2 treatment ) immune reconstitution post-chemotherapy . Determination relative benefit T cell and/or cytokine administration T cell recovery post-chemotherapy may assist development breast cancer vaccine protocols T cell-mediated immune response may necessary optimal response vaccine .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>PRECHEMOTHERAPY ELIGIBILITY : Patients must histologically confirm diagnosis stage II , III , IV infiltrate breast cancer ; stage II patient must consider high risk great four positive axillary lymph node primary surgery . Patients metastatic disease must relapse confirm pathologically . All pathological material must review diagnosis confirm Department Pathology NIH Clinical Center prior acceptance protocol . Patients enrol protocol may receive chemotherapy one follow mechanism : ( 1 ) Any dose intensive chemotherapy regimen give part separate NCI breast cancer protocol . In case , prior approval principal investigator study obtain . It must emphasize clinical research endpoint chemotherapy protocol must compromise participation immune reconstitution protocol . ( 2 ) In case , patient may receive nonexperimental chemotherapy refer physician . Patients may enrol study receive chemotherapy part experimental study perform outside NCI ; patient receive highdose chemotherapy require stem cell support institution specifically exclude participation study . The determination whether nonexperimental chemotherapy qualifies dose intensive make principal investigator . All stage II III patient must represent new diagnosis must receive prior chemotherapy . Patients metastatic disease represent new diagnosis stage IV , may metastatic disease represent relapse adjuvant therapy stage breast cancer . However , prior one year must elapse since completion adjuvant chemotherapy . Patient must Hct great equal 24 % , WBC count great equal 3000 per mm ( 3 ) , platelet great equal 100,000 per mm ( 3 ) time enrollment . Patients must history abnormal bleeding tendency predisposition infection . Serum creatinine le 1.5 Crcl less 60 cc per min . Higher value may allow determined principal investigator elevate value due tumor impairment organ function . AST ALT less 3 time upper limit normal . Higher value may allow determined principal investigator elevate value due tumor impairment organ function . In presence know pulmonary disease symptom , patient must pO2 great 65 FEV1 FVC great 65 % predict ( unless directly due tumor involvement prior therapy ) . LVEF great equal 45 % postchemotherapy , measure MUGA 2D echocardiogram . All patient must free significant history active symptomatology coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure , neurologic disease , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Patients must Karnofsky performance score great 70 % ( ECOG 0 1 ) life expectancy least three month . Patients must able give informed consent . POSTCHEMOTHERAPY ELIGIBILITY : After completion dose intensive chemotherapy , patient must continue meet eligibility criterion . However , patient receive autologous T cell ( IL2 therapy ) , cardiac ejection fraction represent treatment eligibility criterion . In addition , patient must meet criterion outline . To proceed protocol completion dose intensive chemotherapy , stage II III patient must evidence disease . Patients require adjuvant radiation therapy receive prior proceed protocol . Patients metastatic disease must demonstrate least partial response chemotherapy ( great 50 % reduction measurable disease ) . To eligible proceed T cell infusion and/or IL2 administration completion chemotherapy , patient must Hb great equal 9 , ANC great equal 1000 , platelet count great equal 75,000 . Patients must recover nonhematologic toxicity doseintensive chemotherapy radiation therapy prior receive T cell infusion IL2 . All woman test pregnancy enrollment prior T cell transfer IL2 treatment ; individual must pregnant . Patients must HIV positive Hepatitis B C infection . Patients must chronic need steroid anticoagulant therapy . However , patient receive autologous T cell , steroid anticoagulant therapy exclusion criterion . Patients must present unusual medical psychiatric risk .</criteria>
