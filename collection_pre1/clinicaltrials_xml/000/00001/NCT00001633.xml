	<brief_summary>Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) diagnostic tool creates high quality image human body without use X-ray ( radiation ) . MRI especially useful study artery heart ( CMRA , coronary magnetic resonance angiography ) . In study researcher several laboratory hospital work together determine safety effectiveness CMRA MS-325 . MS-325 contrast agent . It give patient undergo CRMA order improve appearance artery heart .</brief_summary>
