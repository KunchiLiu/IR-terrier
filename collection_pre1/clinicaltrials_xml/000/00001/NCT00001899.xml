	<brief_summary>This study examine effect increase HIV blood level immune system . A good understanding HIV alters immune response may lead development effective immune-based therapy virus . Patients 18 year age old HIV-1 infection receive highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) may eligible study . In order study effect increase level virus immune system , therapy stop patient temporarily . Therefore , patient appropriate level understanding potential benefit therapy risk stop treatment consider enrollment . Pregnant woman may participate woman childbearing potential must agree become pregnant study . Candidates screen medical history , physical exam , blood urine test possibly chest X-ray electrocardiogram . Upon enter study , participant blood test measure amount virus blood , CD4+ T cell count , side effect medication , patient immune system respond HIV test tube . White cell collect leukapheresis . In procedure , needle place arm vein blood flow vein tube ( catheter ) cell separator machine , white cell separate rest blood spin process . Some white cell collect machine , rest blood return body second needle place arm . Patients physical examination blood test every 1 2 week manage accord viral load CD4 cell count follow : Viral Load - If viral blood level remain less 5000 copy per milliliter , medical intervention plan . - If viral blood level rise 5,000 copy per ml high , patient undergo second leukapheresis re-start antiretroviral therapy . They monitor least monthly viral load return pre-study level . CD4 Count - If CD4 count rise remain pre-study level , intervention plan . - If CD4 count decrease 10 25 percent pre-study level , count monitor every 2 week least 3 time monthly . - If CD4 count decrease 25 percent pre-study value , antiretroviral therapy re-started count monitor return pre-study level . If viral CD4 level return pre-study level promptly , patient continue monitor advise possible treatment change . Alternatively , patient whose viral CD4 level similar well pre-study value may offer laboratory test every 3 month least 1 year scientific reason continue study patient immune system . Patients may ask undergo additional leukapheresis future , another interruption therapy future felt safe .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) successful control HIV level infect patient , effective eliminate virus patient life-long therapy thought require . However , proper adherence HAART regimens costly , result inconvenience patient , without significant acute long-term risk . Many patient interested undergoing treatment interruption relieve inconvenience risk . This study seek identify patient monitor virologic immunologic parameter treatment interruption . Patients meet criterion study discontinue antiretroviral therapy simultaneously , patient monitor full panel virologic , immunologic , safety parameter . Through study , attempt characterize mechanism HIV evade and/or suppresses effective anti-viral immune response identify feature virus patient ' immune response associate virologic control follow treatment interruption .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects great equal 18 year age . HIV infection confirm ELISA Western blot . Ability sign inform consent willingness comply study requirement clinic policy . In judgment PI , patient satisfactory knowledge benefit continue HAART well risk discontinue treatment . The patient private physician decision interrupt antiretroviral therapy , target point ( i.e . viral load CD4+ T cell count ) reinitiate therapy , regiment antiretrovirals use upon reinitiation therapy make private physician . History least 2 month ongoing HAART , define minimum three drug regimen consist least two nucleoside analog one protease inhibitor two nucleoside analog one NNRTI three nucleoside place drug class OR patient currently therapy plan resume initiate HAART regimen within next 3 month . No baseline CD4 count great equal 350 cells/microL , confirmation , within last 3 month . Asymptomatic significant HIVrelated illness , opportunistic infection malignancy mucocutaneous Kaposi 's sarcoma . For patient IL2 therapy , agreement resume HAART undergo treatment cycle . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Psychiatric illness , opinion PI , might interfere study compliance . Active substance abuse history prior substance abuse may interfere protocol compliance compromise patient safety . Women pregnant breastfeeding . Creatinine great 2 . Liver function test great 5 time normal laboratory value . Platelet count le 100,000/mm ( 3 ) , hemoglobin less 9 mg/dL , neutrophils less 750/mm ( 3 ) . PT PTT ( absence document anticardiolipin antibody ) prolong great 2 second . Known underlie bleed disorder . Significant cardiac , pulmonary , kidney , rheumatologic , gastrointestinal , CNS disease detectable routine history , physical examination , screen laboratory study . History significant opportunistic infection HIVassociated malignancy . Patient must ever total CD4 count less equal 150 cells/cubic millimeter year prior enrollment . At least 2 measurement , possibly include measurement screen visit and/or H &amp; P visit , must available . Due possible increase risk hypersensitivity reaction , patient abacavircontaining regimen eligible treatment interruption . Patients chronic hepatitis B infection receive treatment 3TC ( lamivudine ) , adefovir , tenofovir suppresion eligible study .</criteria>
