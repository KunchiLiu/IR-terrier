	<brief_summary>Stage III patient may begin therapy prior follow surgery . Patients undrainable significant third space fluid collection ( e.g. , pleural effusion , ascites ) enter directly Consolidation . Patients receive induction chemotherapy methotrexate fluorouracil every 2 week 4 course . Patients receive two 3-week course consolidation therapy cyclophosphamide , follow daily granulocyte colony-stimulating factor completion leukapheresis . Patients next receive myeloablative dos thiotepa follow stem cell rescue granulocyte colony-stimulating factor . After hematopoietic reconstitution , patient receive 24-hour infusion paclitaxel every 3 week 4 dos , follow doxorubicin vinblastine every 3 week 4 dos . Patients evaluate additional therapy ( surgery , radiotherapy , hormonal therapy ) appropriate . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Trial Sequential Chemotherapy With Antimetabolite Induction , High-Dose Alkylating Agent Consolidation With Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Support , Intensification With Paclitaxel Doxorubicin Patients With High-Risk Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot trial examine feasibility administer induction high-dose therapy antimetabolite , follow consolidation use high-dose single alkylating agent therapy finally intensification therapy sequential cycle high dos natural product ( paclitaxel follow doxorubicin ) patient metastatic breast cancer ( stage IV ) , patient lesser stage disease high risk relapse ( patient four positive node ( stage II ) , locally advanced breast cancer ( stage III ) ) , patient locally regionally recurrent breast cancer . Patients receive induction therapy antimetabolite agent ( methotrexate , leucovorin 5-fluorouracil ) four cycle . Patients receive consolidation therapy three cycle high-dose alkylating agent . First , patient receive one cycle high-dose cyclophosphamide administer growth factor support . PBPCs harvest recovery phase cyclophosphamide cycle . The next cycle consist high-dose single agent thiotepa . Hematopoietic stem cell mobilize collect previous cyclophosphamide cycle reinfused follow treatment thiotepa augment recovery bone marrow function . After recovery , intensification natural product chemotherapy administer , consist four cycle paclitaxel give 24-hour infusion follow four cycle single agent doxorubicin . This protocol combine several highly active chemotherapeutic agent attempt improve upon response rate achieve current combination . For high-risk stage II III patient , chemotherapy regimen ( without genetic manipulation PBPCs ) serve chemotherapy backbone onto companion immunotherapy protocol offer . An identical chemotherapy regimen offer stage four patient backbone trial retroviral transduction MDR1 NeoR gene harvest PBPCs .</detailed_description>
