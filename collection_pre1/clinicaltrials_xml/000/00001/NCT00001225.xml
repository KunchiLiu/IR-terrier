	<brief_summary>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) genetically inherit heart disease . It cause thicken heart muscle , especially chamber responsible pump blood heart , leave ventricle . Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) important cause sudden death apparently healthy young people . A genetic test call linkage analysis use locate gene cause inherited disease like HCM . Linkage analysis require large family evaluate clinically order identify member without disease . In study researcher collect sample DNA family member patient HCM . The diagnosis disease make history physical examination , electrocardiogram ( 12 lead ECG ) , ultrasound heart ( 2-D echocardiogram ) . The ability researcher locate gene responsible disease improve increase size family member evaluate . In order continue research genetic cause heart disease , researcher intend study family specific genetic mutation ( beta-MHC ) cause HCM . Researcher plan also study family HCM link specific gene mutation ( beta-MHC ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) important cause sudden death apparently healthy young individual clinical manifestation highly variable . Linkage analysis use localize gene cause inherit autosomal dominant disease , HCM . Linkage analysis require large family evaluate clinically determine member without disease . For study , DNA need extracted blood sample family member . The presence disease determine history physical exam , 12 lead ECG 2-D echocardiogram . The likelihood localize gene increase size family number member evaluate . The beta myosin heavy chain ( beta-MHC ) gene show responsible HCM 10 % -30 % affected kindred . Other linage study show least 3 gene cause HCM kindred , gene presently unknown . We identify 13 unique mutation beta-MHC gene cause disease 17 kindred . This allow u demonstrate skeletal muscle involvement , study abnormal physiology consequence mutation , make pre-symptomatic diagnosis , redefine natural history disease . In order continue clinical laboratory study disease next 3 year , intention identify 50 additional HCM kindred , approximately 50 member , beta-MHC gene mutation . During time , order map HCM gene , also evaluate least 6 family , approximately 300 member , disease link beta-MHC gene .</detailed_description>
