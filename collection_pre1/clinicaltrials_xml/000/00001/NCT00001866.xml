	<brief_summary>This study examine safety effectiveness new surgical procedure correct congenital nystagmus-a disorder eye muscle-vision-brain coordination characterize rapid fro eye movement ( oscillation ) . Nystagmus usually begin infancy early childhood ; effect vision varies greatly among patient . Current treatment , prism glass , acupuncture , electronic nerve stimulation , contact lens , various drug treatment , others limit success . Patients congenital nystagmus sometimes eye problem well , cataract , glaucoma , astigmatism strabismus ( cross-eyes ) . When patient eye muscle surgery correct problem , strabismus , nystagmus also improve . Researchers think simply cut muscle might produce beneficial effect . This study test hypothesis-the horizontal muscle eye cut reattached position . This procedure try one sheepdog good result . This small preliminary trial include five adult patient congenital nystagmus treatment option . It evaluate safety surgery effect eye oscillation vision . If procedure find safe , additional patient study . Patients medical history , basic physical examination , complete eye examination , electro-oculography ( eye movement recording ) determine eligibility study . Those accepted study undergo eye muscle surgery followup eye examination electro-oculography 1 week , 6 week , 6 month , 1 year , 2 year 3 year surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective open-label pilot study new surgical approach never perform human . Subjects study patient congenital nystagmus treatment option . Using standard surgical technique determine simple tenotomy reattachment reduce nystagmus . An oculographic reduction nystagmus measure Nystagmus Acuity Function ( NAF ) , consider primary outcome . Phase II study include binocular visual acuity second primary outcome . A 20 % improvement NAF consider clinically significant reduction nystagmus 10 letter great improvement binocular vision consider clinically significant improvement visual acuity . Secondary oculographic outcome include breadth creation null zone , slow phase velocity foveation , nystagmus intensity . Other secondary outcome include visual function , assess pre- post-operatively use standard measure binocular visual acuity ( Phase I ) National Eye Institute-Visual Function Questionnaire ( NEI-VFQ ) patient 18 year old . Extraocular muscle proprioception afferent innervation control ocular motor behavior also examine secondary outcome . The study initially limit 5 adult 18 year age old ( Phase I ) . However , recognize many visual difference young old patient , study expand include child initial pilot study ( Phase II ) . The NEI DSMC , ICRRC , IRB assess adverse event Phase I , judgment serious safety concern surround procedure , Phase II initiate . The initiation Phase II begin enrollment 5 adult review 1 week post-surgical safety data , 5 patient age 18 enrol . Patients clinical oculographic diagnosis congenital nystagmus determine screen exam NEI previous extraocular muscle surgery nystagmus treatment option ( gaze null convergence damp ) eligible . They must able undergo complete ophthalmic ocular-motor evaluation cooperative standard eye movement recording . After informed consent assent , eligible patient undergo complete ophthalmic ocular motor examination . They eye movement record use standard oculographic recording technique protocol . In Phase II recording take place three preoperative visit least 2 week apart 4 month prior surgery . Using routine operative technique extraocular muscle surgery , patient four horizontal rectus tenotomized reattached original insertion . In addition routine post-operative care , complete ocular examination eye movement recording repeat 1 week , 6 week , 6 month , and12 month surgery . The patient 's subjective visual response ( e.g. , visual acuity binocular function ) compare surgery . Objective change eye movement recording binocular visual acuity post-operatively quantify compare preoperative value .</detailed_description>
