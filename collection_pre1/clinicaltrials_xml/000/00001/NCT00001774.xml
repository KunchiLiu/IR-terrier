	<brief_summary>Fabry 's disease genetic disorder ( X-linked recessive ) due absence enzyme alpha-galactosidase A . The disease characterize abnormal collection glycolipids cell ( histiocyte ) within blood vessel wall , tumor thighs , buttock , genitalia , decrease sweating , tingle sensation extremity , cataract . Patients Fabry 's disease die complication kidney , heart , brain . The objective study test belief patient Fabry 's disease problem blood vessel become large . The wall blood vessel contain muscle relax vessel becomes large . This process refer vasodilation . It control substance release cell blood vessel call EDRF ( endothelium-derived relaxing factor ) . Several drug affect vasodilation . Researchers believe drug may work block affect EDRF . Researchers would like test effect drug blood vessel normal volunteer patient Fabry 's disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vasodilation Patients With Fabry 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fabry disease systematic genetic disease patient abnormal blood vessel , lead numerous complication include cerebrovascular stroke . The objective study test hypothesis patient Fabry disease abnormal endothelial-derived vasodilation . If find abnormal , endothelial-derived vasodilation serve useful clinical outcome measure evaluation efficacy specific treatment Fabry disease , possibly cause cerebrovascular stroke . The endothelium modulate vascular tone release contract relax substance act underlying smooth muscle . It previously demonstrate patient essential hypertension blunt vascular response acetylcholine ( endothelium-dependent vasodilator ) . In present study , shall analyze regional vascular response acetylcholine sodium nitroprusside alone , presence L-NMMA ( inhibitor synthesis EDRF endothelial cell ) 12 patient Fabry disease 12 normal age match control subject . We infuse drug brachial artery measure responses forearm vasculature mean strain gauge plethysmography . Forearm blood flow vascular resistance baseline infusion vasoactive drug , Fabry patient , compare response obtain healthy control population . This study perform collaboration Dr. Julio A. Panza , Senior Clinical Investigator Cardiology Branch , NHLBI .</detailed_description>
