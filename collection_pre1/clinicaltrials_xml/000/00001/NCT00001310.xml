	<brief_summary>The purpose project diagnose evaluate ocular relate tissue various disease conjunctival , corneal , uveal , vitreoretinal optic nerve disorder , ocular degenerative , metabolic genetic disease tumor . These study use light microscopy , electron microscopy , confocal microscopy , immunohistochemistry , molecular pathological include polymerase chain reaction situ hybridization , well measure function cellular organelle , e.g. , mitochondrial function . Lymphocytes peripheral blood well involved biopsied tissue ocular tissue compare categorized disease . Cytokines , chemokines growth factor and/or release molecule blood ocular fluid also analyze . Elucidating relationship infiltrate cell , ocular resident cell , product various disease help u make diagnosis increase understand human ocular disorder . Patients require eye surgery treat eye disease disease eye involve may participate study . Samples eye tissue fluid normally remove discard eye surgery instead give researcher study . The tissue examine microscope study use sophisticated chemical biological test . Immune cell blood sample may also examine . These study help good understand diagnose various eye disease develop attractive therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose project diagnose evaluate ocular relate tissue various disease conjunctival , corneal , uveal , vitreoretinal , scleral , optic nerve , orbital disorder , ocular degenerative , inflammatory , metabolic genetic disease , tumor . These study use light microscopy , electron microscopy , confocal microscopy , immunohistochemistry , molecular pathology include microdissection polymerase chain reaction situ hybridization , ELISA , well measure function cellular organelle , e.g. , mitochondrial function . Lymphocytes peripheral blood , serum , well involved biopsied tissue ocular tissue compare categorized disease normal . Cytokines , chemokines , growth factor , antibody , and/or release molecule blood , CSF , ocular fluid also analyze . We compare tissue morphology well immunological biochemical index , e.g. , cytokine/chemokine level , growth factor , antibody diseases normal . Elucidating relationship infiltrate cell , ocular resident cell , product various disease help u make diagnosis , increase understand human ocular disorder , assist therapy .</detailed_description>
