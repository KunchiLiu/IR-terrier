	<brief_summary>Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome ( HPS ) inherit disease result decrease pigmentation ( oculocutaneous albinism ) , bleed problem due platelet abnormality ( platelet storage pool defect ) , storage abnormal fat-protein compound ( lysosomal accumulation ceroid lipofuscin ) . The disease cause poor functioning lung , intestine , kidney , heart . The serious complication disease pulmonary fibrosis typically cause death patient 40 - 50 year old . The disorder common Puerto Rico , many clinical research study disease conduct . Neither full extent disease basic cause disease know . There know treatment HPS . The drug pirfenidone block biochemical process inflammation report slow reverse pulmonary fibrosis animal system . In study researcher select 40 HPS patient diagnose pulmonary fibrosis . The patient randomly divide 2 group . The patient know take pirfenidone placebo `` sugar pill '' . 1 . Group one patient receive pirfenidone . 2 . Group two patient receive placebo `` sugar pill '' The major outcome measurement therapy change lung function ( forced vital capacity ) . The study stop one therapy prove effective .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome ( HPS ) rare autosomal recessive disease consist oculocutaneous albinism platelet storage pool defect . The serious complication disorder , common Puerto Rico , pulmonary fibrosis , generally fatal fourth fifth decade . There treatment pulmonary disease HPS , resemble idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis . However , drug call pirfenidone antifibrotic effect animal model lung fibrosis . Pirfenidone IND drug initially provide Marnac , Inc. ; InterMune , Inc. , hold license . Pirfenidone inhibits cytokine-induced inflammation . Reported side effect include gastrointestinal upset , photosensitivity rash , palpitation . Between 1997 2001 , perform randomize , placebo-controlled trial protocol find pirfenidone safe efficacious analyze use repeated measure model . Using random coefficient model , however , data definitive restrict group subject whose initial force vital capacity great 50 % predict . Because repeated measure analysis choose priori optimal model , DSMB stop study directed patient receive pirfenidone . ( Of 23 original patient , 3 still receive pirfenidone protocol . ) Now , prove efficacy pirfenidone , conduct block-randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind trial involve 40 HPS patient whose forced vital capacity 51-85 % predict . For every patient randomly assign placebo group , two receive pirfenidone . Patients largely draw Puerto Rican population simultaneously enrol clinical protocol 95-HG-193 . They admit NIH Clinical Center 2-3 day admission every 4 month . The primary efficacy variable change force vital capacity , determine every admission . Secondary efficacy variable also examine . A CT scan chest bone densitometry perform . After 4 year patient accrual , 35 patient enrol ; original statistical analysis plan ( SAP ) call 39 patient enrol within one year . The NHGRI DSMB revise original SAP perform interim data analysis 12 month 30 patient enrol , i.e. , May 2009 . That analysis direct study stop due futility . However , protocol continue provide pirfenidone three original protocol patient still enrol , pirfenidone-treated patient choose undergo pulmonary lavage help u determine effect pirfenidone cytokine profile alveolar macrophage . The lavage would require enrollment separate protocol . The treatment drug stop immediately placebo patient pirfenidone patient plan enroll lavage protocol . Pirfenidone treatment stop lavage perform patient enroll lavage protocol , 04-HG-0211 . All patient invite continue come NIH annually HPS natural history protocol , 95-HG-0193 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA For portion protocol involve continuation pirfenidone treatment , criterion simply previous enrollment 97HG0085 . For enrollment new clinical trial , inclusion criterion involve enrollment protocol 95HG0193 , `` Clinical Basic Investigations HermanskyPudlak Syndrome '' . This require diagnosis HPS base upon molecular ground electron microscopic demonstration deficiency platelet dense body . In addition , protocol 97HG0085 , patient must : Be 18 year age . Have FVC great 50 percent less equal 85 percent predict OR hemoglobincorrected DL ( co ) great 35 percent less equal 80 percent predict , evidence pulmonary embolism . Have evidence reduce exercise tolerance lasting longer one week either St. George 's Hospital Respiratory Questionnaire Dyspnea Perception Scale . FEV ( 1 ) /FVC great 80 percent predict bronchodilator . No evidence improvement pulmonary fibrosis within past year define FVC increase 10 percent DL ( co ) increase 15 percent . Distance walk great equal 150 meter ( 492 foot ) oxygen saturation great equal 83 percent less equal 6 L/min . oxygen 6Minute Walk Test ( 6MWT ) . Be available , willing , able come NIH Clinical Center admission every 4 month three year . EXCLUSION CRITERIA History clinically significant environmental exposure know cause pulmonary fibrosis ( include limit drug , asbestos , beryllium , radiation , domestic bird ) .
