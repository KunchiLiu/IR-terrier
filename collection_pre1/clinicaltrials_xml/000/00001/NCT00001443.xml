	<criteria>Age six month 18 year . PREVIOUSLY UNTREATED OR MINIMALLY TREATED PATIENTS : Asymptomatic HIVinfected child agecorrected absolute CD4 count render possible risk AIDSrelated opportunistic infection , ; Children moderate severe symptomatic HIV infection define CDC classification . Absence active opportunistic infection require acute intervention time entry . Prophylaxis PCP trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole pentamidine time entry allow . Availability parent legal guardian give inform consent deem sufficiently reliable return child 's followup visit . PREVIOUSLY TREATED PATIENTS WITH REFRACTORY DISEASE OR INTOLERANCE TO PRIOR THERAPY : HIVinfected patient previously treat one dideoxynucleosides ( zidovudine , didanosine , lamivudine , stavudine , zalcitabine ) another protease inhibitor ( analyse separately ) experience either withdrawal grade toxicity refractory disease evidence progressive clinical immunological deterioration . Availability parent legal guardian give inform consent deem sufficiently reliable return child 's followup visit . ALL CHILDREN : Must critically ill clinically unstable . Patients receive treatment acute infection must stable therapy least 7 day prior entry study . MUST NOT HAVE ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING LABORATORY FINDINGS ( WITHIN 2 WEEKS OF ENTRY AND NOT YET RESOLVED ) : Total WBC count less 1500 cells/mm ( 3 ) . Neutrophil plus band count le 750 cells/mm ( 3 ) . Hemoglobin le 8.0 g/dl ( history recent transfusion exclusion ) . Platelet count le 500,000/mm ( 3 ) . Creatinine great 2 time upper limit normal . Liver transaminase great 3 time upper limit normal . Bilirubin great 1.5 mg/dL . Hematuria . Because possibility increase risk kidney stone formation patient must severe recurrent persistent diarrhea , family history kidney stone . Patients must receive , within 30 day prior entry , therapy immunomodulating agent ( interleukin2 , interferon , growth hormone , IGF1 , biological response modifier ) , cytolytic chemotherapeutic agent , radiation therapy . Stable ( e.g. , great 4 week prior entry ) corticosteroids therapy treatment lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis autoimmune process stable therapy GCSF ( Neupogen ) dosage least 4 week acceptable . Must active opportunistic infection require acute intervention . Women must pregnant breast feeding .</criteria>
