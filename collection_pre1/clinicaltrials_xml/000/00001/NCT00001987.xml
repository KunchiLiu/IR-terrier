	<brief_summary>The study allow researcher obtain blood , plasma , DNA , RNA genetic study insulin . There focus cause insulin resistance diabetes mellitus . Insulin hormone find body control level sugar blood . Insulin resistance refers condition like diabetes insulin work properly . In study researcher would like compare patient diabetes form insulin resistance normal individual . The study investigate insulin attache cell . Researchers take 4 6 ounce ( 100-150 ml ) blood adult patient may request 12 ounce ( one unit ) blood necessary . Skin sample may take biopsy genetic test necessary . In addition patient may ask eat 72 hour prior test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Insulin key hormone responsible regulate level glucose plasma . In several disease state ( e.g. , obesity , non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , acromegaly ) , target cell resistant insulin action . The intramural research program NIDDK long history study patient rare disorder extreme insulin resistance . We use learn rare patient develop therapeutic rare disease , apply learned understand common form insulin resistance . The purpose protocol threefold : 1 . To study molecular genetics underlie various cause insulin resistance diabetes mellitus . 2 . To understand natural history insulin resistance disorder , include response FDA approve therapy . However , treatment aspect protocol represent clinical care rather prospective research . 3 . To educate fellow Inter-institute Endocrinology Pediatric Endocrinology program NIH rare common insulin resistant disorder . Patients evidence insulin resistance eligible participate study . We particularly focus study follow four group patient : 1 . Patients various syndrome lipodystrophy 2 . Patients know suspected mutation insulin receptor gene 3 . Patients know suspected autoantibody insulin receptor 4 . Patients severe form insulin resistance The frequency visit test perform vary due clinical heterogeneity patient study well worldwide geographic distribution , adjust individual basis . The total quantity blood collect adjust remain within approved NIH guideline appropriate individual age size . The test include follow study : - Fasting blood sampling ( e.g . insulin , glucose , HbA1c , lipid profile , lipoprotein profile , IGF-1 level , leptin level ) - Urine pregnancy test applicable patient - adrenal hormone growth hormone - Oral glucose tolerance test - Stable isotope tracer study measure glucose lipid turnover - Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp study measure insulin sensitivity - Analysis body composition ( anthropometric measurement , DEXA , MRI ) - Measurement autoantibody insulin receptor Type B insulin resistance suspect - Biopsy skin establishment fibroblast induce pluripotential stem cell line - Biopsies subcutaneous adipose tissue and/or muscle gene expression profile - Biopsies liver kidney clinically indicated patient lipodystrophy</detailed_description>
