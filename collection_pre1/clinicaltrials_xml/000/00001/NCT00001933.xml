	<brief_summary>Some thinking difficulty Alzheimer 's patient may due deficiency brain chemical call acetylcholine , help transmit message nerve cell . Nefiracetam new drug stimulates acetylcholine . This study test whether Nefiracetam safely improve memory , think activity daily live patient mild moderate intellectual impairment due Alzheimer 's disease . Patients study must caregiver designated representative . Candidates give medical history physical examination include complete neurologic neuropsychologic evaluation , blood test , electrocardiogram . A chest X ray magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) test do patient test within previous two year . During 20-week study , patient take three pill twice day twenty week either Nefiracetame placebo ( sugar pill ) . Neither patient doctor know patient get drug get placebo . Blood urine test do frequently throughout study . Patients ask spinal tap ( voluntary basis ) measure level drug spinal fluid , PET scan ( brain image test ) . At end study , patient feel well side effect drug ( placebo ) may give option continue treatment another seven month . Animal study show Nefiracetam improve learning impairment memory rat dementia . In small study human , one-fourth patient give low dose drug improve intellectual function , one-half receive high dose improve .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diminished cholinergic function long implicated pathophysiology Alzheimer type dementia . Studies animal model disorder well patient Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) suggest drug capable activate central cholinergic transmission improve cognitive function . Nevertheless , currently available drug type consistently confer clinically significant benefit . To evaluate cholinergic hypothesis symptom palliation mechanistically novel pharmacologic tool , acute safety antidementia efficacy nefiracetam study use double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group design . In contrast currently available cholinesterase inhibitor , nefiracetam enhances activity nicotinic acetylcholine receptor interact protein kinase C pathway accelerate acetylcholine turnover release . Efficacy patient mild moderate dementia assess application standardize neuropsychological test instrument first double-blind , randomize control trial nefiracetam AD . Safety monitor mean frequent clinical evaluation laboratory test .</detailed_description>
