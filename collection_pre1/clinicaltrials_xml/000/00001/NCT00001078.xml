	<brief_summary>The purpose study find safe HIV-positive child respond well anti-HIV treatment stop take medication prevent AIDS-related infection ( opportunistic infection ) pneumonia bacterial infection . This observational study , mean child monitor see develop infection . Children receive medication prevent complication HIV infection , Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia ( PCP ) , Mycobacterium avium complex ( MAC ) disease , bacterial infection . It common HIV-positive patient low CD4 count receive preventive medication . However , drug serious side effect , expensive , possible bacteria resistant drug grow . For reason , may beneficial child stop take preventive medication he/she anti-HIV ( antiretroviral ) therapy improve CD4 count . This study look many child stop take medication develop opportunistic infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Rate Opportunistic ( AIDS-Related ) Infections Among HIV-Positive Children Who Have Stopped Taking Their OI Preventive Medications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Due strong correlation significant decrease CD4 count frequency magnitude OIs Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia ( PCP ) , Mycobacterium avium complex ( MAC ) , severe bacterial infection , CD4 count become major criterion initiate antimicrobial prophylaxis OIs . However , despite benefit antimicrobial drug , associate adverse side effect , patient reconstitute immune system follow antiretroviral therapy may receive prophylaxis unnecessarily . Benefits stop prophylaxis include : ( 1 ) elimination adverse effect drug ; ( 2 ) reduction drug cost ; ( 3 ) removal selective pressure development drug-resistant microbe . These benefit must weigh disadvantage , however , frequent determination CD4 count assure maintenance immunocompetence , frequent occurrence serious OIs otherwise preventable prophylaxis patient lose follow-up , possible occurrence atypical PCP prior exposure anti-PCP drug . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 04/26/02 : The extent complete immune restitution yet define . An important corollary incomplete immune recovery vaccination schedule might need adjust obtain optimal response HIV-infected patient highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) . Therefore , third dose hepatitis A virus vaccine administer . ] After pre-entry entry laboratory study , patient follow every 8 week last patient complete 104 week study observation . Hepatitis A vaccination administer entry Week 24 measure response neoantigen . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 04/26/02 : All patient ( except co-enrolled P1024 November 1 , 2001 ) receive 2 dos hepatitis A virus vaccine study offer opportunity enroll Step II P1008 . Patients Step II receive third dose hepatitis A vaccination Week 104 later . Additional blood sample take 8 week later antibody detection peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) cryopreservation . ] All serious bacterial infection Grade 3 high OI event record compare historical event rate . Virologic immunologic marker study do patient correlate risk develop serious bacterial infection OI event . Patients consider reach endpoint develop PCP , 2 serious bacterial infection , Category C OI diagnose , CD4 % le 15 % re-initiation PCP prophylaxis .</detailed_description>
