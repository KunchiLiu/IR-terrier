	<brief_summary>Respiratory Syncytial Virus ( RSV ) infection common widespread . By age 5 , virtually everyone infect developed antibody strain virus . RSV infection happen adulthood , lead common cold syndrome . In Bone Marrow Transplant recipients disease much severe , usually progress pneumonia . This phenomenon associate mortality rate around 60-80 % . RSV Polyclonal Immunoglobulin ( Respigam速 ( Registered Trademark ) ) approve Food Drug Administration recommend American Academy Pediatrics prophylaxis RSV disease premature baby child bear bronchopulmonary dysplasia . Furthermore , use treat RSV pneumonia child Bone Marrow Transplant recipient encourage result complication . Currently , preventive strategy available approaching infection among bone marrow transplant patient . We intend prevent bone marrow transplant patient develop RSV pneumonia employ strategy already use premature baby , i.e. , passive immunization Respigam速 ( Registered Trademark ) . Our goal evaluate efficacy safety strategy immunocompromised population . We believe reasonable approach wait infection settle treating , optimal therapy currently available .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male female patient age 2 80 year . Must admit Bone Marrow Transplant Unit bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) , peripheral stem cell transplantation ( PSCT ) minitransplantation ( MT ) . Must early phase BMT , PSCT MT , i.e. , receive condition therapy transplant within first 30 day receive bone marrow graft ; Must great 30 day postengraftment treat Graft v . Host disease ( GVHD ) total dose equal great 1.5 grams/m ( 2 ) methylprednisolone ( equivalent dose steroid ) first 3 day . Must negative result ( 48 hour ) RSV screen respiratory viral culture . Less 8 day elapse meeting eligibility criterion , contact one investigator , make decision join study . Patients sign symptom Upper Respiratory Tract infection pneumonia exclude etiology establish RSV ruledout screen culture . Patients excluded condition , opinion investigator , could affect safety , preclude evaluation response , render unlikely contemplated course therapy complete .</criteria>
