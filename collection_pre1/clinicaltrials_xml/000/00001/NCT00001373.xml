	<brief_summary>This study design explore genetics pathophysiology disease present intermittent fever , include familial Mediterranean fever , TRAPS , hyper-IgD syndrome , related disease . The following individual may eligible study : 1 ) patient know suspected familial Mediterranean fever , TRAPS , hyper-IgD syndrome related disorder ; 2 ) relatives patient ; 3 ) healthy , normal volunteer 7 year age old . Patients undergo medical family history , physical examination , blood urine test . Additional test procedure may include follow : 1 . X-rays 2 . Consultations specialist 3 . DNA sample collection ( blood saliva sample ) genetic study . These might include study specific gene , complete sequence genome . 4 . Additional blood sample maximum 1 pint ( 450 ml ) 6-week period study white cell adhesion ( stickiness ) 5 . Leukapheresis collect large amount white cell study . For procedure , whole blood collect needle arm vein . The blood flow machine separate component . The white cell remove rest blood return body another needle arm . Patients may follow approximately every 6 month monitor symptom , adjust medicine dosage , undergo routine blood urine test . They receive genetic counseling study team risk affect child advise treatment option . Participating relative undergo medical family history , possibly review medical record , physical examination , blood urine test . Additional procedure may include 24-hour urine collection , X-rays , consultation medical specialist . A DNA sample ( blood saliva ) also collect genetic study . Additional blood sample 550 mL 8-week period may request study white cell adhesion ( stickiness ) . Relatives familial Mediterranean fever , TRAPS , hyper-IgD syndrome receive follow-up counseling describe patient . Normal volunteer patient gout brief health interview check vital sign ( blood pressure pulse ) provide blood sample ( 90 ml , 6 tablespoon ) . Additional blood sample 1 pint 6-week period may request future .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol study genetics pathophysiology familial Mediterranean fever ( FMF ) relate disease . FMF recessively inherit condition characterize episode fever serositis synovitis ; patient also develop systemic amyloidosis . Our laboratory identify FMF gene several disease-related mutation . The FMF gene encodes protein call pyrin prototype family molecule involve regulation apoptosis ( cell-death ) inflammation . The precise biochemical mechanism proteins function , mutation cause disease , still unknown . There number condition , sometimes referred autoinflammatory syndrome lack high-titer autoantibody antigen-specific T-cells also characterize episodic inflammation . Seven cause mutation five gene : TNF-receptor associate periodic syndrome ( TRAPS ) cause mutation one receptor tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) ; hyperimmunoglobulinemia D periodic fever syndrome ( HIDS ) cause mutation gene encode mevalonate kinase ; Muckle-Wells syndrome ( MWS ) , familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome ( FCAS ) , neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease ( NOMID ) cause mutation gene encode cryopyrin , member aforementioned pyrin family protein ; deficiency interleukin-1 receptor antagonist ( DIRA ) cause mutation gene code interleukin-1 receptor antagonist , protein help regulate level inflammatory cytokine , interleukin-1 ; syndrome pyogenic arthritis , pyoderma gangrenosum , acne ( PAPA ) cause mutation PSTPIP1 , protein bind pyrin . In addition , patient episodic fever and/or inflammation identifiable mutation gene . Some latter case appear cluster family , others sporadic . The goal protocol : 1 ) gather evaluate clinical data select patient FMF related condition , characterize thoroughly clinical feature natural history patient recognize disorder well yet undefined autoinflammatory condition ; 2 ) identify mutation , know autoinflammatory gene gene , lead syndrome periodic inflammation , study possible correlation specific genetic mutation disease manifestation ; 3 ) undertake functional , biochemical , molecular study leukocytes patient know yet poorly defined autoinflammatory condition . Patients undergo screen history , physical examination , clinical laboratory evaluation , usually outpatient department . Imaging study skin muscle biopsy may perform clinically indicate . Where appropriate , ask probands obtain permission family member contact . We collect blood sample consent affected individual , case , unaffected family member , extract DNA , perform molecular genetic analysis . For cellular biochemical study , obtain blood sample possibly salivary sample patient , select unaffected family member , unrelated control . In case adult patient may ask interrupt treatment temporarily obtain additional blood sample . We may also ask small number adult patient undergo leukapheresis and/or bone marrow aspiration research purpose .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Individuals refer NIH possible diagnosis FMF , TRAPS , HIDS , MWS , FCAS , NOMID , DIRA , PAPA , PFAPA , unexplained febrile inflammatory illness . Individuals may see initial evaluation , genetic study , research blood specimen , may send blood saliva sample genetic testing . However , place follow age restriction study : 1 . Leukapheresis perform individual age 18 year ; 2 . Brief interruption ongoing therapy research blood sample propose individual age 18 year ; 3 . Research bone marrow aspiration biopsy perform individual age 18 year . 2 . Family member individual include item 1 : may see initial evaluation , genetic study , research blood specimen , may send blood buccal sample genetic testing . Unaffected family member ask undergo leukapheresis , interruption ongoing therapy , bone marrow aspiration biopsy . 3 . Controls cellular , molecular , biochemical assay genetic study : Individuals undergo phlebotomy specifically provide random control specimen require age 7 year pregnant . Individuals provide control specimen already undergo phlebotomy reason must great 1 year age pregnant . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . In case adult , inability provide inform consent unavailability legally authorize representative ( LAR ) provide surrogate consent . 2 . In case minor , unavailability parent guardian . 3 . Presence medical condition would , opinion investigator , confuse interpretation study .</criteria>
