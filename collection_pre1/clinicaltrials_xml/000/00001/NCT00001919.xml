	<brief_summary>St. John 's Wort popular dietary supplement many people take elevate mood relieve stress . This study test normal volunteer whether preparation may alter mood , mean . Animal study suggest St. John 's Wort may work similarly antidepressant affect level chemical serotonin brain . Participants study must also enrol NIMH protocol # 98-M-0094 ( SPECT Imaging Dopamine Serotonin Transporters Neuropsychiatric Patients Normal Volunteers ) protocol # 91-M-014 ( MRI Imaging Neuropsychiatric Patients Controls ) . Separate consent form require study . Candidates undergo medical psychiatric evaluation may include blood urine test , electroencephalogram electrocardiogram . Normal volunteer mood assessment beginning study . They randomly assign take either placebo ( pill active ingredient ) St. John 's Wort 3 time day 2 week , tell take . After 11-week hiatus , start treatment schedule , tell preparation receiving . Each even 2-week treatment period , subject complete brief self-rating mood assessment questionnaire . At end treatment period , undergo SPECT brain imaging ( type CT scan ) determine dopamine serotonin distribution density brain . For procedure , study subject take three drop potassium iodide solution within 24 hour scan two drop nightly 3 day follow procedure . About 10 ml ( less two teaspoon ) blood drawn radioactive tracer inject . SPECT image do next day . After 1 hour imaging , subject give either placebo St. John 's Wort , image continue another 2 hour . During procedure , five blood sample 6 ml may draw . At point study , MRI scan brain do .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Extracts hypericum perforatum ( St. John 's wort ) become increasingly popular treatment mood disorder . Hypericum extract approve Germany treatment mild moderate depression available standardized preparation . In United States , hypericum extract frequently purchase counter preparation . Inhibition serotonin transporter , similar clinically use selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) , suggest possible mechanism action antidepressant property hypericum extract . We propose study effect hypericum extract mood state normal volunteer concurrently volunteer NIMH protocol 98-M-0094 SPECT image serotonin dopamine transporter availability [ I-123 ] Beta-CIT . A placebo-controlled , double-blind , within-subject design employ two two-week period drug/placebo administration , clinical assessment SPECT imaging separate eleven week . We plan test three hypothesis : 1 ) hypericum alters mood state , 2 ) hypericum reduces serotonin transporter availability , 3 ) action quantitatively associate one another .</detailed_description>
