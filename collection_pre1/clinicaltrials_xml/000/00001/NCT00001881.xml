	<brief_summary>Genetically inherit heart disease ( familial cardiomyopathy ) condition affect heart pass family member abnormalities genetic information . These condition responsible many heart related death illness . In study researcher hope determine sign symptom ( clinical correlation ) associate specific genetic abnormality cause inherited heart disease . In order , researcher plan evaluate patient family member patient diagnose inherited heart disease . Patients participate study undergo several test include blood test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , echocardiograms . Patients may also ask undergo MRI heart provide clear picture . Patients participate study may directly benefit . However , information gather study may contribute medical care , treatment , prevention problem others future .</brief_summary>
