	<brief_summary>This study examine quickly white blood cell call CD4 lymphocyte reproduce long live people infected HIV . It use bromodeoxyuridine ( BrDU ) , compound structurally similar thymidine , one building block DNA . BrDU get incorporate DNA instead thymidine , get cell replicate . Therefore , measure proportion cell BrDU indicate many cell replicate . HIV-infected patient 18 year age old may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , chest X-ray , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) blood test . Participants give infusion BrDU catheter ( thin plastic tube ) place arm vein . Blood drawn 4 time first 24 hour infusion . Additional sample collect often daily first week , twice week next 3 week weekly monthly 1 year . Some patient may undergo tissue biopsy ( removal small tissue sample lymph node , tonsil colon ) compute tomography ( CT ) scan thymus ( small gland lung manufacture lymphocyte . Some patient second infusion order examine change rate CD4 replication time follow potent antiretroviral therapy . Patients follow clinic periodically first year see clinic contact telephone year 4 year . The result study may provide good understand HIV cause disease therapy affect immune system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Understanding rate lymphocyte replication destruction HIV infect patient , well effect therapy lymphocyte replication lead well understanding mechanism behind immunodeficiency induce HIV . To examine directly , 85 HIV-infected patient enrol study . Patients receive two 30 minute infusion ( least one month apart ) bromodeoxyuridine ( BrDU ; 200 mg/m ( 2 ) ) , analogue thymidine . BrDU incorporate DNA measure use anti-BrDU monoclonal antibody . It measure subpopulation cell determine rate replication cell . All participant study reimburse inconvenience discomfort associate study participation .</detailed_description>
