	<brief_summary>The purpose protocol allow patient , relatives patient , may newly describe autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome , evaluate NIH Clinical Center . This evaluation include blood relevant tissue study along long-term clinical evaluation define biology , inheritance , clinical spectrum , natural history syndrome . The aim research understand mechanism involve development expand number typically rare population immune cell ( CD4-8-/TCRalpha/beta+ T cell , otherwise refer double negative T cell ) , relate development expand number immune cell autoimmune ( self self ) responses patient ALPS . In case , may proivide treatment relate ALPS . These treatment consistent standard medical practice . Participants ALPS invite visit NIH year frequently clinically indicate next year clinicians scientist follow course disease manage complication . Knowledge gain study provide important insight mechanisms autoimmunity , thymus gland , role immune system genetics play ALPS . Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome rare disease affect child adult . Each three word help describe main feature condition . The word autoimmune ( self-immune ) identifies ALPS disease immune system . The tool use fight germ turn cell cause problem . The word lymphoproliferative describes unusually large number white blood cell ( call lymphocyte ( store lymph nodes spleen people ALPS . The word syndrome refers many common symptom share ALPS patient . One cause ALPS defective apoptosis , say another way , individual abnormality well lymphocytes ( immune cell ) die instruct . It normal lymphocyte disintegrate ( e.g. , die ) do job . In people ALPS affect relative , genetic message cell die alter : message receive cell die . As result , people ALPS develop enlarge spleen , liver lymph gland , along range problem involve white blood cell count overactive immune response ( autoimmune disease ) . Some patient increase risk develop lymphatic cancer ( lymphoma ) . Provided description eligible study candidate : 1 . Any patient ALPS , male female age . As patient ALPS , candidate must : - medical history enlarge spleen and/or enlarge lymph node extend period time ( past and/or current ) . - defective lymphocyte apoptosis , vitro . - great equal 1 percent TCR alpha/beta+CD4-8- peripheral blood T cell . 2 . Relatives ( age ) patient normal control ( 18-65 ) . 3 . Healthy normal volunteer also enrol provide data normal cell behavior comparison patient . Additional information regard ALPS research conduct National Institutes Health available follow World Wide Web ( e.g. , Internet ) location : http : //www.niaid.nih.gov/publications/alps/ http : //www.nhgri.nih.gov/DIR/GMBB/ALPS/ .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome ( ALPS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose family base natural history protocol allow patient , relatives patient screen Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome ( ALPS ) relate disorder apoptosis , RAS associate leukoproliferative disorder ( RALD ) . Patients relatives evaluate NIH Clinical Center meet eligibility criterion . This evaluation include blood relevant tissue study along long-term clinical evaluation define biology , inheritance , clinical spectrum , natural history syndrome . The aim research study elucidate mechanism underlie immune dysregulation due defective apoptosis patient . Knowledge gain study provide important insight mechanisms autoimmunity , normal thymic extra thymic T cell differentiation , TCR repertoire selection , lymphomagenesis . Medically indicated management ALPS-related autoimmune disease cytopenia also consider provide , use standard care treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : A. ALPS Natural History sample size demographic : Study size : 1000 patient , patient , relatives normal control . Sex Distribution : Male female Age range : All age acceptable B . Eligibility Criteria Natural History Study : 1 . To consider ALPS , patient must elevate TCR alpha/beta+ CD48 peripheral blood DNT cell ( equal great 1.5 percent total lymphocytes 2.5 percent CD3+ lymphocytes ) set normal evalted lymphocyte count . 2 . A history chronic ( great 6 month ) nonmalignant , noninfectious lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly . 3 . Willingness allow blood , tissue sample store . 4 . Patients RALD ( RAS associate leukoproliferative disorder ) present autoimmunity , lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly , elevate normal DNT somatic mutation NRAS KRAS C. Eligibility Criteria Screening potential patient : 1 . A history chronic ( great 6 month ) lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly . 2 . Willingness allow blood , tissue sample store . D. Screening criterion ALPS Relatives : 1 . Extended family member ALPS patient eligible genetic screen determine carry mutation find family . 2 . Willingness allow blood , tissue sample store . E. 1 . Apheresis do healthy volunteer patient ALPS adequate peripheral venous access . Women childbearing age must negative pregnancy test within 24 hour procedure must breastfeed . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Any condition Principal Investigator deem nonconducive research goal study .</criteria>
