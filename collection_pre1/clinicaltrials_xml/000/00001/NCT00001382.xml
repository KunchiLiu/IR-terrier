	<brief_title>A Phase I Study Recombinant Vaccinia Virus That Expresses Prostate Specific Antigen Adult Patients With Adenocarcinoma Prostate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial evaluate , patient metastatic prostate cancer , tolerability , toxicity , efficacy , immunologic effect repeat vaccination recombinant vaccinia virus contains Prostate Specific Antigen gene ( PROSTVAC ) . Patients PSA-expressing adenocarcinoma prostate evaluate eligibility include history prior vaccinia ( vaccine smallpox ) immunocompetence . We complete phase I trial investigate use rV-CEA adenocarcinoma GI tract , lung breast . The toxicity encounter local reaction vaccine . We encounter myelosuppression systemic autoimmune reaction . We would like evaluate four dos ensure safety decide best biological dose . Six patient receive 2.65 x 10 ( 5 ) PFU 2.65 x 10 ( 6 ) PFU vaccine scarification . Because high dos achieve scarification , six patient receive 2.65 x 10 ( 7 ) PFU 2.65 x 10 ( 8 ) PFU subcutaneously . We plan give three vaccination four week interval . All six patient treat dose level must evaluable 4 week enrol patient higher dose level . No intrapatient escalation plan . Toxicity , tumor response , humoral cellular immunity factor monitor . Optional lymphapheresis do patient HLA A2 . Once determined best biological dose , would like accrue additional 6 patient level .</detailed_description>
