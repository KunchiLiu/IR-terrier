	<brief_summary>The main objective study : 1 ) determine whether various level severity oral candidiasis ( thrush ) child associate different level speech production , feed skill , self-concept , 2 ) ass effect reduction oral thrush time speech function , feed skill , self-concept HIV-infected patient already receive various antifungal medication treatment thrush ( Note : Decisions regard antifungal therapy make completely independent study ) . Children HIV disease , age 6-21 year , oral thrush eligible paricipate study . The child his/her parent ask complete variety measure specific time interval approximately one month visit National Institutes Health treatment protocol . First , nurse rate location severity thrush child 's mouth . Then parent complete questionnaire assess effect oral thrush child 's feeding speech skill everyday functioning . Finally , child administer brief speech oral-motor evaluation complete questionnaire thrush affect his/her day-to-day activity self-concept . The result study may help good understand cause expressive language deficit observe child HIV infection . More specifically , determine speech feed problem HIV-infected child associate oral thrush . Learning impact oral thrush speech , feeding , self-concept child HIV disease may use parent patient education develop rehabilitative recommendation benefit HIV-infected patient oral thrush .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Oral Candidiasis Speech Production , Feeding Skills , Self-Concept Children Adolescents With Symptomatic HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Language impairment child symptomatic HIV infection associate direct effect HIV central nervous system ( CNS ) . Furthermore , expressive language vulnerable effect HIV compare receptive language ( Wolters , et al. , 1995 ) . Several factor , however , likely involved produce expressive language impairment observe HIV-infected pediatric population . Oral candidiasis ( thrush ) , fungal infection oral cavity frequently appear HIV-infected child ( Walsh , 1994 ) , also may contribute speech language deficit depend severity thrush . Feeding skill self-concept may negatively affected oral thrush well . The effect oral candidiasis speech production , feed skill , self-concept child adolescent HIV infection examine pilot study . Several discipline ( Neuropsychology , Speech , Nursing , Infectious Disease ) involve investigate severity oral candidiasis various aspect everyday behavior . Interdisciplinary assessment ramification oral thrush speech production feed skill conduct date child adolescent infect HIV . Most study assess single dimension function language yield descriptive data , example , regard severity oral thrush .
