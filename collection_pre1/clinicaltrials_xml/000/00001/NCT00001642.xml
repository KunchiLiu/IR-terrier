	<brief_summary>The goal project identify clone gene ( ) responsible Alagille Syndrome ( AGS ) positional clone approach . The first step towards goal define small genomic candidate region AGS 20p12 begin identify gene within region , definition , candidate gene disease . In collaborative effort clinician-investigators study Alagille syndrome , metaphase chromosome genomic DNA affect individual study subchromosomal deletion mutation candidate gene . Characterization gene involve Alagille syndrome could provide important insight pathophysiology disease , development normal liver treatment disease . Recently , others find mutation Jagged1 , Notch1 receptor responsible Alagille Syndrome .</brief_summary>
