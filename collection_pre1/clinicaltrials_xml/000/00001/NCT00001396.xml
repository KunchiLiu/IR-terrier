	<brief_summary>Several study show specialized pacemaking device ( DDD pace ) improve symptom associate hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) adult . In addition , study also show specialized pacemaking device ( DDD pace ) improve condition HCM child . However , growth body organ , include heart , rapid childhood . Therefore long-term effect DDD pace child unknown . The purpose study examine growth rate nutrition child HCM . Due heart condition restriction often place child 's activity level , child HCM may grow slow rat may great tendency overweight . Children participate study growth rate nutritional status measure study begin throughout course study . Findings research study directly benefit patient participate . However , information gather result study may lead improvement management child HCM future .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Several study show dual chamber ( DDD ) pacemaker therapy relieve LV outflow obstruction improve symptom adult patient obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) . It however , uncertain whether DDD pace efficacious child obstructive HCM , evolve cardiac morphology increase LV hypertrophy outflow obstruction associate rapid body growth . We propose monitor clinical progress , cardiac morphologic hemodynamic change several year follow implantation DDD pacemaker child present obstructive HCM age 5 15 year . Functional status , myocardial ischemia , arrhythmia , LV outflow obstruction evaluate exercise test , echocardiography , thallium scintigraphy , Holter monitoring , electrophysiologic cardiac catheterization study . The result pacemaker therapy compare finding cohort young patient obstructive HCM elect treat DDD pacemaker .</detailed_description>
