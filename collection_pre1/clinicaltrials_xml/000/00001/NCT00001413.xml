	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine calcium absorption bone mineral density woman depression . Research indicate pre-menopausal woman depression significantly low bone mineral density ( BMD ) pre-menopausal woman without depression . Although mechanisms BMD loss unclear , researcher believe individual depression impair calcium absorption . However , unknown whether abnormal absorption result depression side effect drug use treat . This study compare calcium absorption woman depression healthy woman without depression . Participants study give two non-radioactive calcium isotope . One take mouth must inject . Participants level isotope urine measured estimate true fractional calcium absorption ( TFCA ) . Participants may also dual X-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan measure total body adiposity lean body mass .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Osteoporosis condition underdiagnosed undertreated , often go unnoticed fragility fracture occur many year progressive loss bone quality . Risk factor osteoporosis include glucocorticoid excess pro-inflammatory state , others observe substantial proportion patient Major Depressive Disorder . We find statistically clinically significant reduction bone mineral density ( BMD ) group 24 depressed otherwise healthy pre-menopausal woman , compare 24 healthy , closely matched control . The difference significant several trabecular bone site ( e.g. , 13.6 % femoral neck , 13.6 % Ward 's triangle , 10.8 % trochanter ) . Epidemiological study indicate loss trabecular bone mineral density magnitude associate increased lifetime risk fracture 50 % . Although mechanism ( ) low bone mineral density patient past current depression yet elucidate , subject show significantly high 24-hour urinary free cortisol excretion match control . However , extent low bone mineral density woman past current depression account strictly basis hypercortisolism alone , likely require hormonal biochemical factor well . Preliminary data subject recruit large study mother without mood disorder offspring indicate disproportionate number young adult offspring mother Major Depressive Disorder show reduce BMD , 2/3 yet manifest clinical sign symptom mood disorder . In light fact major depression affect 5 % 9 % female population , depression-associated low bone mineral density potentially predispose million woman enhance susceptibility osteoporosis . We therefore wish continue assessment bone mineral density subject past current depression document incidence low bone mineral density large series . We also wish identify subject past present depression reduce bone mineral density offer possibility participate study design clarify pathophysiologic mechanism involve low bone mineral density , identify clinical characteristic depressive illness may predict increase risk osteopenia osteoporosis , examine association low BMD endocrine metabolic disturbance see depressive illness , identify may require therapeutic intervention .</detailed_description>
