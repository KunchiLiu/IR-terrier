	<brief_summary>The purpose study see child young adult well immune system start highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) good weak immune system start HAART . HIV infection weaken immune system 's ability fight infection disease . HAART type anti-HIV therapy show improve immune system adult . However , patient show amount improvement HAART . Doctors believe result may depend strong patient 's immune system start HAART . Long-term effect HAART child young adult yet study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-Term Effects HAART Youth With Stronger Immune Systems Versus Youth With Weaker Immune Systems</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent adult clinical trial involve combination HAART , include protease inhibitor ( PI ) , demonstrate improvement somatic immune system function . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 2/27/01 : More recently , similar success demonstrate PI-sparing regimen , zidovudine , lamivudine , efavirenz . ] Not individual , however , experience level immune reconstitution , oftentimes improvement short-lived . Adolescent patient may great potential immune restoration residual thymic tissue therefore may experience great long-term virus-free state compare adult patient . This study examine duration virologic efficacy HAART adolescent HIV-positive population . Patients begin study initiate HAART regimen minimum 3 drug , least 1 must PI [ AS PER AMENDMENT 2/27/01 : efavirenz ( EFV ) ] . A variety drug combination use ; therefore , patient group accord class drug respective regimen ( e.g. , 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [ NRTIs ] plus 1 PI ; 2 NRTIs plus 2 PIs ; 1 2 NRTIs plus 1 PI plus 1 nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [ NNRTI ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 2/27/01 : ; 2 NRTIs plus EFV ] ) . At time HAART initiation , patient undergo immunologic virologic assessment order determine baseline value . Then , determine virologic success failure HAART , HIV-1 RNA measurement take compare initial baseline value . Virologic success equal undetectable HIV-1 RNA Week 12 [ AS PER AMENDMENT 2/27/01 : confirm Week 16 ] significant ( great 1 log ) decrease HIV-1 RNA baseline Week 12 [ AS PER AMENDMENT 2/27/01 : confirm undetectable HIV-1 RNA next schedule visit ( Week 24 ) ] . Patients follow minimum 3 year maintain viral suppression demonstrate virologic failure . From value , correlation may exist HIV-1 RNA value HAART deduce . Patients virologic failure initial HAART regimen may allow change second HAART regimen . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 2/27/01 : Patients virologic success second HAART regimen follow minimum 3 year . ] Patients virologic failure second HAART regimen voluntarily discontinue HAART follow use abbreviate schedule 3 year .</detailed_description>
