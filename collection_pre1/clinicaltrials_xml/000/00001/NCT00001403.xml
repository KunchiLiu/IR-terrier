	<brief_summary>This study examine rare congenital disorder involve malformation abnormal growth . It focus patient Proteus syndrome , whose physical feature characterize overgrowth , benign tumor fatty tissue blood vessel , asymmetric arm leg , large foot thick sol . The study explore genetic biochemical cause course disease , change symptom time , effect disease patient . Patients Proteus syndrome parent may eligible study . Parents study , possible , comparison molecular finding . Study candidate medical history physical examination , include X-rays possibly image test , computerize tomography ( CT ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ultrasound . Other test examination may do need . Those enrolled study interview complete questionnaire , , disease affect . ( Parents ask feeling child rare disorder . ) Patients provide small blood sample research may ask undergo biopsy normal area skin tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose project specifically delineate phenotype natural history well understand genetic etiology Proteus syndrome ( PS ) overgrowth disorder hypothesize AKT/PI3K pathway . As recently determine molecular cause PS relate disorder fibroadipose overgrowth , main objective move forward include genotype-phenotype correlation , identify quantifiable phenotypic characteristic patient measure change characteristic time , develop potential biomarkers future therapeutic research , use new molecular insight expand understand PS related overgrowth disorder . The natural history specific phenotypic characteristic patient PS select overgrowth disorder determine clinical assessment longitudinal followup cohort patient . Subjects screen eligibility use publish diagnostic criterion PS ; screen AKT1 pathway gene mutation may use patient overlap phenotype . As well , hope identify thoroughly phenotype cohort patient molecularly-confirmed AKT1 mutation may candidate future therapeutic intervention study . The discovery AKT1 activate mutation patient disease provide u attractive pathway toward treatment devastate disorder . We also propose expand clinical ascertainment determine full range PS/AKT1 activate mutation phenotype study overlap condition . The etiology disorder study use candidate gene analysis ( primarily base PI3K/AKT pathway ) possibly exome whole genome sequencing ( do protocol 10-HG-0065 ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All patient meet clinical diagnostic criterion PS , demonstrate AKT1 p.Glu17Lys mutation well biological parent , consider eligible protocol . As well , generally offer inperson evaluation NIHCC patient PS whenever possible . Patients overgrowth definitively PS ( i.e. , appear meet clinical diagnostic criterion ) biological parent may also eligible participate study . Decisions invite patient group NIHCC inperson evaluation make casebycase basis patient phenotype , health , proximity NIH , fit current research aim take account . In general , consider subject one manifestation PS clinical criterion eligible . There exclusion race , age , gender participant . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients cancer overgrowth nontumor manifestation PS nonPS overgrowth , whose tumor may harbor AKT1 , PIK3CA , mutation , eligible study . In general , patient clearly meet diagnostic criterion wellcharacterized overgrowth syndrome NOT PS eligible study . BannayanRileyRuvalcaba syndrome PHACES syndrome example entity . We plan enroll prisoner , fetus , pregnant woman , healthy volunteer , lab personnel . Some person PS overgrowth condition intellectually disable ( ID ) developmentally delay ( probably ~10 % ) . The consent issue different child ID developmentally appropriate child except assent judge developmental level instead age . Probands adult decisionallyimpaired eligible legal guardian authority sign consent form behalf . Patients medically fragile unable tolerate travel NIHCC routinely eligible participation . Since enroll people age , woman enroll may become pregnant course study . No image study do woman know pregnant . No surgical procedure undertaken pregnant woman , screen woman reproductive age pregnancy test prior surgery , per standard surgical practice . We request permission retain information prospective participant may immediately enrol . As participant immediately sign consent form joining study , propose NOT count participant Inclusion Enrollment Reports formally enrol study ( , sign consent form ) .</criteria>
