	<brief_summary>This prospective study evaluate role Positron Emission Tomography ( PET scan ) breast cancer . The radiopharmaceutical [ 18F ] 2-deoxyglucose use image modality evaluate tumor metabolism patient breast cancer . Patients stage II , stage IIIA IIIB , stage IV breast cancer evaluable disease breast and/or metastatic site study . Patients inject intravenously [ 18F ] 2-deoxyglucose PET scan conduct 90 minute . Examination role PET scan assess response breast cancer chemotherapy , especially stage II stage III patient , do . Up three PET scan within one year may perform . Findings PET scan correlate concurrent image technique ( x-ray , CT scan , MRI , bone scan mammogram ) , histologic , biochemical , flow cytometric information tumor , finding subsequent surgical specimen . Changes tumor glucose metabolism treatment assess PET image study biochemical method possible .</brief_summary>
