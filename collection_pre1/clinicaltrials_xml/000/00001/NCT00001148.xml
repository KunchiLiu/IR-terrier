	<brief_summary>Glioblastomas , frequent malignant brain tumor adult , widespread brain , despite discrete appearance compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . While tumor tends spread widely brain , unlike tumor body , rarely metastasize , spread , organ . Approximately 10 percent patient glioblastoma develop metastatic disease radiation brain surgery . In absence radiation brain surgery , patient develop disease spread outside brain . During surgery remove tumor organs body , lung , prostate , kidney , ovary , cell tumor routinely find bloodstream . These cell believe reason spread tumor . In case malignant brain tumor , process glioma ( tumor ) cell shed circulation yet investigate . This study determine whether glioma cell detect bloodstream patient undergoing surgery . If glioma cell absent , may mean unable penetrate blood-brain barrier . If present , presumably penetrate blood vessel may recognize eliminate immune system , may escape detection yet able take hold new microenvironment . The result study add knowledge biology highly malignant tumor . Study participant admit hospital 8 10 day . They undergo complete physical neurological exam blood urine test . An electrocardiogram perform , x-ray may take . On morning surgery , patient receive sedation intravenously . A tiny plastic tube call catheter introduce vein groin needle . The catheter pass jugular bulb , right jugular vein , side tumor . The patient take operating room surgery . During surgery , one quarter unit blood remove catheter . The catheter remove patient enters intensive care unit . Another MRI take surgery . The study enroll participant 2 year . Patients follow 3 month 6 month surgery make sure postoperative period uneventful .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Glioblastomas frequent malignant brain tumor adult widespread brain despite discrete appearance CT MRI . While locally aggressive , metastasis glioblastoma extracranial organ consider rare . Approximately 10 % patient glioblastoma develop metastatic disease radiation craniotomy . Few patient develop extracranial metastatic disease absence surgical resection radiation . Unlike tumor organ lung , colon prostate , presence glioma cell circulation patient undergoing surgical resection establish . If find absent , glioma cell may unable intravasate blood brain barrier . If present , tumor cell presumably intravasate may recognize eliminated immunological process , may escape detection yet able take hold new microenvironment . The information provide add knowledge biology highly malignant tumor .</detailed_description>
