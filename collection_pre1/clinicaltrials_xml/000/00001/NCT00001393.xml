	<brief_summary>Glomerulonephritis disease affect kidney . Occasionally diseases progress loss kidney function patient . Glomerulosclerosis focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS ) one form glomerulonephritis . The cause FSGS unknown often occur ( idiopathic ) , associate HIV ( Human Immunodeficiency Virus ) . FSGS occur commonly among black patient Caucasian Hispanic patient . Researchers believe environmental factor may interact genetic mutation cause FSGS , least patient . This study attempt identify genetic factor associate development FSGS . The study population make 600 total subject divide 3 group . Group one 200 African-Americans FSGS . Group two 200 African-Americans HIV without FSGS . Group three 200 non-African-Americans FSGS . Study participation require researcher obtain 20 ml ( 2 tube blood ) . The genetic material ( DNA ) prepare white blood cell analyze . The result group compare result group determine one gene predispose FSGS . In long run , study demonstrate genetic basis FSGS may help u identify patient earlier may lead improved therapy ... .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS ) relate condition , collapse glomerulopathy , chronic renal disease affect glomerular podocytes . Currently , thirteen genetic mutation associate FSGS . We interested expand understand gene may cause FSGS collapse glomerulopathy . We study individual affect family member . We also study sporadic case ; rationale study population FSGS collapse glomerulopathy significantly common among individual African descent . The latter observation suggest particular FSGS-susceptibility allele may common among African Americans . In present study , address hypothesis genetic variation contributes pathogenesis idiopathic FSGS collapse glomerulopathy , idiopathic HIV associate variant . We study follow group : 1 . African-Americans idiopathic HIV-associated collapse glomerulopathy . We exclude post-adaptive FSGS , associate glomerular hyperfiltration , medication associate FSGS . 2 . Other patient idiopathic FSGS &lt; TAB &gt; 3 . African Americans HIV without kidney disease ( hyper-normal control ) 4 . African descent control ( control ) . &lt; TAB &gt; 5 . Healthy European Asian descent control ( control ) . &lt; TAB &gt; 6 . Relatives patient familial FSGS 7 . Kidney donor 8 . Tamils We take three methodologic approach . First , examine know FSGS risk gene candidate gene , look disease-causing mutation disease-susceptibility haplotype . Second , undertaken genome scan , African descent population . We may also undertake whole genome scan European Asian descent . Evidence linkage disequilibrium among marker seek patient without FSGS . Third , identify family multiple affected individual lack know genetic mutation affect FSGS gene , pursue positional cloning .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA , BY GROUP : 1 . Africandescent FSGS : renal biopsy show FSGS collapse glomerulopathy , include HIVassociated collapse glomerulopathy ( HIVassociated nephropathy ) . We include adult pediatric patient . We exclude patient hyperfiltration FSGS . 2 . Other patient FSGS ( similar inclusion exclusion criterion group 1 ) . 3 . African descent HIV without kidney disease ( control ) . We include adult patient serologically confirm HIV1 infection least 8 year lack clinical renal disease , evidence normal creatinine urine protein/creatinine ratio &lt; 0.5 24 hour urine protein excretion &lt; 500 mg/d . 4 . African descent ( control ) . We include adult . Exclusions include HIV1 infection , cardiovascular disease , renal disease . 5 . European Asian descent ( control ) . These sample represent DNA already obtain Dr. Winkler group IRB approve protocols patient recruit part present study. &lt; TAB &gt; 6 . Relatives patient FSGS . In selected family ( patient find mutation FSGS risk gene whose pathologic role establish ) , obtain individual history renal disease ( hematuria , proteinuria , hypertension , nephrolithiasis ) measure serum creatinine urine protein excretion . We include adult without renal disease child renal disease . We evaluate child &lt; 18 year obtain urine sample ; urinalysis urine protein excretion normal , request blood sample unless blood obtain clinical indication . 7 . Kidney donor . We include NIH kidney donor . We obtain individual history provide information age , sex , race , surgical medical history , family history . Our purpose examine whether particular genetic variant , include MYH9 , influence ability kidney undergo hypertrophy follow renal donation propensity manifest albuminuria sign glomerular stress . These finding potential extend understand biology MYH9 might clinical relevance select kidney donor . 8 . Tamil population . We recruit Tamil population . A Tamil define anyone identifies , parent grandparent Tamilian . We ask patient family history . We exclude subject 18 multiple subject within family . We draw blood genetic testing . Our purpose determine whether particular genetic variant , include MYH9 , prevalent Tamilian population . If prevalence indicate , hope study variant influence progression kidney disease population . 9 . Women pregnant exclude participate apheresis component protocol .</criteria>
