	<brief_summary>This study examine effect HIV bone marrow cell . Various type cell bone marrow study learn cell become infected HIV , change occur number growth pattern cell , kind proteins cell make presence absence HIV whether cell function normally . HIV-infected non-infected individual 18 year age old may participate study . Participants undergo follow procedure : - Blood draw : Blood drawn needle hand arm vein . About 150 milliliter ( 10 tablespoon ) collect time . No 450 ml ( 30 tablespoon ) take 6-week period . - Bone marrow aspirate : Bone marrow drawn hipbone . For procedure , local anesthetic inject skin hipbone . A small needle put 1/2-inch shell bone 3 4 teaspoon marrow draw cavity syringe . White cell marrow uninfected individual may infect HIV laboratory grown time study . Alternatively , uninfected cell may use control compare cell HIV-infected individual . White cell marrow HIV-infected individual grown laboratory study comparison cell uninfected individual . Or , bone marrow cell may inject immune-deficient mouse try develop animal model HIV infection . White blood cell also study laboratory learn immune system respond HIV infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hematologic abnormality occur high frequency ( 70 % patient ) human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infect individual . The pathogenesis abnormalities currently understood , although abnormal bone marrow environment ( e.g. , alter growth factor production ) direct infection dysfunction progenitor cell postulate . Under current protocol study bone marrow precursor cell HIV infect uninfected individual show cell infectable vitro HIV also infect vivo subpopulation seropositive individual . While effect HIV infection precursor cell subsequent hematopoietic potential completely understood , could show clear correlation vivo infection cell suppress hematopoiesis . It seem clear study others alteration within bone marrow environment must play role clinically observe hematologic abnormality . We therefore wish continue study elucidate relative contribution direct infection myeloid progenitor cell alteration bone marrow environment pathology see HIV infected individual . Understanding pathogenesis abnormal hematopoiesis HIV infection allow investigator design appropriate therapeutic strategy . Using recently develop technique also wish use bone marrow cell HIV infect individual establish antibody library . This allow study immunologically important epitope HIV virion potential impact subsequent design HIV vaccine introduction passive immunotherapy . Thirdly , research field HIV hamper lack appropriate animal model . One promising approach use human bone marrow reconstitute lethally irradiated Balb/c mouse . Once human hematopoietic system establish mouse , may possible infect animal HIV study vivo model effect infection hematopoiesis .</detailed_description>
