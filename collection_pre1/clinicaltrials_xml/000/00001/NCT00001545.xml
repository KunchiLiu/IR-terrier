	<brief_summary>This study design evaluate repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) potential treatment depression . In rTMS , rapidly change magnetic field pass scalp skull generates small electrical pulse brain . rTMS low intensity help people depression know result case use high intensity , whether randomize 3 week high frequency ( 20 cycle er second ) , low frequency ( 1 cycle per second ) , inactive ( sham ) rTMS . You assign receive one type rTMS leave front art brain five time per week three week . Each rTMS treatment session take 20-30 minute actual stimulation , weekly rating , memory testing , blood sampling may require several hour per week . We also ask brain imaging procedure see predict response high vs. low frequency rTMS . If randomize 3 week sham rTMS , opportunity receive one active stimulation frequency additional 3 week . Responders phase offer additional month rTMS prior study termination recommendation alternative treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) new technique activate brain noninvasively scalp skull . It proven effective produce localized effect brain function open many area human brain function direct investigation . Preliminary data also suggest potential therapeutic application neuropsychiatric illness . We plan investigate possible therapeutic use rTMS depression condition high frequency ( 20 Hz ) , low ( 1Hz ) frequency , sham also examine possible cognitive endocrine effect . Among priority protocol evaluate risk technique .</detailed_description>
