	<detailed_description>An estimated 30 percent 40 percent infect pregnant woman risk transmission HIV-1 infant , whether symptomatic asymptomatic . Zidovudine ( AZT ) previously demonstrate effectiveness potent inhibitor HIV replication vitro adult patient ; benefit treatment include decrease mortality rate , decrease incidence opportunistic infection , increase number CD4 cell . Phase I AZT study child , however , result uncontrolled information regard clinical efficacy . The present study , therefore , investigate safety pharmacokinetics intravenous ( IV ) oral AZT administration HIV-1 infect pregnant woman 3rd trimester , well safety efficacy treatment newborn . It hop result instrumental designing future study assess efficacy AZT reduce transmission risk HIV-1 . AMENDED : For pharmacokinetic safety study AZT labor newborn infant , woman screen consent included part study . 6 mother-infant pair without history intravenous drug abuse 4 pair history evaluate . The mother receive infusion AZT 1 hour follow continuous infusion AZT least 4 hour delivery . Pharmacokinetic data collect patient include deliver receive 4 hour AZT infusion . AMENDED : The trial proceed describe except first 2 methadone patient enrol receive half AZT dose give non-methadone patient . Results evaluate dose additional methadone-use patient do . Original design : Following evaluation , patient receive one intravenous dose AZT 1-hour period . One day later , patient begin take AZT capsule 5 time day mouth remain week prior labor . During labor , patient continue receive AZT intravenously every 4 hour deliver baby . Blood urine test make measure amount AZT mother 's , delivery , baby 's body fluid . AZT stop baby deliver . The initial enrollment six woman history intravenous drug abuse plus another four woman history intravenous drug use , receive methadone maintenance therapy . These woman require negative urine toxicology screen illicit drug enter study .</detailed_description>
