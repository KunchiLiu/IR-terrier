	<brief_summary>This protocol submit consolidate , update , expand two previously approve protocol ( 77-C-0066 82-C-0044 ) single protocol . The purpose study examine factor involve regulation immune system healthy individual define abnormality regulation underlies immunological disorder patient variety immunodeficiency malignant disorder . The study include ex vivo phenotypic functional analysis network cell involve humoral cellular immune response , vivo test capacity make delayed-type hypersensitivity humoral response follow immunization variety antigen . Individuals study include patient variety malignancy patient primary secondary immunodeficiency disorder . Selected family member family member know genetic carrier certain immunodeficiency disease well normal , unrelated individual also study . A small number procedure use include analysis blood obtain phlebotomy , apheresis , skin test recall antigen immunization ass humoral immunity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - The evaluation cell immune system HTLV-1 infection central focus Metabolism Branch past 30 year . - Blood obtain apheresis blood drawing , skin biopsy tissue evaluate abnormality relate immunity , HTLV-1 infection immune system . - Advances characterization acquire genetic change tumor sample lead insight development target therapy malignancy Objective : - To define nature immunological , genetic epigenetic abnormality cell patient immunodeficiency disease associate infection and/or high incidence malignancy patient cancer . - To obtain whole blood , plasma , leukocytes , well skin , lymph node bone marrow biopsies patient immunodeficiency cancer investigate immune system . Eligibility : - Subjects cancer . - Subjects immunodeficiency . - Subjects HTLV-1 infection . Design : -This natural history study permit tissue acquisition analysis immune system HTLV-1 infection .</detailed_description>
