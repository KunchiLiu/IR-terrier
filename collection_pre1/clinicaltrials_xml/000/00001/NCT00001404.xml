	<brief_summary>We aim delineate range severity , natural history , molecular etiology , pathophysiology Pallister-Hall syndrome ( PHS ) , Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome ( GCPS ) , McKusick-Kaufman syndrome ( MKS ) , Bardet-Biedl syndrome ( BBS ) , Oro-facial digital syndrome ( OFDs ) , overlap phenotype . These disorder comprise syndrome community overlap manifestation hypothesize reflection common mechanistic pathway . This hypothesis address combined clinical-molecular approach bring 50-100 patient disorder NIH clinical center comprehensive clinical evaluation follow-up frequency appropriate disorder . Specimens collect evaluated laboratory linkage analysis , physical mapping , candidate gene characterization , mutation screening , cell biologic study normal mutant protein .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We aim use power modern molecular genetics clinical research delineate range severity , natural history , molecular etiology , pathophysiology number congenital anomaly syndrome . The goal research develop knowledge base allow proper clinical molecular diagnosis patient rare congenital anomaly disorder . Our paradigm previous work do Pallister-Hall syndrome ( PHS ) Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome ( GCPS ) , successfully use combine clinical-molecular approach . Using strategy , bring 50-100 patient family disorder NIH clinical center ( NIH CC ) comprehensive clinical evaluation follow-up frequency appropriate disorder . We also clinically and/or molecularly evaluate many additional patient atypical non-classic presentation PHS GCPS conduct exploratory study phenotypes determine might fit general model generate explain PHS GCPS . We currently generalize approach number disorder include talipes equinovarus , atrial septal defect , Robin sequence , persistent leave superior vena cava ( TARP ) syndrome . Specimens patient participate laboratory clinical arm protocol collect evaluated laboratory linkage analysis , physical mapping , candidate gene characterization , mutation screening target exome sequencing , cell biologic study normal mutant protein .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects clinical manifestation congenital anomaly craniofacial syndrome , single congenital anomaly also see part congenital anomaly syndrome consider eligible participation protocol . Blood also request unaffected relative could informative linkage study determine cosegregation mutation within family . Subjects either gender ethnic racial group accept . Prenatal specimen ( amniocentesis CVS ) accept previously acquire clinically indicated reason . Cord blood placenta specimen may accept ( part ) need clinical purpose . Specimens patient collect outside institution may accept study collect IRBapproved protocol MPA FWA institution . Coded specimen ( specimen link identifier without personal identifier attach sample ) may acquire NIH investigator , analyze , return research result investigator . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients typical GCPS PHS demonstrate GLI3 mutation may exclude study . Patients phenotypes disorder high risk/benefit ratio lateonset , neurodegenerative , psychiatric , cancerpredisposition disorder exclude participation . Similarly , patient medically fragile unable tolerate travel NIH CC routinely eligible participation .
