	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate whether experimental drug BG9588 use treat lupus nephritis effectively less toxicity standard treatment , include cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan ) , azothioprine ( Imuran ) prednisone . The body 's immune system naturally produce antibody fight foreign substance like bacteria virus . In autoimmune disease like lupus , however , body make antibody attack tissue , cause inflammation organ damage . Lupus antibodies attack damage kidney cell . BG9588 interfere production antibody , therefore , may lessen kidney damage people lupus nephritis . This study look : BG9588 enter leave blood body tissue time ; adverse effect drug ; whether treatment BG9588 result less kidney damage therapy . Study patient receive 30-minute infusion BG9588 vein every two week three dos every 28 day four dos . Patients ' steroid dosage may taper ; individual adjustment make require . Patients screen study undergo physical examination , medical history , various blood urine test , well complete quality life questionnaire . Results previous kidney biopsy chest X ray also require . Many test repeat throughout study . In previous animal study , BG9588 treatment mouse lupus nephritis improve disease survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BG9588 ( Anti-CD40L Antibody ) Treat Lupus Nephritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies animal human lupus nephritis demonstrate essential role CD40 ligand/CD40 interaction production pathogenic autoantibody . Anti-CD40L antibody treatment mouse lupus nephritis ameliorate disease improves survival . BG9588 recombinant humanize monoclonal antibody specifically bind CD40 ligand ( CD40L ) express surface activate T lymphocytes thereby block CD40L/CD40 interaction T B cell require initiation certain antibody response . Available preclinical data indicate BG9588 cause global blockage immune response pathogens effect reversible upon clearance systemic circulation . In Phase I/II open-label , multiple-dose , multicenter study , 30 subject active proliferative lupus nephritis receive 20 mg/kg BG9588 IV infusion every 14 day three dos , every 28 day four dos total 7 dos . The primary objective determine BG9588 decrease proteinuria great equal 50 percent baseline without worsen renal function . The secondary objective determine safety pharmacokinetics BG9588 , well effect BG9588 renal flare ; cellular cast ; C ( 3 ) level anti-dsDNA titer ; requirement prednisone ; general lupus activity ; quality life .</detailed_description>
