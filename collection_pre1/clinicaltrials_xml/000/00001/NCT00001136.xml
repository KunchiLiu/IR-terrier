	<brief_title>A Study Effectiveness HIV Vaccine ( ALVAC vCP205 ) Boost Immune Functions HIV-Negative Volunteers Who Have Already Received HIV Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vaccines may provide route therapy HIV-1 infection boost immune system response . An artificially construct HIV-1 vaccine ( NYCBH ) , use vaccinia virus vector , advantage confer cellular humoral immune response long-lived . Studies show second artificially construct vector vaccine , HIV-1 canarypox ( vCP205 ) , also increase CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) activity , cell-mediated immune response . Yet , immune response boost volunteer previously vaccinate vaccinia-based HIV-1 vaccine second vaccination vaccine give . One theory vaccinia vaccine 's failure immunologic barrier antibody vector may responsible . This study examine effectiveness boost immune response follow vCP205 vaccination follow : 1 ) volunteer previously immunize vCP205 vaccine may may show increase immune response follow first immunization , 2 ) volunteer previously immunize NYCBH vaccine . Upon study entry volunteer receive one injection ALVAC-HIV vCP205 . Temperature symptom record volunteer day 2 day report clinic staff . Volunteers seven clinic visit draw blood , collect urine specimen , perform clinical evaluation . At Month 3 HIV test do . Volunteers follow 3 month , passive follow-up call end year twice year next 5 year . Counseling avoidance HIV infection pregnancy do .</detailed_description>
