	<detailed_description>Background : Children refer Pediatric Oncology Branch ( POB ) possible enrollment clinical protocol treatment cancer . While child eligible specific protocol , may present disease manifestation offer potential important new insight pathogenesis clinical behavior underlie disease . In addition , child complete participation clinical protocol currently therapeutic protocol alternative may continue provide POB important information . Diseases interest POB include , limited lymphoma , brain tumor , Ewings sarcoma , leukemia , neuroectodermal tumor , osteosarcoma , rhabdomyosarcoma . Hence , serial clinical evaluation patient , include performance clinical , laboratory , diagnostic study help elucidate longitudinally underlying disease mechanism , clinically indicate standard care therapy , assist POB meet overall mission . Objectives : To able follow evaluate child cancer pre-cancer syndrome refer Pediatric Oncology Branch present disease manifestation lend clinical evaluation unique scientific import . Eligibility : Patients evaluate Pediatric Oncology Branch : Children cancer ( pre-cancer syndrome ) , age ( ) 3 month - 40 year present disease manifestation special interest Pediatric Oncology Branch investigator , likely shed lead light disease pathogenesis clinical behavior disorder . Patients age 30 40 year may evaluate protocol cancer ( pre-cancer syndrome ) specific interest Pediatric Oncology Branch . Design : The medical procedure test select patient basis his/her individual diagnosis ( presumed diagnosis ) . When clinically indicate , standard therapy administer patient follow accord standard medical practice . Specimens may collect clinical care purpose evaluate patient status .
