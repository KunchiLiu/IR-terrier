	<brief_summary>This protocol follow patient participate NIAID 's study Gene Therapy Approach Chronic Granulomatous Diseases ( 95-I-0134 ) . No gene therapy treatment give protocol . However , gene therapy new technology involve permanent change genetic code cell , patient treatment require long-term health monitoring . Participants ask provide updated address telephone information name two contact person , sibling friend . Patients see year NIH Clinical Center provide update health status donate small blood sample ( 2 teaspoon ) , frozen store . If patient acquire serious illness , cancer , store blood test ; another blood tissue sample may also request study . If patient develop medical problem think possibly relate gene therapy , illness investigate . The annual follow-up visit continue indefinitely patient decline continue participation . Participants may also agree store blood future research chronic granulomatous diseases medical condition . Stored sample may label code , number , study team link patient . Any identifying information patient keep confidential permitted law .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gene Therapy Chronic Granulomatous Diseases - Long-term Follow-up</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I/II clinical trial determine efficacy safety method ex vivo gene therapy treat X-linked gp91phox deficient Chronic Granulomatous Disease ( CGD ) autosomal recessive p47phox deficient CGD . CGD inherit immune deficiency blood neutrophil monocyte fail produce superoxide antimicrobial oxidant , patient get recurrent life-threatening infection . 30 CGD patient either sex least 5 year age may enrol addition 5 patient enrol first phase trial . Patients le 16 year age must active infection recent relapse infection time enrollment . Patients may receive 6 cycle stem cell mobilization gene therapy interval 4 week longer . For first 3 cycle , cycle stem cell mobilization gene therapy begin 8 daily subcutaneous injection combination flt3-ligand ( flt3L ) 50 micro g/kg/day plus granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulate factor ( GM-CSF ) 5 micro g/kg/day mobilization CD34+ cell . For 3 cycle mobilization CD34+ cell gene therapy ( maximum 6 cycle total ) , mobilization begin 6 daily injection granulocyte colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) 10 micro g/kg/day . On last two three day marrow growth factor administration mobilization CD34+ cell , patient apheresis procedure harvest blood mononuclear cell , thus complete cycle mobilization stem cell harvest . CD34+ progenitor select apheresis collection use Isolex ( Registered Trademark ) 300i anti-CD34 monoclonal antibody/magnetic bead selection system . The purified CD34+ cell may either place directly culture may cryopreserved per standard blood bank procedure ( freeze autologous serum 10 % dimethylsufoxide { DMSO } ) store frozen liquid nitrogen temperature thaw ex vivo culture transduction . For specific gene therapy treatment intravenously infuse , gene correct stem cell , purify CD34+ stem cell collect , purify frozen one cycle mobilization thaw pooled time placement culture transduction virus vector . CD34+ cell culture PL2417 gas permeable plastic container pre-coated fibronectin fragment CH-296 . The growth medium serum-free X-VIVO 10 ( Registered Trademark ) supplement 1 % human serum albumin , 100 ng/ml flt3-ligand , 50 ng/ml PIXY321 50 ng/ml stem cell factor ( SCF ) . Cultured CD34+ progenitor transduce 3 4 day either MFGS-p47phox MFGS-gp91phox retrovirus vector . The retrovirus vector replication defective package amphotropic envelope line engineer CRIP packaging element ( 5 ' LTR-gag-pol-3'SV40polyA ; 5'LTR-AMenv-3'SV40polyA ) . MFGS-p47phox package murine psi-crip line , MFGS-gp91phox package human 293-SPA line . The clinical retrovirus vector supernate animal protein-free serum free . Safety test endotoxin , sterility , absence replication competent retrovirus perform retrovirus producer line , virus particle lot , transduce cell . Transduced CD34+ cell infuse CGD patient . Thus , total six cycle stem cell mobilization , CD34+ cell one cycle mobilization may cryopreserved later pooled culture produce single gene correct stem cell product infusion , may fewer six round ( possibly one round ) gene therapy treatment patient participates study . Blood test periodically appearance persistence neutrophil functionally correct gene therapy . The efficacy goal study allow CGD patient produce autologous gene-corrected functionally normal NADPH oxidase positive neutrophil level least 1 1000 circulate neutrophil least four week . This may provide clinical benefit form increase host defense ongoing potential infection . The clinical status patient monitor evidence toxicity . Information obtain study provide information important achieving ultimate goal development gene therapy CGD permanent cure disorder .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Male female ; concurrent infection present recent multiple relapse infection likely potential additional relapse , subject may include minor 5 17 year age adults age ; concurrent infection present enrollment subject must adults age minor 1617 year age . History severe infection ( two infection require hospitalization intravenous antibiotic ) . Confirmed diagnosis Chronic Granulomatous Disease define less 2 percent normal oxidant production circulate neutrophil . Confirmed CGD genetic subtype gp91 ( phox ) deficiency p47 ( phox ) deficiency define absence deficiency phox subunit protein use antibody detection assay ( western blot , ELISA , flow cytometry ) patient granulocyte . Subjects without current active infection recent multiple recurrence infection must adequate organ function define renal function ( creatinine less equal 2 mg per dl ; le equal 2+ proteinuria ) ; hepatic function ( bilirubin less equal 1.5 mg per dl ; prothrombin time le equal 1.3 x control ) ; hematologic function ( WBC great equal 2500 per mm ( 3 ) ; granulocytes great equal 1200 per mm ( 3 ) ; platelet great equal 100,000 ; hematocrit great equal 26 ) . Successful mobilization demonstrate great equal 10 CD34+ cell per microliter peripheral blood day plan apheresis . Must weigh least 15 kg . If female childbearing potential , patient must negative serum pregnancy test within one week begin administration combination flt3L GMCSF single agent GCSF . Both male female must use barrier effective form contraception marrow growth factor administration least three month follow last reinfusion transduce CD34 + PBHP . Written informed consent , conform institutional guideline obtain patient ( and/or parent guardian minor ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Female patient pregnant lactate determined history and/or positive pregnancy test . While patient may active infection treatment still include study , patient exclude shock , manifest severe hypotension ( le 100 systolic less 60 diastolic ) severe hypoxia require mechanical ventilation piO ( 2 ) great 40 percent . HIV antibody/antigen positive hepatitis B , C antigen positive . ( Exceptions exclusion may make case case basis consultation Transfusion Medicine staff severe bacterial fungal infection present ) . Any condition opinion attend physician Apheresis Unit staff contraindicate apheresis procedure , cardiovascular instability , severe anemia ( hematocrit/hemoglobin le 26/8 ) , adequate venous access , and/or severe coagulation disorder . Patients severe infection hematocrit/hemoglobin le 26/8 might benefit clinically participation protocol may undergo apheresis discretion physician charge Apheresis Unit . In set RBC transfusion may use raise hematocrit/hemoglobin level safe apheresis . Any condition opinion principal investigator patient 's primary physician contraindicate administration bone marrow growth factor indicate dos , preexist severe autoimmune vasculitis severe autoimmune inflammatory condition augmentation immune response infiltration granulocyte may exacerbate condition .</criteria>
