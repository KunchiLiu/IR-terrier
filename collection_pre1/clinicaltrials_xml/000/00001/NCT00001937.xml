	<brief_summary>Fever infection serious complication cancer treatment bone marrow transplant , especially white blood cell count low . When number white blood cell 500 , person condition call neutropenia high risk develop infection . At first sign fever , antibiotic start . However , antibiotic kill fungus germ , fungal infection may difficult treat . Thus , prevention fungal infection population important . The medicine approve prevention fungal infection fluconazole , prevents type infection . A new antifungal medication call FK463 work type fungal infection fluconazole . This study compare effectiveness , safety , tolerance FK463 compare fluconazole . Eight hundred patient enrol study . They randomly assign receive either fluconazole FK463 . Before medicine begin , physical exam well blood sample , mouth swab , urine sample , chest x-ray do . The fluconazole FK463 administer day one hour bloodstream catheter vein . Blood test take twice week . Cultures blood , mouth , urine take throughout study . X-rays CT scan take fungal infection suspect . If fever develops , blood drawn check fungi . If fever neutropenia continue 4 day , FK463 fluconazole stop standard medication call amphotericin B start . Both FK463 fluconazole administer white blood cell count return great 500 ( signify recovery neutropenia ) , 42 day transplantation . Patients evaluate 4 week medicine stop .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective study determine efficacy safety FK463 versus fluconazole prevent fungal infection patient undergo autologous ( hematologic malignancy ) allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant . This Phase III , multicenter , randomize , double-blind study patient six month age old . Study drug , either FK463 50 mg/day ( 1.0 mg/kg/day patient weigh less 50 kg ) fluconazole 400 mg/day ( 8 mg/kg/day patient weigh less 50 kg ) , administer intravenously daily blind manner . Study drug continue neutrophil recovery ( define post nadir absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great equal 500/mm3 ) . Patients develop proven , probable , suspect ( require empirical antifungal therapy ) fungal infection discontinue prophylactic regimen . The maximum time patient may receive study drug 42 day post transplant .</detailed_description>
