	<brief_summary>Pulmonary lymphoangioleiomyomatosis ( LAM ) rare destructive lung disease typically affect woman childbearing age . Currently , effective therapy disease prognosis poor . In order better study disease , National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute ( NHLBI ) develop registry keep official record patient diagnose LAM . This research project collect data 6 health care center well outside physician . Researchers hope provide valuable information rate lung destruction quality life patient LAM . Patients participate study follow 5 year . Tissue collect patient may contribute development future study disease process LAM .</brief_summary>
