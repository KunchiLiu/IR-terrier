	<brief_summary>Synthetic HIV Peptide Vaccines ( Treatment Protocol ) We conduct study evaluate safety two peptide vaccine ( give alone combination ) patient early HIV infection . Patients enter onto study must &gt; 500 CD4 cells/mm ( 3 ) preserve cardiac , hepatic , renal , bone marrow function . Patients must anti-retroviral therapy least 6 month may receive experimental HIV vaccine . The vaccine test trial comprise short peptide segment HIV envelope , include V3 loop . In animal study , peptide able induce neutralize antibody well cytotoxic T response HIV . This first trial give human . The study last approximately one year , time volunteer receive 6 peptide vaccine skin . For information , please call Tino Merced-Galindez , R.N . ( 301 ) 496-8959 Dr. Richard Little ( 800 ) 772-5464 .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients seropositive , document licensed ELISA confirmatory Western blot assay HIV great equal 500 CD4+ cells/mm ( 3 ) time screen also meet either 2 follow criterion : During acute infection lower limit CD4 count ( acute infection define protocol 6 month period diagnosis HIV seropositivity patient document negative HIV serology within 6 month prior diagnosis HIV seropositivity ) OR ; If history CD4 count le 300 cells/mm ( ) point initial HIV seropositive diagnosis patient eligible , unless count time acute infection . Ambulatory status , ability willingness give inform consent . Must 18 year old estimate life expectancy 12 month . Hgb great equal 12 g/dl men 11 gm/dl woman . ANC great equal 1000/mm ( 3 ) . Creatinine great equal 1.5 mg/dl creatinine clearance great 50 ml/min . LFT : AST ALT less equal 3x upper limit normal IU/ml enrollment . Alkaline phosphatase less equal 2.5x ULN . Bilirubin within normal limit , except know Gilbert 's Syndrome patient protease inhibitor therapy . For patient protease inhibitor therapy , direct bilirubin less equal 0.3 mg/dl indirect bilirubin less equal 4.5 mg/dl . Patients must willing comply medical regimen highly active antiretroviral therapy , must stable antiretroviral regimen minimum 4 week prior first vaccination . Patients receive antiretroviral therapy receive antiretroviral therapy within 6 month . Patients without actual suspected allergy component vaccine . No prior vaccine HIV . Patients receive treatment follow med study entry within precede 3 month agent immunomodulating activity , parenteral therapy , HIV drug , vaccine , interferon , corticosteroid , growth factor . No prior Aids defining OI . No active life threaten infection . No severe malabsorption . No evidence Kaposi Sarcoma tumor likely require cytotoxic antitumor therapy within 6 month enter study . Must complete acute therapy infection least 14 day prior entry . No pregnancy . Female patient child bear potential must negative pregnancy test prior vaccine administration . Males female must agree use effective birth control method course vaccination . No patient medical contraindication potential problem comply requirement protocol .</criteria>
