	<brief_summary>This study explore brain work memory test effort understand patient schizophrenia memory difficulty . Patients schizophrenia unaffected family member eligible study . Studying family member may help identify gene relate memory deficit schizophrenia . Normal volunteer also study . Normal volunteer , patient schizophrenia , family member interested participate study screen complete medical examination psychiatric assessment , performance simple task . Study participant show number screen ask recall brief period . This do electroencephalographic ( EEG ) recording , electrode attach scalp measure brain electrical activity . The test repeat patient magnetic resonance imaging brain . The combined MRI EEG test permit good localization brain electrical activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It aim study investigate functional activation couple brain region normal , patient schizophrenia unaffected family member . We perform electrophysiological recording ( MEG , EEG ) cognitive activation ( Continuous Performance Task , Sternberg paradigm , work memory ) . We focus investigation oscillatory brain activity consider crucial information processing related neuronal integration . The measurement closely adapted equivalent fMRI-measurements present independent protocol ( 00-M-0085 ) . The combination method help improve activity source localization ( MEG/EEG ) correlation activity different part brain . In addition , local activity pattern ( fMRI ) good characterize time domain ( tonic versus phasic BOLD-activation ) . We address whether cognitive activation go along increase decrease correlation regional brain area . In context , investigate whether correlated activation pattern different schizophrenic unaffected sibling compare normal . The study integrate schizophrenia-sibling study ( 95-M-0150 ) . Siblings schizophrenic patient investigated order achieve good understanding genetic determination schizophrenia-related pathophysiology .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Controls : 1 . No psychiatric severe chronic medical illness time study , history . This include absence substance abuse history , learn disability DSM IV disorder . The investigator evaluate medical history medical condition judge interfere study may allow . 2 . No use psychotropic substance last 3 month . 3 . There upper age limit low age limit 18 year . Patients : 1 ) Schizophrenia , subtype schizoaffective disorder accord DSM IV , detail protocol # 89M0160 ( `` Inpatient evaluation neuropsychiatric inpatient '' , Dr. Jose Apud , principal investigator ) # 95M0150 ( `` A Longitudinal Investigation Siblings Schizophrenic ManicDepressive Patients '' , Dr. Daniel R. Weinberger , principal investigator ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Controls patient : 1 . Impaired hearing . 2 . Pregnancy ( purpose MRI procedure separate protocol ) 3 . Head trauma loss consciousness last year evidence functional impairment due persist head trauma . Patients healthy volunteer know risk exposure high magnetic field ( e.g . patient pace maker ) metallic implant ( e.g . brace ) head region ( likely create artifact MRI scan ) exclude participate fMRI study . Patients : 1 . Coexistence another major mental illness time study . If patient experience mental illness past ( e.g . learn disability major depression ) , judge fully recover . 2 . Criteria substance abuse meet last 6 month . 3 . Criteria substance dependence meet last year . If criterion dependence meet past , duration disorder less 3 year , judge produce longterm brain change allow patient study . 4 . Major concurrent medical illness likely interfere acquisition task . 5 . Concomitant medication could interfere performance task . 6 . Presence dyskinetic movement face tongue ( likely interfere eyeblink measure ) , gross involuntary movement whole body ( likely interfere position MRI scanner ) .</criteria>
