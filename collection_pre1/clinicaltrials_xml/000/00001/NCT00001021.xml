	<brief_summary>AMENDED 10/1/93 : To evaluate influence prior immunization rgp120 vaccine immune response subsequent immunization different strain rgp120 ( VEU 009X extension - patient previously enrol VEU 009 ) . ORIGINAL DESIGN : To evaluate clinical immunologic safety MN rgp120/HIV-1 vaccine ( MN rgp120 vaccine ) give alone concurrently IIIB rgp120/HIV-1 vaccine ( IIIB rgp120 vaccine ) healthy HIV-1 seronegative adult subject . To compare immune response MN rgp120 vaccine give 100 , 300 , 600 mcg . To determine immune response 300 mcg MN rgp120 vaccine 300 mcg IIIB rgp120 vaccine give concurrently . Recent study suggest immunity HIV-1 rgp120 protein may prevent primary infection . MN rgp120 vaccine IIIB rgp120 vaccine prepare recombinant DNA technology . Because two vaccine derive distinct HIV-1 strain , may elicit immunologic response differ . Unlike IIIB rgp120 vaccine , MN rgp120 vaccine yet evaluate human , although expect MN type result similar safety immunogenicity IIIB type .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Multicenter Study Safety Immunogenicity MN rgp120/HIV-1 Vaccine Given Either Alone Combination With IIIB rgp120/HIV-1 Vaccine Healthy Adult Subjects ( NOTE : Original Study Extended ONLY Patients Previously Enrolled VEU 009 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent study suggest immunity HIV-1 rgp120 protein may prevent primary infection . MN rgp120 vaccine IIIB rgp120 vaccine prepare recombinant DNA technology . Because two vaccine derive distinct HIV-1 strain , may elicit immunologic response differ . Unlike IIIB rgp120 vaccine , MN rgp120 vaccine yet evaluate human , although expect MN type result similar safety immunogenicity IIIB type . AMENDED 10/1/93 : Selected patient VEU 009 receive four previous injection receive three additional injection study extension ( VEU 009X ) , administer week 72 , 76 , 104 . Patients receive 300 600 mcg MN rgp120 vaccine ( eight patient per dosage ) original portion study randomize receive either 300 mcg MN rgp120 300 mcg IIIB rgp120 vaccine . Eight patient previously receive MN/IIIB combination receive 300 mcg vaccine . Additionally , six patient receive placebo original portion receive 300 mcg IIIB rgp120 vaccine . There nine clinic visit require study extension . ORIGINAL DESIGN : Fifty-seven adult subject randomize receive MN rgp120 vaccine one three dosage ( 100 , 300 , 600 mcg ) , 300 mcg MN rgp120 vaccine give concurrently 300 mcg IIIB rgp120 vaccine , placebo . Twelve subject enter onto four vaccine arm , nine subject enter placebo arm . Immunizations ( placebo injection ) give intramuscularly 0 , 4 , 24 , 48 week . Subjects follow 15 month first immunization .</detailed_description>
