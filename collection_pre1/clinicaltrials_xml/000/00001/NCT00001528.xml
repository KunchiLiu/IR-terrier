	<brief_summary>This study design examine blood flow , nutrition , beat function heart different condition . Patients narrow coronary artery restrict blood flow heart . The lowered blood supply heart muscle may cause symptom immediately . However , heart pump faster hard blood supply demand increase . If blood flow unable supply enough oxygen nutrition heart muscle patient experience symptom chest pain shortness breath . Even heart slow demand oxygen nutrition reduce , patient still experience pain abnormal heart function . The purpose study determine change blood flow beating function heart period increase demand ( exercise ) shortly stop exercise . Blood flow heart measure positron emission tomography ( PET scan ) . The PET scan test small amount radioactive water inject bloodstream picture heart take special camera . This procedure allow researcher measure blood flow heart muscle . In order measure nutrition ( metabolism ) heart muscle , researcher use radioactive substance similar sugar ( Fluorodeoxyglucose ) . Results study may provide important information activity function heart muscle exercise patient suffer coronary artery disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Exercise-induced leave ventricular regional wall motion abnormality among patient coronary artery disease indicate myocardial ischemia due significant coronary artery narrowing . Recovery stress-induced wall motion abnormality think occur within minute termination exercise . However , patient , persistent contractile dysfunction observe 90 minute recovery . Whether persistent regional wall motion abnormality exercise due stun myocardium ( prolonged reversible postischemic dysfunction despite restoration blood flow ) persistent ischemia due coronary vasoconstriction ( prolonged postischemic dysfunction due persistent reduction regional blood flow ) well establish . It possible persistent reversible leave ventricular dysfunction post-exercise may represent persistent reduction regional blood flow and/or alter regional metabolic state . In protocol , intend elucidate mechanism prolong reversible post-exercise leave ventricular contractile dysfunction . Results study may provide insight post-exercise cardiovascular physiology among patient coronary artery disease . In addition , clinical implication draw regard patient safety time discharge exercise laboratory , well time post-exercise myocardial perfusion study . We propose evaluate leave ventricular regional wall motion gate blood pool tomographic ( SPECT ) image rest , maximal exercise , 15 30 minute termination exercise . Myocardial perfusion ( O-15 water ) metabolic ( F-18 deoxyglucose ) study perform utilizing positron emission tomography ( PET ) . Absolute regional myocardial blood flow ( ml/min/gm ) assess rest , maximal exercise , 15 30 minute post-exercise along myocardial fluorodeoxyglucose utilization 45 90 minute post-exercise . Patients afflicted condition limit capacity perform adequate exercise study undergo pharmacological stress study dobutamine . Normal subject also study order create control database .</detailed_description>
