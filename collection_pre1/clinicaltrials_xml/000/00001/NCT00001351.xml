	<brief_summary>This study investigate inflammatory disease disorder . Inflammation body immune response many thing , include infection acute chronic irritant . It may also sign abnormal immune function . This study allow evaluation long-term follow-up disorder : - Establish maintain group patient may eligible NIAID protocol . - Provide clinical training experience NIAID fellows . - Provide mechanism NIAID staff maintain clinical skill . - Serve start point new investigation syndrome currently study . Patients 1 80 year age acute chronic inflammation , include limited viral , fungal bacterial infection , abnormal immune response may eligible study . Immediate family member patient may also enrol preliminary examination see affected way may warrant investigation . All patient family member history , physical examination laboratory test . Depending result , family member may require additional test . Patients additional diagnostic test indicate specific disease , accord accept medical standard . These may include routine blood urine test , X-rays imaging study , body fluid tissue culture , skin test allergic immune response , others need . Treatments include medication approve Food Drug Administration accord accept dose schedule delivery method . Patients may request donate extra blood research study . No 450 cc ( 30 tablespoon ) drawn adult within 6-week period , 7 cc ( 1/2 tablespoon ) child 18 year age time period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Long-Term Follow-up Patients With Inflammatory Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inflammatory disorder , include limited caused viral , bacterial , fungal , parasitic infection , associate aberrant immunologic response exceedingly common acute chronic disorder affect human . The pathogenesis various disorder investigate number NIAID clinical research protocol . This protocol evaluation long-term follow protocol disorder purpose maintain group patient LCID investigator draw various protocol . The patient admit protocol also provide train experience member NIAID infectious disease allergy immunology fellowship training program well provide mechanism member Laboratory Clinical Infectious Diseases maintain clinical skill . It anticipate patient receive degree clinical evaluation , care monitoring extensive generally available specimen collect sometimes used laboratory study relate inflammatory condition . Also , protocol may serve start point study syndromes disease address specific protocol , therefore , use evaluate family member patient inflammatory condition appropriate order try understand disease embark specific protocol .</detailed_description>
