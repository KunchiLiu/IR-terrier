	<brief_summary>Oxaliplatin experimental anti-cancer drug shrink tumor colon cancer . However , drug damage kidney , necessary determine dos drug safely give patient poor kidney function . Patients advanced cancer , poorly function kidney , good standard treatment option eligible study . Candidates screen image test , CT MRI scan , determine size location cancer blood urine test evaluate kidney liver function . Study participant receive oxaliplatin intravenously ( vein ) every 3 week long cancer control serious side effect drug . If significant side effect develop , dosage reduce , drug stop . Blood test measure blood cell count do least week , CT scan , chest X-rays , MRIs do every 6 week assess tumor 's response treatment . Additional blood test do begin first two treatment cycle measure amount oxaliplatin blood , urine collect first 24 hour drug treatment determine much drug eliminate body urine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Oxaliplatin diaminocyclohexane platinum derivative know anticancer activity solid tumor . The recommended single-agent dose Oxaliplatin adult cancer patient normal renal function 130 mg/m ( 2 ) give intravenously 2 hour every 3 week . Renal excretion think major route drug elimination , precise dose guideline patient abnormal renal function determine . This phase I pharmacologic study single agent Oxaliplatin conduct adult cancer patient impair renal function . Patients stratify four group base upon degree renal impairment assess 24 hour creatinine clearance . Group A consist 12 patient normal renal function serve pharmacologic control . The remain 3 group start different dos Oxaliplatin base upon degree renal dysfunction dose escalation group proceed manner accordance standard phase I trials 3 patient per dose level dose limit toxicity observe . Pharmacokinetic monitoring perform patient study . The goal trial define toxicity pharmacokinetics single agent Oxaliplatin patient population determine recommend dos Oxaliplatin patient different degree renal dysfunction .</detailed_description>
