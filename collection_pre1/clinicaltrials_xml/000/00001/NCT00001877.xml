	<brief_summary>Sarcoidosis disease commonly affect lung , also involve lymph node , skin , liver , spleen , eye , bone , gland . The cause disease unknown . When occur produce inflammatory reaction lead irreversible organ damage disability . In sarcoidosis granuloma form various organ ( primarily lung ) lead dysfunction . Granuloma form cluster inflammatory cell . The formation granuloma influence release substance call TNF-alpha ( tumor necrosis factor alpha ) find white blood cell . A drug know pentoxifylline ( POF ) know markedly reduce release TNF-alpha . The standard medical treatment sarcoidosis steroid therapy . However , steroid therapy associate significant side effect often must stop . Unfortunately , patient relapse steroid therapy discontinue . Because , researcher interest find alternative therapy treatment sarcoidosis . This study evaluate effectiveness give POF patient sarcoidosis currently take steroid . Researchers compare result patient take steroid pentoxifylline patient take steroids alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Corticosteroids currently mainstay therapy active pulmonary sarcoidosis use prevent relapse many patient stable disease . The pulmonary manifestation sarcoidosis heterogenous patient require corticosteroid therapy . Corticosteroids often produce undesirable side effect , therefore , therapy reduce replace corticosteroid use seek . As tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) play pivotal role formation granuloma ( pathological hallmark disease ) , drug inhibit production/release may prove effective treatment disease . Pentoxifylline ( POF ) , xanthine derivative use many year treatment peripheral vascular disease , know inhibit TNF-alpha release human peripheral blood mononuclear cell alveolar macrophage patient active sarcoidosis . To evaluate whether drug beneficial treatment sarcoidosis , propose conduct randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial POF patient pulmonary sarcoidosis corticosteroid therapy . The primary objective study determine whether POF treatment beneficial adjunct corticosteroid therapy patient pulmonary sarcoidosis . The role TNF-alpha cytokine ( release alveolar macrophage ) explain treatment response define whether patient improve assessed test whether effect treatment probability improvement varies cytokine level .</detailed_description>
