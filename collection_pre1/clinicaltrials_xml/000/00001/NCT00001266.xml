	<brief_summary>One current hypothesis limit duration initial hormone response rapid emergence hormone resistant prostate carcinoma cell . Suramin show effectiveness treatment hormonally refractory prostate carcinoma . Survival less patient high rather low circulate androgen level . Thus , suramin might slow emergence hormone refractory tumor cell combine androgen ablation may maximize effectiveness suramin . In trial , pilot concept .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial Leuprolide + Flutamide + Suramin Untreated Poor Prognosis Prostate Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study assess potential combine androgen blockage ( Leuprolide Flutamide ) , give suramin ( growth factor inhibitor ) improve clinical outcome ( ) cohort patient bulky metastatic prostate cancer . Combined androgen blockage currently standard care individual . Suramin show reproducible activity individual androgen independent disease . Since two approach independent one another - molecular level , clinical result - hop combination two approach result improve response rate improve survival .</detailed_description>
