	<brief_summary>Fabry 's disease genetic disorder ( X-linked recessive ) due absence enzyme ceramidetrihexosidase . The disease characterize abnormal collection glycolipids cell ( histiocyte ) within blood vessel wall , tumor thighs , buttock , genitalia , decrease sweating , tingle sensation extremity , cataract . Patients Fabry 's disease die complication kidney , heart , brain . The purpose study measure level protein marker ( PGP 9.5 ) skin , blood , fluid surround brain spinal cord ( CSF ) patient Fabry 's disease . In addition study attempt determine level protein directly relate severity disease nervous system . PGP 9.5 protein level measure normal volunteer patient diseases nervous system compare level record patient Fabry 's disease . This research study design improve understand Fabry 's disease . Patients participate directly benefit . However , knowledge gain result study may contribute development effective therapy Fabry 's disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : The purpose protocol study natural history Fabry disease different organ system , understand pathogenesis , develop adequate clinical outcome measure therapy trial . Development sensitive outcome measure prerequisite enzyme gene replacement trial patient Fabry 's disease . STUDY POPULATION : Patients Fabry disease age . The patient forego available treatment participate protocol . Experimental treatment part study . STUDY DESIGN : Patients typically see year NIH . Patients comprehensive test order evaluate state health affect Fabry disease . OUTCOME MEASURES : All potential clinically relevant area evaluate comprehensively particular emphasis vasculopathy peripheral neuropathy Fabry disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All patient Fabry 's disease consider potential candidate study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : All candidate must serologically nonreactive human immunodeficiency ( AIDS ) virus . HIV positive patient exclude effect latter illness nervous system . Patients Fabry 's disease exclude participation additional illness cancer , diabetes vasculitis could potentially involve nervous system . The general health well candidate must sufficient allow modest amount blood drawing , collection appropriate laboratory specimen performance necessary roentgenograpic magnetic resonance ( MR ) image study . In addition , candidate must able return National Institutes Health ( NIH ) annually monitor clinical laboratory parameter .</criteria>
