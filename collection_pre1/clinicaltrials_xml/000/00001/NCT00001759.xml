	<brief_summary>Asthma chronic inflammatory disease . We propose study inflammatory change lung subject atopic asthma different severity vivo use positron emission tomography ( PET ) 2-deoxy-2- [ 18F ] fluoro-D-glucose ( FDG ) . It show uptake FDG detect PET scan correlate inflammation animal model well human disease process sarcoidosis , tuberculosis abscess formation . In addition , show inflammation associate allergen challenge patient atopic asthma visualize use PET scan FDG . We hypothesize degree FDG-uptake measure inflammation correlate severity asthma determine pulmonary function test clinical sign symptom . In addition , information spatial distribution inflammatory change obtain . To compare characteristic inflammation asthma non-asthmatic inflammation lung , image obtain asthmatic subject compare image subject inflammatory change lung cause Wegener 's granulomatosis . Subjects atopic asthma non-atopic control subject select community , eligible study , undergo skin test common allergen pulmonary function test . Subjects Wegener 's granulomatosis select large group subject follow disease NIAID . PET scan FDG used measure inflammation PET scan facility Clinical Center NIH result scan correlated severity disease .
