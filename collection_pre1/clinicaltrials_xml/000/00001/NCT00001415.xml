	<brief_summary>A variety hormones immune system process responsible body respond illness . This study concentrate hormone cortisol effect release immune system factor call cytokine . Cortisol hormone produce adrenal gland response stimulation pituitary gland . Abnormal level cortisol see several disease depression multiple sclerosis . Cytokines factor produce certain white blood cell . They act change cell produce ( autocrine effect ) , alter cell close ( paracrine ) , effect cell throughout body ( endocrine effect ) . Cytokines important control inflammation process . In study researcher would like determine change level hormone blood associate change cytokine level . In addition , researcher would like learn cytokine respond hormone certain disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Many biochemical alteration observe people suffer major depression change concentration activity component generalize stress response . These include principal hypothalamic stimulus pituitary-adrenal activation ( corticotropin release hormone ) locus ceruleus/norepinephrine system . The current study attempt provide clear picture stability change acute illness , treatment phase recovery process . We particularly wish determine whether abnormality HPA axis perturbability well-state demonstrate , related acutely-ill state , since information could provide quantifiable phenotypic marker depression .</detailed_description>
