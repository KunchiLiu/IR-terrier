	<criteria>Diagnosis HNPCC patient HNPCC carrier status define : HNPCC patient individual personal history RER plus HNPCC related malignancy AND ; meet Amsterdam criterion modify Amsterdam criterion ( HNPCC associate extracolonic cancer may substitute one three colorectal case one family otherwise required criterion ) OR ; definite mutation one HNPCC relate gene identify gene sequence method reliability . This include gene status determine segregation analysis case `` direct '' test yield alteration . HNPCC carrier relative individual meeting criterion `` HNPCC patient '' describe mutation one HNPCCrelated gene identify gene sequence method equivalent reliability ( include gene status determine segregation analysis case direct test yield alteration , ) OR ; RER plus adenoma . Age great equal 18 year . Voluntary consent document sign witness informed consent . Willingness abstain use NSAID 's ( include aspirin ) , oral adrenocorticosteroids , nonsterodial OTC product duration study . If patient female childbearing potential , must meet following condition : Have use adequate contraception ( e.g. , abstinence , condom , IUD , birth control pill , diaphragm spermicide gel combination ) since last menses AND ; Be willing use adequate contraception ( ) study AND ; Not breastfeed AND ; Have negative serum pregnancy test within 14 day prior study drug administration . Though individual prior colorectal surgery allow , subject must great equal 50 percent colorectum documentation describe postsurgical anatomy ( e.g. , operative report ) . No use investigational agent within last 3 month , discretion medical monitor . The subject allow proceed baseline colonoscopy long follow laboratory criterion meet baseline evaluation : Hgb great 10.0 gm/dl , platelet count great 100,000/ul ; WBC great 3,000/ul ; ALT le 1.5 x upper limit normal ; AST le 1.5 x upper limit normal , alkaline phosphatase le 1.5 x upper limit normal , total bilirubin le 1.2 x upper limit normal , creatinine less 1.5 x upper limit normal , negative pregnancy test . For test mention specifically , must clinically significant abnormality opinion PI would preclude subject 's safe participation . To proceed randomization , subject must follow : An assessable colon colonic segment ( great equal 50 percent ) endoscopically evaluate entirety follow adequate preparative procedure AND ; An assessment aberrant crypt focus via `` enhanced '' endoscopy 10 cm distal ileocecal valve 10 cm distal anastamosis distal 10 cm rectum AND ; All polyp must remove exception small polyp ( less equal 0.6 cm maximal diameter ) amenable serial endoscopic surveillance AND ; Mucosal sample via pinch biopsy must obtain normalappearing mucosa standardize area right leave colon ( surrogate region case prior surgical resection ) area clearly neoplastic suspicious neoplastic pathology ( ACF , adenoma , carcinoma ) interest . No anticipated colectomy within eighteen month randomization . No history hypersensitivity COX2 inhibitor , sulfonamide , NSAID 's salicylate . No use NSAID 's ( include aspirin ) oral adrenocorticosteroids , dose frequency average great 3 time per week six month prior study entry . Use NSAID 's oral adrenocorticosteroids frequency require sixmonth washout period prior eligibility , begin time patient 's last dose . Use dose NSAID 's oral adrenocorticosteroids , average frequency 13 time per week six month prior study entry require threemonth washout period begin time last dose . No history past year discrete gastric duodenal ulcer size great 5 mm , except patient history Helicobacter pylorirelated peptic ulcer disease may become eligible study upon successfully complete antibiotic treatment Helicobacter pylorus . Ability participate schedule followup test . No significant medical psychiatric problem would make patient poor protocol candidate , opinion principal investigator . No `` unacceptable clinical risk '' proceed ( base upon subclinical discovery make via baseline colonoscopy biopsy ) include previouslyunknown bleeding diathesis , new diagnosis carcinoma , suspicion subject may require colectomy ( complete partial ) within eighteen month randomization . Patient must undergo colectomy within past 6 month . Patient must undergo chemotherapy within past 6 month . Patient must receive pelvic radiation .</criteria>
