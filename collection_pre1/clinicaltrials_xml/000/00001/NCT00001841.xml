	<brief_summary>Magnetic Resonance Angiography ( MRA ) method use evaluate artery vein without use invasive catheter x-ray ( radiation ) . MRA technique continuously improve become accurate diagnosing problem narrow blood vessel . However , MRA difficult time detect narrow small blood vessel , limit use large artery . The purpose study recruit patient diagnose suspect , atherosclerosis ( harden artery ) participate series new state-of-the-art diagnostic test use MRA . This study combine effort National Institutes Health ( NIH ) , Uniformed Services University Health Sciences ( USUHS ) , General Electric Medical Services support Cooperative Research Agreement ( CRADA ) . The goal study improve MRA point reliably replace diagnostic x-ray catheter angiography evaluation patient atherosclerosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Angiography ( MRA ) develop technology permit non-invasive evaluation arterial venous structure without need x-ray base catheter angiography . While dramatic progress make last year , still substantial limitation accuracy MRA judging stenosis detect small accessory vessel . The purpose study recruit patient suspect documented atherosclerotic disease evaluation state-of-the-art MRA use new surface coil , new pulse sequence design , novel contrast administration strategy , advanced image processing algorithm . This work represent collaboration NIH , USUHS General Electric Medical Systems support Cooperative Research Agreement ( CRADA ) . The goal pilot study improve MRA point reliably replace diagnostic x-ray catheter angiography evaluation patient atherosclerotic disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must live Metropolitan Washington Area . Patients must suspect atherosclerotic disease base clinical finding document angiography doppler ultrasound perform within 3 month MRA . Patients must willing participate protocol . Patients must refer physician care patient result provide . Patients must clinically stable judged physician able come Clinical Center participate study . Patients must serum Creatinine value le 3.0 mg/dl . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Any contraindication MRI include : ( ) pacemaker implant electronic device ; ( b ) cochlear implant ; ( c ) metal eye ; ( ) embed shrapnel fragment ; ( e ) cerebral aneurysm clip ; ( f ) medical infusion pump . Allergy Gadolinium base contrast medium . Unsatisfactory performance status judge refer physician patient could tolerate MRI scan . Examples medical condition would accept would include angina , dyspnea rest , congestive heart failure , severe claudication ( le 1 flight step ) . Intercurrent illness require treatment would jeopardize MRA scan . Subjects require sedation MRI study . Pregnant female . Patients severe backpain unable tolerate supine position within MRI scanner duration examination .</criteria>
