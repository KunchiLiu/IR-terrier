	<brief_summary>This study collect information different way people control limb body movement . This information use develop database normal movement adaptive movement people disease affect way move . The database serve tool improve diagnosis treatment patient movement-related problem . Volunteers age 4 normal movement pattern develop different way perform movement task may eligible study . A physical therapist screen candidate determine strength , flexibility range motion joint . Participants ask perform movement walk , walk stair , stand quietly reach object . For test , arm legs wrapped soft , rubber-like material small plastic reflective ball attach . A piece firm material call shell may attach rubber sleeve area body . Then volunteer performs specify task several time special camera record movement . The camera record position reflective ball movement , person face body . Electrical activity muscle also may measure , use small metal electrode attach surface skin adhesive bandage .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Human Movement Database</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study develop database normative adaptive control strategy human motion . Up 900 volunteer serve subject complete neuromusculoskeletal screening exam . Subjects ask perform one task related execution activity daily living : walking ground , walk treadmill , quiet perturb standing , stair ascent descent , turn jumping , cycling , elliptical training , isolate upper low extremity limb movement trunk movement . The subject movement pattern record use three-dimensional motion track system . Motion data analyze use rigid body six degree-of-freedom approach applicable . Temporal/spatial , kinematic , kinetic , surface electromyographic variable collect calculate . Many factor affect ability move . The one mainly interested investigate include muscle weakness , spasticity , dynamic balance . To quantify strength spasticity , force transducer need Biodex isokinetic dynamometer standard rehabilitation assessment training device , simple handheld dynamometer use person press force record . For spasticity test , person machine Biodex move joint arc motion ( e.g . elbow , knee , ankle ) range speed 5-240 degree per second resistance motion record grade subjectively . EMG joint position may collect simultaneously passive movement . The dynamic balance test perform force plate use clinical balance test device , Equitest , Neurcom . To determine electrical stimulation ( ES ) improve limb movement , walk , balance , device WalkAide may use patient dysfunction low extremity . Only persons central nervous system injury foot drop gait pattern give opportunity use device 3-6 month . The WalkAide wear knee delivers individually program ES aid muscle function ankle . Patient group identify clinically statistically . Group mean standard deviation compute . It hop database developed may serve tool individual patient data may compare order facilitate diagnosis optimize treatment clinical outcome patient movement relate problem . An ground harness system may use ground instrument gait balance assessment concern patient weak unbalanced therefore may trip fall activity , help facilitate normal pattern decrease load borne trunk and/or leg .</detailed_description>
