	<brief_summary>Black Americans tend die often diseases associated heart disease White Americans . The exact cause unknown , likely combination genetics , behavior , risk factor , strategy education prevention , socioeconomic factor . Recent study suggest faster biological process blood vessel Black Americans may cause increased amount heart disease . In addition , small blood vessel Black Americans seem less responsive substance relax blood vessel , may explain increase blood pressure level . In study researcher plan study artery relaxation ( dilation ) response substance affect cell line blood vessel ( endothelin ) . Researchers compare result study black white people find whether racial difference may contribute increase heart disease heart relate death black .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Black Americans great morbidity mortality relate cardiovascular disease compare white . The cause phenomenon probably multifactorial include difference pathogenesis , risk factor pattern , genetic background , behavioral variable , strategy education prevention , socioeconomic factor . Recent evidence suggest acceleration process related vascular biology may account great prevalence cardiovascular disease black . A diminished vasodilator response microvasculature show African Americans may therefore responsible increase prevalence hypertension . Endothelial dysfunction central mechanism development atherosclerosis . It therefore reasonable postulate endothelial dysfunction large conductance artery may also contribute great susceptibility atherosclerosis black compare white , even individual without know risk factor coronary heart disease . In present study , propose investigate brachial artery dilation response endothelium-dependent -independent stimulus black white individual determine whether racial difference vascular biology large conductance vessel might contribute great cardiovascular morbidity mortality previously report black .</detailed_description>
