	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effectiveness alendronate treat bone abnormality polyostotic fibrous dysplasia McCune-Albright syndrome . In disease , area normal bone replace fibrous growth similar scar . The weakened bone cause pain increase patient ' risk bone fracture bone deformity . Alendronate belong class drug call `` bisphosphonates , '' approve Food Drug Administration treat bone weakening , deformity pain medical condition . It think bisphosphonates might work slow activity osteoclasts-cells break bone . Patients 12 year age old polyostotic fibrous dysplasia McCune-Albright syndrome may eligible 3-year study . Candidates must also enrol NIDCR 's protocol 98-D-0145 ( Screening Natural History Patients Polyostotic Fibrous Dysplasia McCune-Albright Syndrome ) . Participants randomly assign one two treatment group : take one capsule day either alendronate placebo ( look-alike capsule active ingredient ) . They take capsule 6 month , stop 6 month , take another 6 month go 6 month . They remain drug placebo additional 12 month complete study final follow-up visit 36 month . While take alendronate placebo , patient also take calcium vitamin D prevent secondary hyperparathyroidism-a side effect alendronate bone release enough calcium . Patients come NIH physical examination blood urine test every 6 month monitor bone disease , vision , hearing , pain level , functional evaluation , photograph every 12 month . Many monitoring procedure , include image study biopsy , perform screen protocol ( 98-D-0145 ) duplicate study . During study period patient take alendronate placebo , blood sample draw local physician every 3 month send NIH check secondary hyperparathyroidism . If end study alendronate find effective , patient placebo treatment group offer alendronate 24-month period .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia ( PFD ) sporadic disorder affect multiple site skeleton . The bone sit rapidly resorb replace abnormal fibrous tissue mechanically abnormal bone . PFD may occur alone part McCune-Albright Syndrome ( MAS ) , syndrome originally define triad PFD , cafe-au-lait pigmentation skin , precocious puberty . The bony lesion frequently disfigure painful , depend location lesion , cause significant morbidity . Lesions weight-bearing bone lead disable fracture , lesion skull lead compression vital structure cranial nerve . Currently clearly-defined systemic therapy bone disease . Small , uncontrolled trial use second generation bisphosphonate , pamidronate , suggest bisphosphonates may effective . This study phase 2 , control , double blind trial third generation oral bisphosphonate , alendronate treatment fibrous dysplasia . We propose show treatment alendronate improve bone quality , decrease bone pain , decrease fracture , , patient refer companion bone graft protocol , allow regeneration well quality bone .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All patient must concomitantly enrol companion Screening Natural History protocol . Any patient least 2 active fibrous dysplastic lesion either cranial , axial , appendicular skeleton eligible consideration inclusion study . The diagnosis base evidence typical finding bone biopsy ( perform `` Screening '' protocol ) . Final consideration enrollment depend diagnosis NIH . Patients must least 6 year old . Patients may childbearing age , expect nonhormonal form birth control give 95 % protection rate . If patient becomes pregnant course study , must withdraw eligible reenrollment upon completion pregnancy lactation . Patients previous concomitant therapy eligible enrollment . However , patient receive previous treatment bisphosphonate must wait one year completion last course enrol . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patient , child parent unwilling fully cooperate evaluation outline schedule consent form give inform consent . Any sexually active patient unwilling use appropriate contraceptive associate pregnancyprevention rate 95 % great . Pregnancy absolute contraindication evaluate admit study ground removal study . However , patient may reenrolled pregnancy lactation complete . Severe esophageal motility problem may put patient increase risk complication alendronate eligible study . Significant comorbidities decompensated heart failure diabetes mellitus , renal hepatic failure , decompensated psychiatric condition exclude patient enrollment . Patients either history sarcoma bone FD lesion undergoes sarcomatous degeneration enrol either study companion protocol .</criteria>
