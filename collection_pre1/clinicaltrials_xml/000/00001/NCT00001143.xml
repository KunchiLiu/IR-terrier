	<brief_summary>Little know development ocular , eye , motor system ( part brain control eye move ) child . Recent technological methodological advance enable researcher investigate visual system ocular motor system infant , finding report . This study hypothesize quantitative analysis `` at-risk '' infant ' eye movement system detect abnormality precede predict onset strabismus , cross-eye . We collect data eye movement group infants bear 36 44 week conception . These infant enrol 4 24 week birth follow 4-week ( +/- 5 day ) intervals 28 week age year 3 year birth . The infant undergo complete ophthalmic evaluation visit enroll . At visit 28 week age , also undergo analysis eye movement . We also monitor development ocular alignment check detect visual system abnormality . The study provide basic knowledge cause normal abnormal alignment eye infant first 28 week life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Little know development ocular motor system child . We hypothesize quantitative analysis `` risk '' infant eye movement system detect abnormality precede predict onset strabismus . We collect data eye movement group infants bear 36 44 week post-conceptual age . These infant enrol 4 24 week birth follow 4 week ( +/-5 day ) intervals 28 week age yearly 3 year birth . After study enrollment infant undergo complete ophthalmic evaluation ocular motor analysis study visit . The ocular motor analysis include evaluation ocular following , saccadic , pursuit vergence eye movement use stimulus paradigm specially develop use child . Children follow annual basis 28 week age age 3 year monitor development ocular alignment detect visual system abnormality . Study endpoint subject 28 week age ( ocular motor recording complete ) 3 year age ( ophthalmic examination complete ) . This provide basic knowledge regard etiology normal abnormal binocular alignment infant first 28 week life .</detailed_description>
