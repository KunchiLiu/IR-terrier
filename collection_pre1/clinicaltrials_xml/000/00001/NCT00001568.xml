	<brief_summary>Positron Emission Tomography ( PET scan ) perform use total dose less 50 mRad per patient visit . Fludeoxyglucose F 18 ( FDG ) inject intravenously 2 min . Initial dynamic image obtain heart . Emission image work midcervical region perineal region . For CEA scanning , radiolabeled antibody , arcitumomab ( IMMU-4 ) , inject intravenously 5 min . A single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) transmission scan perform region emission scan . Total dose transmission scan 20 mRad per patient visit . Patients undergo exploratory laparotomy perform two surgeon , one blind result CEA-Scan PET scan . At completion exploration , identified disease biopsied pathologic analysis resectable disease remove . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month second year , 3 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Role Anti-CEA Antibody Immunoscintigraphy &amp; Positron Emission Tomography Localization Recurrent Colorectal Carcinoma Patients With Rising Serum CEA Levels Absence Imageable Disease Conventional Modalities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recurrences follow resection colorectal carcinoma occur 50 % patient . Early detection management recurrence result improve survival . Post-operative surveillance consist serial CT scan , chest x-ray , colonoscopy CEA determination . Elevations serum CEA level earliest sensitive indicator recurrence . A rise serum CEA level absence imageable disease present particular diagnostic challenge . Advanced image modality Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) anti-CEA antibody immunoscintigraphy propose way localize disease patient . This study evaluate sensitivity , specificity , accuracy predictive value FDG-PET scan anti-CEA immunoscintigraphy patient follow resection colorectal carcinoma rise serum CEA value absence imageable disease conventional modality . Patients meet inclusion criterion undergo FDG-PET scan anti-CEA immunoscintigraphy follow exploratory laparotomy . Abdominal exploration conduct two surgeon , one blind result FDG-PET CEA scan . All suspicious lesion biopsied possible resect . Results operation correlate result scan . The goal study determine role FDG-PET scan anti-CEA immunoscintigraphy localization recurrent colorectal carcinoma patient rise serum CEA level .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patient great 18 year old prior resection colorectal cancer suspect recurrent disease . Rising serum CEA level great 6 two successive test . Resectable residual recurrent disease . Patients occult arm ( Arm 1 ) must visible residual disease abdomen time last surgical exploration . In addition , must imageable definitive site recurrent disease use conventional imaging modality include ; CT scan chest/ abdomen/ pelvis contrast , MRI scan , chest xray . Patients arm 2 may single site recurrent metastatic disease resectable additional site disease know imageable disease solitary site potentially resectable disease identify . Patients must ECOG performance status 01 . Patients must willing return NIH followup . Patients must able provide inform consent demonstrate signed consent . Patients must 2 month abdominal thoracic surgery . No patient medical contraindication abdominal exploration . No patient recurrent disease detect conventional imaging study outline . Metastatic disease localize outside abdominal cavity conventional imaging study outline . Patients must weigh less 136 kg . weight limit scanner table . No patient previous injection murine monoclonal antibody : Human antimouse assay ( HAMA ) perform patient prior history receive murine monoclonal antibody . No patient pregnant breast feed . Patients HIV + exclude .</criteria>
