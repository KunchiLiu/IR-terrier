	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety effectiveness Zenapax control recurrent eye inflammation associate Behcet 's disease . Behcet 's disease usually treat corticosteroid suppress inflammation . Other medicine methotrexate , cyclophosphamide , azathioprine may also use . These drug serious side effect , include liver kidney damage . Zenapax monoclonal antibody bind certain protein ( receptor ) white blood cell , prevent interact chemical call interleukin-2 . Blocking interaction prevents inflammation . This study include 20 patient unacceptable side effect medicine use treat disease ; benefit standard treatment ; refused standard treatment possible side effect medicine . All patient study continue take current medicine start study . In addition , one group patient receive Zenapax second group receive placebo . The drug placebo infuse vein start study every two week next six week , every four week rest study period ( 24 month ) . Each infusion last 15 minute . Patients eye examination time every treatment , medicine add need control eye disease . Drugs taper six month patient whose eye disease quiet , readjust necessary . Neither doctor patient know receive placebo receive Zenapax study end . Patients give physical examination , medical history , eye examination , fluorescein angiography ( special photograph retina evaluate blood vessel eye ) , blood test . Zenapax previously study 10 patient uveitis positive result . The patient able reduce medicine take minimal side effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The development ideal therapy immunosuppress patient Behcet 's disease , cause endogenous uveitis major cause acquire blindness adult , important research goal . Corticosteroids remain mainstay therapy intraocular inflammation ; however , many patient intolerant resistant corticosteroid therapy . Although etiology Behcet 's disease unknown , evidence suggest interleukin-2 receptor bear auto-aggressive cell may play important role disorder . Zenapax , humanize anti-TAC ( T-cell activate antigen ) monoclonal antibody ( HAT ) , utilized Protocol # 96-EI-0096 , pilot Phase I/II study , evaluate Zenapax administration treatment patient endogenous sight-threatening uveitis . Long-term result demonstrate positive therapeutic trend trial . We propose randomize masked pilot trial Zenapax versus placebo . Twenty patient 18 year age old Behcet 's disease randomly assign receive either Zenapax placebo addition standard immunosuppressive therapy . After six month quiescent disease , patient eligible taper standard immunosuppressive therapy . The primary purpose study investigate safety efficacy Zenapax control recurrent , explosive nature ocular manifestation patient Behcet 's disease . Because study Phase I/II study examine efficacy safety , primary outcome define . The primary safety endpoint one following : ) development life threaten complication , namely exacerbation systemic neurological disease , b ) development severe opportunistic infection . The primary efficacy outcome study base number ocular attack experience amount immunosuppressive medication 2 year study period , include ability taper standard immunosuppressive therapy . Secondary efficacy outcome include level inflammation measure vitreous haze anterior chamber cell flare , presence absence cystoid macular edema , change baseline visual acuity , quality life issue measure questionnaire .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must 18 year age old primary randomize cohort . Up six additional patient 18 6 year age may enroll separate stratum . Patients ocular complication Behcet 's disease . Patients currently take minimum 15 mg prednisone , cyclosporine , antimetabolite , combination treatment intraocular inflammatory disease retinal vasculitis least past 3 month . Patients must least two documented ocular attack due Behcet 's disease involve posterior segment . Patients normal renal liver function evidence mild abnormality define WHO criterion . Patients neutrophil count 750 . Patients agree use acceptable birth control method throughout course study 6 month completion treatment assign Zenapax . If patient assign placebo unmasked , patient need practice birth control . Patients able understand sign consent form enter study . Minor patient require sign assent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients receive previous treatment IL2 direct monoclonal antibody investigational agent would interfere ability evaluate safety , efficacy , pharmacokinetics Zenapax . Patients significant active infection . Patients history cancer ( nonmelanoma skin cancer ) within past 5 year . Patient pregnant lactating . Patients significant symptomatic neurological disease complicate evaluation neurological sequela Behcet 's disease . This would include multiple sclerosis , stroke , neurodegenerative disease eligible . NeuroBehcet 's disease would permit . In opinion treat physician ocular disease endstage , would reasonable hope improvement visual acuity . Patient use Latanoprost within two week prior enrollment , current likely need Latanaprost course study .</criteria>
