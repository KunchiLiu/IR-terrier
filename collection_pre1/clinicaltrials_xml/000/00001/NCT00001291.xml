	<brief_summary>This protocol examine blood , synovial fluid synovial tissue patient rheumatoid arthritis chronic inflammatory joint disease study genetic immunologic factor involve cause , development progression condition . Synovial fluid lubricate fluid joint . The synovial membrane delicate tissue line inner surface joint , , arthritic condition , thickens becomes infiltrate various type cell . Patients rheumatoid arthritis certain patient form arthritis may eligible study . Those enrolled follow periodically follow-up disease evaluation . They may undergo follow procedure : 1 . Synovial fluid aspiration , medically indicate ( example , joint swell inflammation ) . For procedure , area skin around joint numbed anesthetic , needle insert joint withdraw small fluid sample . 2 . Periodic blood sampling , exceed 450 milliliter ( 15 ounce ) 6-week period , genetic study rheumatoid arthritis . The sample usually take time synovial fluid withdrawn . 3 . Synovial tissue , collect needle biopsy surgical procedure arthroscopy ( examination interior joint repair joint ) total joint replacement . For needle biopsy , skin biopsy site wash anesthetize . A needle inserted fluid aspirate . The biopsy needle insert outer needle tissue sample suction . Patients qualify research study may invite participate .</brief_summary>
