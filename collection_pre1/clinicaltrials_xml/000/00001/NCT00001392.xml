	<criteria>EVALUATION AND TREATMENT OF GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS INCLUSION CRITERIA An unlimited number subject know suspected glomerular tubulointerstitial disease eligible study . No sex , race ethnic selection apply . It anticipate AfricanAmericans predominate , give increase risk FSGS ( focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ) population . EXCLUSION CRITERIA RITUXIMAB AND CYCLOSPORINE . ( CLOSED FOR SUBJECT RECRUITMENT . ) INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR ADULT PATIENTS PARTICIPATING IN PILOT STUDY OF COMBINATION RITUXIMAB AND CYCLOSPORINE First void urine protein creatinine ratio &gt; 2g/g despite optimal use ACE inhibitor ARB ( possibly ) , last dose increase least 4 week qualify proteinuria determination Women must use reliable birth control method avoid pregnancy participate study . Subjects fail respond complete remission partial remission least 8 week prednisone dose least 60 mg steroid dependent relapse steroid . Subjects compel contraindication use glucocorticoid , morbid obesity , define BMI &gt; 35 diabetes mellitus Subjects idiopathic FSGS collapse glomerulopathy Subjects eGFR great equal 50 mL/min/1.73 m^2 screen time precede 6 month . INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR MINORS ( BETWEEN AGES 4 AND 18 YEARS ) Estimated average protein creatinine ratio &gt; 2.0 g/g despite use ACE inhibitor ARB . At least onefirst void urine obtain must urine protein/creatinine ratio &gt; 2.0 g/g exclude diagnosis orthostatic proteinuria Girls go puberty and/or menstrual period must use reliable birth control method avoid pregnancy participate study Failed respond complete remission partial remission least 8 week prednisone dose least 1 mg/kg steroid dependent relapse steroid . Compelling contraindication use glucocorticoid , morbid obesity , define 99th percentile age sex , diabetes mellitus Subjects idiopathic FSGS collapse glomerulopathy Subjects eGFR great equal 50 mL/min/1.73 m^2 screen time precede 6 month . EXCLUSION CRITERIA Age &lt; 4 year . Prior intolerance rituximab monoclonal antibody therapy , include severe infusion reaction hypersensitivity murine protein . History cardiac arrhythmia , unless cardiology consult approves use rituximab . Treatment rituximab within last two year . Prior intolerance cyclosporine . Subjects postadaptive FSGS ( include obesityassociated FSGS , reflux nephropathy , reduce nephron mass ) . There strong rationale use immunologic therapy population . Subjects genetic FSGS due high penetrance mutation , e.g . NPHS2 mutation . There strong rationale use immunologic therapy population . Medicationassociated FSGS . Recurrent FSGS follow renal transplant Chronic viral infection , HIV1 , hepatitis B , hepatitis C. The safety aggressive immunologic therapy diseases question . Chronic bacterial infection . At baseline , patient give history BCG vaccination prior positive PPD , consult infectious disease clinician enrol patient . Active malignancy Poorly control hypertension define home BP measurement &gt; 140/90 control blood pressure require 4 medication . The rationale blood pressure elevation common cyclosporine therapy . Women girls pregnant try become pregnant unwilling practice birth control . Rituximab pregnancy class C : systematic evidence safety . In human , cyclosporine cross placenta . Cyclosporine lack genotoxic effect human animal study . However , growth restriction prematurity occur 40 % neonate born mother organ transplant treat cyclosporine , congenital abnormality document . Women girls breastfeed ( possible immune suppression infant well unknown effect growth association carcinogenesis . ) Predicted requirement live vaccine 24 month follow enrollment . FINDING THE CAUSE OF CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE IN AGRICULTURAL WORKERS IN THE NORTH AND NORTH CENTRAL PROVINCE , SRI LANKA : A SYSTEMS BIOLOGY APPROACH INCLUSION CRITERIA , BY GROUP Sri Lankans CKDu follow feature A member North North Central Province least 15 year . A negative history prior renal disease . A fasting blood glucose less equal 110 mg/dL , BMI less equal to35 kg/m^2 blood pressure less equal 140/90 one screening .

A urine albumin/protein ratio less equal 25 % exclude glomerular proteinuria An ultrasound show kidney great equal 8.5 cm presence welldefined corticomedullary demarcation . The ultrasound lack moderate echogenicity , multiple renal cyst evidence renal obstruction , reduce chance bleed complication Males nonpregnant female age 2060 year old .
