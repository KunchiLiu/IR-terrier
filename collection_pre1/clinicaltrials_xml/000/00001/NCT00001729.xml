	<brief_summary>Hepatitis C major cause liver disease United States lead cirrhosis liver approximately one-third patient ultimately suffer liver failure liver cancer . At present , recommend therapy hepatitis C combination alpha interferon ribavirin give 6 12 month . Ribavirin antiviral drug give mouth . Interferon antiviral immune medication must give injection ( three time week ) many difficult side effect . The purpose study determine whether combination ribavirin interferon improve liver disease hepatitis C whether improvement maintain continue ribavirin therapy long-term . This study take 100 120 patient suffer hepatitis C place combination drug therapy alpha interferon ribavirin . The course drug therapy schedule last 6 12 month . Patients select appropriate screening hepatitis C virus elevate liver enzymes conduct liver biopsy show chronic hepatitis degree injury scarring . During first 6 month study , subject ask return outpatient clinic routine check-ups blood test every 2 4 week . Blood test include test hepatitis C virus . If virus test become negative treatment , therapy consider successful continue full 6 12 month ( depend upon strain virus ) . If virus test become negative first six month treatment , subject consider `` non-responders '' stop take interferon continue ribavirin alone identically appear placebo tablet . These non-responsive subject continue therapy additional 12 month . ( A year-and-a-half total ) . Upon completion drug therapy , subject request submit blood sample undergo liver biopsy determine therapy successful . Test result reveal loss hepatitis C antibodies normal level liver enzymes deem successful . Patients successful laboratory test result consider continuation ribavirin therapy . Patients receive placebo year eligible receive ribavirin long-term end study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Between 60 90 patient chronic hepatitis C enrol study combination alpha interferon ribavirin 12 month early discontinuation therapy randomization receive either ribavirin alone placebo patient respond within 6 month start therapy . Adult patient choose chronic hepatitis C , HCV RNA serum , elevation serum aminotransferase . Patients receive alpha interferon past eligible sustain response previous course interferon . After medical evaluation liver biopsy , patient begin receive alpha interferon subcutaneous injection dose 3 million unit three time weekly . At time , patient begin receive ribavirin orally dose 1000 mg ( body weight less 75 kg ) 1200 mg daily ( two three capsule 200 mg twice daily ) . During initial 24-week period combination therapy , patient see outpatient clinic medical interview , physical examination blood test 2 4 week interval . At 24 week , patient classify either responder non-responders base upon HCV RNA test serum . Responders continue combination therapy another 24 week ( total treatment = 48 week ) . Non-responders stop interferon therapy randomize receive either ribavirin identically appear placebo capsule 48 week ( total treatment = 72 week ) . At 72 week point ( 18 month enrollment ) , patient readmitted repeat medical evaluation liver biopsy . At point , ribavirin placebo stop ( unless patient clear histological biochemical response therapy ) patient monitor outpatient visit 8 week interval another 6 month . Patients exhibit histological biochemical response ribavirin monotherapy offer one-year extension treatment ribavirin gradually reduce dosage . These patient monitor 8 week interval dose reduce 200 mg per day every 16 week minimum dose 600 mg per day . If biochemical response maintain , patient continue therapy one year undergo repeat medical evaluation liver biopsy . Continued therapy ribavirin point depend upon whether safety efficacy ribavirin demonstrate whether ribavirin approve use hepatitis C. The primary criterion success therapy overall sustained loss HCV RNA assess 18 month . Primary criterion response among patient randomize receive ribavirin placebo degree histological improvement liver biopsy . Secondary criterion normalization ALT level . This study allow therapy patient chronic hepatitis C combination alpha interferon ribavirin allow therapy patient resistant form chronic hepatitis C ribavirin alone address whether monotherapy ribavirin sustain improvement whether biochemical improvement reflect amelioration underlie liver disease judge histologically .</detailed_description>
