	<brief_summary>The common problem follow kidney transplant development acute chronic rejection . Rejection immunologic reaction body refuse accept transplant organ . The body 's immune system make destructive antibody attempt attack transplant organ . In order prevent organ rejection , patient receive allograft ( graft transplant genetically non-identical individual specie ) must take anti-rejection therapy . These medication function lower body 's natural immune system . Often medication associate significant side effect range infection cancer . This study design test whether drug presently know BG9588 ( Antova TM ) reduce incidence organ rejection follow kidney transplant human . More specifically , study attempt ass safety BG9588 give alone give combination anti-rejection therapy . Safety measure amount acute chronic rejection , immunological graft loss . Subjects study make non-human primate ( monkey ) human . Up 5 subject group receive kidney transplant place 12 month course BG9588 without additional anti-rejection drug . BG9588 give intravenously ( injected vein ) prior transplant decrease dose decrease frequency year . Following 12 month therapy subject may eligible additional monthly therapy . The long-term follow occur 30 month last dose BG9588 . Subjects undergo periodic test evaluation throughout course study . These test assess body 's immune system detect presence rejection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing Safety BG9588 ( Anti-CD40L Antibody ) Against Standard Treatment Kidney Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol open label , non-randomized study design test whether treatment BG9588 , humanize monoclonal antibody specific CD154 , induce state allograft tolerance follow renal allotransplantation human . This study design primarily assess safety efficacy BG9588 give alone combination steroid mycophenolate prevent renal allograft rejection without use calcineurin inhibitor chronic anti-rejection therapy . Efficacy parameter include incidence acute chronic rejection episode , immunological graft loss . Additional evaluation perform specifically assess development donor-specific immune hyporesponsiveness result use BG9588 . This study base extensive use BG9588 non-human primate pilot evaluation human . Up five patient group receive primary renal allograft treat 12-month course BG9588 without steroid mycophenolate prevent allograft rejection . The recruitment perform first group steroid mycophenolate . Subjects receive BG9588 dose 70 mg/kg ( base ideal body weight baseline ) via continuous 60 minute IV infusion within 24 hour pre-operatively follow 30 mg/kg dose via continuous 30 minute IV infusion follow day : within 24 hour post-transplantation , day 3 , 10 , 18 , 28 , monthly 12 month post-transplantation . The enrollment stagger early efficacy demonstrate 5 patient prior complete enrollment . Following 12 month therapy , patient may extend receive additional monthly therapy . Long-term follow occur 30 month last dose BG9588 . Mechanistic evaluation test allograft tolerance perform throughout study include evaluation allospecific T cell deletion , allospecific T cell anergy , alloantibody production . The donor population study include live donor cadaveric donor . This do address theoretical concern ischemic reperfusion injury may negatively affect efficacy BG9588 .</detailed_description>
