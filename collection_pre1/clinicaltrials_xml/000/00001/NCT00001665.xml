	<brief_summary>The problem motor activity associate Parkinson 's disease still poorly understood . Patients Parkinson 's disease often suffer extremely slow movement ( bradykinesia ) result inability perform complex physical act . Imaging study brain provide researcher information specific area brain associate motor difficulty . One particular area involve surface brain call cerebral cortex . Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) non-invasive technique use stimulate brain activity gather information brain function . It useful study area brain related motor activity ( motor cortex , corticospinal tract , corpus callosum ) . Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) involve placement cool electromagnet figure-eight coil patient 's scalp rapidly turn magnetic flux . This permit non-invasive , relatively localized stimulation surface brain ( cerebral cortex ) . The effect magnetic stimulation varies , depend upon location , intensity frequency magnetic pulse . Researchers plan study therapeutic effect repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) complex motor behavior patient Parkinson 's disease . In order measure effectiveness , patient ask perform complex task , play piano receive transcranial magnetic stimulation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The physiology motor disturbance Parkinson 's disease completely understood . One major perhaps disable manifestation PD bradykinesia . It particularly difficult patient perform simultaneous , sequential complex motor act . Imaging study recently provide important information reference brain region associate performance motor sequence normal volunteer PD patient . These study help u identify brain region active association task performance . It suggest cortical region , particularly SMA less active patient PD control association motor performance . We plan study effect subthreshold rTMS deliver SMA primary motor cortex patient PD `` '' `` '' medication . From study , expect learn stimulation scalp overlie primary motor cortex SMA ameliorate performance simple complex motor sequence PD . Subthreshold rTMS propose therapeutic tool psychiatric disorder . In motor domain , subthreshold rTMS deliver primary motor cortex improve reaction time motor performance patient Parkinson 's disease . The mechanisms underlying beneficial effect know . However , may relate subthreshold rTMS replace miss excitatory drive motor cortex .</detailed_description>
