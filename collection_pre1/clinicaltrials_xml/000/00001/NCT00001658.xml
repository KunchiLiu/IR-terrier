	<brief_summary>Bacteria carry substance surface call antigen . When antigens come contact right kind cell body immune reaction cause . This reaction often symptoms sickness patient feel . In order body fight attack antigen , creates substance call antibody . Antibodies counter action antigen make bacteria harmless . However , immune system must learn make right antibody right antigen . Sometimes body create antibody confuse normal tissue foreign attack . This call autoimmune reaction sometimes occur body expose certain bacteria . One bacteria know cause autoimmune reaction Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus ( GABHS ) . This bacteria often cause throat infection commonly know `` strep throat '' . Some researcher believe autoimmune reaction associate strep throat infection may cause neuropsychiatric disorder , like obsessive-compulsive disorder and/or tic disorder child . As result , time child one disorder experience infection GABHS his/her symptom reoccur worsen . Researchers believe give patient certain antibiotic , prevent GABHS infection thus prevent return symptom . This study design test effectiveness antibiotic Amoxicillin treatment Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated Streptococcal infection ( PANDAS ) . Patients receive Amoxicillin six week placebos `` inactive sugar pill '' six week order see medication truly work . Effectiveness treatment base presence absence symptom . If end study Amoxicillin proven effective treatment PANDAS patient may offer opportunity continue take medication additional six month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An increase body evidence suggest Group A beta-Hemolytic Streptococcal throat infection ( GABHS ) may trigger onset obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) and/or tic disorder certain vulnerable child via autoimmune process . In subgroup child childhood-onset OCD tic disorder , preliminary data suggest child rapid response amoxicillin . After 24 48 hour treatment , dramatic reduction OC symptom tic . To date , observe phenomenon least 5 child , relapse amoxicillin stop . These observation raise number question , include whether amoxicillin direct central nervous system ( CNS ) effect indirect effect perturbation immune system ( e.g. , cytokine shift ) . The purpose study determine amoxicillin effective treatment PANDAS , well examine possible mechanism effect . We propose 3-month double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial amoxicillin treatment randomize A-B-A-B design . Outcome measure blind rating tic severity , standardized measure psychopathology , immunologic assay ( type I type II cytokine level ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects presence OCD and/or tic disorder : Must meet lifetime diagnostic criterion ( DSM III DSM IV ) obsessive compulsive disorder tic disorder . Pediatric onset : Symptoms disorder first become evident 3 year age begin puberty , generally true rheumatic fever . Episodic course symptom severity : Clinical course characterize abrupt onset symptom dramatic symptom exacerbation . Episodic course characterize wax wan symptom severity great +20 percent fluctuation baseline . Association GABHS infection : Symptom onset exacerbation must temporally relate group A BHemolytic Streptococcal infection ( GABHS ) , i.e. , associate positive throat culture and/or elevate antiGABHS antibody titer . Association neurological abnormality : During symptom exacerbation , patient abnormal neurological examination , motoric hyperactivity adventitious movement ( i.e. , choreiform movement tic ) . Subjects must report history improvement tic and/or OCD treat amoxicillin . No subject meet criterion Autism . No subject neurologic disorder tics/TS . No subject IQ less 80 . No subject serious concurrent chronic medical illness . No subject history penicillin amoxicillin allergy . No subject history noncompliance medical procedure .</criteria>
