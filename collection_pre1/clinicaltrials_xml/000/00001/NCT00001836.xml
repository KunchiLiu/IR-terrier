	<brief_summary>Electron beam compute tomography ( EBCT ) regard state-of-the-art investigation detect quantitating coronary artery calcification . However , EBCT expensive , asymmetric gantry geometry make less useful routine scanning ; thus , EBCT readily available general population . Recent report show `` volumetric '' ( also know `` helical '' `` spiral '' ) scanner , much commonly available EBCT , detect coronary artery calcification . Updated software available NIH allow EKG gate volumetric scan improve quality image , thus improve ability accurately quantitate coronary calcification volumetric scanner . We would like compare result volumetric scan standard EBCT order characterize similarity differences two scan technique . We propose obtain EBCT volumetric CT scan coronary artery group patient know suspected coronary artery disease calculate calcium score method . Our primary analysis comparison sensitivity two method .</brief_summary>
