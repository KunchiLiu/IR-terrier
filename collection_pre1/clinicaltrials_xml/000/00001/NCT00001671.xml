	<brief_summary>Leukodystrophy disease white matter brain . White matter portion brain responsible conduct electrical impulse one area brain . Insulating cell call myelin cover brain nerve cell white matter . If myelin becomes damage electrical information transfer properly . Many patient suffer leukodystrophies fit description define type leukodystrophies therefore consider leukodystrophy unknown cause . The purpose study define group patient leukodystrophies work toward find cause disorder . In order , researcher analyze patient leukodystrophies unknown cause . Patients undergo clinical , neurophysiologic , biochemical , genetic examination test . Researchers believe study patient disorder able good understand cause myelin destruction , eventually lead effective treatment disorder .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Classification Cause Leukodystrophies Unknown Cause</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients leukodystrophies ( LDs ) unknown etiology heterogeneous group constitute second large group genetic white matter disease . The purpose study : ( ) define novel homogeneous group patient LDs ( b ) work toward find cause disorder . In order achieve goal , patient LDs unknown cause analyze clinically , neurophysiologically , biochemically genetically . Patients would diagnose know leukodystrophies outside center . At Clinical Center , patient undergo series neuropsychological , blood , urine , spinal fluid , radiological , peripheral tissue pathological test . Some test part standard battery others tailor individual patient . Patients follow 3 year . Patients screen mutation gene cod structural myelin protein . In patient test yield information regard etiology disease , open brain biopsy consider . Brain biopsy tissue evaluate use novel combination approach include detailed pathological , immunohistochemical , biochemical analysis myelin proteins lipid . Oligodendroglial biology expression myelin gene brain also investigate situ . It hop present study help clarify nosology leukodystrophies significantly advance understanding pathogenesis disease .</detailed_description>
