	<brief_summary>Iron overload ( hemochromatosis ) condition cause intestine take much iron body food pill . The extra iron build liver , heart , joint , pancreas , sex organ , organ . Patients iron overload feel well initially , iron eventually damage organ may lead early death . The condition believe passed generation generation . Many study conduct condition affect Caucasian Americans , address condition African Americans . Researchers believe important find much possible iron overload African Americans . The goal study determine pattern inheritance primary iron overload African American family identify genetic defect cause condition . The study use various test simple blood testing ( transferritin saturation serum ferritin level ) complex genetic test ( segregation analysis polymerase chain reaction [ PCR ] ) . The test help researcher deterimine iron level blood , presence antigen may help trace inheritance , detect change gene know cause iron overload Caucasians . The study may directly benefit patient participate . However , study may lead improve method diagnose iron overload African American population whole .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose project determine pattern inheritance primary iron overload African American family identify genetic defect . The iron status index subject family member determine measure transferrin saturation serum ferritin , genetic pattern study segregation analysis . The chromosomal localization iron-loading locus pursue determine HLA haplotype , test HFE gene mutation , sequence portion gene molecule involve iron metabolism , analyze polymorphism gene PCR , employ molecular method screen genome , test linkage iron phenotype lod score . Loci proteins important iron metabolism examine candidate gene .</detailed_description>
