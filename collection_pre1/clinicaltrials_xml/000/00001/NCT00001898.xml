	<brief_summary>This study look genetic change occur development male female breast cancer cancer . It use new technology call DNA microarray hybridization look wide array gene identify disease-associated pattern human genome ( complete set human gene ) . Numerous study link particular gene give disease , little information pattern gene expression ( production proteins genetic cod ) entire human genome . Pinpointing genetic abnormality disease may help classify different form cancer perhaps lead new avenue treatment prevention . A primary goal study create database gene expression human cancer disorder provide basis find genetic abnormality disease . Tumors specimen use study take tissue biopsied patient breast , colon cancer , sarcomas melanoma part routine care . Patients study among receive care : Department Oncology , University Hospital , University Lund , Sweden ( breast cancer ) ; Department Medicine , University Michigan , Ann Arbor , Michigan ( breast cancer ) ; Surgery Branch , National Cancer Institute , Bethesda , Maryland ( melanoma ) , Johns Hopkins Univ . ( colon cancer ) , Memorial Sloan Kettering ( sarcoma ) . Patients study family history take complete questionnaire . Some patient ask blood test . Breast cancer patient mammogram one do within last year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study make use novel technology Cancer Genetics Branch NHGRI leader develop . This technology genome-wide expression analysis , DNA microarray hybridization , focus protocol . We access tissue bank collect collaborator contain excess tissue obtain routine clinical care . Specimens process large-scale gene expression analysis DNA copy number determination use DNA microarrays . The development analysis gene expression gene copy number database primary purpose study . Currently available new bioinformatics tool apply data characterization disease subset ( e.g. , early vs. advance stage cancer ) well mine data specific gene link give disease state .</detailed_description>
