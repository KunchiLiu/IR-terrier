	<brief_summary>We propose longitudinal study natural history type III IV osteogenesis imperfecta child age birth 25 year . A consistent objective throughout study obtain comprehensive assessment natural history progression multiple secondary feature osteogenesis imperfecta . In addition radiographic , bone density , physical rehabilitation dental manifestation , ass cardiovascular , pulmonary , neurological , audiology system . The major objective protocol focus rehabilitation physical therapy study , pulmonary cardiovascular function , neurological feature , audiological study genetic molecular biology aspect OI . A major objective study expand intensive rehabilitation physical therapy study child type III IV OI . This objective continue work do Rehabilitation Department Clinical Center past 20 year patient . However , focus objective change include study scoliosis effect function , study chest proportion rib deformity , study nonkinetic variable relate motor performance , temperament , competence , cop , resilience child OI . The second major objective longitudinal study pulmonary function child type III IV OI . It well know cardiopulmonary complication major cause disability death adult OI ; developmental pattern complication , whether susceptible individual identify childhood , unknown . The third major objective study secondary feature determine incidence basilar invagination develop monitoring management plan neurological feature . Next , prevalence , severity , age onset genotypic/phenotypic correlation hearing loss among child type II IV OI remain poorly understood ; therefore , study audiological feature fourth major objective . The final major objective study continue study genetic molecular biology aspect OI . Patients skin biopsy collagen study biochemical molecular level . Parents blood drawn determination mosaic status mutation cause child OI . These study provide information genotype/phenotype correlation variable OI genetics . As appropriate , bone chip emergency elective surgical procedure participant use study osteoblast function OI .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Children recruit United States . This recruitment accomplish contact Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation , parenttoparent communication , outside referral health care provider . There exclusionary criterion relate race gender protocol . Children enrol study limit Sillence Types III IV OI , determine clinical genetic criterion . Patients age birth 10 year enrollment consider protocol . Children skin biopsy do collagen analysis another facility prefer participation study . However , previous skin biopsy another facility preclude participation protocol . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Children expect attain least degree ambulatory skill high potential achieve independent locomotion assistive technology . Children clinically severe benefit program define follow criterion : 1 . The ratio head circumference age ( age child 's head body size fall 50th percentile ) body length age ( age child 's length fall 50th percentile ) 7:1 great ; 2 . Children 24 month age , unable sit unsupported 60 second unable demonstrate ability prop upper extremities prone position ; 3 . Children significant medical problem , especially severe cardiopulmonary problem , impact physical development . Compliance visit schedule , maintenance physical therapy program , completion measurement tool central analysis outcome study . Failure comply condition constitute exclusion criterion .</criteria>
