	<brief_summary>This 2-part study evaluate effectiveness side effect two anti-inflammatory drug relieve pain improve jaw function patient temporomandibular disorder ( TMD ) . Part 1 evaluate celecoxib ( Celebrex ) ; Part 2 evaluate etanercept ( Enbrel ) . The Food Drug Administration approve drug treat certain form arthritis . Patients age 18 65 year painful jaw joint condition may eligible study . Candidates complete several write questionnaire jaw condition undergo medical history , complete TMD evaluation , blood urine test , image study temporomandibular joint , X-rays magnetic resonance imaging . Patients rate quality intensity pain begin treatment . At certain period study , also keep pain diary , twice day record intensity magnitude pain . Part 1 - Celecoxib : Patients randomly assign receive either 1 ) celecoxib twice day mouth ; 2 ) naproxen ( non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ) twice day mouth ; 3 ) placebo ( inactive pill ) twice day mouth . Part 2 - Etanercept : Patients randomly assign receive either 1 ) etanercept inject skin 2 ) saline ( inactive placebo ) inject skin . Patients group also undergo two aspiration fluid jaw joint - treatment begin 6 week later . For procedure , joint numb anesthetic needle insert jaw space withdraw fluid , analyzed inflammatory process joint . All patient final evaluation 6 week begin treatment , include TMD physical examination , laboratory X-ray test require . The pain diary questionnaire collect visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose clinical trial consist two parallel study . In first part study , evaluate analgesia adverse effect celecoxib , COX-2 inhibitor comparison naproxen placebo patient temporomandibular disorder ( TMD ) . Celecoxib , oral anti-inflammatory analgesic agent act selectively inhibit cyclooxygenase 2 ( COX-2 ) expect cause typical gastrointestinal , platelet-related side effect associate inhibition COX-1 enzyme . Decrease pain , dysfunction improvement quality life assess base line 6-week follow-up . Successful demonstration enhance therapeutic effect reduce toxicity may provide basis clinical use selective COX-2 inhibitor patient painful TMD . In second group carefully select patient , evaluate short-term effect etanercept ( Enbrel ) comparison placebo patient pain tenderness palpation temporomandibular joint ( TMJ osteoarthritis ) least three month duration respond conservative treatment . Etanercept biologic modifier bind specifically tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF alpha ) . The mechanism action etanercept competitive inhibition TNF bind cell-surface TNF receptor ( TNFR ) , prevent TNF-mediated cellular response render TNF biologically inactive . Subjects randomly assign either etanercept placebo administration . At baseline 6-week follow individual outcome assess pain , mandibular range motion along analysis sample synovial fluid level TNF alpha . By study joint fluid level TNF alpha , learn development local inflammatory process joint , help predict prognosis patient TM joint disorder . Positive finding also provide clinical implication etanercept patient painful TMJ osteoarthritis .</detailed_description>

Subjects primary psychiatric disease score average high comparison normative score Symptom Checklist ( SCL90R ) able participate . Subjects obvious occlusal disturbance crossbite , openbite , full denture disqualify . Children age 18 exclude study . Pregnant woman include study . Etanercept Study : INCLUSION CRITERIA : For etanercept study , recruitment patient later stage temporomandibular disorder , respond standard nonsurgical TMD therapy ( i.e. , splint , physical therapy , biofeedback , trigger point injection ) , whose primary diagnosis consist TMJ osteoarthritis define Research Diagnostic Criteria . Subjects require preauricular pain minimum three month clinical radiographic evidence TMJ arthritis . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects undergone TMJ surgery within precede 6 month active way exclude . Subjects take regularly steroid narcotic medication exclude . Further exclusion criterion presence TMJ growth disturbance . Patients red , hot , swollen , tender TM joint , TMJ infections medical history consist infectious arthritis , crystal induce arthropathy , musculoskeletal disorder disqualify . Patients sepsis know hypersensitivity etanercept component exclude study . Any patient medical history diabetes , congestive heart failure , chronic infection exclude . Children age 18 include . Pregnant woman include .</criteria>
