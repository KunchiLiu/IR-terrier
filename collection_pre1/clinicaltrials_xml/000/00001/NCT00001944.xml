	<brief_summary>Tumor resistance anti-cancer drug major problem cancer treatment . Studies find protein ( P-glycoprotein ) cancer cell pump chemotherapy drug cell , reduce treatment effectiveness . In laboratory test , experimental drug call XR9576 , block pump protein . It use study try increase amount anti-cancer drug vinorelbine , cancer cell . Vinorelbine show several clinical trial effective advanced cancer , include breast , lung ovarian , one drug pump tumor cell P-glycoprotein . Patients cancer 18 year old may eligible study . Candidates screen test may include blood urine test , electrocardiogram , echocardiogram , CT scan , X-rays , nuclear medicine study . A tumor biopsy may do diagnostic research purpose . Study participant undergo tumor image radioactive drug Tc-99m Sestamibi . This drug accumulate tumor cell eliminate much way cancer drug eliminate cell . The drug inject vein series picture take gamma camera . After baseline scan , patient receive dose XR9576 undergo second scan 24 hour later . The scan show whether XR9576 affect accumulation elimination Sestamibi tumor cell . This procedure may provide way monitor cancer evidence chemotherapy resistance show XR9576 improve effectiveness therapy . At least 10 day baseline XR9576 scan , patient begin first 3 21-day cycle vinorelbine treatment . On day 1 8 cycle , patient receive 30-minute infusion XR9576 intravenously ( vein ) follow vinorelbine , infused 6- 10-minute period . ( In patient , XR9576 administer one two vinorelbine dosage . ) Physical examination , blood test , procedure may do periodically monitor treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Intrinsic acquire drug resistance remain major obstacle treatment cancer . Accumulating evidence indicate malignancy P-glycoprotein confer resistance , reversal improve therapeutic outcome . Clinical trial investigate P-glycoprotein antagonist hamper occurrence unpredictable pharmacokinetic interaction , require dose reduction chemotherapeutic agent avert excessive toxicity . XR9576 new P-glycoprotein antagonist potent , prolonged activity , potentially devoid significant pharmacokinetic interaction . This phase I study seeks identify safety XR9576 administration combination vinorelbine determine extent , , pharmacokinetic interaction two drug . Clinical response also determine .</detailed_description>
