	<brief_summary>About 27,000 new case renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) diagnose every year United States . 11,000 case die disease . More half patient present advanced metastatic disease chemotherapy play limited role . Therefore , development another therapeutic approach need . Cancers human commonly associate mutation dominant recessive oncogene . These gene produce mutated protein unique cancer cell . Von Hipple-Lindau ( VHL ) gene associate development VHL disease , recently map clone , find mutate 57 % sporadic renal cell carcinoma . Data mouse show generation major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) restrict cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) capable detect endogenous cytoplasmic peptide derive mutated oncogene . In addition , recently demonstrate , conduct different phase I clinical trial vaccinate cancer patient mutate Ras p53 peptide correspond abnormality patient harbor tumor , patient generate immunological response represent generation lymphocyte ( CD4+ and/or CD8+ ) . In current study , would like extend observation test whether VHL tumor suppressor protein immunologically target vaccination . We identify specific epitope along amino acid sequence VHL protein , represent know specific human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) class-I bind motif . These amino acid stretch VHL protein correspond area point mutation hot spot . Therefore , propose treat patient sporadic RCC carry VHL mutation tumor correspond mutant VHL peptide vaccination . This vaccination do either use pulsed-autologous peripheral mononuclear cell peptide , peptide administer subcutaneously alone combination cytokine .</brief_summary>
