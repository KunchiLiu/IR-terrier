	<brief_summary>Some drug ability push stem cell ( cell responsible produce new cell type ) bone marrow blood stream . The step involve process still poorly understood . However , good understand process could lead improved result transplantation , cancer treatment , contribute development new genetic therapy wide variety disorder . In study researcher plan compare two different treatment , mobilize ( push ) stem cell bone marrow blood stream . In addition , researcher attempt determine efficient mobilize blood cell patient multiple myeloma . Information knowledge gain study help design future transplantation genetic therapy research study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Some drug , hematopoietic cytokine , result mobilization primitive stem cell bone marrow space blood , mechanism process still poorly understood . A good understanding process could greatly improve clinical result transplantation , cancer treatment , potentially genetic therapy wide variety disorder . In protocol , study two different mobilization treatment compare efficient increase number primitive cell blood patient multiple myeloma . These cell collect apheresis , use autologous transplantation follow high dose chemotherapy . This aggressive approach treatment multiple myeloma show improve remission rate survival without active disease . The use large number blood stem cell may decrease toxicity associate procedure . In research laboratory , study number characteristic primitive cell blood bone marrow treatment mobilize drug . These study help u design future transplantation genetic therapy protocol .</detailed_description>
