	<brief_summary>This study test safety effectiveness drug methimazole treat polymyositis dermatomyositis-inflammatory muscle disease cause weakness muscle waste . Although known cause disease , abnormal immune function think involve . Recent study indicate methimazole , use many year treat thyroid disease , may alter immune activity affect interaction white blood cell call lymphocyte certain molecule cell surface . This study examine effect methimazole immune activity muscle strength patient inflammatory muscle disease evaluate drug side effect . Patients polymyositis dermatomyositis normal thyroid function may eligible study [ age requirement ? ] . Candidates undergo history physical examination ; blood urine test ; chest X-ray ; muscle strength testing , daily living skill questionnaire , speech swallow evaluation ; magnetic resonance imaging muscle ; muscle biopsy ( removal small piece muscle tissue local anesthetic ) . When indicated , candidate may also cancer screen test ( example , mammogram , Pap smear ) , lung function test measure breathe capacity , electromyogram , small needle insert muscle measure electrical activity . Participants take 30 mg methimazole mouth twice day 6 month . They blood test weekly first 2 week every week rest study measure blood count liver thyroid function . Blood also draw white blood cell study screen evaluation , begin therapy , 6 12 week therapy start , end 6-month treatment period , 1 3 month therapy end . Muscle enzyme urine test do month.. During drug treatment , patient periodic physical examination blood muscle function test evaluate response therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This open label pilot study ass ( 1 ) activity methimazole ( MMI ) , down-regulator MHC Class I transcription use treatment autoimmune thyroiditis ( AIT ) , tissue expression HLA class I ( 2 ) efficacy measure serum muscle enzyme level manual muscle test twenty patient dermatomyositis ( DM ) polymyositis ( PM ) . Participants persistent weakness , laboratory evidence inflammation stable regimen medication control myopathy . MMI administer orally 30 mg twice day six month . Patients evaluated alteration HLA Class I expression muscle peripheral blood lymphocyte ( PBL ) drug-related toxicity study three month discontinuation treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis Polymyositis Dermatomyositis . Baseline muscle weakness score less equal 139 160 manual testing ( MMT ) . Baseline functional assessment score less equal 82 91 . Ability provide inform consent aspect study full information provide . Age equal old 18 . A diagnosis classic definite polymyositis dermatomyositis ( Critieria A B plus least one three criterion ) : 1 . Symmetrical proximal muscle weakness ; 2 . Muscle biopsy abnormality time disease : i. degeneration regeneration muscle fiber ii . necrosis iii . phagocytosis iv . interstitial mononuclear infiltration ; c. Elevation serum creatinine phosphokinase ( CPK ) , transaminases , lactic dehydrogenase ( LDH ) aldolase activity ; d. Electromyography ( EMG ) triad change i. small amplitude , short duration polyphasic motor unit potential ii . fibrillation , positive sharp wave , increase insertional irritability iii . spontaneous bizarre high frequency discharge ; e. Typical skin rash DM . Willingness undergo 2 muscle biopsy . Evidence active disease measure weakness , elevate CK active MRI . Must taper stable dose steroid equal less 0.50 mg/kg/day equivalent prednisone one month prior study . If additional immunosuppressive drug , drug must maintain stable dose 1 month prior initiation therapy maintain throughout trial . Women childbearing potential men whose partner childbearing potential must practice acceptable form contraception . No pregnant female nurse mother . No history hepatitis abnormal liver function test . No history prior thyroid disease . No active acute chronic infection require antimicrobial therapy , serious viral fungal infection . No preexist coexist malignancy basal cell localize squamous cell carcinoma skin . No history cerebrovascular accident , seizure disorder , aseptic meningitis , transverse myelitis central nervous system disease . No history document coronary artery disease , cardiomyopathy , great firstdegree heart block , dysrhythmia require therapy . No confound medical illness judgement investigator would pose added risk study participant . No anemia require maintenance blood transfusion ; leukoplakia WBC le 3,000 microgram absolute neutrophil count le 2,000 microgram ; platelet count le 100,000 microgram least two different occasion . No history ( current ) autoimmune hemolytic anemia . No current anticoagulant therapy .</criteria>
