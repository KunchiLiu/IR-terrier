	<brief_summary>The main source energy brain come combination oxygen glucose ( sugar ) . For brain cell function normally must receive constant supply nutrient . As area brain become active blood flow area increase . In addition oxygen glucose , brain us chemical compound know phospholipid . These phospholipid make cover nerve cell assist transfer information cell cell . Without phospholipid brain cell activity may become abnormal cause problem nervous system . Certain disease like Alzheimer 's disease brain tumor affect blood flow brain change way brain metabolizes phospholipid . In addition disease , change brain occur normal healthy age . This study design use PET scan measure change blood flow change phospholipid metabolism . Using technique , researcher improve understand certain disease change shape function brain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Brain Physiology Metabolism Section ( BPMS ) National Institute Aging ( NIA ) Clinical Neuroscience Program ( CNP ) National Institute Neurological Disorders Stroke ( NINDS ) propose study regional brain phospholipid metabolism young old normal volunteer patient Alzheimer disease . The method employ , develop animal study , involve intravenous injection radiolabeled polyunsaturated fatty acid , [ 11C ] arachidonic acid measure regional brain radioactivity use positron emission tomography ( PET ) . A mathematical model use calculate regional brain incorporation coefficient k* [ 11C ] arachidonate brain . These reflect brain signal transduction membrane turnover involve phospholipid signal transduction membrane turnover involve phospholipid activation enzyme , phospholipase A2 . PET also use subject measure regional cerebral blood flow ( rCBF ) , marker brain energy metabolism , radioactive water ( [ 150 ] H20 ) . The literature report rCBF energy metabolism decline age markedly reduce Alzheimer disease . We hypothesize ( ) able quantify image incorporation [ 11C ] arachidonate human brain first time , ( b ) normal volunteer , k* arachidonate correlate regional basis rCBF , ( c ) rCBF reduce old compare young normal volunteer , markedly reduce Alzheimer disease patient compare old volunteer ( control ) , ( ) normal coupling ( regression ) relation k* rCBF disturb Alzheimer disease . This protocol originally propose measure brain incorporation two label fatty acid , [ 11C ] arachidonate [ 11C ] palmitate , well rCBF , young old normal volunteer , patient Alzheimer disease , Niemann-Pick Type C disease brain tumor . Eleven patient Alzheimer disease scan use [ 11C ] arachidonate [ 150 ] H20 , compare 10 volunteer . The current amendment proposes use [ 11C ] arachidonate [ 150 ] H20 16 additional normal volunteer , compare result old young group patient Alzheimer disease . A request study 16 additional normal volunteer approve NINDS IRB Continuing Review 1999 , change since .</detailed_description>
