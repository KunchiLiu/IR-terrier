	<brief_summary>One major interest laboratory characterization cellular subpopulation involve trigger immunoregulation B lymphocytes produce antibody . We assess response individual produce antibody newly encounter antigen keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( KLH ) ( approve project number 77-I-0130 ) propose assess amnestic response previously encounter antigen , tetanus toxoid . The purpose protocol add recall antigen repertoire antigen use evaluate immune response man . Booster immunization tetanus/diphtheria toxoid use several year number clinical immunology laboratory throughout country ass B cell relate immunologic profile patient control normal subject . We recently develop sensitive ELISA assay IgM IgG vitro specific antibody response tetanus toxoid . This allow u carefully precisely monitor evolution immunoregulation human B cell response recall antigen . This particular importance relevance u ongoing study number disease characterized abnormality immunologic reactivity , include treat various regimen immunosuppressive agent .</brief_summary>
