	<brief_summary>PRIMARY : To compare clinical efficacy two decision make strategy initiate change antiretroviral therapy : decision make base current clinical practice alone ( i.e. , initiate change therapy base CD4 count decline and/or clinical progression ) versus decision make base plasma HIV RNA quantitation addition current clinical practice . SECONDARY : To evaluate toxicity , biological marker , patient management two arm . Although change therapy common strategy treatment HIV disease , guideline need help clinician patient decide change antiretroviral therapy indicate . The technology measure HIV RNA plasma suggest tool monitoring clinical drug efficacy . However , uncertainty remain whether aggressive antiretroviral treatment low HIV RNA maintain low level long possible confer clinical benefit comparison management base monitoring CD4 count HIV-related symptom .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Two Methods Determining When Begin Change Anti-HIV Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although change therapy common strategy treatment HIV disease , guideline need help clinician patient decide change antiretroviral therapy indicate . The technology measure HIV RNA plasma suggest tool monitoring clinical drug efficacy . However , uncertainty remain whether aggressive antiretroviral treatment low HIV RNA maintain low level long possible confer clinical benefit comparison management base monitoring CD4 count HIV-related symptom . Patients randomized decision make strategy initiate change therapy base current clinical practice alone vs. decision making base plasma HIV RNA quantitation addition current clinical practice patient &lt; = 300 CD4+ cells/mm3 . All patient RNA arm well subset ( n = 183 ) CCP arm plasma HIV RNA quantitation drawn every 4 month . The result quantitations blind end study . CD4 count obtain least every 4 month previous count &gt; 20 cells/mm3 . The remain patient CCP arm CD4 count obtain accord clinician ' current clinical practice . Medications , clinical status , change antiretroviral therapy record patient study . Patients stratify CD4+ cell count ( &lt; 100 cells/mm3 [ 200 patient ] vs. 100-300 cells/mm3 [ 900 patient ] ) .</detailed_description>
