	<detailed_description>Background : - Brain tumor represent common solid tumor childhood . Treatment generally include surgery radiation , recurrence frequent , particularly high-grade lesion . - Chemotherapy often use adjuvant setting , delay radiation therapy resistant disease . - Children brain tumor generally follow imaging study , CT MRI . - Difficulty arise try distinguish tumor regrowth treatment related edema , necrosis radiation injury . - Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic ( NMRS ) Imaging non-invasive method detect measure cellular metabolite vivo . Objective : - To determine NMRS image pattern , chemotherapy pediatric patient primary metastatic brain tumor - To identify characterize specific pattern metabolite related tumor regrowth , tumor response therapy , edema necrosis . Eligibility : - Age le equal 21 year . - Patients enter trial also enter one Branch primary brain tumor treatment trial . - Histologically confirm primary metastatic brain tumor . Patients brainstem glioma optic pathway glioma require histologic diagnosis . - Measurable evaluable tumor time study entry . Design : - This intend pilot study define metabolite pattern associate tumor growth , tumor edema tumor necrosis see standard MRI ; determine feasibility use metabolite pattern predict response therapy pediatric patient brain tumor . - Contalateral spectroscopic analysis normal appear brain also perform feasible . - Analysis result stratify accord type tumor , prior history radiation therapy surgery .</detailed_description>
