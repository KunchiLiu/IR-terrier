	<brief_summary>In study researcher would like learn low level bone mineral density see approximately half woman forty diagnose currently previously depression . Bones always undergo process building ( formation ) breakdown ( resorption ) . This process refer bone remodeling . When bone form resorbed , density ( level calcium ) bone increase bone become strong . However , bone resorb form density bone decrease bone become weak . This condition call osteoporosis . It unknown woman depression decrease bone mineral density result much breakdown bone enough building . It important know cause low bone mineral density influence way patient treat . Medications like bisphosphonates use much bone breakdown . Growth hormone replacement give case enough bone production . Presently , bone biopsy procedure know histomorphometry determine process go bone . Researchers decide use sample bone ( biopsy ) part hip bone ( iliac crest ) . In addition , researcher collect sample bone marrow ( soft tissue find center bone ) tell biochemical , cellular , molecular process may contribute problem decrease bone density depress premenopausal woman .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Bone Biopsy Better Understand Causes Decreased Bone Mineral Density Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We recently find premenopausal woman past current depression show clinically significant decrement bone mineral density hip spine , render 40 % present risk osteoporotic fracture . Recent pharmacologic advance provide opportunity ameliorate reverse clinically significant loss bone mineral density . Available agent bisphosphonates growth hormone preferentially effective context increase decrease bone turnover , respectively . It currently know whether decrease bone mineral density depression associate increase decrease bone turnover many endocrine change associate depression possible relevance decrease bone mineral density disparate effect bone turnover dynamic . At present , definitive way determine status bone turnover human via bone biopsy histomorphometric evaluation . In addition , bone marrow routinely obtain standard bone biopsy would provide opportunity culture osteoblast osteoclast progenitor cell determine possible abnormality differentiation function mean explore cellular molecular mechanism decrease bone mineral density depression . In light high incidence depression woman , decrease bone mineral density patient past current depression considerable public health implication .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Female patient primary affective disorder ( major depression n=17 ) . Controls must psychiatric disorder . Subjects past current depression study bone mineral density site either hip spine assess DEXA scan equal great 1 1/2 standard deviation peak bone density . Subjects psychiatric illness either drug free receive FDA approve medication treatment depression , exception valproic acid carbamazepine , know interfere intestinal calcium absorption ( hence , influence bone mineral density ) , monoamine oxidase inhibitor , interact adversely fentanyl event would give relief pain . During course entire study subject must abstain tobacco alcohol instruct inform physician conduct research use prescription nonprescription medication , include birth control pill . Must serious medical illness . Must current past , prolong steroid use . Must pregnant . Must anticoagulant medication . Must allergic show adverse reaction tetracyline , benzodiazepine , fentanyl , lidocaine . Must use aspirin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent past week .</criteria>
