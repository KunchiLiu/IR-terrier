	<brief_summary>Dementia refers condition loss intellectual function ( cognition ) . It usually progressive condition interferes normal social occupational activity . Patients frontal lobe dementia ( FLD ) suffer destruction brain cell find frontal lobe brain . Loss frontal lobe neuron cause change personality , aggressiveness , agitation , depression . In addition , patient FLD may difficulty plan task may loss motivation . Researchers believe cell lose frontal lobe brain responsible produce chemical call serotonin . Serotonin neurotransmitter , mean used neuron communicate neuron . Researchers incline believe replace miss serotonin , symptom FLD may relieve . Drugs known serotonin uptake inhibitor , help maintain high level serotonin body . They use successfully treat patient depression patient violent / impulsive behavior . Sertraline serotonin reuptake blocker relatively easy give ( daily ) , safe serotonin reuptake blocker ( little effect vital enzyme system [ cytochrome P-450 ] ) , interaction drug . This study design test effectiveness Sertraline treatment symptom associate FLD . Patients participate study receive Sertraline 6 week placebo `` inactive sugar pill '' 6 week . During study , researcher test psychological neurological function measure effect drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Degeneration frontal serotonin-containing neuron occurs frontal lobe dementia ( FLD ) . The associated loss serotonin transmission may contribute frontal lobe dysfunction associate disorder . FLD patient undergo control clinical trial orally administer serotonergic agent ( Sertraline ) act centrally selectively block serotonin uptake treat patient ' cognitive behavioral frontal dysfunction . Study subject evaluate regular interval battery neuropsychological behavioral test design assess frontal cognitive function . In addition , compliance level medication measure blood possible cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) .</detailed_description>
