	<brief_summary>This clinical , epidemiologic , genetic , laboratory study individual family high risk cancer select tumor investigate genetic susceptibility environmental exposure may alter cancer risk . Families multiple member unusual pattern number cancer tumor evaluate clinically . This evaluation specific type cancer tumor predominant family order determine affection status individual genetic epidemiologic study . Genetic environmental risk factor information specific tumor type obtain . Individuals , high risk , cancer personal , familial , environmental history identify healthcare worker referral personal inquiry . Relevant etiologic risk factor information document review pathology specimens medical , vital , genealogical record . Selected individual family member ask complete questionnaire undergo clinical evaluation specific tumor interest . They also ask donate biologic specimen use search cancer etiology mechanism carcinogenesis . No therapy beyond counsel education cancer prevention , risk reduction , early detection give . Genetic test tumor susceptibility gene ( ) mutation risk notification offer study participant specific mutation predictive disease identify his/her family . This test offer reasonable individual cancer risk estimate deliver , participant choose know individual genetic status appropriate education counseling . The test conduct exclusively Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA ) -licensed laboratory . Genetic test risk notification entirely optional affect participation aspect protocol . A separate consent procedure consent form use genetic test risk notification relate specific gene . Once enrol , study participant monitor prospectively development outcome interest , typically mean periodic mail telephone contact . In selected instance , subject may return Clinical Center periodically study-specific follow-up examination . Although offer specific anti-cancer therapy part protocol , provide assistance insure study participant require treatment tumor-related problem develop course study refer appropriate healthcare provider . We remain available study participant healthcare provider advice consultation relate management familial cancer/tumor predisposition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical , Laboratory , Epidemiologic Characterization Individuals Families High Risk Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Persons may prone develop cancer variety reason include : inherited predisposition benign , premalignant , malignant condition ; environmental exposure share family member ; previous tumor , immune deficiency , preneoplastic condition . Investigations individual family high risk cancer often lead etiologic clue may important sporadic counterpart cancer general population . Identification etiologically important genetic factor could inform chemoprevention trial , screen program , treatment study cancer type . Objectives : To evaluate define clinical spectrum natural history disease syndromes predispose cancer . To evaluate potential precursor state disease family risk . To quantify risk tumor family member . To map , clone , determine function tumor susceptibility gene . To identify genetic determinant , environmental factor , gene-environment interaction confer cancer risk individual family . To evaluate gene-gene gene-environment interaction tumor formation . To educate counsel study participant tumor risk include prevention recommendation early detection activity know . To develop educational material medical professional high-risk family member . Eligibility : Persons age consider inclusion study either , A family personal medical history neoplasia unusual type , pattern , number ; , Known suspect factor ( ) predispose neoplasia , either genetic and/or congenital factor , environmental exposure , unusual demographic feature . Types familial tumor currently actively accrue include Cancers : bladder , bone , brain , chordoma , lung , nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome ( NBCC ) . Design : This prospective study . Individuals family study long-term , use cohort approach . The study design clinical evaluation vary specific type familial neoplasm study . The overall approach eligible study participant include define affection status , characterization disease , localization genetic locus , identification gene , evaluation phenotype/genotype correlation , estimation risk disease associate carrier status identification risk factor modify penetrance ( genetic , environmental , host factor ) .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : On referral , person age consider inclusion study either : A family personal history neoplasia unusual type , pattern , number ; OR , know suspected factor ( ) predispose neoplasia , either genetic and/or congenital factor ( birth defect , metabolic phenotype , chromosomal anomaly Mendelian trait associate tumor ) , environmental exposure ( medication , occupation , radiation , diet , infectious agent , etc . ) , unusual demographic feature ( young age onset , multiple tumor , etc. ) . Personal family medical history must verify questionnaire , interview , review pathology slide medical record . For familial neoplasm , two living affected case among family member require . The type familial tumor currently actively accrue include : Familial Cancers : bladder , brain , chordoma , lung , nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome ( NBCC ) Familial Benign Neoplasms : meningioma , neurofibromatosis 2 ( bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis ) The type familial tumor active accrual study predominantly investigatorand hypothesisdriven . This approach permit GEB investigator remain alert opportunity afford cluster rare tumor family individual , responsive dynamic research priority cancer genetics . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Referred individual family report diagnosis verify . Inability provide inform consent . Eligible familial melanoma , lymphoproliferative , breastovarian cancer , testicular cancer protocol .</criteria>
