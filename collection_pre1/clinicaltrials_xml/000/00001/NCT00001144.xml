	<brief_summary>This study investigate safety effectiveness new stem cell transplant procedure treat chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) . Transplantation donate stem cell ( cell produce bone marrow mature different blood components-white cell , red cell platelet ) effective treatment CML . However , despite success large number patient , still significant risk death procedure . In addition , result sterility leave patient increase risk cancer eye cataract . These complication result intensive chemotherapy radiation patient receive transplant rid body cancer cell . In study , radiation use chemotherapy drug give low dos try reduce danger procedure . Patients CML test match donor ( family member ) undergo medical history , physical examination several test ( e.g. , breathe test , X-rays , others ) determine eligibility study . Participants undergo apheresis collect lymphocytes ( white blood cell important immune system ) . In apheresis , whole blood drawn needle arm , similar donate unit blood . The required component-in case , lymphocytes-are separate remove , rest blood return needle arm . Each day start five day transplant , donor give injection G-CSF , drug release stem cell bone marrow blood stream . The cell collect fifth injection sixth injection follow day . Meanwhile , patient give cyclophosphamide fludarabine , perhaps anti-thymocyte globulin , prevent rejection donate cell . On day transplant , patient give cyclosporin prevent graft-versus-host-disease , disease donor cell react patient 's cell . They may also give lymphocytes transplant boost immune system destroy leukemia cell . After 30 , 60 100 day , bone marrow cell circulate lymphocyte check see many donor cell origin . If less 100 percent donor origin , lymphocytes transfuse . Patients physical examination blood test least weekly 3 month periodically 5 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>CML disease progress blast crisis within five year onset despite medical intervention . Allogeneic transplantation provide definitive cure large number patient . The International Bone Marrow transplant registry report 67 % three-year disease free survival CML patient receive match sibling transplant . However remain 17-20 % treatment-related mortality significant long-term complication . Myeloablative regimen total body irradiation ( TBI ) associate certain sterility , along significant incidence cataract second malignancy . Efforts ameliorate toxicity lead development regimen lack total body irradiation . Although follow-up period patient receive regimen long enough answer question long-term toxicity , appear response rate disease free survival comparable regimen contain TBI . In addition , transplantation experience aplastic anemia TBI part regimen indicate treatment related mortality along risk long-term sequela significantly decrease . Non-myeloablative allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant currently investigate phase I/II trial assess engraftment efficacy toxicity number transplant center . Preliminary data , include experience 30 patient undergoing type procedure , show high rate complete donor engraftment low toxicity profile . Two recent study investigate non-myeloablative allo-transplantation standard risk patient reveal extremely low rate transplant-related complication mortality . In protocol investigate non-myeloablative allogeneic PBSC transplantation patient CML . The patient group study would include patient chronic phase CML HLA-identical sibling . In protocol , eligible patient would treat allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant HLA identical single HLA antigen-mismatched family donor , use intensive immunosuppressive regimen without myeloablation ( `` mini-transplant '' ) attempt decrease transplant related toxicity preserve anti-malignancy and/or anti-host marrow effect graft . The low intensity non-myeloablative conditioning regimen provide adequate immunosuppression allow stem cell lymphocyte engraftment . T-cell replete , donor-derived , granulocyte colony stimulate factor ( G-CSF ) -mobilized peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) use establish hematopoietic lymphoid reconstitution . We add back lymphocytes patient less 100 % donor T-cell chimerism attempt prevent graft rejection enhance graft-versus-malignancy effect . The primary endpoint study transplant relate mortality ( 1 year survival ) . Other end point include engraftment , degree donor-host chimerism , incidence acute chronic graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) , transplant related morbidity , well disease-free overall survival .</detailed_description>
