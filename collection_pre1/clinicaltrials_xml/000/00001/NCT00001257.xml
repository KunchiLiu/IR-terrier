	<brief_summary>This study investigate inflammatory response . People abnormal regulation inflammation immune defect often exaggerate depressed inflammatory response result poor heal recurrent infection . This study measure compare amount inflammatory mediator ( chemical involve inflammatory response ) healthy normal volunteer patient abnormal immune response . Healthy normal volunteer patient host defense defect excessive inflammation , vasculitis syndrome , may eligible study . Patients must 6 65 year age . Participants eight small blister raise forearm use gentle suction device . The top blister remove scissors plastic template place blister . The well template fill salt solution mixture subject serum ( fluid part blood without cell ) salt solution . Some blister may cover coverslips small round piece thin sterilize glass add fluid . Blister fluid remove well 3 , 5 , 8 , 24 hour syringe analyzed inflammatory mediator . A scab form blister fall 2 week . Participants 4 tablespoon blood drawn order compare inflammatory mediator blood blister fluid .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients abnormal regulation inflammation host defense defect often exaggerate depressed inflammatory response resultant difficulty heal recurrent infection . Delayed heal manifest either delay wound healing , granuloma formation along incision line , dehiscence partially heal wound without evidence infection . We interest study dynamic host immune defense experimentally induce inflammatory response use well-studied suction blister device . This protocol design study mediator inflammation patient host defense defect well patient excessive inflammation vasculitis syndrome . We measure mediator inflammation ( e.g. , C5a , leukotriene B4 , interleukins , chemokines , tumor necrosis factor , interferon-gamma ) ELISA , radioimmunoassay , High Performance Liquid Chromatography , multiplex cytokine assay , and/or bioactivity assay . Furthermore , molecular characterization host defense function ( e.g. , respiratory burst , chemotaxis , phagocytosis , microbicidal activity ) cell recruit blister also examine . In addition analysis cell function , RNA prepare subject DNA microarray quantitative RT-PCR study measure expression dynamic key inflammatory mediator . Many factor contribute inflammatory process several think important granuloma formation . If patient find abnormal amount mediator compare healthy volunteer patient abnormality help u understand basis disease new therapeutic strategy . For example , blister study allow u identify patient subsequently show IRAK4 deficiency .</detailed_description>
