	<brief_summary>According study , speech disorder unknown cause ( idiopathic ) affect approximately 5 % population point life . Some disorder like , stutter cluttering , know detect early , speech development . Stuttering characterize sound syllable repetition consonant/vowel prolongation . When stutter moderate severe , interfere person 's job social activity . Speech articulation disorder characterize omission , substitution speech sound . The speech person clutter often difficult understand . People often unaware error make speak cause treatment condition difficult . The purpose research study extend family whose member exhibit pure form speech articulation disorder In addition , study use data information gather study use develop guideline ( criterion ) define differentiate patient speech disorder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Our objective determine factor involve development stutter familial phonological processing disorder associate familial pattern inheritance . Study population : The study population comprise 8 group : 1 . Children adults persistent developmental stuttering ; 2 . Unaffected sibling individual affect developmental stuttering recover stutter 3 . Children adult recover developmental stuttering ; 4 . Children adults persistent familial phonological processing disorder ( FPPD ) ; 5 . Unaffected sibling individual affect FPPD recover FPPD 6 . Children adult recover FPPD ; 7 . Unaffected sibling individual recover FPPD ; 8 . Children adult normal speech language development comprise control group . Design : A Natural history design use compare affect unaffected family member healthy volunteer normal speech language . Outcome Measures : Genetic marker pedigree analysis use test familial inheritance pattern . Speech language development compare use index speech perception , auditory perception , self monitor one 's speech , language complexity , motor complexity , speech learning , phonological processing verbal/nonverbal memory .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : . Normal Language Development , Hearing Cognition ii . The following screening test previously publish norm find good distribution determine normal functioning adolescent adults subject hit ceiling score great equal 80th percentile . These test use ensure subject affected stutter FPPD disorder hear loss , language delay , mental retardation . Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test III ( PPVTIII ) Expressive Vocabulary Test ( EVT ) Oral Speech Mechanism Screening Examination Revised Token Test ; Token test Children Test Non verbal intelligence ( TONI2 ) Digit Span subtest WICSR Audiometric Screening Goldman Fristoe Test Articulation WUG Test Morphological Encoding Test Auditory Comprehension Language ( TACL ) KhanLewis Phonological Analysis INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR IDENTIFYING AND QUANTIFYING STUTTERING : The Stuttering Severity Index 3 ( Riley , 1981 ) find accurate identifying assess severity stutter conversational speech . For inclusion stuttering subject require : . A total overall score 11 great 3 17 year , ii . A total overall score 18 great age 18 . INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR IDENTIFYING FPPD : . A family history autosomal dominant pattern inheritance speech disorder several generation persistence adulthood case , ii . Speech symptoms conversational speech include : deletion final consonant ; syllable reduction syllable deletion ; deletion grammatical marker copula , auxiliary , preposition , connective ; poor ability selfcorrect ; poor awareness error ; consonant cluster reduction . iii . Greater 9 % discourse error analysis sample 300 syllable . iv . A discrepancy 30 point ( 1 1/2 Standard Deviations ) receptive ( high score ) expressive percentile score PPVT III Expressive Vocabulary Test . v. For subject great 7 year age , phonological process rating 3 phonological process KhanLewis Phonological Analysis . For subject le 7 year age , phonological process rating 3 2 phonological process KhanLewis Phonological Analysis . Finally , subject non developmental phonological process error identify potentially FPPD . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : . Anyone hearing loss exclude participation diagnostic testing . ii . Children delayed language , 1 year delay norm receptive expression language test exclude . iii . Language impairment : score 2 standard deviation age appropriate score standardized language test list inclusion criterion . iv . Cognitive impairment : score 2 standard deviation age appropriate score standardize cognitive test list inclusion criterion . v. Bilingual nonnative English speaker Studies demonstrate brain organization speech language may differ bilingual person . It hypothesize may alter speech motor learn thus kinematic data nonnative English speaker would differ native English speaker . Therefore , nativeAmerican English speaker , one language speak home , include .</criteria>
