	<brief_summary>This study test reliability instrument call Quasi Elastic Laser Scattering Device ( QLS ) detect early change cataract formation . Surgery currently treatment cataract . Many laboratory , however , research drug reverse , delay prevent cataract formation . Anti-cataract drug presumably would effective give early course disease . When clinical trial drug begin , dependable standardize method document monitoring lens opacity need test effectiveness . The QLS design detect early molecular change cataract development . This study evaluate usefulness reliability instrument measure change . Normal volunteer patient cataract study standard eye examination , include vision test eye pressure measurement . The pupil dilate QLS test examination retina . Photographs retina may take . The QLS test use dim laser light similar use scan grocery item supermarket . The laser beam project lens eye , scatter light collect analyzed determine normal abnormal molecular interaction lens . Two measurement do eye . The test repeat 6 month determine reproducibility system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Test QLS Device Detect Early Cataracts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently , device create determine molecular interaction occur nucleus lens , call Quasi Elastic Laser Scattering Device ( QLS ) . Preliminary study show potential detection early change occur cataract , stage anticataract treatment would theoretically effective reversing , delay prevent cataract . A new miniaturize version device develop NASA use low energy laser offer development test NEI . We therefore propose conduct preliminary study evaluate usefulness reproducibility instrument quantitating lens change .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients 18 year older admit study . There gender sex bias recruitment . Three subject normal volunteer age 40 three subject normal volunteer age 40 recruit . These normal volunteer clear lens LOCS II clinical score nuclear opalescence 0.5 le . In addition , 3 subject early nuclear cataract ( LOCS II/Nuclear opalescence 2 ) also recruit study . QLS data obtain eye normal cataractous subject nuclear region . No patient uveitis , glaucoma think risk adverse reaction pupil dilation , history allergic reaction one dilating agent use .</criteria>
