	<brief_summary>To determine safety usefulness zidovudine ( AZT ) treatment patient early symptomatic HIV infection early AIDS relate complex ( ARC ) . The ability AZT suppress HIV , improve body defense , prevent occurrence development AIDS advance ARC evaluate . In one human study , patient AIDS advance ARC receive AZT few life-threatening infection , improved weight performance , live long patient receive placebo ( inactive medication ) . Further study need toxic effect associate use AZT note long-term effectiveness toxicity AZT still unknown . It also unknown AZT benefit patient less severe HIV infection early ARC PGL .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Safety Effectiveness Zidovudine Treatment Patients With Early AIDS Related Complex</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In one human study , patient AIDS advance ARC receive AZT few life-threatening infection , improved weight performance , live long patient receive placebo ( inactive medication ) . Further study need toxic effect associate use AZT note long-term effectiveness toxicity AZT still unknown . It also unknown AZT benefit patient less severe HIV infection early ARC PGL . Patients accept study randomly assign receive either AZT placebo . Treatment continue minimum 104 week beyond time last patient enters study . If study medication cause toxic effect , dose decrease temporarily stop , toxic effect severe , medication stop permanently . Participants visit clinic every 2 week first 16 week month thereafter . Throughout study frequent blood sample take monitor effectiveness safety treatment . AMENDED : The placebo arm discontinue August 3 , 1989 AZT dose reduce .</detailed_description>
