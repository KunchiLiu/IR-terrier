The goal study treat previously untreated patient follicular lymphomas complete remission minimal residual disease ProMACE chemotherapy . Three six month completion chemotherapy , effort reduce relapse rate ( eradicate microscopic disease resistant chemotherapy ) , patient receive autologous Id vaccine administer combination GM-CSF . Id-KLH ( 0.5 mg ) administer subcutaneously . GM-CSF administer subcutaneously locally vaccine day vaccination three consecutive day follow vaccination close initial vaccination site possible one two dos ( patient randomize either high low dose , 500 100 micrograms/m2 ) . We plan accrue 42 patient . Twenty-nine patient enrol . Sixteen patient enter and/or complete vaccination phase . Patients demonstrate significant lymphoproliferative response specific autologous idiotype magnitude significantly great previously observe .</brief_summary>
