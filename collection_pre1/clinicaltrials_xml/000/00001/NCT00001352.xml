	<brief_summary>This 5-year study follow course disease previously healthy patient cryptococcosis develop disease identifiable reason . Individuals positive culture Cryptococcus neoformans 18 year age old without HIV infection condition predispose cryptococcosis ( high-dose corticosteroid therapy , sarcoidosis , blood cancer ) may eligible study . Candidates test positive HIV infection may participate . Participants physical examination , medical history , routine blood test assessment disease activity upon enter study . Patients may active cryptococcosis also lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) additional blood test . Following initial evaluation , patient receive treatment cryptococcosis come NIH Clinical Center need manage disease , typically less every 3 month . Other patient see every 6 12 month . The visit include medical history , physical examination , blood urine test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cryptococcus fungus cause infection commonly immunocompromised patient , AIDS solid organ transplant recipient , particularly renal transplant recipient ( 1-3 ) . However , approximately one-third case fall outside group , overall , 12.9-17.9 % readily identifiable immune defect ( 4 , 5 ) . The genetic factor , may predispose cryptococcosis immune response patient , extensively study . This protocol design examine immune deficit predispose cryptococcosis well clinical immune response among previously healthy adult . The patient include unknown predispose condition cryptococcosis . Patients undergo blood , saliva , tissue sampling . Throughout study , patient provide standard medical care see often necessary manage condition . Patients microbiologic control infection occur inflammation cause neurologic damage may treat corticosteroid immunosuppressive agent . Genetically related family member patient also screen clinical , vitro , immune , genetic correlate immune abnormality . Healthy adult volunteer , comparison group , enrol source blood sample research test . Moreover , respect cryptococcosis , patient isolate non-CNS disease ( e.g. , pulmonary ) may serve subset comparator central nervous system ( CNS ) involvement major tissue tropism Cryptococcus . Genetic immunologic testing perform subject ( patient , relative , healthy volunteer ) evaluate possible immunogenetic factor lead susceptibility cryptococcosis . Among aim protocol good understand pathophysiology genetic factor lead defect host defense use modern evolve method molecular cellular biology elucidate pathogenesis particular susceptibility . A good understanding underlying pathophysiology immune defect genetic susceptibility fungal infection could allow rational development novel therapy diseases benefit future patient .</detailed_description>
