	<brief_summary>The purpose study see whether anti-HIV drug reduce HIV blood also reduce HIV cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) . CSF fluid find around brain spinal cord . This study also look whether reduce HIV CSF help protect brain function . HIV detect brain CSF early HIV disease . Anti-HIV drug probably reduce HIV CSF . This may important study suggest high CSF HIV level may lead loss brain function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HIV-1 RNA emerge CSF early course HIV disease . Studies show high level HIV-1 RNA CSF correlate increase severity dementia worsen performance neuropsychological test . While combination antiretroviral treatment potent suppressor HIV-1 replication plasma , extent treatment suppress viral replication CSF unknown . A study suggest antiretroviral treatment reduce HIV-1 RNA CSF . However , since CSF isolate peripheral immune response HIV antiretroviral treatment may readily penetrate compartment , researcher hypothesize remain virus overcome antiretroviral treatment achieve high level viral replication . This virologic failure likely accompany decreased cognitive function . It therefore critical determine ability antiretroviral treatment control HIV-1 replication CSF durability viral suppression . Patients enrol one several AACTG-sponsored potent antiretroviral therapy trial ( `` parent '' trial ) may enter study . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 06/06/00 : Patients already enrol AACTG-sponsored study change treatment due virologic failure may also enter study . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 11/15/01 : Patients start new potent antiretroviral regimen part clinical care , enrol potent antiretroviral treatment trial , change potent antiretroviral therapy clinical care ongoing antiretroviral treatment trial virologic failure may enter study . ] Patients receive treatment undergo various procedure aim characterize effect antiretroviral therapy CSF viral load cognitive function . Procedures include : 1 ) venipuncture measure plasma HIV-1 RNA DNA level , CD4+ T cell count , cytokine immune activation marker associate HIV-1 neurological disorder ; 2 ) neuropsychological examination measure cognitive function ; 3 ) lumbar puncture obtain CSF sample , use determine pharmacokinetics antiretroviral agent CSF determine level blood cell , cytokine immune activation marker , HIV-1 RNA DNA . An entry visit must occur initiate potent antiretroviral therapy parent trial [ AS PER AMENDMENT 06/06/00 : change antiretroviral regimen due virologic failure ongoing trial ] . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 11/15/01 : Patients register initiate new potent antiretroviral regimen . ] Subsequent visit occur within 21 day prior lumbar puncture Weeks 24 52 . If evaluation , procedure , assay give patient 's parent trial [ AS PER AMENDMENT 11/15/01 : coenrollment AACTG study ] occur time specify study , duplicate study . Other visit may occur patient change antiretroviral treatment discontinues parent trial [ AS PER AMENDMENT 11/15/01 : discontinues potent antiretroviral therapy ] .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Are HIVpositive . Have level CD4 cell ( immune cell fight infection ) less 200 cells/mm3 viral load ( level HIV blood ) great 2,000 copies/ml viral load great 50,000 copies/ml CD4 cell level . Are either : 1 ) start new potent antiretroviral therapy HIV ; 2 ) enrol potent antiretroviral trial ; 3 ) currently participate ongoing antiretroviral trial clinical care change treatment due treatment failure . The entry visit ACTG 736 must occur start treatment change new treatment . ( This study change include patient change treatment due treatment failure start new antiHIV regimen . ) Exclusion Criteria Have infection cancer brain certain disease brain nervous system . Have serious psychiatric illness ( schizophrenia severe depression ) . Have complete treatment significant infection within 4 week begin study ( certain drug fight infection allow study ) . Are take drug prevent dissolve blood clot . Abuse drug alcohol .</criteria>
