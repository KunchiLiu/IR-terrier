	<brief_summary>Chronic Inflammatory Demylinating Polyneuropathy ( CIDP ) autoimmune condition affect nervous system . Researchers believe immune system begin attack cell cover nerve call myelin . The destruction myelin cause muscle weakness , loss sensation , abnormal level protein fluid surround brain ( CSF ) , slow nervous system . The disease progress slowly disables patient suffer . CIDP treat steroid , plasmapheresis , immunosuppressive drug . Many patient initially respond treatment , develop resistance therapy experience side effect cause treatment stop . Researchers believe intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg ) may provide patient CIDP safer effective alternative standard therapy disease . IVIg drug use successfully treat immune-related disease nervous system . However , IVIg expensive , researcher believe first proven effective small group patient . The study take 60 patient CIDP divide two group . Group one receive 2 injection IVIg month three month . Group two receive 2 injection placebo `` inactive injection sterile water '' month three month . Following three month treatment , group one begin take placebo group two begin take IVIg additional 3 month . The drug consider effective patient receive experience significant improvement ( &gt; 25 % ) muscle strength .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravenous Immunoglobulin ( IVIg ) Treatment Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy ( CIDP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic inflammatory demyelinate polyneuropathy ( CIDP ) slowly progressive disable neuropathy characterize subacute onset muscle weakness , distal sensory deficit , elevate spinal fluid protein , slow nerve conduction velocity without conduction block . A monoclonal gammopathy time present serum patient . Because immune-mediated mechanism peripheral nerve myelin think primarily responsible clinical manifestation CIDP , treatment choice corticosteroid , plasmapheresis immunosuppressive drug . Although many patient initially respond agent , large number become resistant develop unacceptable side effect necessitate discontinuation . The need effective safe immunotherapy CIDP patient prompt present study use high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg ) . IVIg immunomodulating agent recently show effective safe treatment number patient immune-related neuromuscular disease . This double blind , randomize , placebo control , trial involve 60 patient , half receive IVIg half placebo ( D5/W ) . Because IVIg prohibitively expensive , control trial need provide convince evidence efficacy , ensure benefit due spontaneous improvement observer bias . The dose IVIg 2 GM/Kg divide two daily dos administer monthly six month . The drug consider effective patient experience increase 25 % baseline muscle strength . Muscle strength assess series objective dynamometric measurement perform monthly infusion .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Selected patient CIDP without associate monoclonal gammopathy . Subjects clinical evidence peripheral neuropathy muscle weakness sensory deficit . Subjects evidence clinical , histological family history another neuromuscular illness . Subjects elevation CSF protein course disease . Subjects demyelination nerve conduction study and/or nerve biopsy . Suitable candidate IVIg patient active , bonefide CIDP : 1. treated steroid : ) response incomplete response ( define continue muscle weakness ) highdose therapy b ) good response steroid inability taper dose without flare disease activity c ) unacceptable steroid side effect gastrointestinal hemorrhage , osteonecrosis , hyperglycemia , extreme weight gain etc . 2. additionally treat one immunosuppressive agent consider effective CIDP patient , azathioprine , chlorambucil , cyclophosphamide , cyclosporine plasmapheresis without benefit unacceptable side effect necessitated discontinuation . Subjects pregnant nursing . Subjects critically ill require intravenous pressor maintenance cardiac output , patient unstable respiratory insufficiency patient severe muscle weakness require help basic self care ( Karnofsky performance scale le 50 ) . No subject 18 year age . Patients severe renal hepatic disease severe COPD coronary artery disease . Patients allergic IVIg know IgA deficiency .</criteria>
