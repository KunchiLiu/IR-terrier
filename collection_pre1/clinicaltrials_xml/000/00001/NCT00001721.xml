	<brief_summary>Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome ( SLOS ) genetic disorder ( autosomal recessive ) cause abnormality production cholesterol . The disorder occur `` mild '' `` severe '' form . SLOS associate multiple birth defect mental retardation . Some birth defect include ; abnormal facial feature , poor muscle tone , poor growth , shorten life span , abnormality heart , lung , brain , gastrointestinal tract , limb , genitalia , kidney . There known cure SLOS recently patient treat increased amount cholesterol diet . The cholesterol person diet unable correct abnormality patient 's organ , researcher hope improve growth failure mental retardation . This study develop answer question cause complication SLOS , well effectiveness cholesterol treatment . The study enroll patient diagnose SLOS , mother . The objective study address follow question : 1 . &lt; TAB &gt; What prognosis / natural history demyelination nervous system patient SLOS ? 2 . &lt; TAB &gt; Do patient SLOS problem concern function endocrine system ? 3 . &lt; TAB &gt; What genetic make-ups patient SLOS ? 4 . &lt; TAB &gt; Can study cholesterol metabolism genetic testing , use SLOS fibroblast , increase understand SLOS ? &lt; TAB &gt;</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome ( SLOS ) autosomal recessive multiple congenital anomaly/mental retardation syndrome . Typical clinical feature include distinctive facial appearance , mental retardation , autistic behavior , hypotonia , failure feed , poor growth , decrease life span , variable structural anomaly heart , lung , brain , gastrointestinal tract , limb , genitalia kidney . The SLOS phenotypic spectrum broad variable . At severe end spectrum SLOS lethal disorder multiple major congenital anomaly ; whereas , mild case SLOS present combination minor physical stigma , behavioral problem , learn disability . SLOS due inborn error cholesterol biosynthesis . Biochemically , SLOS patient deficiency 3beta-hydroxysterol delta ( 7 ) -reductase activity . 3beta-hydroxysterol delta ( 7 ) -reductase NADPH dependent microsomal enzyme catalyze reduction C7 ( 8 ) double bond 7-dehydrocholesterol ( 7-DHC ) yield cholesterol last step cholesterol biosynthesis via Kandutsch-Russel pathway . This inborn error cholesterol biosynthesis result elevate tissue serum 7-DHC level typically decrease serum tissue cholesterol level . In 1998 established deficiency 3beta-hydroxysterol delta ( 7 ) -reductase activity due mutation 3beta-hydroxysterol delta ( 7 ) -reductase gene ( DHCR7 ) . Once biochemical defect SLOS identify , dietary cholesterol supplementation propose employ therapeutic approach . Although developmental malformation remain fixed , dietary cholesterol supplementation appear improve overall health patient , initial result show dietary cholesterol supplementation positive impact behavioral manifestation disorder . Although understanding disorder advance last year , many question remain concern effectiveness cholesterol replacement therapy , long term prognosis individual dietary cholesterol supplementation , need adjunctive measure clinical management SLOS patient . We propose answer question continue longitudinal natural history/prognosis study patient SLOS . The objective study follow : 1 . To establish natural history , thus prognosis , cohort SLOS patient dietary cholesterol supplementation. &lt; TAB &gt; &lt; TAB &gt; &lt; TAB &gt; &lt; TAB &gt; 2 . To provide baseline information SLOS patient cholesterol supplementation order design interpret future adjunctive therapy . 3 . To function screen protocol recruit patient therapeutic investigative trial . This protocol provide phenotypic evaluation , obtain skin fibroblast , initial laboratory testing , genotyping . This protocol also provide alternative patient exclude , elect participate future therapeutic trial . 4 . To maintain large , diverse well-characterized SLOS cohort investigate new area clinical concern arise . 5 . To establish genotype/phenotype correlation SLOS , continue define SLOS clinical spectrum determine factor may significantly influence specific patient phenotype . 6 . To use vitro vivo study cholesterol metabolism understand molecular , biochemical , cellular process underlie clinical problem encounter SLOS . 7 . To use new modality magnetic resonance imaging ( Quantitative MRS Diffusion Tensor Imaging ) correlate finding biochemical measure neurocognitive testing .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Any patient biochemically confirm SLOS accept study . Patients age , either gender , ethnicity accept study . No exclusion make base race gender . Historically , males female diagnose SLOS . This bias likely result fact genital hypoplasia readily apparent male , therefore clinical diagnosis easy make male patient . SLOS syndrome appear commonly individual Northern European ancestry . Out 150 biochemically proven case , one African American patient Asian descent report . One SLOS mutant allele ( R404C ) appear present individual French Canadian Creole heritage . This likely represent founder effect . One puzzle find carrier rate common SLOS mutant allele Black Canadians Ontario African Americans Pennsylvania appear approximately 0.7 % . However , clinical case appear rare . The predominance Caucasians report literature may represent bias ascertainment disorder , variable presentation different ethnic group , founder effect ethnic group . Because function referral center respect recruitment , ethnic background population likely go reflect overall population diagnose case . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients exclude travel NIH medical condition . Pregnant woman exclude , negative urine pregnancy test require menstruating woman .</criteria>
