	<brief_summary>Approximately 40 % patient myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) die consequence cytopenia . As aplastic anemia , cytopenia MDS may partly due cytotoxic T cell activity . Immunosuppressive therapy may therefore reverse cytopenia . In phase II pilot study anti-thymocyte globin ( ATG ) treat myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) ; 41 % patient ( 61 % patient refractory anemia ) respond term transfusion independence . Recently , Jonasova et al [ 32 ] report 82 % substantial hematological response rate 18 patient MDS refractory anemia ( RA ) subtype treat cyclosporine alone . Just 50 % patient series MDS hypocellular type . Cyclosporine alone indeed efficacious would powerful therapeutic option could readily use hematologist community treat patient MDS . This efficacy need proven large study include patient subtypes MDS patient non-hypocellular form MDS ( constitute approximately 70 % case community ) . As MDS heterogeneous group disorder , randomize comparison immunomodulating intervention proven benefit , ATG , appropriate . In randomized study patient MDS receive either ATG alone cyclosporine alone .</brief_summary>
