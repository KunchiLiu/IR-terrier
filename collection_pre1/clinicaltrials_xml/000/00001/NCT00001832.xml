	<brief_summary>This experiment test safety effectiveness treatment melanoma certain lymphocyte ( type white blood cell ) take patient , grown laboratory , return patient 's immune system weaken immune-suppressing drug . Some patient also receive interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) , drug may enhance activity re-infused lymphocyte . Patients metastatic melanoma ( melanoma whose tumor spread ) treat unsuccessfully gp100 vaccination may participate study . They undergo apheresis tumor biopsy , , collect lymphocyte . In apheresis , whole blood drawn needle arm . A machine separate blood component remove white cell . The rest blood return donor needle arm . A biopsy surgical procedure remove small piece tumor tissue . Several week lymphocyte collect , patient receive injection growth colony stimulate factor ( G-CSF ) every day five day . This drug stimulate white cell production , permit many cell possible obtain collection . The lymphocyte grow large number laboratory . Seven day cell re-infused , patient admit hospital catheter ( small tube ) place large vein chest neck . Two drug , cyclophosphamide fludarabine , give tube . These drug suppress immune system interfere work reinfused lymphocyte . The lymphocyte inject catheter 30-minute period . After infusion , patient receive IL-2 give drug high dose 15-minute period every eight hour five day . Patients whose condition permit high-dose IL-2 , heart condition lung problem , may receive low-dose regimen , drug give shot skin thigh abdomen five day follow 2-day break , continue total six week . These patient receive high dose first week half dose next five week . Blood tissue sample take study evaluate size tumor ass treatment . If , 3-5 week therapy complete , patient 's tumor stabilize shrunk , entire treatment , except chemotherapy , may repeat two time .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Patients must evaluable metastatic melanoma refractory standard therapy . Age great equal 16 year . Patients gender must willing practice birth control four month receive preparative regimen . Clinical performance status Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) 0 , 1 entry trial time chemotherapy induction . Absolute neutrophil count great 1000/mm^3 . Platelet count great 100,000/mm^3 . Hemoglobin great 8.0 g/dl . Serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) /aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) less two time upper limit normal . Serum creatinine less equal 1.6 mg/dl . Total bilirubin less equal 1.6 mg/dl , except patient Gilbert 's Syndrome must total bilirubin less 3.0 mg/dl . More four week must elapse since prior therapy time patient receives preparative regimen . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test potentially dangerous effect preparative chemotherapy fetus . Life expectancy great three month . No steroid therapy require . Seronegative human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) antibody . ( The experimental treatment evaluate protocol depends intact immune system . Patients HIV seropositive decrease immune competence thus less responsive experimental treatment susceptible toxicity . ) Seronegative hepatitis B antigen . Patients receive high dose interleukin 2 ( IL2 ) must active systemic infection , coagulation disorder major medical illness cardiovascular , respiratory immune system . Patients receive high dose IL2 part phase I portion study randomize must eligible receive high dose IL2 . Any patient receiving IL2 must sign durable power attorney .</criteria>
