	<brief_summary>Asthma third lead cause preventable admission hospital United States . Deaths diseases associate asthma increase every year . Asthma disorder airway inflammation . There several factor think play role process inflammation . In study researcher particularly interested study factor know TNF ( tumor necrosis factor ) sit factor attache call receptor . Another factor associate receptor processing call aminopeptidase-like protein . It may involve relationship TNF , 's receptor , inflammation . In order understand relationship factor , researcher plan simulate allergic reaction lung airways patient participate study . By collect study factor cause airway inflammation . Samples collect patient asthma compare sample volunteer without asthma . Patients volunteer participate study directly benefit research . However , study may help researcher understand cause process involve asthma . In addition , study may lead development new treatment asthma airway inflammation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal exploratory study assess role novel aminopeptidase-like protein induction airway inflammation asthma . This aminopeptidase-like protein may involve process type I TNF receptor soluble form . We propose study role aminopeptidase-like protein set late phase asthmatic airway inflammatory response follow segmental allergen challenge mild allergic asthmatic .</detailed_description>
