	<detailed_description>Study Aim One : To develop validate objective procedure quantify efferent response non-invasive laryngeal mechanical aerodynamic stimulation . Study Aim Two : To develop validate objective test brain stem evoke response laryngeal stimulation use electrical stimulation superior laryngeal nerve . Study Aim Three : To determine whether individual idiopathic voice disorder abnormal conditioning response laryngeal mechanical aerodynamic stimulation . Study Aim Four : To determine whether individual idiopathic voice disorder abnormal brain stem response laryngeal stimulus . Study Aim Five : To evaluate whether sensory input play role symptom generation laryngeal motor control disorder , temporary bilateral ISLN blockade use idiopathic voice disorder . Study Aim Six : To evaluate whether central pathophysiology involve motor response sensory stimulation alter botulinum toxin injection individual spasmodic dysphonia . Study Aim Seven : To evaluate central response laryngeal afferent stimulation normal volunteer patient idiopathic voice disorder rest vocalization use magnetoencephalography . These study develop improve non-invasive technique diagnosis laryngeal sensory disorder determine abnormality sensory feedback modulation involve idiopathic voice disorder . Such finding lead improve understanding pathophysiology differential diagnosis idiopathic voice disorder may ultimately improve treatment approach disorder .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Normal Volunteers : Normal volunteer age 20 80 year age select screen examination . Subjects without cardiac , pulmonary , neurological , otolaryngological , psychiatric speech hearing problem determine medical history examination otolaryngologist . None subject include study reduction range vocal fold movement nonspeech task whistle suggest either paralysis paresis , joint abnormality neoplasm . EXCLUSION CRITERIA Normal Volunteers : Any patient history airway obstruction exclude study . No smoker tobacco user include study . Subjects history psychiatric disorder , care psychiatrist , medication treatment psychiatric disorder exclude study . Examples psychiatric disorder exclude : somatoform disorder , conversion disorder , currently treatment major depression , history schizophrenia bipolar disorder . However , history previous episode minor reactive depression would exclude person participation . Any individual : 1 ) implant surgical clip implant neural stimulator , implanted cardiac pacemaker autodefibrillator , cochlear implant , ocular implant , aneurysm clip , artificial heart valve , insulin pump , orthopedic pin prosthesis : 2 ) foreign body metal shaving , shrapnel , orthodontic brace , tattoos permanent eye liner ; and/or , 3 ) implant device foreign body list possibly ferromagnetic also exclude study seven contraindication magnetic resonance imaging . INCLUSION CRITERIA Patients Spasmodic Dysphonia : Symptoms present speech apparent rest . Symptoms le evident whisper , sing falsetto . Symptoms become bad prolonged speaking , practice anxiety . Reflexive emotional aspect voice function unaffected , cough , laughter cry . EXCLUSION CRITERIA Patients Spasmodic Dysphonia : Any patient history airway obstruction exclude study . Structural abnormality affect larynx vocal fold nodule , polyp , carcinoma , cyst , contact ulcer , inflammation ( laryngitis ) . Reduction vocal fold movement range nonspeech task whistle would suggest either paralysis paresis , joint abnormality neoplasm . No smoker tobacco user include study . Subjects history psychiatric disorder , care psychiatrist , medication treatment psychiatric disorder exclude study . Examples psychiatric disorder exclude : somatoform disorder , conversion disorder , currently treatment major depression , history schizophrenia bipolar disorder . However , history previous episode minor reactive depression would exclude person participation . Although patient neurological disorder exclude , certain focal dystonias occasionally occur simultaneously spasmodic dysphonia , automatically exclude patient participate . The determination make discretion Laryngeal Speech Section Team . Although structural abnormality larynx cause patient exclude , previous laryngeal surgery automatically disqualify remain measurably symptomatic voice disorder . The determination make discretion Laryngeal Speech Section Team . Patients whose symptom vary initial interview , and/or report period symptom remission atypical spasmodic dysphonia include . Patients whisper aphonia complete aphonia include . Patients constant voice quality abnormality include . Patients muscular tension dysphonia include separate subject group include spasmodic dysphonia . Spasmodic dysphonia muscular tension dysphonia disorder adult onset usually first occur 40 year age , therefore , plan include child study . INCLUSION CRITERIA Patients Adductor SD : Intermittent strain hoarseness uncontrolled voice break change pitch vowel speech . Symptoms easily hear vowel , liquid ( r l ) semivowel sound ( w ) . Intermittent hyperadduction vocal fold interfere air flow fold vowel speech , stop vocal fold vibration , result voice interruption break . When hyperadduction less severe , voice may become strained rapid change pitch may occur . In milder form disorder , intermittent irregular catch heard voice vowel every couple sentence . In moderate form , voice constantly break burst patient try force air excessively tight vocal fold . The speech intermittent hoarseness well . In severe form , individual constant strain hoarseness reduce volume little air force vocal fold . In individual voice may hear end sentence vocal fold release end speech phrase . The speech excessively slow , tight effortful . INCLUSION CRITERIA Patients Abductor SD : Prolonged vocal fold opening voiceless consonant excessive breathiness individual experience difficulty close vocal fold produce vowel follow voiceless consonant ( p , , k , , f , h , th ) . Sounds ( , h k ) come open vowel ( ah uh ) home , coffee puppy usually affect . A breathy voice quality , uncontrolled pitch elevation vowel initiation , difficulty coordinate breathe speech , complaint excessive air loss speaking . These individual usually similar problem sing normal laughter cough . In milder form intermittent prolongation voiceless consonant heard . In severe form voiceless consonant affect , speech initiation become difficult voice become breathy . In severe form adductor abductor spasmodic dysphonia , individual may resort whisper less affected much less effortful . EXCLUSION CRITERIA Patients Adductor SD : Any patient history airway obstruction exclude study . No smoker tobacco user include study . Patients cardiac , pulmonary , neurological , otolaryngological , psychiatric speech hearing problem determine medical history examination otolaryngologist . Structural abnormality affect larynx vocal fold nodule , polyp , carcinoma , cyst , contact ulcer , inflammation ( laryngitis ) . Reduction vocal fold movement range nonspeech task whistle would suggest either paralysis paresis , joint abnormality neoplasm . Patients whose symptom vary initial interview , and/or report period symptom remission atypical spasmodic dysphonia include . Patients whisper aphonia complete aphonia include . Patients muscular tension dysphonia include separate subject group include spasmodic dysphonia . EXCLUSION CRITERIA Patients Abductor SD : Any patient history airway obstruction exclude study . No smoker tobacco user include study . Patients cardiac , pulmonary , neurological , otolaryngological , psychiatric speech hearing problem determine medical history examination otolaryngologist .

Patients muscular tension dysphonia include separate subject group include spasmodic dysphonia . INCLUSION CRITERIA Patients Muscular Tension Dysphonia : 1 . Increased phonatory muscle tension paralaryngeal suprahyoid muscle palpation . 2 . Constant elevation larynx neck speech . 3 . A consistent hypertonic laryngeal posture phonation , either open posterior glottic chink arytenoid cartilages phonation , anteriorposterior squeeze ( pinhole posture ) ventricular hyperadduction . 4 . A normal appear larynx . EXCLUSION CRITERIA Patients Muscular Tension Dysphonia : 1 . Cardiac , pulmonary , neurological , otolaryngological , psychiatric speech hearing problem determine medical history examination physician . Any patient history airway obstruction exclude study . 2 . Reduction range vocal fold movement nonspeech task whistle suggest either paralysis paresis , joint abnormality neoplasm . 3 . Intermittent symptom initial interview , report period symptom remission spasmodic break voice typical either adductor abductor spasmodic dysphonia . 4 .
