	<brief_summary>This study examine cause seizures patient cysticercosis ( pork tapeworm infection ) . A good understanding could lead improve method control preventing seizure . In human , pork tapeworm ( Taenia solium ) live small intestine . The parasite 's microscopic egg travel around body-including brain-where develop cyst . Usually , cysts n't cause symptom die . Then , provoke inflammatory reaction irritates brain , cause seizure symptom . The inflammation eventually go away , dead cyst remain . Calcium deposit often form cyst . Some calcified cyst develop swell around seem associate development seizure . This study explore dead , calcified cyst continue cause seizure . In , try determine : 1 ) best diagnostic imaging method detect swell around cyst ; 2 ) often swell occurs ; 3 ) make cyst prone swell related seizure activity , others . Patients cysticercosis seizure know possible swell around calcified cyst study various test , include magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , compute tomography ( CT ) scan , electroencephalography ( EEG ) , blood test , possibly lumbar puncture . Patients study two cycle seizure ( active quiet period ) maximum 4 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Seizures common clinical manifestation cerebral cysticercosis occur presence viable , die , calcified non-calcified dead cyst . How calcified cyst provoke seizure know recent observation demonstrate edema around calcify lesion time seizure activity disappearance period seizures occur . Edema associate foci idiopathic epilepsy highly unusual observation suggest mechanism ( ) associate calcified cyst unique . Documenting understand phenomenon important number reason . First , although definition lesion inactive , e.g. , live larvae require anti-parasitic treatment , frequently mistake active lesion patient undergo unnecessary treatment . Second , likely reason perilesional edema intermittent antigen release subsequent host immune response result inflammation edema . If prove , treatment would involve suppression seizure activity anti-seizure medication also use anti-inflammatory medication corticosteroid . The present protocol systematically assess presence edema associate calcified lesion time seizure activity attempt determine calcify lesion patient focus seizures others clinically silent . There three related separate question . 1 ) What sensitive MRI technique detect edema around calcified inactive lesion ? It essential determine sensitive method initially use insensitive technique lead inaccurate assessment lesion prone lead seizure activity many patient affect . 2 ) How common perilesional edema around calcified inactive lesion associated seizure activity ? 3 ) What factor determine lesion prone cause seizure activity ? 4 ) Can perilesional edema effectively treat prevent ? 5 ) Can perilesional edema treat ? We report long term longitudinal study handful patient many lesion seem associated seizure activity edema .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 18 year age old . If child evaluate see general protocol may enter present protocol exception . Likely diagnosis inactive cysticercosis present past seizure activity . Requires `` '' `` b '' plus one remain criterion : 1 . History seizures present seizure activity ; 2 . Previously treat inactive disease decline treatment ; 3 . Single calcify lesion positive serology ; 4 . Multiple calcify lesion ; 5 . Multiple small enhance nodular lesion ; 6 . History cystic lesion respond specific chemotherapy . If female , pregnant use effective birth control method . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Less 18 year age . Pregnant unwilling use effective birth control measure . Refuse blood test . Unwilling unable undergo test accord schedule . Unable undergo MRI CT examination . Patients require anesthesia undergo image study .</criteria>
