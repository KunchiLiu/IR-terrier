	<brief_summary>This study examine whether enhance chemical acetylcholine brain improve memory attention . It identify change brain function occur cognitive task . Animal human study show decrease acetylcholine may responsible cognition deficit Alzheimer 's disease . Conversely , patient take medication slow breakdown neurotransmitter experience improvement memory . Normal volunteer patient Alzheimer 's disease may eligible study functional brain image use positron emission tomography ( PET ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . These technique measure brain activity identify brain region involve memory attention . Candidates study screen medical psychiatric history physical examination include blood test , urinalysis , chest X-ray , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . Those enrolled perform memory attention task PET MRI study . The cognition task repeat twice-once infusion saline ( fluid drug effect ) catheter insert blood vessel infusion physostigmine , drug delay breakdown acetylcholine . The PET procedure complete one day ; MRI procedure do two different day . During imaging , attention memory task present short block 4-minutes duration . They repeat sequence 10 time minute separation . Subjects show picture face visual stimulus ask decide whether picture different . Information gain study may increase knowledge acetylcholine affect brain 's response memory attention task perhaps lead good treatment cognitive deficit Alzheimer 's disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal research project determine role cholinergic neuromodulation functional organization memory attention human , use functional neuroimaging technique . The study human cognition functional brain image conjunction pharmacologic probe alter cognitive process provide opportunity examine another dimension organization human neural system . In addition identify anatomical structure participate specific cognitive function , approach reveal different neuromodulators influence processing structure . Additionally , combine use functional brain image pharmacological manipulation use evaluate role neurotransmitter dysfunction disease state produce cognitive impairment may direct u potential therapeutic approach .</detailed_description>

No subject contraindication magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , include pacemaker , cochlear implant , surgical clip metal fragment eye body part . Only subject good health without evidence significant chronic disease accept healthy control group . Only patient without evidence significant chronic disease meet standard clinical criterion diagnosis dementia Alzheimer 's disease type accept study AD group .</criteria>
