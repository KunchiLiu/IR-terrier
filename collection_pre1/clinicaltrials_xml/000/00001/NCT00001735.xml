	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety effectiveness gene therapy patient gyrate atrophy , inherit condition area retina-the inner line wall eye-become thin . Over several decade , degeneration retina cause tunnel vision , night blindness , vision problem . Gyrate atrophy cause defect gene responsible produce enzyme , ornithine aminotransferase ( OAT ) , break amino acid call ornithine . As result , excessive ornithine buildup cause retinal thinning . Currently , condition treat amino acid tablet low-protein diet limited fruit vegetable 2,000 calorie day carbohydrates fat . Some patient maintain diet , need another treatment . One possible alternative replace defective gene one function normally . Patients follow NEI 's Ocular Genetics service may eligible participate study . Study patient undergo follow gene therapy procedure : 1 . Skin biopsy-A small piece skin surgically remove patient 's thigh . 2 . Gene transfer-Skin cell call keratinocytes take biopsied tissue grown laboratory . The normal gene produce OAT inserted cell , cause produce enzyme . 3 . Skin graft-Under local anesthesia , patch skin 2 1/4 inch x 2 1/4 inch surgically remove upper thigh cell increase OAT graft back onto area . Patients follow 1 week 2 week procedure , monthly 6 month , 9 month 1 year . Follow-up continue 1-year interval patient treatment successful . During follow-up visit patient 2 3 tablespoon blood drawn test . A small biopsy ( 1/4 inch ) transplant cell also do 1 week , 1 month , 3 month , 6 month , 1 year , year thereafter . These test evaluate whether treated skin cell produce deficient OAT enzyme , , much long . They also indicate whether enzyme produce sufficient low ornithine blood level . Patients also undergo various eye examination graft schedule follow-up visit . These test may include electrophysiologic ( ERG ) testing , fundus photograph , scan laser ophthalmoscope , visual field test , fluorescein angiogram , visual acuity , manifest reaction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary purpose phase I study evaluate safety skin engraftment procedure transplant ex-vivo transduced keratinocytes patient deficiency ornithine transferase gene ( OAT ) . The safety procedure evaluate term technical complication immune response patient presence transduce keratinocytes . Adult patient gyrate atrophy , disease define deficiency OAT , follow extended period time National Eye Institute whose natural history know investigator evaluate study enrollment . Keratinocytes , previously obtain grown culture patient , transduce retrovirus manufacture GMP condition express OAT gene . The autologous transduced keratinocytes return patient upper thigh small patch prepare receive graft . At study define visit , site integrity monitor biopsy graft area perform . The biopsy provide information evaluate follow three secondary study objective : 1 ) ability keratinocytes express OAT gene , 2 ) extent duration expression , 3 ) extent activity present keratinocytes sufficient low serum level ornithine .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Elevated serum ornithine level great equal 200 micro M , measure median three value obtain monthly two month prior screen visit screen visit . Absence OAT activity measure western blot analysis isolate enzyme activity skin biopsy sample . Fundus finding indicative gyrate atrophy characterize sharply demarcate circular patch chorioretinal atrophy . Must least 18 year age . Female patient child bear potential must pregnancy test do , demonstrate negative result must agree practice effective birth control 12 month follow study initiation , patch removal , whichever come first . Must sign date inform consent willing able follow study procedure . Patients demonstrate progression ocular disease due grate atrophy evidence reduction electrophysiologic testing , visual field test progression retinal finding . Patient offer argininerestricted diet unable attain ornithine level less 200 micro M prior patch placement . Patient previously undergone skin biopsy . Not currently participate experimental protocol therapeutic trial . Does known malignancy chronic infection yield immunoincompetence . Patient must able maintain followup follow detail protocol .</criteria>
