	<brief_summary>This study design learn area brain involved experience positive negative emotion . Patients would like participate study first undergo screen process see eligible study . Patients eligible participate study go two session . During session one , researcher attempt evoke positive negative emotion show patient slides different emotion-arousing stimulus ( picture pleasant unpleasant scene ) . While patient view slide , researcher measure patient 's heart rate , sweat , eye-blinking . During session two , patient undergo MRI brain see similar emotion-arousing picture session one . In addition , patient may ask play simple computer game reward money researcher use MRI measure brain activity . Researchers hope develop method evoke positive negative emotion simultaneously ( time ) see brain activation normal volunteer , alcoholic , recover alcoholics. &lt; TAB &gt;</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Positive Negative Emotions Brain Activity Alcoholics Nonalcoholics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : The purpose protocol two-fold : 1 ) determine individual difference evoke brain response relate generalize trait personality behavior difference ( assess psychometric questionnaire instrument behavioral measure ) , 2 ) determine whether individual difference evoke brain response relate specifically genetic polymorphism gene govern neurotransmitter activity . Study population : Healthy non-alcoholic adult volunteer , healthy adolescent age 12 17 year ( without family history alcohol use disorder ) , inpatient outpatient alcoholic , recover alcoholic . Design : In event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) study attempt evoke positive negative affect via several different standardize method include : ( 1 ) picture emotion-arousing stimulus ; ( 2 ) picture emotional facial expression ; ( 3 ) cue signal reward punishment . This protocol design cover many different functional magnetic imaging study use similar technique evoke measure positive negative affect brain . Most subject participate study involve method describe protocol . Outcome measure : The outcome measure difference blood oxygenation dependent level ( BOLD ) signal measure use standard fMRI technique analyze use AFNI software .</detailed_description>
