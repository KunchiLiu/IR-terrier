	<brief_summary>This study evaluate way improve magnetic resonance angiography ( MRA ) diagnose atherosclerosis ( harden narrow artery ) . MRA new method look artery vein without standard angiography , require insert catheter blood vessel , inject contrast material , obtain X-ray image . Current MRA technique , however , depict lumen ( cavity ) small vessel well enough accurately determine extent narrow . This study test image processing method eventual goal improve MRA accuracy point replace X-ray catheter angiography diagnose atherosclerotic disease . Patients atherosclerosis conventional angiography Suburban Hospital Bethesda , MD , may consider study . They screen brief history physical examination , enrol MRA scan within 72 hour conventional angiogram . For procedure , catheter place vein patient 's arm patient lie table slide magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scanner-a large donut-shaped machine magnetic field . Surface coils-flexible , pad antenna use improve quality pictures-are wrap around patient 's leg . At time scan , patient ask hold breath several second , contrast material call gadolinium inject catheter vein . This substance enhance image blood flow vessel . The procedure generally take hour half , although actual image take small part time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Magnetic Resonance Angiography Standard Angiography Diagnosing Atherosclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Angiography ( MRA ) develop technology non-invasive evaluation arterial venous structure require x-ray base catheter angiography . While dramatic progress MRA recently make , still substantial limitation accuracy MRA grading stenosis detect small accessory vessel . The purpose study recruit patient document atherosclerotic disease confirm catheter angiography perform Suburban Hospital evaluation state-of-the-art MRA MRI unit , also Suburban Hospital . We intend test new surface coil , new pulse sequence design , advance image processing algorithms order improve MRA accuracy point large-scale study MRA vs. conventional angiography possible . The goal pilot study improve MRA point reliably replace diagnostic x-ray catheter angiography evaluation patient atherosclerotic disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient must willing participate study . Patient must document atherosclerotic disease extracranial vessel angiography perform within 72 hour MRA . Patient must refer physician care patient result provide . Patient must clinically stable judged physician able tolerate lie MR gantry 1.5 hour . Patient must serum Creatinine value less 3.0mg/dl . Must contraindication MRI include : pacemaker implant electronic device ; cochlear implant ; metal eye ; embed shrapnel fragment ; cerebral aneurysm clip ; medical Infusion pump . Must allergy Gadolinium base contrast medium . Must unsatisfactory performance status judge refer physician patient could tolerate MRI scan 1.5 hour . Examples medical condition would accept would include unstable angina , dyspnea rest , severe pain rest , severe back pain . Must intercurrent illness require treatment would jeopardize MRA scan . Subjects must require sedation MRI study administer normally conventional angiogram . Must pregnant . Must nursing mother .</criteria>
