	<detailed_description>Therapeutically , need explore potent alternative therapy patient receive , currently receive , double nucleoside analog combination include lamivudine ( 3TC ) , regimen prove clinically inferior indinavir ( IDV ) combine zidovudine/3TC study ACTG 320 . In order produce maintain maximal antiviral response , patient study receive 2 3 potent , new agent ; ABC , nucleoside analog , EFV , non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) , IDV , protease inhibitor . Virologically , major question protocol seek answer prior 3TC exposure dual nucleoside regimen influence response subsequent treatment . It unclear whether best add protease inhibitor either 1 ) NNRTI 1 2 dos , 2 ) NNRTI 1 2 dos plus new nucleoside analog achieve plasma HIV RNA level limit detection . Prior randomization , patient stratify CD4 cell count ( cells/mm3 ) : less equal 50 versus great 50 ACTG 320 participation : enrol versus enrol . Patients great 50 CD4 cells/mm3 randomize 1 4 treatment arm ( Arms I , II , III , IV ) patient less equal 50 CD4 cells/mm3 randomize 1 2 treatment arm ( Arms I II ) . All patient follow 48 week beyond enrollment last patient . The regimens treatment arm follow : Arm I - indinavir ( IDV ) plus EFV plus ABC placebo bid , Arm II - IDV ( high dose ) plus EFV ( low dose ) plus ABC , Arm III - IDV plus EFV plus ABC placebo , Arm IV - IDV ( high dose ) plus EFV ( low dose ) plus ABC . If 15 week data indicate reasonable dose regimen , sample size Arms III IV expand include additional patient CD4 count great 50 cells/mm3 allow equal enrollment across 4 treatment arm . Those patient roll ACTG 320 assign receive open-label treatment Arm II evaluate independently 4 treatment arm list . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 8/27/97 : Patients 2 consecutive HIV RNA measurement least 500 copies/ml week 16 anytime thereafter give option receive open-label treatment IDV plus EFV plus ABC , seek best available therapy outside study . NOTE : Patients choose open-label combination may take prescribed nucleoside analog provide outside study . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 12/17/97 : It strongly recommend patient reach confirm endpoint elect receive open-label therapy consider add additional approve ( novel , possible ) antiretroviral agent open-label regimen . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 1/12/98 : Patients choose open-label combination may receive approve antiretrovirals obtain outside study provide ACTG 368 team approves combination . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 8/7/98 : Subjects take study medication maximum 96 week , depend time study enrollment . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 3/10/99 : A 24-week extension , end July 30 , 1999 , add study . The extension apply subject currently blind Step 1 treatment , open-labeled Step 2 , study treatment . Subjects unblinded study treatment follow remainder extension . Subjects continue current study drug schedule . Subjects blind IDV plus EFV , upon unblinding ( failure ) decide add prescription ABC regimen , consider study treatment follow duration extension ; already register Step 2 continue Step 2 therapy . Any subject wish continue study extension unblinded original randomized regimen . Subjects experience virologic failure extension seek best available treatment follow current recommendation use many approve , novel antiretroviral agent possible . The new drug regimen may incorporate study drug . ]</detailed_description>
