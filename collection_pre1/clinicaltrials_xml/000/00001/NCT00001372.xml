	<brief_summary>This protocol evaluate patient systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) relatives learn disease develop change time . It also study genetic factor make person susceptible SLE . Patients 10 year age old know suspected SLE relative may eligible study . Patients evaluate medical history physical examination , blood urine test . Other procedure may include : 1 . Electrocardiogram 2 . 24-hour urine collection 3 . Imaging study , chest joint X-rays , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan , bone scan , bone densitometry . 4 . Questionnaire degree disease activity , survey risk factor disease complication . 5 . Apheresis Collection plasma ( fluid portion blood ) blood cell analysis . Whole blood collect needle arm vein . The blood circulates machine separate component . The required component ( plasma cell ) remove rest blood return body needle second needle arm . 6 . Skin biopsy Removal small skin sample microscopic analysis . An area skin numb anesthetic small circular portion ( 1/4 inch diameter ) remove , use sharp cookie cutter-type instrument . 7 . Kidney , bone marrow organ biopsy Removal small sample organ tissue . These biopsy do provide information useful well understanding disease make treatment decision . 8 . Genetic study Collection blood sample gene test . Patients follow least year brief history physical examination routine blood urine test . Some patient may see often . Treatment recommendation offer patient ' physician , patient eligible research treatment study invite enroll . Participating relative patient fill brief medical history questionnaire provide DNA sample ( either blood sample tissue swab inside cheek ) genetic testing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This research protocol evaluate subject systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) relatives study pathogenesis natural history disease mechanisms lead enhance organ damage . Patients evaluate history physical examination routine laboratory study obtain needed assess disease activity complication disease monitor drug-related toxicity . Blood , skin urine specimen may request research purpose , include genetic study . In addition , subset patient undergo several test understand pathogenic change affect blood vessel . Patients eligible research protocol offer opportunity participate study sign informed consent . Any medical care recommend provide patient consistent routine standard practice provide consultation patient refer physician . Blood urine sample cardiovascular test also collect perform healthy volunteer research purpose support identification validation new biomarker candidate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients know suspected SLE evaluate either outpatient inpatient research ward Clinical Center indicate . Patients select base age , race gender . However , due nature disease , patient population expect evenly distribute , since SLE predominantly disease young female , increase prevalence select racial group , particularly African Americans Hispanics . First seconddegree relative patient may recruit study genetic analysis . We ask patient permission contact his/her relative , describe detail Section IV.H . SLE suspect SLE establish ACR criterion Ability give inform consent Adult minor relative ( first second degree ) individual Included IVG ( genetic study ) Ability patient minor relative parent give informed consent EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Concomitant medical problem would confound interpretation study gather protocol . Included presence HIV blood interferes interpretation lupus study . Concomitant medical , surgical condition inadequate facility available support care NIH . CRITERIA FOR HEALTHY CONTROL SUBJECTS : Age 18 year upper age limit . For vascular study healthy control subject age gendermatched . For genetic study : Minor relative ( first second degree ) SLE subject Included section IVG . Ability give inform consent minor relative parent give inform consent ( genetic study ) . Any concomitant medical problem take medication would confound interpretation study consider EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR VASCULAR STUDIES ONLY , FOR SLE AND HEALTHY CONTROLS : Subjects contraindication MRI scan receive optional PET/MRI . These contraindication include subject follow device : Central nervous system aneurysm clip Implanted neural stimulator Implanted cardiac pacemaker defibrillator Cochlear implant Ocular foreign body ( e.g . metal shaving ) Implanted Insulin pump Metal shrapnel bullet Subjects BMI &gt; 40 also receive PET MRI . Subjects renal excretory dysfunction , estimate glomerular filtration rate &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73m ( 2 ) body surface area accord Modification Diet Renal Disease criterion , receive cardiac CT angiography , gadolinium contrast agent PET/MRI . Pregnant lactate woman exclude vascular study . Healthy control known history coronary artery disease , peripheral vascular disease atherosclerosis . Individuals young 18 year old exclude give radiation exposure well lack proper validation propose vascular function study .</criteria>
