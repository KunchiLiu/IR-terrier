	<brief_summary>This study explore cause immunodeficiency common variable immunodeficiency ( CVI ) relate immunodeficiency syndrome IgA deficiency , hyper IgM syndrome , thymoma agammaglobulinemia , hypogammaglobulinemia associate Epstein-Barr infection , others better focus correct underlie defect . Patients CVI family member may participate study . Family member must age 18 85 , good health weigh least 110 pound . Patients receive standard medical care illness . Procedures may include medical history physical examination , routine blood test , stool examination infectious agent , lung function test , chest sinus X-rays . Treatment may include administration immune serum globulin , antibiotic infection , anti-inflammatory drug , need . In addition , patient may undergo follow : - Lymphapheresis : This procedure do collect large number white blood cell ( lymphocyte ) . Blood collect needle arm vein , similar donate blood . The blood separate component centrifugation ( spin ) , white cell remove , rest blood ( red cell , plasma platelet ) return body , either needle another needle arm . - Blood draw : Blood may draw needle arm vein ( venipuncture ) . No 450 milliliter ( 15 ounce ) blood collect 6-week period adult , 7 ml ( 1 1/2 teaspoon ) per kilogram ( 2.2 pound ) body weight child time period . - Lymph node biopsy : Lymph node biopsy do require diagnostic purpose . Some biopsy tissue may keep research . Up two lymph node may remove procedure . For procedure , painkiller inject beneath skin biopsy area , node remove surgically . The incision close use dissolve suture ( stitch ) require removal . The biopsy take 30 minute . Patients hospitalize least overnight observation . - Intestinal biopsy : Endoscopy gastrointestinal biopsy do evidence malabsorption . Some biopsy tissue may keep research . Patients pre-medicated allay anxiety , fully conscious procedure . A flexible tube insert stomach small intestine mouth . The tube allow doctor see intestinal mucosa project image onto TV screen . At various place mucosal surface , small piece tissue pluck use small space tip endoscope . The procedure take 30 60 minute . Some blood collect may use genetic test . Some blood tissue sample may store future research label code , number , study team link patient . Participating family member provide medical history , pulse , blood pressure temperature take . They 10 120 ml ( 1/3 4 ounce ) blood drawn vein arm . Blood sample may take repeated occasion long relative remains study . The blood use research may involve development diagnostic test CVI , evaluation structure function normal blood cell comparison patient CVI , study try determine possible genetic factor involve susceptibility CVI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol carry laboratory study concern immunopathogenesis Common Variable Immunodeficiency ( CVI ) relate primary humoral immunodeficiency disease . Additionally , aim document track progression know complication primary immunodeficiency . Complications associate CVID include recurrent respiratory , gastrointestinal bacterial infection , pulmonary insufficiency , nodular regenerative hyperplasia , lymphoid malignancy , various autoimmune manifestation . Patients CVI relate B Cell immunodeficiency enrol natural history study . Protocol procedure include baseline measurement change lab radiographic study . Changes patient clinical state measure determine precursor disease complication . This may lead development improve preventive measure novel treatment option population .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Must verifiable diagnosis common variable immune deficiency define decrease IgG least one Ig isotype two standard deviation normal control level . Or B cell immunodeficiency relate CVI ( define selective IgA deficiency , hyper IgM syndrome , thymoma agammaglobulinemia , hypogammaglobulinemia associate EpsteinBarr virus infection ) hypogammaglobulemia associate related immunodeficiency . Must 2 year old great . Patients repeat infection suspect immunodeficiency syndrome . Patients must primary medical care provider criterion inclusion study . Patient must agree submit sample storage future study On investigator discretion unaffected family member may ask provision blood specimen clinical research purpose . Adults unable provide initial ongoing consent may participate study . When question arise regard adult ability provide initial ongoing consent , consultation NIH Ability Consent Assessment Team obtain determine capacity consent . In event adult determine unable provide initial ongoing consent appropriate surrogate may provide permission ( per NIH policy M874 ) . The subject right discontinue participation refuse participation study time without impact care treatment provide NIH protocol future participation protocol offer NIH . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Presence medical illness would preclude individual undergo routine diagnostic test test immunologic feature immunodeficiency .</criteria>
