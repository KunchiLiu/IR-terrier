	<brief_summary>This study examine feasibility use gene therapy prevent toxicity intensive chemotherapy regimen patient metastatic breast cancer . Patients wish participate gene therapy procedure offer identical chemotherapy different protocol . Patients treat initially chemotherapy active breast cancer , low potential hurt blood-forming cell . Then , patient receive high dose chemotherapy , time blood cell capable rebuild patient ' bone marrow remove patient ' bloodstream . We use blood cell collection isolate peripheral blood progenitor cell ( PBPCs ) , cell think forbear blood cell . A portion PBPCs expose disabled virus either carry genetic material refer multidrug resistance gene ( MDR1 ) . The virus transfer MDR1 gene portion patient 's PBPCs . The purpose put MDR1 gene patient ' PBPCs try make blood cell offspring resistant toxic effect certain type breast cancer chemotherapy . The MDR1 protein ( Pgp ) make MDR1 gene make cell resistant chemotherapy laboratory system pump drug cell drug able kill cell . Another portion patient PBPCs expose similar disabled virus carry different gene call NeoR gene . The NeoR gene change effect chemotherapy blood forming cell . The purpose use NeoR gene serve point comparison , see presence MDR1 drug resistance gene really help blood form cell withstand subsequent chemotherapy . Patients treat high dose another anti-breast cancer drug , one toxic bone marrow cell , patient receive frozen PBPCs , contain new gene , help recover chemotherapy . After recovery , patient treat high dos paclitaxel ( Taxol ) doxorubicin ( Adriamycin ) chemotherapy . Both drug active breast cancer , MDR1 gene may potentially protect bone marrow cell drug . Samples peripheral blood cell obtain dos chemotherapy determine whether number blood cell contain MDR1 gene comparison number contain NeoR gene increase response chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antimetabolite Induction , High-Dose Alkylating Agent Consolidation Retroviral Transduction MDR1 Gene Into Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cells Followed Intensification Therapy With Sequential Paclitaxel Doxorubicin Stage 4 Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot trial determine whether retroviral-transduced peripheral blood progenitor cell ( PBPCs ) select expanded vivo non-ablative chemotherapy patient metastatic breast cancer . It also examine feasibility administer induction high-dose therapy antimetabolite , follow consolidation use high-dose single alkylating agent therapy finally intensification therapy sequential cycle high dos natural product breast cancer chemotherapeutic agent ( paclitaxel follow doxorubicin ) . Patients receive induction therapy antimetabolite agent ( methotrexate , leucovorin 5-fluorouracil ) two four cycle . Patients receive consolidation therapy two cycle high-dose alkylating agent . First , patient receive one cycle high-dose cyclophosphamide administer growth factor support . PBPCs harvest recovery phase cyclophosphamide cycle . One-half cell reinfused transduced retroviral vector contain gene multidrug resistance protein ( MDRI vector G1MD ) half transduce vector contain neomycin resistance gene ( NeoR vector G1Na.40 ) . Both vector previously approve Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee PBPC transduction Medicine Branch protocol . The next cycle consist high-dose single agent thiotepa . Hematopoietic stem cell mobilize collect previous cyclophosphamide cycle transduce retroviral vector reinfused follow treatment thiotepa augment recovery bone marrow function . After recovery , intensification natural product chemotherapy administer , consist four cycle paclitaxel give 24-hour infusion follow four cycle single agent doxorubicin . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell monitor follow cycle paclitaxel doxorubicin presence MDRI NeoR transgene . The ration level MDRI NeoR transgenes peripheral blood determine whether vivo expansion PBPCs contain selectable MDRI marker achieve . This protocol combine several highly active chemotherapeutic agent attempt improve upon response rate achieve current combination . Patients wish participate gene therapy procedure offer identical chemotherapy different protocol .</detailed_description>
