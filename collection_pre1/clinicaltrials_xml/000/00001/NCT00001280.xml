	<brief_summary>This protocol describe prospective , randomize study examine safety efficacy Itraconazole prevent fungal infection patient Chronic Granulomatous Disease ( CGD ) . CGD genetic disorder phagocyte unable produce oxygen radical . As result , affect patient prone recurrent , severe infection bacterial fungal organism . Patients CGD 5 year age without evidence infection time study entry eligible enrollment . Patients randomize receive itraconazole placebo tablet daily , double blinded fashion . In addition itraconazole , patient receive antimicrobial prophylaxis bacterial infection , may addition receive gamma-interferon prophylaxis infection . Randomization patient stratify among patient receive receive gamma interferon . The primary endpoint study development culture histologically prove invasive fungal disease . Patients monitor every three month evidence drug toxicity . The anticipated accrual period approximately 36-48 month .</brief_summary>
