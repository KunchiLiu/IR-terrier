	<brief_summary>Tumors spine describe primary , mean tumor originate cell normally find spine , metastatic , cell another area body spread spine . Metastatic tumor common primary tumor . Tumors spine press spinal cord interfere information travel brain nerve spinal cord . As result , patient spinal tumor suffer loss movement sensation within area body tumor . In addition , tumor spine typically painful condition . Presently , treatment choice spinal tumor radiation therapy . However , many tumor spine become resistant radiation therapy . In addition , spinal cord often close tumor damage radiation . Absolute ( 100 % ) ethanol commonly know `` alcohol '' . It kind alcohol find alcoholic beverage . When pure alcohol inject directly tumor destroy cell blood vessel . Because feature , researcher would like test effectiveness alcohol treat patient spinal tumor . Researchers believe intratumoral ethanol injection treatment worth study closely minimally invasive , proven effective treatment type metastatic tumor , use repeatedly , interfere treatment surgery . In addition test effectiveness intratumoral ethanol injection , study attempt determine cause pain associated spinal tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Direct Injection Alcohol Treatment Spinal Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although radiation therapy currently treatment choice spinal metastasis , radioresistant recurrent neoplasm remain therapeutic dilemma . Because debility shorten life expectancy patient spinal metastasis , treatment minimizes blood loss , convalescence , immobility critical . The effectiveness safety intratumoral injection absolute ethanol eradicate vertebral hemangioma hepatic metastasis suggest intratumoral ethanol injection may also effective treat vertebral metastasis . Since spinal metastasis diagnose MRI produce spinal instability , may possible treat direct ethanol infusion preserve spinal stability . Direct ethanol infusion may prove especially useful treat symptomatic patient receive maximal tolerable radiation dose spinal cord . Unlike radiation , limited total radiation dosage , intraarterial alcohol , preclude multiple treatment occlude feed artery , intratumoral ethanol injection repeat necessary obliterate residual tumor . The potential neurotoxic effect ethanol avoid use CT-guidance position needle , monitor test injection contrast , inject ethanol slowly small volume . Intratumoral injection absolute ethanol warrant clinical trial minimally invasive , effective treat peripheral metastasis , use repeatedly , preclude type treatment open surgery . As well test therapeutic efficacy intratumoral ethanol spinal metastasis , protocol seek elucidate pathophysiology pain spinal metastasis . Correlation change pain change tumor size tumor pressure pre- post-ethanol injection indicate relationship pain tumor size pressure . A group 11 patient vertebral hemangiomas treated intratumoral ethanol NIH . This protocol accrue patient vertebral hemangiomas require treatment intratumoral ethanol continue post-treatment evaluation patient previously treat intratumoral ethanol NIH .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must vertebral tumor document MRI . Vertebral height must least 50 percent adjacent vertebra . Patients must symptomatic spinal tumor . Treatment attempt reduce size , eliminate , tumor relieve symptom . The treatment vertebral tumor must indicate base patient 's condition . Prior surgical radiation therapy vertebral tumor result exclusion study radiographic evidence tumor evidence persistent local pain , epidural compression , neurological deterioration relate vertebral tumor . The patient must able comprehend risk therapy must able give informed consent . Pregnancy exclude participation due radiation exposure involve protocol . Bleeding disorder exclude patient protocol unless disorder correct prior treatment . Patients must contraindications MRI scan . Patients undergo ethanol injection xray department must able lay prone least one hour intravenous sedation analgesia . Patients whose tumor respond radiation therapy candidate ethanol infusion . Patients tumor area receive maximal radiation dose spinal cord candidate ethanol infusion . Patients whose poor general condition precludes open surgery candidate ethanol infusion . Patients wish avoid morbidity potential mortality open surgery candidate ethanol injection . Patients radioresistant tumor melanoma prostate carcinoma candidate ethanol infusion even undergone prior irradiation . Patients radiationsensitive spinal tumor breast , kidney , lung carcinoma , lymphoma , myeloma , Ewing 's sarcoma , neuroblastoma , seminoma enter protocol unless tumor either respond radiation lie spinal cord level already receive maximal tolerable radiation dos . Patients less 2 month life expectancy exclude . Patients symptomatic vertebral metastasis 3 spinal level exclude . Patients asymptomatic vertebral metastasis exclude .</criteria>
