	<detailed_description>There proven therapy cryptosporidiosis person AIDS . Nitazoxanide appear good candidate drug evaluation effectiveness preclinical model , data early clinical trial safety profile . Cooperation clinical researcher basic scientist clinical trial agent HIV infection complication high priority ACTG , NIAID , NIH . Thus , important design clinical trial NTZ include cooperation basic scientist . Patients randomize active drug placebo 2:1 ratio . Patients stratify presence absence dual infection microsporidiosis screen CD4+ count ( &lt; = 50/mm3 , &gt; 50/mm3 ) . Days 1 - 21 , Arm I receive oral NTZ Arm II receive NTZ placebo po bid ( blind ) . With approval protocol chair , patient may switch open-label NTZ two week blind therapy clinical worsen diarrhea due cryptosporidiosis accompany either weight loss &gt; = 5 % requirement intravenous fluid maintain body weight and/or intravascular volume despite use appropriate antidiarrheal agent . Days 22 - 42 , Arm I Arm II receive oral NTZ ( open-label ) . Days 43 - 63 , Arm I begin maintenance phase Arm II receive oral NTZ ( open-label ) . On Day 63 Arm II start maintenance phase . In maintenance phase patient randomize 1 2 dos NTZ 24 week . Patients complete marked responder Day 42 ( Arm I ) Day 63 ( Arm II ) may receive high dose NTZ additional three week . Patients complete mark response high dose may initiate maintenance therapy . Patients continue partial response fail respond discontinue therapy .</detailed_description>
