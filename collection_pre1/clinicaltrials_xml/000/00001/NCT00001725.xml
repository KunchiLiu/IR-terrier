	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety effectiveness two drugs-dextromethorphan topiramate-in treat orofacial ( mouth face ) pain . Dextromethorphan , commonly use cough suppressant , topiramate , anti-seizure medicine , block certain receptor brain spinal nerve cell may cause cell produce electrical discharge pain . Patients 18 year age old oral facial pain trigeminal nerve damage pain daily least 3 month may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood test psychiatric evaluation . These result serve baseline value participant . Those enrolled study take either dextromethorphan topiramate 2-part study follow : Dextromethorphan In Part 1 , patient take dextromethorphan lorazepam ( commonly use anti-anxiety drug ) separately two 6-week period . ( Lorazepam use study `` active placebo '' comparison dextromethorphan . An active placebo drug work problem study whose side effect like test drug . ) They take dextromethorphan 4 week determine maximum tolerate dose ( high dose cause trouble side effect ) stay dose remain 2 week . Then repeat process lorazepam . Patients respond either drug may continue Part 2 study , compare two drug four time confirm response see Part 1 . In Part 2 , maximum tolerate dose determined 2-week period dose continue another 2 week . This procedure repeat eight time . Throughout study , patient keep daily pain diary . They contact telephone 2 3 time week dose escalation check side effect . At end two 6-week period Part 1 end 4-week period Part 2 study , patient 1-hour clinic visit . Participants live hour ' drive NIH full telephone follow-up evaluation instead clinic visit . Topiramate Patients receive topiramate follow plan similar describe dextromethorphan , following exception . They take topiramate inactive placebo ( look-alike pill active ingredient ) two separate 12-week period . Patients ' maximum tolerate dose determine first 8 week stay dose remain 4 week period . Patients respond medication Part 1 may continue Part 2 confirm response . Part 2 consists six 6-week period . The first 4 week use determine maximum tolerate dose patient remain dose next 2 week . Patients keep daily pain diary contact phone 2 3 time week dos increase . Patients complete Part 2 topiramate study may participate another phase study last 2 year . Those continue phase take topiramate 2-year period . They follow regularly study nurse come NIH every 6 month follow-up visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Studies Dextromethorphan Topiramate Treat Oral Facial Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Some clinical feature trigeminal facial neuralgia suggest painful disorder may associate sensitization central nervous system neuron . Laboratory evidence show central sensitization produce maintained excitatory amino acid ( e.g . glutamate ) act neuron NMDA AMPA/kainate receptor site . Given information , need effective treatment orofacial neuropathic pain syndrome , two possible candidate worthy study 1 ) dextromethorphan , NMDA receptor antagonist 2 ) topiramate , anticonvulsant drug AMPA/kainate receptor block activity . Thus , purpose study evaluate efficacy safety topiramate ( TPM ) high-dose dextromethorphan ( DM ) versus placebo treatment pain patient trigeminal neuralgia ( TN ) orofacial neuropathic pain syndrome . We propose two 6 month study respectively evaluate dextromethorphan ( 60 patient ; least 20 TN , 20 definite trigeminal nerve pathology 20 likely trigeminal nerve pathology ) topiramate ( 40 patient ; least 20 TN , 20 definite trigeminal nerve pathology ) . These double-blind randomized crossover design compare high-dose dextromethorphan ( DM ) versus lorazepam ( LOR ) ( active placebo ) OR topiramate versus inactive placebo . The primary study outcome measure ( part ) overall daily pain assess Gracely pain intensity descriptor . Other record data include adverse drug effect , frequency , severity duration pain paroxysms questionnaire focus daily function ( modification Brief Pain Inventory ) .</detailed_description>

Patients must moderate severe heart disease ( MI within precede year , unstable angina congestive heart failure ) . No sign symptoms central neurologic disorder ( include seizure ) . No psychological/psychiatric disorder identify prestudy entry psychiatric assessment . Patients must hypersensitivity intolerance dextromethorphan , topiramate active placebo . No chronic substance abuse , include alcoholism . Patients must primary physician . Subjects must receive experimental drug use experimental device within 30 day .</criteria>
