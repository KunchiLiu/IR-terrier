	<brief_summary>Pharmacokinetics term use body affect drug take . Vitamin C , also know ascorbic acid , essential water soluble vitamin . Meaning , body make Vitamin C must take diet . In study researcher attempt determine amount water consume affect level vitamin C blood ( specifically plasma component blood ) . In study researcher take 13 subject place Vitamin C restrict diet . Vitamin C level measure twice week outpatient basis subject reach desire low level Vitamin C ( 12-15 micromolar plasma ascorbic acid concentration ) . Subjects admit undergo 24 hour blood urine collection . Following collection sample , subject begin receive Vitamin C orally ( mouth ) intravenously ( injected vein ) . The dosage Vitamin C gradually increase 30 mg-2500 mg divide two daily dos . Blood urine sample collect time dose increase . The study take approximately 18 week subject discharge healthy condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Vitamin C ( ascorbic acid , ascorbate ) essential water soluble vitamin . Our study NIH first demonstrate healthy men woman change vitamin concentration human plasma vary direct function amount ingest , wide range . ln present study , plan achieve prescorbutic vitamin C plasma concentration approximately 5-10 micromolar healthy human volunteer . We gradually replete subject incremental dos vitamin C measure plasma , red blood cell , leukocyte concentration change function dose . We also determine whether change vitamin C concentration result change gene expression metabolic profile ( metabolomics , lipidomics , proteomics ) . Outpatient subject encourage consume vitamin C food . As inpatient , vitamin C deficiency induce placing subject tightly restrict scorbutic diet . Plasma vitamin C monitor several time per week . When subject achieve plasma ascorbate concentration 5-10 micromolar , blood sample urine collection 24 hour perform . After platelet leukocytes collect , ascorbate repletion begin . Escalating dos ascorbate administer orally intravenously remainder inpatient admission . Total daily dose 30mg , 60mg , 100mg , 200mg , 400mg , 1000mg 2500mg give two divided dos . Bioavailability ascorbate determine dosage increment . When plasma ascorbate concentration reach steady state dose , subject undergo 36 hr plasma sample time 48 hr urine collection . At steady state 4 5 dos , apheresis procedure perform collection platelet leukocytes . lt anticipated subject discharge healthy condition 20-26 week .</detailed_description>
