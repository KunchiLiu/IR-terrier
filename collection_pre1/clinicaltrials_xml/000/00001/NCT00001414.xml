The goal research study determine genetics influence heritable personality trait . The work focus genetics affect chemical messenger brain cell use communicate ( neurotransmitter ) . The study involve collect personality data DNA sample related individual , primarily male sibling female sibling , also include parent .

	<detailed_description>Building family , twin adoption study suggest substantial aspect personality heritable , research protocol explore potential genetic influence normal personality dimension . We previously report association variation neurotransmitter system gene variation personality trait , across within family , sample general population . This study involve collect personality data DNA sample related individual , primarily male sibling female sibling , also include parent . Genetic test perform sample continue focus variation gene , potentially affect brain neurotransmission . In case , participant recontacted specifically investigate whether identified variation neurotransmitter system gene actually affect neurotransmission . Large population sample need research , particularly since new epidemiologically standard population sample obtain . This research potential advance knowledge genetic influence human behavior may relevant normal personality psychopathology .</detailed_description>
