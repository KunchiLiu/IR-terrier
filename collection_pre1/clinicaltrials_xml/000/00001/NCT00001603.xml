	<brief_summary>The goal study learn tumor upper airway digestive passage ( tongue , throat , mouth , voicebox ) affect body 's immune defense energy storage . Previous study show tumor vocal tract produce signal could help tumor escape body 's immune defense use body 's energy mineral store grow . Researchers hop learn signal give tumor cell advantage live grow , tumor cell control signal , signal affect rest body . This study look close researcher belief tumor vocal tract contain gene ( genetic information ) abnormally function allow tumor survive grow attack body 's normal immune system Patients cancerous tumor ( squamous cell carcinoma ) benign ( non-cancerous ) tumor ( papilloma ) upper aerodigestive tract candidate standard investigational therapy eligible participate study . Tumor cell collect patient participate study , undergo standard surgical treatment biopsy condition . Once tumor cell collect analyzed genetic make-up . In addition , patient undergo several test use skin , blood , urine look closely function immune system metabolism .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Upper Airway Digestive Tract Tumors Immune System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients squamous cell carcinoma papilloma upper aerodigestive tract candidate standard investigational therapy eligible participate pilot immunopathogenesis study . Patients neoplasms exhibit alteration immune metabolic regulation . These alteration immunoregulation show affect prognosis , thus far obstacle successful development active immunization cytokine immunotherapy attempt order improve preservation organ function survival . This pilot study explore basis alteration immune metabolic regulation patient tumor . Similar alteration immunity metabolism usually occur response injury infection , mediate expression immunoregulatory signal . The study evaluate hypothesis regulatory structural gene involve immunoregulation abnormally express within tumor signal promote tumor development progression confer selective growth survival advantage . The expression activity immunoregulatory gene signal express neoplastic non-neoplastic cell within tumor analyze use tumor cell leukocytes derived patient specimen obtain clinically indicated biopsy surgical therapy . Tumor keratinocyte cell line establish analysis differential gene cytokine expression neoplastic cell , lymphocyte cell line establish test culture signal condition stimulate regulatory effector immune response patient lymphocyte vitro . The potential factor identify promote alter immune metabolic function evaluate patient skin , blood urine immune metabolic assay perform tumor resection cytoreduction . Patients participate investigation would expect benefit receipt standard therapy would encumber minimal additional risk beyond procedure standard investigational therapy patient ask consent . Twenty patient squamous cell carcinoma papilloma accept undergo standard therapy protocol , twenty patient may accept study undergoing therapy approve investigational protocol ( ) . Twenty age-matched clinical research volunteer evaluate control subject skin , blood urine test .</detailed_description>
