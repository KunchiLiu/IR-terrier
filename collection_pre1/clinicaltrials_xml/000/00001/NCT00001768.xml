	<brief_summary>Recent research study early onset-obsessive compulsive disorder ( OCD ) Tourette 's syndrome question whether autoimmunity could play role development condition . As result , increased interest field research potential involvement autoimmunity psychiatric condition like schizophrenia . Autoimmune condition occur normal immune system body begin work . The immune system recognize cell foreign begin attack . There several similarity autoimmune disease schizophrenia . Genetics play role development disease . Both condition show similar course , condition tend show worsening symptom expose stress . Previous research study show intravenous immunoglobulin safe effective use neurologic disease involve immune system . Presently NIMH test effectiveness IVIg OCD Tourette 's syndrome . Intravenous Immunoglobulin IVIg medication use treat disease like Kawasaki disease , systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis , lupus nephritis , idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura . The drug modify body 's natural immune reaction . This research study 13-week trial intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg ) patient suffer childhood-onset schizophrenia , fail respond therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recent development study early-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) Tourette 's syndrome implicate autoimmune etiology subset condition , renew interest possibility autoimmune pathophysiology underlie psychiatric disorder . There several clinical epidemiologic similarity autoimmune disease schizophrenia : genetic predisposition , twin concordance 50 % ; wax wan course ; exacerbation symptom precipitation relapse psychosocial stress . However , mixed evidence engender considerable debate literature regard role immune mechanism schizophrenia . The clinical efficacy safety intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg ) immune-mediated neurological disease document , clinical study efficacy IVIg treatment Tourette 's syndrome OCD currently ongoing NIMH ( see protocol 92-M-0132 ) . In protocol , propose 13-week placebo-controlled double-blind crossover study IVIg 25 patient suffer treatment-refractory childhood-onset schizophrenia . After first 5 patient complete trial , data present NIMH Institutional Review Board decision make whether trial proceed .</detailed_description>
