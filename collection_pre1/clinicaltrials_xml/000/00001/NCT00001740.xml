	<brief_summary>Quantitative measurement leave ventricular volume ejection fraction useful management patient heart disease . Several image method exist , limited cost , invasiveness , exposure radio-isotopes . Conventional echocardiography noninvasive method allow estimation leave ventricular size function ; however , quantitative measurement volume widely use due lack reproducibility inaccurate measurement . Real-time three-dimensional echocardiography new technique use derive volume measurement single image acquisition . We hypothesize real-time three-dimensional echocardiography accurate method making leave ventricular volume measurement . We therefore propose measure leave ventricular volume use real-time three-dimensional echocardiography human subject correlate measurement magnetic resonance imaging , accurate noninvasive method obtain measurement .</brief_summary>
