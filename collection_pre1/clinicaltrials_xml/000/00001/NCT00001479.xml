	<brief_summary>Major depression represent major public health problem worldwide U.S. Fifteen percent U.S. population depression point life ( 40 million individual ) . The condition common woman , occur female male ratio 5:2 . Presently , 6-8 % outpatient primary care meet diagnostic criterion major depression . Fifteen percent untreated patient depression commit suicide . Most people commit suicide depress . Researchers believe year 2020 suicide 10th common cause death U.S . In addition mortality due suicide , depression also associate severe health condition . Areas brain ( hippocampus ) begin deteriorate , heart disease , decrease bone mineral density ( osteoporosis ) associate major depression . Researchers believe year hormone control hypothalmus , pituitary gland , adrenal gland ( commonly refer HPA axis system ) way associate psychiatric illness like depression . According previous study , researcher theorize increased activity HPA axis associate depressed patient typical melancholic feature . Melancholia refers feeling anhedonia ( absence pleasure activites would normally think pleasurable ) , insomnia ( inability sleep ) , guilt , psychomotor change . On hand decrease activity HPA axis may associate atypical feature depression . This study already develop refined study improve understanding HPA axis healthy human depressed patient . Researchers already identify plan continue identify distinct subtypes depressive disorder base activity HPA axis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Major depression represent major public health problem worldwide U.S. Fifteen percent U.S. population depression point life ( 40 million individual ) , female male ratio 5:2 . Presently , 6-8 % outpatient primary care meet diagnostic criterion major depression . Fifteen percent untreated depressed patient commit suicide-most suicide depression . In U.S. , year 2020 suicide 10th cause death . In addition mortality due suicide , major depression associate severe morbidity , include decreased hippocampal volume , cardiovascular illness , decrease bone mineral density . Moreover , myocardial infarction , patient depression high mortality rate without depression ( adjust risk ratio 4:29 ) . Because morbidity differentially affect either increase decreased level hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) function , necessary study HPA function population . Additionally , base previous data , hypothesize depressed patient melancholic feature would increase HPA function , atypical feature would decrease HPA function . Using protocol , past four year develop , refine , repeatedly conduct detailed patient-oriented study expand frontier exist knowledge HPA regulation healthy human depressed subject . This protocol already demonstrate existence two distinct biological subtypes major depression , important find decrement HPA function patient atypical feature . Thus , atypical classification restrict phenotype represent subtype specific biological characteristic . This finding show unique strategy , target , potential interventional approach patient either atypical melancholic feature . The elucidation neuroendocrinology major depression key goal branch , protocol offer potential unravel biology phenotypically distinct subtypes major depression . Moreover , elucidation medical consequence major depression require precise longitudinal characterization HPA function accomplish study .</detailed_description>
