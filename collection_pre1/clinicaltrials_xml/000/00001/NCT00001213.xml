	<brief_summary>Cystinosis inherit disease result poor growth kidney disease , among thing . The damage kidney organ think due accumulation cystine inside cell various body tissue . This chemical also accumulate cornea-the cover eye pupil iris . After 10 20 year , corneas patient become packed crystal surface may become irregular , occasionally cause small , painful break . Patients enrol NIH study cystinosis receive drug cysteamine . Taken mouth , drug reduces cystine tissue , cornea . This study begin 1986 test whether cysteamine eye drop could prevent reduce corneal cystine crystal patient . The drop effective remove crystal reduce pain patient take medication direct . Patients take medication prescribe benefit . After effectiveness drop proven , main purpose modify continue evaluate long-term safety effectiveness cysteamine eye drop treat cystine crystal corneas patient cystinosis drop approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . When New Drug Application ( NDA ) Sigma-Tau standard formulation grant , protocol terminate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Protocol 86-EI-0062 begin randomize , double-masked , placebo control study evaluate efficacy safety 0.5 % topical cysteamine subsequently amend natural history protocol . Additional protocol conduct National Eye Institute ( NEI ) National Institutes Health ( NIH ) begin protocol test various formulation cysteamine topical solution efficacy safety patient cystinosis . Subjects NIH protocol test various formulation ultimately transfer natural history protocol open-label treatment establish formulation within study effective . All subject enrol protocol receive effective cysteamine topical solution formulation eye . The control define natural course corneal crystal accumulation patient cystinosis . The efficacy data obtain study conduct NIH evaluate various cysteamine ophthalmic solution formulation 1986 2005 . The safety data collect 1986 termination protocol July 2013 . OBJECTIVE : The free thiol cysteamine deplete cystinotic leukocyte cell cystine , whose accumulation consider cause organ damage cystinosis . This organ damage involve tissue body . Cysteamine therapy improve growth stabilize renal function pre-renal transplant cystinosis , without substantial toxicity noticeable effect cystine crystal accumulation cornea , likely inadequate local cysteamine concentration cornea . Previous study show safety cysteamine 0.5 % topical solution benzalkonium chloride efficacy resolve cystine corneal crystal . The main purpose protocol maintain topical cysteamine treatment patient nephropathic cystinosis drop approve FDA . When NDA Sigma-Tau standard formulation grant , present protocol ( 86-EI-0062 ) terminate . STUDY POPULATION : Up 350 adult child two year old , confirmed diagnosis cystinosis enrol . STUDY DESIGN : This open label treatment protocol . Eligible subject receive drop cysteamine 0.5 % topical solution benzalkonium chloride hourly awake eye . They undergo eye examination baseline visit . They take cysteamine eye drop eye every hour waking hour . They return NIH Clinical Center follow-up safety eye examination one year baseline visit , every two year thereafter drug available commercially . OUTCOME MEASURES : The initial pre-specified primary outcome measure reduction cystine corneal crystal . The post-hoc primary outcome measure ( protocol modify ) collection safety data .</detailed_description>
