	<brief_summary>Inflammatory myopathy group muscle diseases characterized muscle weakness , high level muscle enzymes blood , inflammation tissue surround muscle fiber ( endomysium ) . The disease make inflammatory myopathy group three subset : I ) Polymyositis ( PM ) II ) Dermatomyositis ( DM ) III ) Inclusion Body Myositis ( IBM ) Inflammatory myopathy think autoimmune process treat steroid immunosuppressive drug . However , many patient initially respond treatment develop resistance therapy experience side effect cause treatment stop . Researchers believe intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg ) may provide patient PM , DM , IBM safer effective alternative standard therapy diseases . IVIg drug use successfully treat immune-related disease nervous system . The study take 60 patient divide two group . Group one receive 2 injection IVIg month three month . Group two receive 2 injection placebo `` inactive injection sterile water '' month three month . Following three month treatment , group one begin take placebo group two begin take IVIg additional 3 month . The drug consider effective patient receive experience significant improvement ( &gt; 15 % ) muscle strength .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The inflammatory myopathy group acquire muscle disease characterize subacute onset progressive proximal muscle weakness , elevate serum muscle enzyme endomysial inflammation . They comprise 3 clinically distinct subset : polymyositis ( PM ) , dermatomyositis ( DM ) Inclusion Body Myositis ( IBM ) . Because immune-mediated mechanism primarily responsible clinical manifestation condition , treatment choice corticosteroid immunotherapy drug . Although patient initially respond drug , number become resistant develop unacceptable side effect necessitate discontinuation . The need effective safe immunotherapy patient PM , DM IBM prompt present study use high dose intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg ) . IVIg immunomodulating agent show effective safe treatment number patient immune-related neuromuscular disease . This double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled study involve 30 patient , receive IVIg placebo 3 month cross-over alternate therapy another period 3 monthly infusion . The monthly dose IVIg 2 GM/Kg divide two daily dos . The drug consider effective patient experience increase 15 % baseline muscle strength . Muscle strength assess series objective dynamometric measurement perform end monthly infusion .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Selected patient PM , IBM DM . Specifically ) proximal muscle weakness ; b ) evidence clinical , histological family history another neuromuscular illness ; c ) elevation muscle enzymes course disease ; ) typical skin rash case DM ; e ) diagnostic muscle biopsy . Suitable candidate IVIg patient active , bonefide disease : 1. treated steroid : ) response incomplete response ( define continue muscle weakness ) highdose therapy b ) good response steroid inability taper dose without flare disease activity c ) unacceptable steroid side effect gastrointestinal hemorrhage , osteonecrosis , hyperglycemia , extreme weight gain etc. , 2. treat one immunosuppressive drug ( azathioprine , Methotrexate , Cyclophosphamide , Cyclosporine ) without benefit unacceptable side effect . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Pregnant nursing woman ( confirm screen pregnancy test ) . Critically ill patient require intravenous pressor maintenance cardiac output due severe cardiomyopathy , patient respiratory insufficiency patient severe muscle weakness require help basic self care . Children age 18 . Patients severe renal hepatic disease , severe COPD coronary artery disease systemic medical problem often see PM DM associate severe case lupus , rheumatoid arthritis scleroderma . Patients know allergic reaction IVIg . Serum IgA less 11mg/dl .</criteria>
