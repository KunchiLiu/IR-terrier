	<brief_summary>We investigate clinical manifestation molecular genetic defect heritable urologic malignant disorder . Families urologic malignancy know suspected genetic basis enrol . Affected individual individual suspect germline urologic malignant disorder undergo periodic clinical assessment genetic analysis purpose : 1 ) definition characterization phenotype , 2 ) determination natural history disorder , 3 ) genotype/phenotype correlation . Genetic linkage study may perform situation genetic basis disorder elucidate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Disorders investigation : Autosomal dominant inherit urologic malignant disorder include : von Hippel- Lindau ( VHL ) , hereditary papillary renal cancer ( HPRC ) , Birt Hogg Dube ( BHD ) hereditary leiomyomatosis renal cell acarcinoma ( HLRCC ) well familial renal cancer . - Studies lead identification characterization VHL , HPRC , BHD HLRCC gene . - The genetic etiology common type inherited kidney cancer , familial renal cancer ( FRC ) , remain determined . Objectives : - To characterize natural clinical history inherit urologic malignant disorder . - To determine genetic etiology hereditary urologic malignant disorder gene defect unknown , linkage analysis , positional clone evaluation candidate gene . - To correlate specific mutation associate protein domains disease phenotypic expression base parameter include present age , clinical manifestation , histopathology rate recurrence . - To identify describe yet unknown uncharacterized inherit urologic malignant disorder . Eligibility : - Individuals family member suspect established diagnosis von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) syndrome hereditary papillary renal carcinoma ( HPRC ) , Type I . - Individuals family member suspect established diagnosis inherit urologic malignancy disease gene yet know , specifically hereditary form Type II papillary renal cancer , clear cell renal carcinoma , renal oncocytoma , chromophobe renal carcinoma Birt Hogg Dube syndrome . - Individuals family member urologic malignant disease suspect , proven genetic etiology , include family one individual affect related cancer . Design : - These rare family recruit genetically confirm diagnosis , determine size location renal tumor , size presentation , growth rate metastatic potential renal tumor . - Genetic testing offer gain appreciation effect mutation relative activity various germline somatic mutation . - We determine relationship mutation disease phenotype .</detailed_description>
