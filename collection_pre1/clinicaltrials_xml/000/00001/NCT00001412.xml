	<brief_summary>There evidence suggest male sex hormone ( androgen ) play significant role brain ( central nervous system ) functioning . In study conduct animal , researcher document male sex hormone ( androgen ) associate neurotransmitter ( serotonin ) function , sexual behavior , aggression , non-reproductive behavior . Similar finding see study involve human . Androgens think involve neurologic condition . Tourette 's syndrome see often males female cause researcher look closely effect androgens brain . This study design examine effect testosterone brain ( CNS ) activity first stop testosterone release replace . Researchers evaluate mood , behavior , cognitive ( mental ) function , physiologic response serotonergic agonists regional cerebral blood flow ( r-CBF ) . This study attempt answer follow question ; 1 . Is person 's mental functioning result male female ( gender ) result hormonal condition 3 . Does decrease blood flow ( r-CBF ) specific area brain ( prefrontal cortex ) woman whose ovary release hormone ( hypogonadal state ) also occur men 4 . Will mental rotation task well identify hormone ( gonadal steroid ) differences r-CBF 5 . Do hormone directly influence responsiveness hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis 6 . Does hormonal state patient directly affect level chemical steroids cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Several type evidence suggest androgen exert clinically significant effect central nervous system ( CNS ) function . In animal study , androgen modulate brain serotonin function , regulate sexual behavior , aggression , non-reproductive behavior . These action reflect organizational activational effect androgen . Several study human also support central modulatory capacity androgens . Correlative study describe relationship plasma androgen level sexual interest/behavior cognitive task performance . Androgens believe underlie gender relate difference prevalence certain neuropsychiatric disorder , result trial anti-androgens least one disorder ( Tourette 's syndrome ) . Finally , androgens believe possess psychotropic effect human , evidence purport antidepressant effect report psychotic reaction follow administration androgen . In recent study , demonstrate androgenic/anabolic steroid precipitate mood behavioral state disturbance administer double-blind , placebo-controlled fashion normal volunteer . There remarkably study attempt identify CNS effect androgens central system may mediate effect . In study propose examine directly effect testosterone CNS activity first suppress , double-blind , placebo-controlled fashion , replace physiological level testosterone . We evaluate mood , behavior , cognitive function , physiologic response serotonergic agonists cerebral blood flow ( separate protocol ) pharmacologically control hormonal condition : hypogonadism hypogonadism testosterone replacement . On basis prior finding group others , ask follow question : 1 ) Does cognitive function differ function gender hormonal condition ; 2 ) Is decrease r-CBF observed prefrontal cortex hypogonadal state woman also demonstrable men ; 3 ) Do measure hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis responsivity differ function gender hormonal condition ; 4 ) Do CSF neurochemistry neurosteroid level differ consequence change hormonal state . This protocol provide much need information behavioral physiological effect androgens serve companion study NIMH protocol # 92-M-172 , `` The Central Nervous System Effects Pharmacologically Induced Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism without Estrogen Progressive Replacement .
