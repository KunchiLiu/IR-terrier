	<brief_summary>This project measure magnetization transfer ( MT ) parameter normal subject use two novel approach . The first investigation asymmetric MT effect respect zero on-resonance reference point . The technique measure difference MT effect two symmetrically position off-resonance MT pulse positive negative frequency range . Prior research technique kidney show difference macromolecular lineshape correlate specific metabolite . The second approach , utilizing subset acquisition first approach , test newly develop formulation calculate macromolecular fraction , fraction proton density account MT . We foresee measurement may significantly develop understand MT introduce diagnostic quantitative tool study human tissue .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Normal control age 18 70 year age capable give informed consent . Subjects must condition would preclude use technical development ( e.g . paralyzed hemidiaphragm , morbid obesity , claustrophobia , etc. ) . Subjects must condition would present unnecessary risk ( e.g . pregnancy , surgery uncertain type , symptom pheochromocystoma insulinoma , etc. ) . Lactating woman subject hemoglobinopathy , asthma , renal hepatic disease exclude study involve administration contrast agent . Must contraindication MR scan surgery involve metal clip wire might expect concentrate radiofrequency field cause tissue damage twist magnetic field . Examples include : aneurysm clip ; implant neural stimulator ; implant cardiac pacemaker autodefibrillator ; cochlear implant ; ocular foreign body ( e.g . metal shaving ) ; insulin pump .</criteria>
