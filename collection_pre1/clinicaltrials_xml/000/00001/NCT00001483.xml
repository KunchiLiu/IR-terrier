	<brief_summary>This study compare effectiveness relatively new antidepressant different mechanisms action . Buproprion ( Wellbutrin ) work dopamine dopaminergic pathway . Sertraline ( Zoloft ) work selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) . Venlafaxine ( Effexor ) work mixed serotonin , norepinephrine , dopamine reuptake inhibitor . Subjects enrol study patient diagnose bipolar disorder presently take medication prevent symptom disease ( prophylactic treatment ) , breakthrough episode depression despite take medication . Patients receive one three antidepressant medication note plus placebo inactive sugar pill , order mask antidepressant prescribe ) addition regular medication bipolar disorder . All dos calculate effective treatment unipolar major depressive disorder . The patient continue receive medication ten week . The effectiveness drug treatment measure use three different scale ; 1 . Inventory Depressive Symptoms - Clinicians form ( IDS-C ) 2 . Clinical Global Impression scale ( CGI-BP ) 3 . Life Charting Methodology ( LCM ) Patients respond medication within ten week begin study consider non-responders offer opportunity start study , take one two remain medication . For example , patient assign take Wellbutrin ineffective , he/she could re-enter study give either Zoloft Effexor . Patients respond first ten week study eligible continue take medication one year ass long term effectiveness drug prevent episode depression ass possible differential induction mania .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This NIMH-Stanley Foundation Bipolar Network ( `` Network '' ) study first systematic assessment bipolar depression comparative efficacy bupropion ( Wellbutrin ) , sertraline ( Zoloft ) , venlafaxine ( Effexor ) , three new antidepressant different mechanisms action . Bupropion largely dopaminergic sertraline serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) venlafaxine mixed serotonin , norepinephrine , less extent dopamine reuptake inhibitor . Subjects enrol study bipolar patient prophylactic treatment experience breakthrough major depressive episode . Subjects assign double-blind manner use three-arm forced randomization procedure antidepressant therapy either bupropion , sertraline , venlafaxine ten-week acute response trial . The study medication assign adjuvant treatment mood stabilize medication ( ) proven unsatisfactorily effective within therapeutic range ( ) maximum tolerate dose ( ) . All subject receive active drug dosage establish clinically relevant unipolar major depressive disorder . Subjects research personnel conduct cross-sectional longitudinal rating assessment mood function blind treatment group assignment . The primary outcome measure Inventory Depressive Symptoms - Clinician form ( IDS-C ) , Clinical Global Impression ( CGI-BP ) scale , Life Charting Methodology ( LCM ) . Subjects worsen baseline week four treatment consider non-responders initially assigned medication , offer re-randomization either two drug subject originally randomize ( e.g. , bupropion non-response , either sertraline venlafaxine ) additional ten-week acute response trial . Responders acute trial enter 12 month trial continuation therapy ass long term effect prophylaxis depression possible induction mania cycle acceleration . We also wish explore possible clinical biological correlate acute long term response antidepressant receive almost systematic study bipolar illness . One hypothesis study acute efficacy three antidepressant would . Another hypothesis potent noradrenergic ( NE ) effect , venlafaxine would higher rate induce mania compare bupropion sertraline .</detailed_description>
