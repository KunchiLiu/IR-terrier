	<brief_summary>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) disease nervous system . The exact cause MS unknown , believe autoimmune condition . Autoimmune condition diseases cause body 's immune system natural defense attack healthy cell . In case MS , immune system begin attack myelin , cell make sheath cover nerve . Without myelin , nerve unable transmit signal effectively symptoms occur . This study direct toward good understanding cause Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) . Researchers evaluate patient tentative diagnosis MS neurological disease possibly cause immunological reaction . Patients undergo series three MRIs , take month three month submit blood sample immunological study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Neuroimmunology Branch ( NIB ) conduct research cause immunologically mediate disease nervous system multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . The study NIB range study natural history MS trials new experimental therapy . In order recruit patient various NIB research study , patient tentative diagnosis initially see NIB assess accuracy diagnosis assess level disease activity occur patient . Patients see NIB screen protocol evaluate clinic complete neurological examination . Blood study necessary eliminate possibility many cause disease may resemble MS perform . Spinal fluid examination may preform uncertainty exists respect diagnosis . Finally , patient least one MRI preform assess consistency MRI finding expect MS . Most patient series three MRIs do approximately one month apart order ass frequency new contrast enhance lesion occur patient . The level disease MRI important standpoint diagnosis well determine patient may eligible NIB protocol . To assess patient 's eligibility NIB study , NIB may periodically follow patient diagnosis uncertain level disease activity clear initial evaluation .</detailed_description>
