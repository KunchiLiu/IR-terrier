	<brief_summary>Menkes Disease genetic disorder affect metabolism copper . Patient disease physically mentally retarded . Menkes disease usually first detect first 2-3 month life . Infant male bear disease fail thrive , experience hypothermia , delay development , experience seizure . These infant also characteristic physical feature change hair face . Females may also change hair skin color , rarely significant medical problem . Appropriate treatment Menkes Disease require disease diagnosed early treatment start irreversible brain damage occur . The aim treatment bypass normal route absorption copper gastrointestinal tract . Copper must deliver brain cell available use enzyme . Copper histidine copper replacement inject directly body avoid absorption gastrointestinal tract . However , study show genetic abnormality cause Menkes disease simply correct copper replacement injection . The genetic abnormality cause Menkes disease vary severity . Patients genetic abnormality may still permit production enzyme require process copper may receive benefit early treatment copper replacement . However , patient severe abnormality gene responsible copper metabolism may receive benefit copper replacement . The purpose study continue evaluate effect early copper histidine Menkes disease patient correlate specific molecular defect responses treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Menkes disease X-linked recessive neurodegenerative disorder cause defect gene encodes evolutionarily conserve copper-transporting ATPase ( ATP7A ) . Several issue must address configure therapeutic strategy disorder : ( ) affect infant must identify treatment commence early life irreparable neurodegeneration occurs , ( b ) block intestinal absorption copper must bypass , ( c ) circulate copper must deliver brain , ( ) copper must available enzyme within cell require cofactor . Very early , pre-symptomatic therapy copper injection associate improved overall survival , patient - base molecular defect , vastly well neurological outcome comparison usual natural history disorder . The purpose study continue provide early copper treatment newborn infant diagnose Menkes disease .</detailed_description>
