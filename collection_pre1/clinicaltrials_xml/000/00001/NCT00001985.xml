	<brief_summary>Type 1 diabetes mellitus autoimmune disease body 's immune cell attack insulin-producing cell pancreas . Several environmental genetic factor may predispose individual develop disease , include change gene call CD152 . This study examine gene may influence development insulin-dependent diabetes . Patients Type 1 diabetes mellitus enrol clinical trial National Institutes Health University Florida healthy normal volunteer may participate study . Participants three blood sample draw period le 1 year . The first sample ( 20 milliliter , 4 teaspoon ) , examine change structure CD152 gene . If CD152 structure different normally see general population , second sample ( 90 ml , 6 tablespoon blood ) drawn . This sample use study function specialize immune system cell ( T cell ) , include growth survival , chemical produce stimulate , factor . If cell function differently generally see population , third sample ( 90 ml ) drawn detailed study . This investigation may help explain make certain individual susceptible Type 1 diabetes mellitus may contribute development improved treatment disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Genetic variation CD152 report confer susceptibility development type-1-diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) . In protocol draw blood sample patient normal control volunteer order analyze presence CD152 genetic variation determine whether variation associate measurable abnormality T cell function . Subjects T1DM homozygous CD152 gene polymorphism , patient T1DM without CD152 polymorphism , control subject without CD152 polymorphism study determine whether CD152 polymorphism measurable effect T cell function signal . We assess T cell function measuring : proliferation , viability , apoptosis , cytokine production T cell signal transduction . The identification characterization gene link T1DM may provide explanation mechanism individual predispose T1DM .</detailed_description>
