	<detailed_description>PER 5/30/95 AMENDMENT : In HIV-negative patient , intermittent anti-TB therapy show effective daily therapy , optimal duration therapy HIV-infected patient establish . ORIGINAL : In area country , resistance one drug commonly use treat TB emerge . Thus , need test regimen contain new drug exists . Furthermore , optimal duration anti-TB therapy HIV-infected patient TB need determine . PER 5/30/95 AMENDMENT : Patients receive acceptable induction regimen prior study entry find susceptible isoniazid rifampin pyrazinamide resistance randomize receive either isoniazid rifampin plus vitamin B6 biweekly 18 31 week . Patients evaluate month 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , every 4 month thereafter . Minimum follow-up 1.5 year . ORIGINAL : In induction phase , patient enrol `` drug-susceptible '' area ( define metropolitan area resistance rate isoniazid therapy le 10 percent ) receive four drug : isoniazid ( plus pyridoxine ) , rifampin , pyrazinamide , ethambutol . Patients enrol `` drug-resistant '' area ( resistance rate isoniazid 10 percent high ) receive four-drug regimen without fifth drug , levofloxacin . After 8 week induction , patient multi-drug resistance remove study regimen ; patient enter continuation phase . Pansusceptible patient ( show susceptibility first-line anti-TB drug ) receive two study drug additional 18 31 week ; patient isoniazid-resistant ( intolerant ) TB receive two three study drug additional 44 week , rifampin-resistant TB receive two three study drug additional 70 week . Patients evaluate every 2 week induction phase every 12 week continuation phase . Minimum follow-up 2 year .</detailed_description>
