	<brief_summary>This study examine safety effectiveness drug mycophenolate mofetil ( MPM ) treat Wegener 's granulomatosis relate inflammatory vessel disease . Blood vessel inflammation patient may involve different part body , include brain , nerve , eye , sinus , lung , kidney , intestinal tract , skin , joint , heart , site . The severe involvement , likely disease life-threatening . Standard treatment consist combination drug therapy prednisone cytotoxic agent-usually cyclophosphamide methotrexate . However , patient treatment initially successful disease relapse ; patient take medication health problem severe side effect drug . MPM approve Food Drug Administration prevent kidney transplant rejection . It chemically similar another cytotoxic drug call azathioprine , beneficial maintain remission patient Wegener 's granulomatosis treat successfully cyclophosphamide . Because MPM effective azathioprine prevent organ rejection , may also prove beneficial second-line treatment Wegener 's granulomatosis . Patients Wegener 's granulomatosis relate inflammatory vessel disease relapse follow treatment cyclophosphamide methotrexate take one drug may eligible study . Only patient treat NIH methotrexate protocol cyclophosphamide switch methotrexate protocol , receive exact treatment physician may participate . Participants complete medical evaluation include laboratory study . Consultations , X-rays biopsy affect organ may also do indicated diagnosis treatment . Patients active disease give MPM prednisone , tablet form . Patients inactive disease receive prednisone already take . In case , prednisone reduce gradually discontinue disease improve significantly . MPM therapy continue least 2 year . If 2 year disease remain remission , MPM dose gradually reduce stop . If active disease recur MPM therapy , treatment plan likely change . The new regimen determine severity disease , medical condition , history side effect previous medication . Patients follow NIH clinic every month first 3 month MPM every 3 month another 18 month . Those whose disease remain remission stop medication follow every 6 month 4 visit . The follow-up visit include physical examination , blood draw , , need , X-rays . Visits may schedule frequently medically indicate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study assess efficacy safety mycophenolate mofetil treatment Wegener 's granulomatosis relate vasculitides patient contraindication methotrexate cyclophosphamide experience disease relapse agent . Mycophenolate mofetil novel immunosuppressive agent approve FDA renal transplantation . It chemically similar potentially great efficacy prevent acute transplant rejection azathioprine , drug previously use alternative treatment vasculitis . In study , patient disease relapse contraindication methotrexate initially receive cyclophosphamide glucocorticoid switch cyclophosphamide mycophenolate mofetil upon disease remission . If end two year mycophenolate mofetil therapy continue evidence disease remission , drug taper discontinue . Patients contraindication cyclophosphamide methotrexate treat initially prednisone mycophenolate mofetil mycophenolate mofetil continue two full year disease remission taper discontinue . For patient develop intolerance methotrexate cyclophosphamide disease remission , mycophenolate mofetil start continue two year time taper discontinue . Patients prospectively monitor evidence disease activity drug toxicity . Specific parameter obtain include time disease remission , rate time disease relapse , incidence drug relate adverse effect .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Documentation Wegener 's Granulomatosis ( WG ) base clinical characteristic histopathological evidence vasculitis . Patient positive C PANCA glomerulonephritis evidence presence red blood cell cast proteinuria renal biopsy show necrotizing glomerulonephritis absence positive immunofluorescence immunoglobulin complement also eligible . Patients must age 1880 year . Patients CYC MTX protocol ( # 95I0091 ) experience relapse disease MTX maintenance therapy . Relapse define Vasculitis Disease Activity Index great equal 3 . Patients outside NIH also eligible treated CYC MTX regimen identical use # 95I0091 experience relapse disease MTX maintenance therapy . If treatment relapse already commence outside institution daily CYC glucocorticoid , patient still eligible history Vasculitis Disease Activity Index great equal 3 time CYC glucocorticoid initiation . Patients experience relapse disease MTX stop taper MTX dose ( follow 2 year maintenance therapy ) eligible . Patients active disease contraindication MTX therapy eligible . Evidence active disease define Vasculitis Disease Activity Index great equal 3 . Patients inactive disease contraindication CYC . Evidence active disease define Vasculitis Disease Activity Index great equal 3 . Patients inactive disease MTX CYC MTX protocol ( 95I0091 ) MTX protocol ( 90I0086 ) develop contraindication necessitate discontinuation MTX . Patients outside NIH also eligible similarly develop contraindication MTX treatment . Patients inactive disease CYC protocol ( # 76I0041 76I0042 ) develop contraindication necessitate CYC discontinuation also contraindication receive MTX . Patients outside NIH also eligible similarly develop contraindication CYC treatment receive MTX . Patients inactive disease receive treatment CYC prednisone manner similar # 76I0042 eligible contraindication receive MTX remission le 3 month . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Evidence active infection , judgment investigator , great danger patient underlie vasculitis . In instance infection rule gram stain culture secretion collection fluid involved organ , may necessary obtain biopsy affected tissue microbiological histopathological study . Patients pregnant nursing infant eligible . Fertile woman must negative pregnancy test within one week prior study entry must use effective mean birth control . Patients active disease eligible CYC MTX protocol ( # 95I0091 ) MTX protocol ( # 90I0086 ) . Active peptic ulcer disease . Serological evidence infection human immunodeficiency virus . A serological determination perform within two week begin study participation . Inability comply study guideline . Creatinine clearance less 25ml/min .</criteria>
