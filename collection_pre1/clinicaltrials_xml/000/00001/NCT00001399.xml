	<brief_summary>Fanconi 's Anemia inherit disorder produce bone marrow failure . In addition , patient Fanconi 's anemia physical defect usually involve skeleton kidney . The major problem patient aplastic anemia , blood count red blood cell , white blood cell , platelet low bone marrow fail produce cell . Some patient Fanconi 's anemia develop leukemia cancer organ . Many laboratory study suggest Fanconi 's anemia cause inherited defect ability cell repair DNA . Recently , gene one four type Fanconi 's anemia , type C , identify . It known gene defective patient Fanconi 's anemia type C. Researchers conduct laboratory study suggest Fanconi 's anemia type C may treatable gene therapy . Gene therapy work place normal gene cell patient abnormal gene responsible Fanconi 's anemia type C. After normal gene place , new normal cell develop grow . Drugs give patient kill remain abnormal cell . The new cell contain normal gene harm drug . The purpose study test whether researcher safely place normal Fanconi 's anemia type C gene cell patient disease . The gene place special cell bone marrow call stem cell . These stem cell responsible produce new red blood cell , white blood cell , platelet .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fanconi anemia ( FA ) rare genetic disorder characterize progressive pancytopenia , congenital abnormality , predisposition malignancy . Therapy currently limit allogeneic marrow transplantation ; patient lack suitable donor usually die aplasia acute leukemia . Recently , mutation novel gene name FACC ( Fanconi anemia C-complementing ) identify cause one type FA . FACC mutation , introduce splice error stop codon , identify 15 % FA patient . We recently successful functional complementation four FA cell line use retroviral vector transfer copy normal FACC gene . We also analyze ability four viral vector functionally correct hematopoietic progenitor cell patient bearing splice donor mutation . As lymphoid cell line , CD34 enrich cell extremely sensitive MMC . After injection progenitor cell viral vector bear normal FACC , progenitor give rise increased number colony absence presence 5 nM MMC , whereas control cell completely destroy 1 nM MMC . In summary , demonstrate : ( 1 ) retroviral vector engineer transfer normal FACC gene FA ( C ) lymphoid cell line primary hematopoietic cell ; ( 2 ) introduction normal FACC gene CD34+ progenitor markedly enhance growth absence presence MMC . This study design determine whether hematopoietic progenitor transduce normal FACC gene re-infused safely FA ( C ) patient . CD34+ cell obtain G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood transduce ex vivo 72 hour period presence IL-3 , IL-6 , stem cell factor FACC retroviral vector . These transduced cell re-infused FA ( C ) patient . Patients monitor toxicity well evidence successful gene transfer expression . The procedure repeat total 4 time treatment 2-4 month apart . Theoretically , rescue stem cell selective growth advantage within hypoplastic FA marrow environment vivo .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must meet follow criterion within 30 day prior study entry ( Day 0 ) unless otherwise note . Males female , age great equal 5 year age . Diagnosis Fanconi anemia , complementation group C , confirm 1 ) Diepoxybutane mitomycin C test 2 ) DNA analysis indicate FACC mutation . Adequate baseline organ function assess follow laboratory value within 30 day prior study entry ( day 30 0 ) . Adequate renal function estimate creatinine clearance great 50 ml/min . ( This determine serum creatinine 24hour urine creatinine order concurrently ) . Adequate liver function SGOT , SGPT alkaline phosphatase less equal 5 time ULN ( transaminase great upper limit normal ( ULN ) , patient hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAG ) test prior study entry . Patients may enter study HBsAG positive ) . PT PTT 1.5 time ULN . Serum Amylase less equal 1.5 time ULN . Bilirubin le equal 3.0 mg/dL . Triglyceride le 400 mg/dl . Ability give inform consent . Normal cardiac function history exam . Resting transcutaneous oxygen saturation great 90 percent room air . Karnofsky Performance Status great equal 40 . Although blood count criterion inclusion study , preference give patient significant marrow failure reflect anemia , neutropenia , and/or thrombocytopenia . Furthermore , intend first enroll adult old child , extent possible , enrol young child . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients meet one follow criterion exclude study entry : Patients present acute leukemia bone marrow aspirate reveal great 10 percent blast . Pregnant lactating female ( patient must practice adequate birth control females childbearing potential must negative serum betaHCG pregnancy test ( within Day 7 Day 0 ) . Acute infection : acute viral , bacterial , fungal infection require specific therapy . Acute therapy must complete within 14 day prior study treatment . HepatitisB surface antigen positive patient . HIVinfected patient . Acute medical problem ischemic heart lung disease may consider unacceptable anesthetic operative risk . No patient underlying condition would contraindicate therapy study treatment ( allergies reagent use study ) . Patients less 25 kg weight . Patients elect bone marrow transplantation .</criteria>
