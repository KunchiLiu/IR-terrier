	<brief_summary>The purpose study identify gene responsible inherited connective tissue disorder learn range medical problem cause . It investigate whether specific gene change cause specific medical problem establish diagnostic criterion ( sign symptom ) individual syndrome . Children adult know suspect inherited connective tissue disorder ( Marfan , Ehlers-Danlos Stickler syndrome , closely related disorder ) family member may eligible study . Patients enrol study medical history , physical examination blood test , well procedure may include : - Echocardiogram ( ultrasound heart ) - X-rays imaging study , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) computerize tomography ( CT ) scan - Lung function study - Urine test - Skin biopsy ( removal small piece tissue , local anesthetic , microscopic examination ) - Examination various specialist ( e.g. , ophthalmology , gastroenterology , rehabilitation medicine ) need - Questionnaires regard chronic pain fatigue , quality life , impact connective tissue disorder patient family . ( Patients wish enroll travel NIH may limit participation , include review medical record , telephone interview regard personal family history , collection specimen ( blood , skin biopsy , ) genetic testing . Patients notify genetic testing result show change responsible connective tissue disorder . If wish , information also send local health care provider , along recommendation additional test treatment option . No treatment offer part study . Participating family member connective tissue disorder provide small blood sample gene test interview telephone personal family health history . Those whose blood test result show gene change associate connective tissue disorder invite NIH discussion finding refer genetic center area .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We investigate clinical manifestation molecular genetic defect heritable connective tissue disorder , concentrate Marfan , Stickler , Ehlers-Danlos syndrome . Although condition know many year , full spectrum associate phenotype continue expand genetic etiology condition completely elucidate . In addition , many patient feature overlap two described syndrome , preclude unequivocal diagnosis . The goal study define characterize full phenotype natural history disorder , perform genetic linkage , gene identification , mutation detection , genotype/phenotype correlation affect individual family . Individuals suspect Marfan , Stickler Ehlers-Danlos syndrome closely related disorder , well interested family member , enrol . Participants undergo genetic analysis periodic clinical assessment . The expected outcome improve clinical description condition gene mutation identification analysis genotype/phenotype correlation .</detailed_description>
