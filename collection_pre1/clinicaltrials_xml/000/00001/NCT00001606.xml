	<brief_summary>This study design discover gene cause hear impairment . More precisely , study aim map clone gene important development maintenance anatomy physiology relate hearing ( auditory system ) . The study begin find large family member hear impairment . Once family find , member without hear impairment evaluate audiologist clinician ( doctor ) . An audiologist , person train evaluating , habilitating , rehabilitate people disorder hear function . The clinician 's responsibility examine patient check sign symptom related hearing . Finding gene hear impairment require : 1 . &lt; TAB &gt; DNA sample hear impaired family member , take standard blood sample . 2 . &lt; TAB &gt; DNA sample member family without hear impairment , take standard blood sample . 3 . &lt; TAB &gt; Results hearing test conduct audiologist participant . Once member family evaluate researcher create pedigree . A pedigree like family tree chart member family genetic disorder , like hear impairment . Pedigrees use determine mode inheritance gene responsible particular condition . Finally , researcher intend use information gather well method genetic analysis map location gene . Patients participate study directly benefit research , scientific understand achieve may help researcher well understand auditory system someday prevent deafness. &lt; TAB &gt;</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective research project map clone gene important normal development maintenance auditory system . One strategy identify gene important auditory process ascertain large family several hearing impaired individual . Initial contact make family physician , audiologist , supervisor school hear impaired , directly principal investigator survey school deaf visit hear impairment self-help group . Members family evaluate audiologist , instance hear impairment document categorize . A clinician would examine hearing impaired unaffected member family presence clinical feature distinguish nonsyndromic syndromic form hear impairment . Pedigrees family analyze determine mode inheritance hereditary hearing impairment segregate family . Families ascertain audiologists clinician , genetics clinic , school hear impaired linguist medical anthropologist study unique sign languages sociology community high proportion hearing impaired individual . The mutated gene genetically map linkage association base strategy , use DNA type highly polymorphic genetic marker distribute across human genome .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : It anticipate , case , patient recruit whose disorder appear syndromic ( i.e . associate extraauditory extravestibular feature ) . We seek subject member large family multiple individual affect hear disorder . Sporadic case occasionally include phenotype feature suggestive mutation one particular candidate gene , since autosomal Xlinked recessive inheritance appear sporadic . If evidence genetic homogeneity , small family pool linkage analysis , combination large small family pool . Subjects ethnic background , gender , age , sexual orientation , health status include . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients exclude hear vestibular dysfunction know cause nongenetic etiology trauma , infection , metabolic immunologic disorder , exposure ototoxic agent noise aminoglycoside antibiotic .</criteria>
