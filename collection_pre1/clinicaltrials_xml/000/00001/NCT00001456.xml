	<brief_summary>Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome ( HPS ) inherit disease result decrease pigmentation ( oculocutaneous albinism ) , bleed problem due platelet abnormality ( platelet storage pool defect ) , storage abnormal fat-protein compound ( lysosomal accumulation ceroid lipofuscin ) . The disease cause poor functioning lung , intestine , kidney , heart . The major complication disease pulmonary fibrosis typically cause death patient age 40 - 50 year old . The disorder common Puerto Rico , many clinical research study disease conduct . Neither full extent disease basic cause disease know . There know treatment HPS . The purpose study perform research medical complication HPS begin understand cause complication . Researchers clinically evaluate patient HPS ethnic background . They obtain cell , blood component ( plasma ) , urine future study . Genetic test ( mutation analysis ) detect HPS-causing gene also conducted. &lt; TAB &gt;</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome ( HPS ) rare autosomal recessive disease consist oculocutaneous albinism , platelet storage pool defect , patient , lysosomal accumulation ceroid lipofuscin . Other manifestation include pulmonary fibrosis ( often fatal fourth fifth decade ) , chronic granulomatous colitis , rarely , renal involvement cardiomyopathy . There exist 8 different gene know cause HPS , HPS-2 basic defect know . HPS-2 disease result mutation b3A subunit coat protein , adaptor complex-3 , responsible intracellular vesicle formation . One severe subtype disorder , HPS-1 , common northwest Puerto Rico , another milder subtype , HPS-3 , see central Puerto Rico . HPS-4 disease display founder population , severity resembles HPS-1 . HPS-5 HPS-6 resemble HPS-3 severity . HPS-7 HPS-8 recently describe fully characterize . In protocol , clinically evaluate HPS patient ethnicity , obtain cell , plasma , urine future study , perform mutation analysis know HPS-causing gene , search gene responsible HPS . Routine admission last 4-5 day occur approximately every two year .</detailed_description>
