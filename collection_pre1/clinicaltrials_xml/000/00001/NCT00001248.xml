	<brief_summary>Studies perform 89-N-0045 design examine natural history multiple sclerosis ( MS ) use MRI immunological measure . In addition study natural history untreated patient , natural history patient receive approve disease-modifying therapy MS examine . In cohort patient level disease activity MRI compare immunological characteristic order help identify disease mechanism . Patients either definite MS ( base either clinical combine clinical MRI criterion ) initial presentation neurological dysfunction consistent MS study longitudinally MRI . Disease activity MRI assess use several MRI measure disease activity include number contrast enhance lesion , overall burden disease , brain atrophy measure assess axonal damage . Patients assess clinically correlation immunological genetic factor disease activity see clinically MRI study . A second cohort patient start use approve therapy also examine . Patients refer NIH prior begin approved therapy assess series three monthly MRIs determine level pretreatment disease activity . After begin approve therapy direction private physician , patient follow similarly natural history cohort . Immunological genetic finding access therapy order help establish mechanisms action therapy identify mechanisms accounting either response lack response therapy . Part collect sample willl cryopreserved provide respository study focus detection biomarkers indicative disease state , disease stage repsonse therapy . Additionally , cohort normal volunteer study . The study normal volunteer use establish appropriate imaging sequence study normal white matter MS patient use magnetization transfer ( MT ) image sequence study normal white matter MS patient use magnetization transfer ( MT ) image provide normative immunological measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Studies perform 89-N-0045 primarily design examine natural history multiple sclerosis ( MS ) mimicker , view window imaging ( especially magnetic resonance image MRI ) . The protocol four important objective : ( 1 ) Screening prospective participant select Neuroimmunology Branch clinical trial ; ( 2 ) Performing study help define mechanism action cause side effect disease modify therapy ( DMT ) ; ( 3 ) Studying healthy volunteer comparison patient development new experimental technology ; ( 4 ) Comparing MS neurological disease share image feature . Disease activity MRI assess use several MRI measure , focus number new on-study lesion also include number contrast-enhancing lesion , total number MRI-visible lesion , brain atrophy , recently define MRI measure tissue damage , quantitative magnetic relaxation mapping , diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI ) , magnetization transfer imaging ( MTI ) , MR spectroscopy ( MRS ) . Additionally , participant assess image modality , specifically optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) fluorescein angiography eye , also study clinically neurophysiologic test . In order obtain comparative data proper interpretation result MS , two control cohorts one consisting patient , healthy volunteer study . The patient control cohort three subcohorts : ( 1 ) patient disorder receive DMT use MS experience similar side effect ( e.g . progressive multifocal encephalopathy ( PML ) patient systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) ) , ( 2 ) patient receive DMT use MS MS-like illness suspect ( e.g . TNF-alpha inhibitor patient rheumatological disease ) ( 3 ) patient neurodegenerative disease may share pathophysiological process MS patient ( e.g . oxidative stress patient Parkinson disease mitochondrial dysfunction patient mitochondrial disease ) qualify enrollment 09-N-0032 protocol . Enrollment patient different disease experience identical side effect DMTs study MS cohort help answer question whether identify mechanism action side effect MS specific generalizable . The neurological disease cohort provide data assess specificity MRI finding MS cohort .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Inclusion criterion population : Diagnosis MS base combine MRI clinical criterion ( Polman et al. , 2005 ) OR presentation clinically isolated syndrome consistent MS least two abnormality MRI consistent MS OR diagnosis another neurological disease CNS ( see Section 6.1.2 ) OR patient disease receive identical DMTs MS cohort OR patient acquire MSlike disease receive immunomodulatory agent different indication . For patient neuroimmunological disorder , treatment available immunomodulatory therapy . Age great equal 18 . Able give inform consent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Exclusion criterion cohort : Contraindication MRI . Fulfills inclusion criterion 09N0032 protocol , i.e . untreated neuroimmunological CNS white matter disease require diagnostic workup . Pregnancy . Unwilling allow cod sample process offsite unwilling cod sample use study .</criteria>
