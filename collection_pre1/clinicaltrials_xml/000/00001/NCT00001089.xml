Presently need exists define natural history CMV disease patient AIDS within context HAART . In prospective observational study , HIV-infected patient CMV-seropositive clinical symptom CMV disease entry follow three year diagnosis CMV end-organ disease death , whichever come first . Clinical evaluation perform baseline every 8 week . Blood sample virologic study take every 16 week .</detailed_description>
