	<detailed_description>Obesity condition affect one-third adult U.S. population major risk factor development Type 2 diabetes , hyperlipidemia , hypertension , cardiovascular respiratory disorder . Individuals onset obesity childhood adolescence increase risk obesity-related , comorbid condition , adolescence later life . African American girl woman particular risk obesity , substantial rate obesity-related morbidity mortality . Further , African American adult woman less satisfactory response many therapeutic approach use treat obesity . At present , medical therapy proven effective amelioration severe obesity child adolescent . One medication may favorable risk-benefit ratio pediatric population orlistat ( Xenical ( Trademark ) , Hoffmann LaRoche ) . Orlistat act inhibit gastrointestinal lipase , interfere absorption approximately 1/3 ingested dietary fat . Orlistat appear effective reduce weight obesity-associated comorbidities obese adult . We propose determine safety , tolerability , efficacy orlistat 12-17 year-old severely obese African American Caucasian child adolescents one obesity-related comorbidity ( hypertension , hyperlipidemia , sleep apnea , hepatic steatosis , insulin-resistance , impair glucose tolerance , Type 2 diabetes ) . Under protocol , conduct open-label pilot study orlistat twenty subject , suggest orlistat similar side effect profile adolescent adult . We wish determine safety efficacy orlistat reduce obesity-related comorbidities use randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial . All study participant enrol psycho-educational weight loss program include nutrition education , cognitive-behavioral self-monitoring strategy , promotion physical activity . We also study effect orlistat fat preference , study influence genetic variable energy expenditure weight loss treatment . A group healthy , non-overweight child adolescent complete questionnaire exercise study control group interpretation result overweight child adolescent , undergo phlebotomy receive medication .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Good general health . Individuals take medication obesityrelated comorbid condition exclude . Obesity : body mass index age triceps skinfold 95th percentile ( determined NHANES I age , sex , race specific data ) . All subject require 60 kg body weight . Evidence quantifiable obesityrelated comorbidity . Examples include : systolic diastolic hypertension ( determine agespecific chart ) ; frank Type 2 diabetes , impair glucose tolerance assess oral glucose tolerance testing ; hyperinsulinemia ( define fast insulin great 15 mIU/mL ) ; significant hyperlipidemia ( total cholesterol great 200 mg/dL , LDL cholesterol great 129 mg/dL fast triglyceride great 200 mg/dL ) ; hepatic steatosis ( SGPT SGOT normal range negative hepatitis study ) sleep apnea document sleep study . Age 12 17 year start study . For girl childbearing potential , negative pregnancy test take take study medication . Sexually active female must use effective form birth control . These method include total abstinence ( sex ) , oral contraceptive ( `` pill '' ) , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , levonogestrol implant ( Norplant ) , medroxyprogesterone acetate injection ( Depoprovera shot ) . If one use , contraceptive foam condom recommend . Race four grandparent selfidentified either Caucasian African American . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Volunteers exclude ( referred nonexperimental treatment program ) follow reason : Presence renal , hepatic ( obesityrelated steatosis ) , gastrointestinal , endocrinologic ( e.g. , Cushing syndrome ) , pulmonary disorder ( either asthma require continuous medication sleep apnearelated disorder ) ; Adolescent girl pregnant , currently nurse infant , unprotected intercourse ; Individuals , whose parent guardian , current substance abuse psychiatric disorder condition , opinion investigator , would impede competence compliance possibly hinder completion study ; Subjects regularly use prescription medication unrelated complication obesity . Oral contraceptive use permit , provide contraceptive use least two month start study medication . The use overthecounter prescription medication review casebycase basis ; depend medication , subject continued take prescription medication least 3 month prior study entry may eligible ; Recent use ( within six month ) anorexiant medication purpose weight reduction ; Inability undergo MRI ( e.g. , volunteer metal within body include cardiac pacemaker , neural pacemaker , aneurysmal clip , shrapnel , ocular foreign body , cochlear implant , nondetachable electronic electromechanical device infusion pump , nerve stimulators , bone growth stimulators , etc . contraindication ) . For pilot study participant , hypersensitivity allergy methylene blue . Individuals document G6PD deficiency exclude . INCLUSION CRITERIA : HEALTHY CONTROL CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS : Volunteers qualify inclusion meet follow criterion : 1 . Good general health . 2 . Age 1217 year study entry . 3 . Body mass index ( BMI ) age 5th percentile 85th percentile , consider normal weight CDC growth chart standard . 4 . For female childbearing potential , negative pregnancy test initial evaluation . 5 . Race four grandparent selfidentified either Caucasian African American . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : HEALTHY CONTROL CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS : Volunteers exclude follow reason : 1 . Presence past present medical problem would impair performance exercise test ; 2 . Females pregnant , currently nurse infant ; 3 . Individuals , whose parent guardian , current substance abuse psychiatric disorder condition opinion investigator would impede competence possibly hinder completion study ; 4 . Recent weight change 3 % body weight past two month ; 5 . Recent use ( within six month ) anorexiant medication purpose weight reduction ; 6 . Physical impairment would prevent completion either walk/run test cycle test .</criteria>
