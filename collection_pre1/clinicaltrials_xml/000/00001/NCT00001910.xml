	<brief_summary>This study examine allergen immunotherapy ( allergy shot ) work reduce prevent reaction allergens pollen , dust cat dander . Certain T cell ( type white blood cell ) call Th2 cell produce substance generate allergy . Other T cell call Th1 cell produce substance opposite effect . This study determine allergy shot change immune response allergens reduce number Th2 cell change Th1 cell . A good understanding treatment work may help scientist develop effective allergy therapy . People 18 50 year age allergic asthma least 1 year may participate study . Candidates ' medical , allergy medication history review , physical examination , include routine blood test , urinalysis , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , lung function test . Blood also draw test T cell response allergens , 12 skin test ( similar tuberculosis skin test ) do test sensitivity various allergen . Participants admit Clinical Center 1 2 day rush therapy ( see ) . They brief history physical examination . A heparin lock ( thin plastic tube similar intravenous line ) place arm vein . They undergo follow procedure : - Rush/Cluster Immunotherapy - An allergen give increase dos 2 5 week . During rush therapy , dose increase rapidly 1 2 day moderate level dose reach . To reduce chance allergic reaction , patient take prednisone , cetirizine ( Zyrtec® ( Registered Trademark ) ) , ranitidine ( Zantac® ( Registered Trademark ) ) montelukast ( Singular® ( Registered Trademark ) ) start 24 hour treatment begin rush therapy end . After discharge third day , patient return clinic week next 2 5 week cluster therapy , dose increase gradually maintenance level . - Maintenance Immunotherapy - Participants receive 12 weekly injection maintenance dose . Blood drawn one visit week 2 7 maintenance therapy . - Follow-up Visits - Patients return clinic 2 3 week last maintenance dose blood draw evaluation . In addition , `` late-phase '' allergen skin test do 3-week follow-up compare reaction result test do screen visit . - End-of-Study Visit - 12 16 week last allergy shot , patient return final blood draw brief evaluation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Asthma major public health problem due high prevalence significant impact activity daily live . Allergen immunotherapy vaccination consist therapeutic administration allergen extract . The efficacy allergen immunotherapy asthma modest , however immunotherapy remain known disease modify therapy allergic asthma . Because exact mechanism immunotherapy work unclear , great understand mechanism action allergen immunotherapy need modern immunopharmacologic method apply increase therapeutic efficacy . This goal study determine effect allergen immunotherapy allergen specific T cell response . This open label study allergen specific CD4+T lymphocyte response monitor , 12 weekly injection maintenance immunotherapy , allow study induction well decay change . Immunotherapy employ rush/cluster schedule consist serial administration rapidly increase dos allergen deliver subcutaneously 2 day period ( rush ) , follow gradually increase weekly injection 2-6 week ( cluster ) , time subject bring maintenance allergen dose , repeatedly administer weekly basis . Immunological endpoint consist frequency cytokine profile allergen specific T cell response measure intracellular cytokine stain measurement vitro induce T cell cytokine real time RT-PCR . Ten allergic asthmatic subject enrol therapeutic arm study .</detailed_description>
