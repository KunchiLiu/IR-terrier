	<detailed_description>Treatment patient HIV infection must address primary viral infection subsequent immune deficiency , primary cause mortality AIDS . In vitro study ampligen show inhibit HIV infection . Ampligen may also minimize toxicity many drug use treatment AIDS induce antiviral state brain may useful treat neurologic symptom HIV infection . The time course degree immunologic response ampligen remain unknown although essential proper use drug treatment HIV infection perhaps clinical problem . Ten healthy volunteer 10 HIV-infected patient randomize ampligen placebo group . Five volunteer group receive single dose ampligen day 1 single dose placebo day 8 . The 5 volunteer receive drug placebo day 8 1 , respectively . Seven day observation test follow administration drug placebo also allow body eliminate drug .</detailed_description>
