	<brief_summary>In current clinical trial , compare effect two NMDA receptor antagonist placebo patient painful distal symmetrical diabetic neuropathy post-herpetic neuralgia . The treatment three-period crossover study dextromethorphan , 920 mg/day ( 8 time antitussive dose ) , memantine , 30-50 mg/day , placebo . Memantine NMDA antagonist use Europe treat Parkinson 's disease Alzheimer 's disease . The underlying hypothesis , base study painful neuropathy animal model , neuropathic pain cause largely sensitization central nervous system neuron cause excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter , act largely NMDA receptor . A previous small trial dextromethorphan suggest efficacy diabetic neuropathy pain . The study require one visit NIH outpatient Pain Research Clinic , consist three 9-week treatment period . Patients respond one medication invite participate control study medication follow several year open-label treatment continue observation .</brief_summary>
