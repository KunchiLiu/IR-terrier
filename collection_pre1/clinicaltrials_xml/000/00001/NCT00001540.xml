	<brief_summary>The objective study evaluate safety utility bacteriophage phi X174 immunization tool ass immune competence HIV-infected patient different stage disease vivo , assess impact viral load level therapy-induced change viral load level response immunization neo-antigen bacteriophage phi X174 . Bacteriophage phi X174 immunization method use 25 year assess immunity patient various type primary secondary immunodeficiency , include 48 HIV-infected patient . This prospective open-label , control study enroll 39 HIV-infected patient 13 healthy volunteer , male female 18 year age . The HIV-infected patient divide 3 group accord CD4 cell count : le 200 cells/mm ( 3 ) , 200 500 cells/mm ( 3 ) great 500 cells/mm ( 3 ) . After screen two week pre-study evaluation , eligible participant receive primary , secondary tertiary immunization 2 x 10 ( 9 ) PFU/kg bacteriophage phi X174 six week apart . Patients present detectable level viral load entry offer effective antiviral drug regimen . Patients stable antiviral regimen least one month prior receive primary immunization . Patients return visit 1 , 2 4 week immunization clinical laboratory evaluation . The study endpoint : safety ( measure incidence adverse event , CD4 cell count HIV plasma RNA ) , kinetics bacteriophage clearance follow primary immunization , quantitation bacteriophage phi X174 specific antibody titer follow primary , secondary tertiary immunization determination qualitative quantitative antibody isotype switch follow secondary tertiary immunization .</brief_summary>
