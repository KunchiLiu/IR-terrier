	<brief_summary>Study A : To determine whether treatment zidovudine ( ZDV ) delay change disease process hemophilic patient HIV infection symptom . The major clinical question whether patient receive chronic ZDV therapy delay development AIDS AIDS-related complex ( ARC ) . The pharmacokinetics ( blood level ) ZDV hemophilic patient also study . Study B : To determine ZDV therapy change risk hemophiliac transmit HIV wife female sexual partner . To determine effectiveness counsel education behavior wive place risk HIV infection . To determine antibody HIV either appear disappear blood wife study . Study A : Individuals infect HIV benefit therapy effective anti-AIDS virus agent . ZDV potent inhibitor HIV vitro ( test tube ) safe human dose plan . It may effective preventing development AIDS ARC hemophiliac HIV antibody blood . The pharmacokinetic study especially important high prevalence hepatic disease population may affect metabolism blood level ZDV . Study B : HIV transmit sexual contact , wife infect hemophilic patient become infected long-term sexual relationship . Transmission virus occur casual family contact . This study aid determine therapy influence transmission HIV , wive hemophiliacs generally risk HIV infection sexual contact spouse .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study A : Individuals infect HIV benefit therapy effective anti-AIDS virus agent . ZDV potent inhibitor HIV vitro ( test tube ) safe human dose plan . It may effective preventing development AIDS ARC hemophiliac HIV antibody blood . The pharmacokinetic study especially important high prevalence hepatic disease population may affect metabolism blood level ZDV . Study B : HIV transmit sexual contact , wife infect hemophilic patient become infected long-term sexual relationship . Transmission virus occur casual family contact . This study aid determine therapy influence transmission HIV , wive hemophiliacs generally risk HIV infection sexual contact spouse . Study A : Patients select study randomly assign placebo ( inactive medication ) ZDV take every 4 hour patient awake total 5 dos per day . The patient 's immune function clinical condition monitor periodic virus culture , p24 antigen assay , estimate lymphocyte type number , cell surface marker , frequent clinical evaluation see marker drug efficacy . Patients continue regimen final analysis data , could occur 3 year last patient enter study . Amendment : Based data ACTG 019 protocol close accrual . All patient enter study unblinded treatment receive . Patients informed result ACTG 019 request sign modify statement consent approve local Institutional Review Board . All patient currently receive study therapy offer open-label ZDV . Patients temporarily discontinue study therapy time offer open-label ZDV toxicity resolve ( less equal Grade 2 hemoglobin neutrophil toxicity , less equal Grade 1 toxicity ) . Patients permanently discontinue study therapy eligible open-label ZDV protocol . Modification dose recommend , however , patient elect continue current dose ZDV inform result ACTG 019 allow . All patient enrol study continue follow termination study . Above amendment add 11/01/89 . Study B : The wife female sexual partner interview begin study Study A complete . The interview take 10 minute include question couple 's sexual activity help define risk become infect HIV . In addition , blood drawn test antibody HIV . The questionnaire blood sample repeat time patient switch blind study therapy open-label ZDV . ( AMENDED 11/01/89 ) The result blood test give person test . Information transmission HIV counseling provide . It recommend wife abstain sexual contact husband , , use condom condom plus spermicide recommend . The decision type precaution take influence opportunity participate study .</detailed_description>
