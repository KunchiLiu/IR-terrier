	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effectiveness combination chemotherapy paclitaxel ( Taxol ) cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan ) , follow high-dose melphalan etoposide treat inflammatory breast cancer . Patients also receive infusion previously collect progenitor cell ( primitive cell make new cell replace one destroy chemotherapy ) . Patients 18 year age old stage IIIB inflammatory breast cancer metastasize ( spread beyond breast ) may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood urine test , chest x-ray . They compute tomography ( CT ) head , chest , abdomen pelvis well bone scan determine extent disease , nuclear medicine scan call MUGA examine heart 's pumping ability . They may receive rehabilitation medicine evaluation . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Central venous line placement : Patients central venous line ( plastic tube ) place major vein chest begin treatment . The line remain body throughout treatment use give chemotherapy medication withdraw blood sample . The line usually place local anesthesia radiology department operate room . - Chemotherapy : Patients receive two cycle paclitaxel cyclophosphamide . Paclitaxel give intravenously ( I.V. , vein ) 72 hour use portable pump . Cyclophosphamide give daily 3 day I.V . 1 hour . The cycle may 28 day apart . A drug call Mesna give treatment protect bladder irritation cyclophosphamide . Patients previously treat doxorubicin ( Adriamycin ) may receive maximum four cycle doxorubicin cyclophosphamide vein single day cycle , cycle 21 day apart . When paclitaxel/cyclophosphamide cycle complete , patient receive melphalan etoposide , drug I.V . 1 8 hour three consecutive day . - G-CSF treatment : After paclitaxel/cyclophosphamide cycle melphalan/etoposide treatment , patient give drug call G-CSF . G-CSF , inject skin , stimulate production infection-fighting white blood cell . - Apheresis : This procedure collect progenitor cell later reinfusion . For procedure , blood collect catheter ( plastic tube ) place arm vein . The blood circulate cell-separating machine , white cell , include progenitor cell , extract , red cell return patient another catheter arm . Apheresis do two cycle paclitaxel/cyclophosphamide . - Progenitor cell transplant : Progenitor cell reinfused melphalan/etoposide treatment . - Glucose infusion : A salt solution chemically modify glucose infused I.V . period 12 48 hour , subsequent donation blood cell blood immune system study . Patients maximum two glucose infusion , separate least 3 month . - Tumor biopsy : Some patient biopsy tumor ( removal small piece tumor tissue microscopic study ) start chemotherapy . - Blood test : Blood drawn frequently monitor safety treatment response , research purpose . - Dental consultation : Some patient may dental consultation progenitor cell transplant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Efforts cure high-risk breast cancer increasingly focus application dose intensive chemotherapy . To date , use dose intensive high-dose chemotherapy significantly change survival majority high risk metastatic patient . The optimal schedule combination agent improve result high-dose chemotherapy know . This study pilot combination chemotherapy agent treatment Inflammatory Breast Cancer . OBJECTIVES : To define , statistically relevant manner , clinical efficacy chemotherapy regimen combination treatment Inflammatory Breast Cancer ( stage IIIB inflammatory ) . To examine effect high-dose chemotherapy T-cells ( T-cell number , phenotype , cytokine profile ) study process post-chemotherapy T-cell regeneration . ELIGIBILITY : Newly diagnose patient non metastatic Inflammatory Breast Cancer ( stage III B ) . The patient treat study also eligible entrance protocol experimental Transplantation &amp; Immunology Branch examine strategy manipulate T-cell regeneration adult intensive chemotherapy . DESIGN : Patients receive multiple cycle dose intensive combination Paclitaxel Cyclophosphamide mobilization peripheral blood progenitor cell therapeutic intent . A second induction regimen consist four cycle combination Doxorubicin / cyclophosphamide . Patients subsequently receive high-dose Melphalan Etoposide follow infusion peripheral blood progenitor cell granulocytes colony-stimulating-factor ( G-CSF ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA : INCLUSION CRITERIA : Age great equal 18 year . All patient must histologically confirm diagnosis Inflammatory Breast Carcinoma stage III B . Patients clinical inflammatory sign tumor invasion dermal lymphatic histology eligible . Patients metastatic disease Inflammatory Breast Carcinoma eligible . All pathologic material must review confirmed Department Pathology treat institution prior treatment ( central pathology review ) . Patients may untreated may receive prior induction chemotherapy outside NCI . If patient receive prior induction chemotherapy , may unresponsive . They may receive chemotherapy either ( neoadjuvant setting ) local surgery ( adjuvant setting ) . Karnofsky performance status great 70 % ( ECOG 0 1 ) . Ejection fraction MUGA 2D echocardiogram within institution normal limit . Creatinine clearance great 60 cc/mm . AST ALT less 3 time upper limit normal . Bilirubin le 1.5 ( except case Gilbert 's disease ) . ANC great l000/mm ( 3 ) . Platelet count great 90,000/mm ( 3 ) . DLCO great 50 % . No history medical psychiatric disease would preclude safe treatment view principal investigator . No history abnormal bleeding tendency predisposition repeat infection . Patients must able give informed consent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients Inflammatory Breast Cancer metastatic disease . Any patient may exclude study discretion principal investigator deem allow participation would represent unacceptable medical psychiatric risk . Any patient need chronic steroid anticoagulation ineligible . Any patient testing positive HIV ( AIDS ) hepatitis B C ineligible . Any female patient know find pregnant consider ineligible . Patients childbearing potential unwilling practice contraception ineligible . Any patient active second malignancy ( exclude treat skin cancer carcinoma situ ) ineligible .</criteria>
