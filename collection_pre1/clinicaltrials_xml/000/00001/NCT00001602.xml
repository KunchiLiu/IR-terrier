	<brief_summary>Stuttering abnormality speech affect rhythm speech . People stutter know wish say , time unable say involuntary repetition , unnecessary lengthening ( prolongation ) , early stopping ( cessation ) . This study design increase understanding genetic factor may relate stuttering . Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) protein find nucleus cell . It responsible carry genetic information organism . DNA provide direction make substance human body . DNA link together small segment call gene . Genes contain information anything related organism . In order researcher determine gene directly relate stuttering must conduct several type study . Linkage study , study family lot member stutter several generation . The linkage study complete use adult individual diagnose person stutter person never stutter , one family large number family member stutter several generation . Candidate gene study , look closely gene suspect related stuttering patient may may significant family history stutter . By conduct study , researcher hope learn gene relate stutter ultimately find cause stutter .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Genetic study developmental stutter important potential ultimately determine pathophysiological basis disorder . This study combine two approach examine genetic aspect stutter , linkage family , candidate gene analysis . Linkage study complete use adult individual diagnose person stutter judge never stutter one family large number affect individual within several generation . Candidate gene analysis also carry adult stutter determine frequency polymorphism certain neurotransmitter receptor enzymes differ control population . In addition , give heterogeneity population adult stutter , phenotypic probe motor skill , language skill , neuropsychological ability psychological response stutter also assess order identify subgroup phenotype expression gene may differ .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects must age 5 age 90 . Subjects must general good health , without evidence chronic medical illness . Onset stutter affected individual must occur childhood ( 3 10 year age ) , unrelated psychological neurological trauma . Subjects test presence HIV antibody . Persons positive HIV antibody exclude , unless take medication may change performance task use phenotypic assignment . Subjects screen history psychiatric illness , depression , anxiety obsessivecompulsive disorder accord DSMIV criterion . A history disorder disqualify subject participation , note variable phenotypic assignment .</criteria>
