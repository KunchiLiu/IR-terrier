	<brief_summary>This clinical study compare effectiveness two anticonvulsant Lamotrigine ( Lamictal ) Monotherapy Gabapentin ( Neurontin ) patient treatment resistant affective disorder . We initially find response rate lamotrigine ( 51 % ) exceed gabapentin ( 28 % ) placebo ( 21 % ) . In study placebo phase drop examine possible clinical biological factor predictor response . The drug give randomized order six week know give one . There 2-4 week `` washout '' period treatment . If respond well one treatment , long open continuation period offer end study . This would involve one drug combination . A variety rating scale brain imaging procedure also offer drug evaluation . Both lamotrigine gabapentin generally well tolerate . A serious potentially life threaten rash occur 1/500 patient treated lamotrigine , however . Common side effect rash , dizziness , unsteadiness , double vision , blur vision , nausea , vomit , insomnia , sedation , headache . These side effect usually mild , resolve continued time drug decrease dosage .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The anticonvulsant carbamazepine ( CBZ ) valproate ( VPA ) efficacy treatment mood disorder , suggest anticonvulsant related mechanism action may similar utility . Additional treatment sorely need many patient recurrent affective disorder symptom refractory treatment conventional agent , include lithium , carbamazepine , valproate . This refractory group major focus investigative effort 3-west Section Psychobiology , NIMH . Moreover , establish differential clinical biological predictor response become increasingly important rapid allocation appropriate treatment may supply insight pathophysiology mood disorder subtypes . Lamotrigine , phenyltriazine use-dependent sodium channel blocker inhibit release excitatory amino acid , new anticonvulsant few side effect old agent recently approve FDA adjunctive therapy treatment partial seizure . Heretofore , preliminary open clinical evidence suggest lamotrigine may mood stabilize property . Gabapentin neutral amino acid gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) analog increase brain GABA level few side effect old agent require hematological hepatic monitoring . Preliminary evidence open `` add-on '' series suggest gabapentin therapy might antidepressant antianxiety effect , mood stabilize property . We wish evaluate efficacy lamotrigine gabapentin refractory mood disorder . We also wish examine neurobiology phenomenology lamotrigine gabapentin responder nonresponders ascertain potential predictor concomitant response medication . This study may lead improvement treatment understand mood disorder provide control data efficacy potential new treatment , potential predictor response , insight pathophysiology mood disorder .</detailed_description>
