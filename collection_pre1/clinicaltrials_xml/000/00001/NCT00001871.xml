	<brief_summary>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) genetically inherited disease affect heart . It cause thicken heart muscle , especially chamber responsible pump blood heart , leave ventricle . This condition cause patient experience symptom chest pain , shortness breath , fatigue , heart beat palpitation . Researchers believe disease may cause abnormality gene responsible produce protein heart muscle . Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy ( OPMD ) another genetically inherit disease . This condition affect muscle eye throat cause symptom weak eye movement , difficulty swallow speaking , weakness arm legs . In previous study researcher find several patient hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) also oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy ( OPMD ) . Researchers interested learn two disease associate . In study , researcher plan collect sample muscle ( skeletal muscle biopsy ) patient belong family several member inherit one disease . The muscle sample use link muscle abnormality specific genetic mutation . Patients participate study may directly benefit . However , information gather study may use develop good technique diagnose treat condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mutations fast alpha-tropomyosin gene cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) , also express skeletal muscle . However , skeletal phenotype undetermined . We identify three family HCM cause alpha-tropomyosin mutation . Several family member one kindred also inherit distinct skeletal myopathy call oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy ( OPMD ) cause mutation poly ( A ) bind protein-2 gene ( PABP2 ) . The pathologic hallmark disease unique nuclear filament inclusion skeletal muscle fiber . It possible skeletal muscle phenotype severe two disease occur patient . We wish perform skeletal muscle biopsy determine skeletal myopathy patient alpha-tropomyosin , patient PABP2 gene mutation , patient inherited disease .</detailed_description>
