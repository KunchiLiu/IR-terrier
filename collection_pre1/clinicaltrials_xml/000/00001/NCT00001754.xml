	<brief_summary>This study determine gene responsible skeletal dysplasia ( disorder skeleton ) short stature define range type medical problem cause time . It investigate whether specific gene change cause specific medical problem disorder identify sign symptom upon diagnosis must base . Individuals short stature skeletal dysplasia know suspect caused gene mutation ( change ) may eligible study . Family member may also participate . Skeletal dysplasia study include : achondroplasia , hypochondroplasia , achondrogenesis type II , hypochondrogenesis , Kniest dysplasia , spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia , Stickler syndrome ; Shmid Jansen metaphyseal dysplasia ; pyknodysotosis , proximal symphalangism , brachydactyly type B C E , Ellis van Creveld relate disorder , metatrophic chondrodysplasias , cartilage-hair hypoplasia disorder skeletal abnormality yet define might result genetic defect . Patients talk two genetics specialist explain study possible implication patient family answer question . The patient 's medical record review , personal family history take , physical examination do . Various procedure may do include draw 6 tablespoon blood , use DNA ( genetic ) study , X-rays , echocardiography ( ultrasound heart ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , eye examination , hear test , sleep study , sperm analysis skin biopsy ( surgical removal small piece skin do local anesthetic ) . There may additional evaluation specialist rheumatology , rehabilitation medicine orthopedics . When test examination complete ( 2 3 day ) , doctor discus result patient . Patients whose DNA study show gene change responsible disorder meet genetics nurse counselor review result , express feeling ask question may . Patients may ask return NIH every 6 month 2 year continue follow-up . Medical management provide primarily patient 's physician . Participating family member interview telephone personal family health history blood sample drawn DNA testing . If gene change find responsible bone disorder growth problem family , arrangement make family member discuss implication finding genetics specialist .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We investigate clinical manifestation molecular genetic defect human skeletal dysplasia generalize short stature . Families skeletal dysplasias short stature know suspected genetic basis enrol . Affected individual individual suspect skeletal dysplasia undergo periodic clinical assessment genetic analysis purpose : 1 ) definition characterization phenotype , 2 ) determination natural history disorder , 3 ) genotype/phenotype correlation . Genetic linkage study may perform disorder genetic base yet know .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients know suspected skeletal dysplasia short stature family member age recruit worldwide diverse medical community include genetics , orthopedics , ophthalmology , pediatrics . DISEASE CATEGORY I : Individuals family member suspect established diagnosis FGFR3 disorder , type II collagen disorder , Schmid metaphyseal dysplasia , pyknodysostosis , proximal symphalangism , brachydactyly type C. DISEASE CATEGORY II : Individuals family member suspect established diagnosis skeletal dysplasia disease gene yet know , include : Ellis van Crevald , brachydactyly type B E , cartilagehair hypoplasia . DISEASE CATEGORY III : Individuals family member previously uncharacterized systemic manifestation suggestive skeletal dysplasia , clinical finding : disproportionate proportionate short stature ; and/or cleft palate ; and/or detach retina ; and/or history loose joint frequent joint dislocation ; and/or history , family history , premature arthritis . Short Stature Category I : Individuals generalize short stature family member . This include adult abnormal stature statistically define standardized growth chart . Must able give inform consent , old child ( great equal 7 year old ) give assent , person ward state exclude study .</criteria>
