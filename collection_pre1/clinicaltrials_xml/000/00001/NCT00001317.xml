	<brief_summary>In recent double-blinded , placebo-controlled multi-center international study , subcutaneous injection interferon-gamma administer three time weekly reduce frequency serious infection patient chronic granulomatous disease . Patients receive interferon-gamma few hospital stay , short length , placebo group . Children le 10 year age benefit treatment few side effect . Based data , FDA license interferon-gamma prophylaxis CGD patient . We wish monitor patient participate original study possible long-term side effect . Any new patient refer u either interferon-gamma consider candidate interferon-gamma consider protocol . In addition , patient originally accept Genentech 's compassionate plea protocol also monitor new protocol . The patient evaluate every six month , blood work interim medical history take .</brief_summary>
