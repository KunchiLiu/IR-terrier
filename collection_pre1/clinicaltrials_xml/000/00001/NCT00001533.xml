	<brief_summary>T Cell Large Granular Lymphocyte ( T-LGL ) Lymphoproliferative Disorders heterogeneous group uncommon disease may involve polyclonal monoclonal T cell population , bear characteristic surface marker correspond activate cytotoxic ( CD3+ , CD8+ ) lymphocytes . They often associate quite severe neutropenia , anemia , thrombocytopenia may life-threatening . There evidence abnormal cytotoxic lymphocyte population may cause cytopenia suppress hematopoiesis , although mechanism unclear . Case report suggest immunosuppressive therapy direct toward T cell may reverse cytopenia . This pilot study involve 25 patient evaluate clinical response cyclosporine , immunosuppressive drug , seek elucidate mechanism underlie cytopenia .</brief_summary>
