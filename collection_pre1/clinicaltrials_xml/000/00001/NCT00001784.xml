	<brief_summary>Dystonia refers condition characterize involuntary muscle contraction may cause pain , abnormal posture , abnormal movement . The cause dystonia unknown , researcher believe result overactivity area brain responsible movement ( basal ganglion ) . Lidocaine drug use treatment irregular heartbeat . It give injection . Recent study show lidocaine also effective treatment dystonia . Mexiletine drug similar lidocaine use irregular heartbeat take mouth . Researchers would like test effectiveness Mexiletine treatment dystonia . Patients participate study divide two group ; Group 1 take Mexiletine six week stop . They remain drug free one week begin take placebo `` inactive sugar pill '' additional six week . Group 2 take placebo `` inactive sugar pill '' six week stop . They remain drug free one week begin take Mexiletine additional six week . Throughout study researcher test effectiveness treatment evaluate patient use clinical rating scale neurophysiological study . In addition , researcher test patient 's reflex attempt find mexiletine work nervous system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mexiletine Treatment Focal Dystonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dystonia complex neurological disorder unknown pathogenesis likely involve basal ganglion . There adequate treatment dystonia . Recent study use intramuscular intravenous lidocaine show improvement dystonic movement . It propose patient dystonia reduce presynaptic inhibition alpha motoneuron lead overactivation response movement . This may also reflect hyperexcitability cortical level , reduce alter peripheral input . Mexiletine , antiarrhythmic similar lidocaine , available orally , may benefit patient dystonia , show several recent open-label study . This trial offer possibility treat dystonia well elucidate level dysfunction nervous system dystonic patient . We propose double-blind cross study compare mexiletine placebo treatment patient idiopathic dystonia . The patient evaluate clinical rating scale well neurophysiological study . In order study physiologic effect attempt localize neuroanatomic sight action mexiletine , study peripheral reflex , reciprocal inhibition cortical excitation perform . These study include blink reflex recovery curve , tonic vibration reflex , H-reflex transcranial magnetic stimulation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients focal dystonia , specifically writer 's cramp blepharospasm , eligible study . Patients need medical clearance , specifically , cardiac clearance , primary care physician . This include EKG within past 12 month history underlying cardiac disease . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients follow condition exclude study : structural brain lesion , identifiable etiology dystonia ( stroke , trauma , Parkinson 's Disease , Wilson 's Disease , peripheral neuropathy ) , contractures fix joint deformity , current past use neuroleptic , seizure , prior neurosurgery , coexistent neurologic general medical illness , include history cardiovascular disease peptic ulcer disease pregnant breastfeeding woman . Patients take take mexiletine exclude well .</criteria>
