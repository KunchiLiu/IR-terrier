	<brief_summary>In 1997 , Genetics Department NCI Medicine Branch help establish breast cancer genetics program National Naval Medical Center Breast Care Center . Genetic education , counseling , germline test BRCA1 BRCA2 , two gene confer increased lifetime risk breast ovarian cancer , offer Navy IRB-approved study . Sixty participant receive education counsel protocol , 49 chose genetic testing . The education counseling , provide oncology nurse train cancer genetics , focus prepare participant make well-informed decision test . Included information cancer genetics ; hereditary breast/ovarian cancer syndrome ; risk , benefit limitation BRCA1/BRCA2 testing ; screen risk reduction option high-risk individual . Through experience study , devise two different method provide information . Both method well receive appear equally effective , measure knowledge assessment session subjective evaluation participant . We study randomized fashion current protocol , good evaluate whether one method preferable . Ultimately hope able make recommendation allow access genetic education counseling individual cost efficient manner .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In October 1995 National Naval Medical Center open Department Defense fund Breast Care Center ( BCC ) . Within less one year Center see 100 - 200 new patient per week make 10 - 20 new diagnosis breast cancer per month . In 1997 begin conduct germline test BRCA1 BRCA2 approve Navy IRB study . To date , 51 individual enrol Education Counseling component , 42 individual elect receive germline testing . Early become apparent time efficient approach education counsel would require access information breast cancer genetics make available large population . Traditionally , education counseling offer one one basis prior germline testing . Often , hour spend individual . At center , multiple visit standard . Not shortage health care provider train cancer genetics , even abundance train provider , time cost , well need efficiency would preclude type approach . Thus , approach applicable health care delivery system . We begin offer education small group approximately 18 month ago , use informational content use one one session . Based preliminary , nonrandomized result , appear difference learn general patient satisfaction base result pre- post-test administer education . It contention group education equivalent , situation better individual education . Therefore , conduct randomize trial design test equivalence individual group education .</detailed_description>
