	<brief_summary>The purpose study identify gene mutation patient muscle disease phosphofructokinase ( PFK ) deficiency , acid maltase deficiency ( GAA deficiency ) learn disease develop . PFK deficiency mild , exercise-related illness . The childhood form GAA deficiency ( Pompe disease ) affect heart liver rapidly fatal . The adult form begin midlife involves degeneration skeletal muscle , lead weakness muscle wasting . The follow group individual may eligible study : Group A : Patients PFK deficiency , acid maltase deficiency , relatives also affect . Participants group undergo brief medical family history , blood sample collection , possibly physical examination , review medical record , interview patient 's physician . Group B : Unaffected family member patient group A , include blood relative spouse . People group may ask provide history genetic information . A review medical record , interview individual 's physician , blood sample may also request . Group C : Control subject . This group provide small blood sample buccal mucosal sample ( tissue sample collect brush inside cheek ) . The sample cod investigator know participant ' identity . DNA sample analyze frequency gene mutation . Genetic counseling arrange patient , appropriate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This laboratory define several mutation muscle disease mimic idiopathic inflammatory myopathy , ( IIM , polymyositis dermatomyositis ) , particular , phosphofructokinase ( PFK ) deficiency ( Type VII glycogenosis ) acid maltase ( GAA ) deficiency ( Type II glycogenosis ) . Some patient autosomal recessive disease show genetic compound , different mutation allele parent . In protocol , seek permission receive perform genetic screening sample tissue , blood , DNA patient know metabolic muscle disease , family member , patient undiagnosed muscle disease , group control subject . Although know name history patient , may choose admit protocol study , test propose perform DNA currently laboratory interest believe outcome implication clinical care subject . We propose obtain oral consent , appropriate take limit history speak patient 's physician , patient family member speak directly . All specimen obtain family study particular disease ( e.g. , PFK deficiency GAA deficiency ) obtain write consent test gene particular disease study . After completion test , DNA , product derive stored code may use control sample study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients know PFK deficiency , GAA deficiency know genetic muscle disease clinically affect relative . Clinically unaffected family member patient PFK deficiency , GAA deficiency know genetic muscle disease , include blood relative spouse . Control subject . These individual whose DNA gather coded investigator provide u solely purpose population survey mutation frequency . Among control , may unaffected individual racial geographic origin particular mutation . If convenient bank anonymous sample unavailable , seek individual among work NIH family friend .</criteria>
