	<detailed_description>For PRAM 2 : Evidence suggest consequence antiviral therapy , decrease plasma HIV-1 RNA strongly associate delay clinical progression . Therefore , drug regimen propose study design result much large sustain drop plasma HIV-1 RNA great clinical benefit . Further intent study evaluate virologic therapeutic potential novel combination antiretrovirals well define pharmacokinetics drug-drug interaction therapy include regimen . The Master PRAM schema design allow new therapeutic arm study `` rolling screen '' multiple generation PRAMs . There common , `` link '' regimen 2 sequential PRAM generation permit indirect comparison include therapy . ( NOTE : Due significant change study design PRAM 1 PRAM 2 , `` link '' arm . The linkage reinstate PRAM 2 subsequent PRAM generation . ) The therapeutic potential treatment arm assess ability decrease HIV copy number define plasma HIV-1 RNA copy number . Once accrual PRAM complete , new treatment comparison open accrual . For PRAM 2 : This study compare follow 4 treatment arm : Arm A - stavudine ( d4T ) /nevirapine/ritonavir Arm B - d4T/lamivudine ( 3TC ) /nelfinavir Arm C - d4T/nevirapine/nelfinavir Arm D - d4T/3TC/nevirapine/nelfinavir . Prior randomization 1 PRAM 2 treatment arm , patient stratify base CD4 % ( le 25 % great equal 25 % ) age ( le 24 month great equal 24 month ) . The first 35 subjects/treatment arm evaluate special immunologic study include lymphoproliferative assay extend panel immunophenotyping . There interim analysis patient complete 12 week treatment . Patients treat 48 week . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 6/11/99 : The study extend additional 48 week ( 96 week total ) permit long-term follow-up clinically stable , HIV-infected child . ]</detailed_description>
