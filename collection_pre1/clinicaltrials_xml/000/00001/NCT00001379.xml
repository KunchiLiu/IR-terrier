	<brief_summary>This study evaluate response long-term effect alpha-interferon patient lymphomatoid granulomatosis ( LYG ) . The disease cause proliferation destructive cell involve lung , skin , kidney , central nervous system . Patients age 12 old LYG pregnant breast feeding may eligible study . Alpha interferon chemotherapy , , use . Alpha interferon protein body naturally produce . If patient grade 3 disease , usually receive EPOCH-rituximab ( EPOCH-R ) chemotherapy ( letter represent drug ) . If patient grade 1 2 disease , usually receive alpha interferon . If patient LYG receive alpha interferon and/or EPOCH-R , may receive rituximab alone alpha interferon . Rituximab antibody , bind specific molecule ( CD20 ) present B-cell lymphoma . Doses several drug EPOCH-R may increase patient tolerate previous cycle . If patient respond EPOCH-R still low grade LYG , may receive alpha interferon . Researchers also try obtain biopsy patient lesion , help understanding disease . Patients self-administer alpha interferon injection skin three time weekly . They visit clinic every 2 12 week follow-up . Patients receive alpha interferon 1 year LYG go away , depend response . EPOCH-R drug : rituximab vein Day 1 ; prednisone mouth Days 1 5 ; etoposide , doxorubicin , vincristine continuous intravenous infusion Days 1 5 ; cyclophosphamide intravenous injection 1 hour Day 5 . Each cycle last 3 week : 5 day chemotherapy 16 day chemotherapy . Etoposide , doxorubicin , vincristine infuse small pump worn patient . The drug give 5 day central intravenous catheter . There two cycle EPOCH-R beyond maximum response , six cycle minimum . To reduce harm bone marrow , patient receive granulocyte colony stimulate factor ( G-CSF ) , self-administered injection skin daily approximately 10 day chemotherapy cycle . If end therapy , patient complete response , treatment stop . If residual low grade disease , patient may receive alpha interferon . Alpha interferon flu-like side effect headache , fever , chill , body ache . EPOCH-R drug cause gastrointestinal problem , hair loss , weakness . G-CSF cause bone pain , body ache , hair thin . Chemotherapy cause patient develop leukemia . This study may may direct benefit participant . It certain whether new therapy help decrease tumor . However , knowledge gain may improve understand treatment LYG .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - Lymphomatoid granulomatosis ( LYG ) angiocentric destructive proliferation lymphoid cell predominantly involve lung , skin , kidney , central nervous system . - It divide three grade , depend degree necrosis cellular atypia . The grades disease histologically-based necessarily correlate clinical outcome . However , like EBV relate LPD 's , LYG transform aggressive large B-cell lymphoma , would include within grade 3 category . It important note grade 3 lesion large B-cell lymphoma . - Current evidence show LYG disease B cell . OBJECTIVES : - To determine response long-term efficacy alpha-Interferon patient lymphomatoid granulomatosis ( LYG ) . - To determine response long-term efficacy dose-adjusted ( DA ) -EPOCH-R chemotherapy patient grade 3 LYG patient fail interferon . ELIGIBILITY : - Patients must tissue diagnosis grade 1 , 2 and/or 3 A/B LYG ( diagnosis consistent LYG ) confirm Laboratory Pathology , NCI . - Patients stage disease eligible . - Previously untreated treated patient eligible . - Patients age 12 old eligible . - Female patient pregnant lactate eligible receive treatment follow natural history . DESIGN : - Interferon use initial treatment patient grade 1 2 LYG . Patients receive interferon one year past CR . - Patients progress interferon , patient grade 3 LYG receive aggressive combination chemotherapy DA-EPOCH-R ( rituximab , etoposide , doxorubicin , vincristine , cyclophosphamide prednisone ) . - Patients fail one treatment approach may cross . - A total 90 patient enrol single institution .</detailed_description>

Final histopathologic classification pathologic grade determine Stephania Pittaluga , M.D . designee . Patients stage disease eligible . Previously untreated treat patient eligible . Patients age 12 old eligible . Informed consent must obtain . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Female patient pregnant lactate eligible receive treatment follow natural history . Patients history coronary artery disease angina pectoris , history congestive heart failure eligible receive . DAEpochR chemotherapy . Patients significant renal ( Cr . great 1.5 mg/dl creatinine le 40 cc/min ) hepatic ( bilirubin great 2.5 u ) dysfunction due tumor involvement eligible receive DAEPOCHR chemotherapy . Patients opinion principle investigator poor psychiatric medical risk eligible . Patients receive &gt; 450 mg/m2 doxorubicin cardiac ejection fraction echocardiogram less equal 40 % protocol entry eligible receive DAEPOCHR .</criteria>
