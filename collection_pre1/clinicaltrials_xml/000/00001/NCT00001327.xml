	<brief_summary>The brain spinal cord surround fluid call cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) . The CSF flow channel brain around spinal cord . Occasionally , people bear malformation channel . Syringomyelia pocket within CSF channel result abnormal CSF flow . Syringomyelia associate problem nervous system . Patients syringomyelia may unable detect sensation pain heat . If condition treat worsen . Treatment condition surgical . It require flow CSF return normal . There many different treatment option , one procedure show significantly well . In study , researcher would like learn CSF pressure flow contribute progression syringomyelia . Ultrasounds magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use evaluate anatomy brain . Researchers hope information gather anatomy measure CSF pressure flow use later develop optimal surgical treatment syringomyelia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study establish mechanism development progression syringomyelia . Although syringomyelia usually accompany anatomic abnormality craniocervical junction , pathophysiology relates anatomic abnormality syringomyelia development progression controversial . We test hypothesis progression syringomyelia associate Chiari I malformation produce cerebellar tonsil partially occlude subarachnoid space foramen magnum act piston partially enclose spinal subarachnoid space , create enlarge cervical subarachnoid pressure wave compress spinal cord without , within , propagate syrinx fluid caudally heartbeat , lead syrinx progression . We also test hypothesis development syringomyelia result increase transit CSF spinal cord parenchyma syrinx . Patients treat posterior fossa craniectomy , upper cervical laminectomy , duroplasty . We evaluate cerebrospinal fluid flow pressure , syrinx size , neurologic function , rate entrance CSF syrinx surgery . These study intraoperative evaluation movement cerebellar tonsil wall syrinx provide data elucidate hydrodynamic mechanism development progression syringomyelia . The best treatment type syringomyelia establish . Present surgical treatment result disease stabilization many , patient , although objective improvement less common . Delayed deterioration uncommon . Correlation anatomic physiologic measurement provide data indicate mode development progression syringomyelia may implications optimal treatment syringomyelia .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : To eligible participate research study , subject must : Be 18 year age old . Have syringomyelia . Have lesion narrow space spinal fluid base skull neck . Prior surgery syringomyelia result exclusion study radiographic evidence syrinx evidence neurological deterioration relate syrinx . Be able give inform consent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : The subject eligible participate research study subject : Is pregnant ( Xrays might injure fetus ) . Can MRI scan determine radiologist . Has problem bleeding correct . Is unable understand risk test surgical therapy . Has blood test HIV ( virus cause AIDS ) positive , positive HIV test would increase risk infection research testing .</criteria>
