	<brief_summary>Much kidney disorder learn determine kidney function . This research propose study kidney function several parameter know glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) , Renal Plasma Flow ( RPF ) , Glomerular Capillary Wall Permselectivity . The study select patient suffer different type kidney disease . These patient select base presence significant amount protein urine ( proteinuria ) . Standard blood urine test often unable provide completely accurate information kidney . In order researcher accurate idea kidney function , use alternative test . Test material ( para aminohippurate inulin ) inject patient vein provide information base filtration kidney .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study various kidney disorder facilitate determination true glomerular filtration rate and/or effective renal plasma flow employ inulin non-radioactive iothalamate and/or para aminohippurate ( PAH ) , respectively . Selected patient proteinuria ask participate study glomerular capillary wall permselectivity calculate fractional clearance endogenous protein , albumin IgG fractional clearance polydisperse neutral dextran effective molecular radius range 20-60 angstrom . To achieve , low molecular weight dextran administer slow IV injection immediately follow inulin iothalamate and/or PAH priming dos . Glomerular filtration rate , effective renal plasma flow and/or glomerular permselectivity measure simultaneously standard hydrate urinary clearance study . Timed urine blood collection obtain , typically require total 60 90 minute . The total test time , include pre-test hydration , 4 5 hour . Alternatively , glomerular filtration rate measure one two plasma clearance method require urine collection . For one method , steady-state plasma concentration iothalamate achieve ambulatory patient 24-hour subcutaneous infusion iothalamate use insulin pump . For second method , decline plasma concentration iothalamate measure intravenous dose iothalamate .</detailed_description>
