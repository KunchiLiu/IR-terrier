	<detailed_description>Background : - Central nervous system toxicity recognize side effect certain cancer therapy , particularly cranial irradiation , intrathecal therapy systemic high-dose chemotherapy . - The pathophysiologic mechanism well-defined clinical manifestation vary . Previous study define MRI change correlate neurocognitive deficiency inconsistent . - Recent advance brain imaging may help good define neurotoxic effect . ( 1 ) H-NMRS noninvasive method obtain vivo biochemical information brain . It use study patient CNS disorder , include neuronal disorder . Objective : -To identify specific pattern brain metabolite associate therapy-related neurotoxicity use ( 1 ) H-NMRS cancer patient receive receive potentially neurotoxic therapy . Eligibility : -Patients brain tumor patient receive high-dose systemic chemotherapy , intrathecal chemotherapy ( lumbar puncture intra-Ommaya ) , cranial radiation therapy OR patient document suspected clinical neurotoxicity presume caused treatment cancer . Design : - In order identify metabolite profile may associate neurotoxicity , NMRS data collect cross-sectional manner patient various stage treatment longitudinally throughout course therapy . - NMRS study perform patient enter study follow time : prior therapy , immediately first cycle therapy , prior subsequent cycle therapy , completion therapy . - Neurotoxicity also evaluate neuropsychological testing .</detailed_description>
