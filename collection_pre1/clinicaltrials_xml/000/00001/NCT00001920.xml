	<brief_summary>The purpose study explore brain work particular memory task people schizophrenia healthy volunteer . Research show patient schizophrenia structural functional abnormality hippocampus cerebellum brain . These abnormality likely associated memory impairment experience patient . Eye blink test provide information memory acquisition involve cerebellar hippocampal region . By alter stimuli interval , test distinguish cerebellum-dependent memory associate subliminal mnemonic encode hippocampus-dependent memory associate conscious awareness . This study use eyeblink test determine type memory predominantly affect schizophrenia . Participants study screen physical psychiatric examination . Participants electroencephalogram ( EEG ) , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , electrodermal test . Evoked potential magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan brain may also take .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eyeblink condition paradigm allows study aspect neural mechanism memory human . This paradigm extensively studied animal human being functional neuroanatomy appear well understood , involve hippocampus cerebellum . The performance task likely independent subject motivation . Moreover , manipulation interval condition unconditioned stimulus allow study subliminal form mnemonic encoding ( `` delay '' task ) well learn associate conscious awareness ( `` trace '' task ) . This make eyeblink condition particularly suit study patient population , particularly schizophrenia motivation attention frequently confound factor study memory process . Patients schizophrenia report hippocampal possibly cerebellar structural functional abnormality , however eyeblink condition minimally study patient population . We expect implicit form memory ( cerebellum dependent ) relatively spared compare declarative memory ( hippocampus dependent ) schizophrenia . We would like test hypothesis patient schizophrenia deficit acquire trace form task oppose delay , assume would unimpaired compare normal control . We would also like study heart rate skin conductance change occur conditioning , since patient schizophrenia show impaired autonomic function . We also plan study neurophysiological correlate behavior evoke response potential ( EP ) eventually functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) We expect EPs show significant change relation development behavioral response . The association awareness stimulus contingency slow cortical potential EEG also interest .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Controls : No psychiatric severe chronic medical illness time study , history . This include absence substance abuse history , learn disability DSM IV disorder . Medical history evaluate investigator medical condition judge interfere study may allow . No use psychotropic substance last 3 month . Age 1860 . No family history schizophrenia subject report possibly also collateral report least one family member . Patients : Schizophrenia , subtype schizoaffective disorder , depress type DSM IV ( 110 ) . Only concomitant medication neuroleptic medication direct control side effect ( e.g . anticholinergic ) . An effort make recruit patient atypical neuroleptic , therefore attempt minimize anticholinergic , might interfere acquisition condition response . When patient anticholinergic treatment recruited inpatient , clinical evaluation risk benefit suspend anticholinergic treatment make discussed patient . Anticholinergics withdrawn period equivalent 3 half life drug attempt study , judge achievable relatively low risk patient agree . Age1860 . EXCLUSION CRITERIA Controls Patients : Impaired hearing . Use caffeine tobacco 2 hour precede test . Head trauma loss consciousness last year , evidence functional impairment due persist head trauma . All subject unable withstand eyeblink test exclude . Subjects able participate MRI ( e.g . due claustrophobia ) study achieve large group behavioral experiment . Subjects find eye lesion exam . Patients healthy volunteer know risk exposure high magnetic field ( e.g . patient pace maker ) metallic implant ( e.g . brace ) head region ( likely create artifact MRI scan ) exclude participate MRI study . Patients : Coexistence another major mental illness time study . If patient experience mental illness past ( e.g . learn disability major depression ) , judge fully recover . Criteria substance abuse meet last 6 month . Criteria substance dependence meet last year . If criterion dependence meet past , duration disorder less 3 year , judge produce long term brain change allow patient study . Major concurrent medical illness likely interfere acquisition task . Concomitant medication could interfere performance task , exclude neuroleptic . Presence diskinetic movement face tongue ( likely interfere eyeblink measure , gross involuntary movement whole body ( likely interfere position MRI scanner ) . Pregnancy test performed woman childbearing age within three day prior MRI scan . Siblings Patients Schizophrenia : The inclusion criterion normal volunteer , exception family history , course . In addition , inclusion criterion protocol # 95M0150 apply . The exclusion criterion normal volunteer apply .</criteria>
