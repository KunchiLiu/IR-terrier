	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety immune system effect infuse HIV-infected patient multiple dos lymphocyte ( white blood cell ) non-infected identical twin . It determine whether donate lymphocyte improve immune function reduce viral load infect twin . Identical twin pairs-one infect HIV-1 one negative virus-may eligible study . Candidates screen blood test , medical history physical examination . Both twin participant receive tetanus booster shot , need . The non-infected twin undergo apheresis collect white blood cell . For procedure , whole blood collect , similar procedure donate unit blood needle arm . The blood flow cell separator machine white cell remove , rest blood ( red cell , plasma platelet ) return donor catheter opposite arm . The collected lymphocyte give intravenously ( vein ) infect twin 60-minute period . This procedure-apheresis infusions-will repeat 4 day week complete one cycle . The cycle repeat every 8 week 6 cycle ( 1 year ) . The infected twin blood sample draw first day cycle , 2 week begin cycle , 4 week cycle evaluate immune status , viral load safety parameter . The frequency blood test may change study progress . The infected twin also undergo apheresis immediately cycle infusion one month later test white cell certain immune feature . The number apheresis procedure may reduce study proceeds .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This phase I/II study evaluate safety , immunologic effect , potential efficacy repeat infusion syngeneic lymphocyte obtain HIV-1 seronegative identical twin give set maximum anti-retroviral therapy . Unfractionated lymphocyte seronegative twin obtain lymphocytapheresis directly transfer HIV-1 seropositive twin . Four separate lymphocytaphereses transfer perform one week , cycle may repeat frequently every 8 week total 6 cycle . The recipient twin monitor general health status , immunologic improvement , depletion within CD4+ T-cell repertoire , HIV-1 viral load .</detailed_description>
