	<brief_summary>This study determine whether patient infected Lyme bacteria , Borrelia burgdorferi , treat antibiotic still bacteria alive inside whether cause symptom . The information study may serve basis develop stringent diagnostic criterion Lyme disease establishment future treatment trial . Individuals follow category may eligible study : chronic Lyme disease ; chronic Lyme arthritis ; seropositive control ( infect bacteria cause Lyme disease disease symptom ) ; recover control ( sick Lyme disease treat successfully currently well ) ; control multiple sclerosis ( patient multiple sclerosis ) ; healthy volunteer . Patients chronic Lyme disease category must age 13 ; others must age18 . Candidates screen blood urine test . Participants physical examination follow test : Blood test Includes HLA-typing , genetic test immune system marker ; Leukapheresis Collection large number white blood cell Whole blood collect needle arm vein . The blood circulates machine separate component . The white cell remove rest blood return body , either needle use draw blood another needle arm . ( Alternatively , patient 100 cc ( 7 tablespoon ) blood drawn . ) ; Lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) Collection cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF , fluid bathe brain spinal cord ) . A local anesthetic administer needle inserted space bone low back cerebrospinal fluid circulate spinal cord . A small amount fluid collect needle ; Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain Imaging brain use strong magnetic field radio wave instead X-rays . During scan , patient lie table narrow cylinder contain magnetic field . He speak staff member via intercom time procedure ; Neuropsychologic testing ; Some participant may also hear test urine collection . Participants whose test result positive Borrelia burgdorferi follow NIH interval 3 6 month determine whether infection . Those infected offer treatment antibiotic ceftriaxone . Following treatment , patient return NIH Clinical Center follow-up visit 1 week treatment 3 , 6 12 month . The lumbar puncture , hear examination , blood urine test repeat visit evaluate response treatment , leukapheresis repeat research purpose . Patients whose MRI abnormal therapy repeat MRI 3-month , 6-month 1-year visit . All participant chronic Lyme disease , chronic Lyme arthritis , seropositive control recover control may reevaluate interval 6 12 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Lyme Disease : Clinical , Microbiological Immunological Characteristics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lyme disease emerge lead vector-borne disease United States . Despite much learn Lyme borreliosis past decade , still many remain area uncertainty . One fundamental question whether persistent sign symptom disease , despite administration currently consider adequate antibiotic therapy , due ongoing active borrelial infection , post-infectious syndrome , irreversible sequela earlier tissue injury due condition unrelated Lyme disease . Reliable objective marker infection , clinical status host response organism require discern scope implication persistent borrelial infection , effectiveness current treatment option , development new therapeutic approach . The goal study assemble follow well-characterized cohort patient post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome relevant control yield prospective database upon stringent diagnostic criterion establish future therapeutic trial design .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Screening : Age great equal 13 year old . Suspect suffer Lyme disease . PostTreatment Lyme Disease Syndrome ( PTLDS ) : For purpose study , PTLDS define occur male female patient age 13 diagnose confirm Lyme disease , receive recommended antibiotic therapy persistent relapse symptom and/or sign least six month therapy . They also document explanation sign symptom positive serum antibody B.burgdorferi confirm Western blot accord CDC criterion ( IgG immunoblot consider positive five follow 10 band present : 18 kDa , 21 kDa ( OspC ) , 28 kDa , 30 kDa , 39 kDa , 41 kDa ( Fla ) , 45 kDa , 58 kDa ( GroEL ) , 66 kDa , 93 kDa ) . Lyme arthritis control : For purpose study , Lyme arthritis define occur otherwise healthy male female age 18 intermittent episode arthritis involve one joint , without cause document , positive serum antibody B.burgdorferi confirm Western blot accord CDC criterion . Recovered Controls : For purpose study , recover control define otherwise healthy male female age 18 Lyme disease , fulfil CDC Lyme Disease National Surveillance Case Definition receive accepted antibiotic treatment Lyme disease ( least 3 month since end antibiotic therapy protocol evaluation ) currently asymptomatic . Seropositive Controls : For purpose study , serpositive control define otherwise healthy male female age 18 positive serum IgG antibody B.burgdorferi Western blot accord CDC criterion asymptomatic recall episode disease compatible Lyme infection receive antibiotic therapy Lyme disease . OspA vaccinate control : For purpose study , OspA vaccinate control define otherwise healthy male female age 18 receive least two dos OspA vaccine Lyme disease ( Lymerix [ R ] ) . These control may positive ELISA B.burgdorferi negative ( unreadable ) IgG western blot . Multiple sclerosis control : For purpose study , multiple sclerosis control define otherwise healthy male female age 18 relapsingremitting progressive multiple sclerosis define Clinical Trial Committee National Multiple Sclerosis Society evidence prior exposure B.burgdorferi indicate negative history Lyme disease negative Western blot B.burgdorferi serum CDC criterion . Patients Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) 1 5 . Healthy Volunteers : For purpose study , healthy volunteer define healthy male female , age 18 , history compatible acute chronic Lyme disease negative western blot B.burgdorferi serum CDC criterion . All study participant must agree allow sample use future research . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : General exclusion criterion : Age le 18 ( less 13 patient chronic Lyme disease ) . Weight le 70 Lb ( 35 kg ) . Pregnancy lactation . Women childbearing potential sexually active unwilling use effective contraception . Clinically significant laboratory abnormality include positive test syphilis ( RPR ) , HBsAg , antiHCV , antiHIV . Chronic medication use evaluate casebycase basis . Not able understand requirement study unable give inform consent and/or comply aspects evaluation . EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PTLDS PATIENTS AND LYME ARTHRITIS CONTROLS : In addition general exclusion criterion , individual exclude : 1 . Use immunosuppressive drug systemic ( topical inhalant ) steroids cytotoxic agent . 2 . History recognize autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis , vasculitis , systemic erythematous lupus , etc . 3 . Serious preexist concurrent chronic medical psychiatric illness Lyme disease . 4 . Past history significant head trauma , alcohol substance abuse past 5 year medical illness might produce neurologic deficit ( cerebrovascular disease ) . 5 . Use systemic antibiotic previous month . 6 . Use immunomodulators interferon . 7 . Chronic medication use evaluate casebycase basis . 8 . Patients exclude protocol judged principal investigator significant impairment capacity judgment reason compromise ability make decision best interest . EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR RECOVERED , SEROPOSITIVE , OSPA VACCINATED AND HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS CONTROLS : In addition applicable exclusion criterion ( general exclusion criterion exclusion criterion PTLDS patient Lyme arthritis control ) , individual exclude : 1 . Preexisting concurrent serious chronic medical psychiatric illness . EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS CONTROLS : In addition general exclusion criterion , individual exclude : 1 . Preexisting concurrent serious psychiatric chronic medical illness besides Multiple Sclerosis . 2 . Past history significant head trauma , alcohol substance abuse past 5 year medical illness , besides Multiple Sclerosis , might produce neurologic deficit ( cerebrovascular disease ) . 3 . Previously receive total lymphoid irradiation ( TLI ) cladribine . 4 . Has use immunoactive medication ( exclude betainterferon ) three month precede study . 5 .
