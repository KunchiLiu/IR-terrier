	<brief_summary>This protocol test humanize monoclonal antibody know Campath-1H ability induce state permanent allograft acceptance , tolerance , administer combination brief course immunosuppressive drug deoxyspergualin ( DSG ) time human renal allotransplantation . Campath-1H specific common lymphocyte monocyte antigen CD52 . Its administration temporarily deplete mature lymphocytes monocyte without alter neutrophil hematopoietic stem cell . Deoxyspergualin inhibit NFkB pathway thus prevent monocyte macrophage activation . Recipients live cadaveric donor kidney treat one dose Campath-1H prior transplantation insure peripheral depletion achieve time graft reperfusion .

In addition , patient treat DSG 14 day begin day prior surgery . This trial expand pilot study NIH 15 patient Campath give alone time transplantation . In study , excellent peripheral depletion occur one dose Campath though central depletion require additional dosing . This allow greatly reduce immunosuppression use prevent rejection , date , patient require immunosuppressive medication . It hop addition DSG eliminate need long-term immunosuppression . Patients follow closely post transplant period . If patient experience rejection , treat methylprednisolone immunosuppression add use sirolimus predominant immunosuppressive agent .

In addition evaluate graft function follow transplantation , protocol also characterize evaluate function immune system composition T cell repertoire follow administration Campath-1H DSG , immune system recovery transplantation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This protocol test humanize monoclonal antibody know Campath-1H ability induce state permanent allograft acceptance , tolerance , administer combination brief course immunosuppressive drug deoxyspergualin ( DSG ) time human renal allotransplantation . Campath-1H specific common lymphocyte monocyte antigen CD52 . Its administration temporarily deplete mature lymphocytes monocyte without alter neutrophil hematopoietic stem cell . Deoxyspergualin inhibit Rel-B/ NFkB pathway thus prevent monocyte macrophage activation . Extensive preliminary data accumulate human use Campath-1H non-humanized predecessor . Additionally , data generate use similar deplete scheme without DSG non-human primate . Both human non-human primate data suggest profound mature mononuclear cell depletion establish window opportunity foreign tissue transplant without need additional immunosuppression . Regulatory event occur mature cell repopulation presence allografted tissue create state graft may reject even absence chronic immunosuppression . Recipients live cadaveric donor kidney treat one dose Campath-1H prior transplantation insure peripheral depletion achieve time graft reperfusion . Three subsequent dose Campath-1H administer first , third fifth day transplant deplete passenger donor leukocytes residual recipient cell mobilize response allograft . In addition , patient treat DSG 4mg/kg/d x 1 begin day 12 2.5 mg/kg/d additional 13 day . This trial expand pilot study NIH 17 patient Campath dose prior transplantation without DSG . In study , excellent peripheral depletion occur one dose Campath though central depletion require additional dosing . Thus , goal pre-reperfusion depletion achieve single pre-operative dose thorough depletion require additional post-operative dosing . Lasting rejection-free survival realize without addition , albeit reduce immunosuppression . This thought due residual post-operative monocyte infiltrate allograft cause modest reversible allograft dysfunction . The current dosing regimen DSG thus design accomplish pre-operative depletion , thorough post operative elimination donor recipient cell mobilize result reperfusion , combine therapy aim prevent activation monocyte escape depletion . The timing DSG mean correspond peripheral repopulation monocyte see previous patient . Patients follow closely post transplant period evidence detrimental immune response allograft . In previous patient experience graft direct immunity graft dysfunction precede rise activate monocyte peripheral blood augment transcription cytokine Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha ( TNF-a ) allograft . This syndrome resistant treatment TNF-a sequestrant Infliximab think require comprehensive monocyte direct therapy . If patient progress graft dysfunction occurs , patient treat methylprednisolone immunosuppression add use sirolimus predominant immunosuppressive agent . This maneuver case successful return allograft normal function . Sirolimus chosen since act interfere specific T cell receptor function , thus , provide immunosuppressive coverage cell repopulation without interfere antigen specific T cell event important tolerance induction . Non-human primate human clinical data support approach . In addition evaluate graft patient outcome follow transplantation , protocol also characterize evaluate function immune system composition T cell repertoire follow administration Campath-1H DSG , immune system recovery transplantation .</detailed_description>
