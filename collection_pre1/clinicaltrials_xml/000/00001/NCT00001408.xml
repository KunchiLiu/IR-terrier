	<brief_summary>This study examine movement T cell ( type white blood cell ) blood lung patient asthma exposure allergen , cat dander pollen . Asthma large part due inflammation bronchus ( breathe tube lung ) , cause heat , swell redness . T cell play major role inflammatory reaction . A good understanding T cell migration lung allergen exposure may lead improved therapy asthma . Patients 18 50 year age mild allergic asthma may eligible study . In addition , patient healthy normal volunteer 18 65 year age may participate sub-study ( blood draw ) protocol . Participants undergo follow procedure : Visit 1 ( screen visit ) - Blood test blood count HIV - Urine pregnancy test woman childbearing potential . Visit 2 - Physical examination electrocardiogram ( EKG ) - Prick skin test - A drop allergen extract put skin underlying skin scratch needle . A positive test resembles insect bite may itch . - Intradermal skin test - Increasing concentration drop dilute allergen inject skin allergic response monitor 5-mm swelling ( 1/4 inch ) swell develops . - Methacholine challenge - The subject repeat pulmonary function ( breathe ) test breathe methacholine , drug temporarily ( 5 10 minute ) worsen asthma symptom . - Physician evaluation repeat pulmonary function test Visit 3 - Allergen bronchoprovocation - This test do patient whose physical evaluation breathe test permit continue study . A heparin lock ( needle device stay vein allow multiple blood draw without repeated stick ) place . The subject breathes 5 breath allergen nebulizer ( device create mist ) , follow breathing test . This procedure repeat increasingly high allergen dos lung function significantly decline maximum 6 dos . Subjects monitor 8 hour last dose . Blood sample 50 ml ( 3.5 tablespoon ) collect 1 , 3 , 5 8 hour , physician evaluation do end 8 hour . Additional 50-mm blood sample collect follow two morning . Visit 4 - Physician evaluation , blood test anemia pulmonary function test - Serial blood draw - 50 ml blood drawn , follow salt-water nebulization another 50-ml blood draw 1 hour . Additional 50-ml blood sample draw 7 hour later next two morning . Participants sub-study portion protocol undergo screen blood test , prick skin testing , breathe test methacholine inhalation 100 ml-blood draw . These test do three session .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In last 10 year become generally accept asthma inflammatory disease airway . T lymphocytes play key role regulate inflammatory response , elaboration cytokine IL-4 , IL-5 , IFN-gamma . IL-5 particular interest major eosinophil survival factor vivo . Eosinophils felt major effector cell asthma , cause damage various airway structure . The pulmonary late phase response , worsen airflow see 4-8 hour allergen inhalation , associate many inflammatory change see chronic asthma . Current study suggest late phase response peripheral blood T cell traffic lung express cytokine , specifically IL-4 IL-5 . We propose investigate trafficking determine frequency phenotype cell capable produce cytokine peripheral blood subject mild allergic asthma . These study lead clear understanding cell process lead T cell traffic lung may yield tool evaluate propose anti-inflammatory therapy asthma .</detailed_description>
