	<brief_summary>Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) technique use investigate activity area brain . The PET technique allow researcher study normal process brain ( central nervous system ) normal individual patient neurologic illness without physical / structural damage brain . When region brain active , use fuel form oxygen sugar ( glucose ) . As brain use fuel produce waste product , carbon dioxide water . Blood carry fuel brain waste product away brain . As brain activity increase , blood flow area activity also increase . This known regional cerebral blood flow ( rCBF ) . Knowing fact , researcher use radioactive water ( H215O ) PET scan observe area brain receiving blood flow . In study researcher plan investigate change regional cerebral blood flow ( rCBF ) patient participate different activity . The activity design stimulate area brain responsible voluntary motor activity sensation . By compare result PET scan perform different condition , researcher locate region brain responsible specific task . This study provide new information voluntary movement human preparation involve controlling .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main purpose study present protocol investigate physiology motor control health well pathophysiological modification take place disease . To end , investigate change regional cerebral blood flow ( rCBF ) index regional neuronal activity , associate various motor sensory task use Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) . The rCBF obtain measure distribution cerebral radioactivity emission scan follow intravenous bolus injection 15O-labeled water . The short half-life 15O ( 2 minute ) allow u measure rCBF repeatedly different task condition ( see methodology experimental procedure ) . With comparison PET scan perform different condition , detect specific task-related activated region . PET image coregistered high resolution Magnetic Resonance Images ( MRI ) get accurate anatomical information regard activate area . The result correlate physiological approach include Electroencephalography ( EEG ) , Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) , functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) , Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( MRS ) . These study provide new information executive component voluntary movement human also different organizational aspect preparatory process control .</detailed_description>
