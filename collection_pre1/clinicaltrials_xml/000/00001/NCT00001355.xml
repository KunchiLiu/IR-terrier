	<brief_summary>This protocol design evaluate select patient document recurrent unusual infection family member clinical laboratory correlate immune abnormality . It allow long term follow patient host defense defect permit periodic study blood , urine , saliva , skin , stool vaginal specimen wound drainage patient family member medically indicated purpose research study relate understanding genetic biochemical base diseases . This protocol may help provide patient material development therapy diseases . This study : 1 . Determine biochemical genetic cause inherit immune disease affect phagocyte ( white blood cell defend bacterial fungal infection ) 2 . Try develop good way diagnose treat patient disease , prevent , diagnose treat infection Patients family member may undergo follow procedure : - A personal family medical history , physical examination procedure , may include various blood test ; urinalysis ; saliva collection ; image study chest X-ray , compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ; lung function study , dental examination eye examination , medically indicate . - Patients drain wound fluid collect wound biochemical study . - Tissues remove part medical care , piece lung , liver , teeth , biopsy tissue study . - Patients immune problem investigator wish study ask return NIH follow-up visit irregular interval , least every 6 month . The visit include updated medical history , examination direct particular medical problem relate immune disorder , follow-up abnormal test treatment , collection blood , saliva , urine , wound fluid study . - Patients may genetic test must willing specimen store future research . - Family member medical history , saliva urine collection , chest X-ray imaging study , medically indicate . - Normal volunteer tissue biopsy piece tissue remove part medical care , piece lung , liver , teeth , tissue study . - NIH cover cost initial screen visit travel lodging . A financial assessment may determine patient eligible financial assistance . This study enroll child age 2 . - Patients ask obtain medical record , previous test result , image study prior first visit .</brief_summary>
