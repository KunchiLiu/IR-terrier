	<brief_summary>It commonly believe object world categorize least three different way level . The three level basic , superordinate , subordinate . Previously believe basic categorization present cognitive ( mental ) advantage child 's development . However , recent study superordinate categorization challenge belief . 1 . &lt; TAB &gt; Items superordinate group accord functional purpose , even though may share similarity look ( perception ) . For instance , desk , chair , bed appear similar group together superordinate category furniture . 2 . &lt; TAB &gt; Items basic categorization share similarities function perception . For instance , chair consider basic category . Chairs share functional perceptual similarity many kind chair readily distinguish type furniture like bed desk . 3 . &lt; TAB &gt; Subordinate category subsets basic category . For instance , kitchen chair , desk chair , high chair , within basic category chair . Each one similar 's function others definitely discriminable . This study develop investigate development categorization three level use design child age 1 3 year test categorization three level set object domain ( vehicle fruit ) . Researchers plan chart infant develop categorization basic , subordinate , superordinate level two-year period. &lt; TAB &gt;</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The major objective research well understand functional significance object categorization early development . The proposed work design examine emergence organization toddler internal representation real-world category furniture fruit . Representation , capacity , refers simply store information influence later behavior . Categorization refers treatment discriminable equivalent way . Even young infant appear capable categorize diverse set discriminable pattern object , form internal representation bound collection . Much less know , however , change lead basic capacity highly structure concept characteristic child adult category knowledge . The present research design characterize course change infancy childhood . The primary research strategy use consist analyze toddler examination manipulation familiar object similar within adult-defined category category . The organization temporal structure child action object cod analyzed infer similarity relation perceive among stimulus set .</detailed_description>
