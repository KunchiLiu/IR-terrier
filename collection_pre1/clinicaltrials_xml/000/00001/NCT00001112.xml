	<brief_summary>To find four dos ( recombinant ) human interferon gamma ( IFN-G ) effective stimulate white blood cell ( monocyte ) fight infection see treatment IFN-G strengthen ability AIDS patient control infection . This study also determine long single injection IFN-G white blood cell remain stimulated . AIDS disease progressively destroy aspect body 's defense call immune system . It particularly harmful class cell call helper T-lymphocytes . The specific opportunistic infection malignancy associate AIDS treat therapy often poorly tolerate patient associate dose-limiting toxicity . The principal focus AIDS therapy research present control underlie retroviral infection restore immune function recombinant lymphokine , adoptive immunotherapy , and/or lymphocyte transplant . These treatment include zidovudine ( AZT ) , show control HIV infection , IFN-G , lymphokine activate tumor-destroying germ-killing function . Studies need find dose IFN-G work best .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>AIDS disease progressively destroy aspect body 's defense call immune system . It particularly harmful class cell call helper T-lymphocytes . The specific opportunistic infection malignancy associate AIDS treat therapy often poorly tolerate patient associate dose-limiting toxicity . The principal focus AIDS therapy research present control underlie retroviral infection restore immune function recombinant lymphokine , adoptive immunotherapy , and/or lymphocyte transplant . These treatment include zidovudine ( AZT ) , show control HIV infection , IFN-G , lymphokine activate tumor-destroying germ-killing function . Studies need find dose IFN-G work best . Patients , may participate three part study , maintain stable dose AZT . In part A ( optimal dose ) , five AIDS patient AIDS relate opportunistic infection receive 4 once-weekly increase dos IFN-G. Monocyte antimicrobial activity examine test tube study injection IFN-G . In part B , five patient receive optimal dose IFN-G establish part A . Patients enrol part A complete least 2 week part A enrol part B. Antimicrobial activity examine 1 , 2 , 3 day single injection optimal dose IFN-G ( determine part A ) . In part C ( safety tolerance combine treatment IFN-G AZT ) , patient treat IFN-G 4 week use optimal dose administration schedule derive part A B .</detailed_description>
