	<brief_summary>The human heart divide four chamber . One four chamber , leave ventricle , chamber mainly responsible pump blood heart circulation . There inherited condition affect heart , pass genetics , hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) . HCM cause left ventricle become abnormally enlarged ( left ventricular hypertrophy LVH ) . Some patient abnormal gene may cause HCM characteristic LVH . Approximately 20 - 40 % patient genetic abnormality ( missense mutation gene encode sarcomeric protein ) actually enlarge left ventricle . Because , researcher believe may factor , along genetic abnormality contribute development HCM . Researchers interested learning several factor suspect may play role development HCM . Specifically , researcher plan study level hormone protein attache , may contribute development abnormally enlarge heart . Insulin-like growth factor ( IGF-1 ) insulin-like growth factor bind protein ( IGFBP ) work together growth hormone ( GH ) development maturation many organ system . Previous study suggest hormone affect development function heart . Patients participate study undergo variety test include collection blood sample , echocardiogram heart , treadmill exercise test , continuous electrical monitoring heart activity ( Holter monitor ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Factors Contributing Increased Left Ventricle Size Patients With Abnormally Enlarged Hearts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) genetic disease autosomal dominant pattern inheritance characterize leave ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ) . HCM often cause missense mutation gene encode sarcomeric protein . The LVH varies markedly patient identical sarcomeric gene mutation , notably , 20 40 % subject disease mutation LVH assess echocardiography . These finding suggest factor affect LV wall thickness HCM . We wish ( 1 ) investigate potential role IGF-I binding protein , IGFBP3 , determine increase LV mass HCM cause sarcomeric mutation ; ( 2 ) ass myocardial ultrasound backscatter , exercise tolerance , propensity arrhythmia , subject inherit sarcomeric mutation LVH .</detailed_description>

Age gendermatched blood relative sarcomeric gene mutation without LVH . Age gendermatched blood relative without sarcomeric gene mutation . EXCLUSION CRITERIA History hypertension ( basal systolic diastolic pressure 170 mm Hg 95 mm Hg , respectively ) another systemic cardiac disease may cause cardiac hypertrophy . History recent acute illness chronic illness might affect plasma level IGFI IGFBP3 . History thyrotoxicosis , diabetes mellitus abnormally elevate fast blood sugar . Any condition would exclude patient undergo MRI scan .</criteria>
