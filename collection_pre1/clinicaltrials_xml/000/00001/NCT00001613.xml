	<brief_summary>Cataract , lens eye opacified , major cause blindness . This study examine protein material lens call crystallins try determine cause nuclear cataract , type cataract form central lens nucleus . Men woman age 45 year old cataract may eligible study . Candidates screen determine type cataract undergo complete eye examination , include vision test , eye pressure test , examination lens retina . Patients select study complete physical eye examination , include photography various part eye , ultrasound measurement eye . They cataract surgery , either without intraocular lens implantation , follow-up examination 1 week , 3 week , 5 week 8 week surgery . Tissue lenses remove surgery give NEI scientist research cause age-related nuclear cataract .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Progress make elucidate causative factor cataracts little yet know factor involve development aging-related nuclear cataract . The predominant theory nuclear cataractogenesis lens crystallins accumulate covalent modification ultimately lead increased light scatter . This theory base several line evidence . Crystallins , predominant component lens , present high concentration determine refractive property lens . A relationship crystallin alteration cataract formation come study animal cataract model mutation crystallin gene identify . Numerous study also demonstrate covalent modification crystallins occur human lens . These modification report developmentally relate , age relate and/or result toxic environmental influence . Data lab demonstrate human lens crystallins undergo extensive covalent modification part normal lens fiber cell maturation . Crystallin modification cause cataract would superimpose normally occur modification . We begin study protocol entitle `` Use Human Lens Material Possible Causes Cataract '' compare crystallins nuclear cataract normal lens . The goal identify uniquely altered crystallins , isolate modify specie determine covalent modification could possibly involve cataract formation . Surprisingly , preliminary finding indicate pattern protein spot 2-dimensional display total lens protein ( soluble , water insoluble membrane ) nuclear region nuclear cataract essentially find nucleus normal lens . Only relative concentration protein specie vary . The number pure nuclear cataract available 1 ) determine relationship nuclear cataract crystallin covalent modification 2 ) establish significance concentration difference crystallin specie normal lens nuclear cataract . Therefore , purpose protocol recruit enough subject pure nuclear cataract complete study provide significant insight mechanism underlie nuclear cataract .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients cataract screen order determine eligibility . Patients 45 year old either sex clinically significant cataract admit study . Patients require cataract surgery either age related nuclear cataract cortical and/or posterior subcapsular cataract without nuclear cataract ( control ) . Age related nuclear cataract define use LOCS II Clinical Classification Nuclear color 02 , Nuclear Opalescence 25 , Cortical Opacity 01 , PSC 01 . In addition , control , patient either sex clinically significant cortical posterior subcapsular cataract nuclear cataract also recruit . These LOCS grade Nuclear Color 02 , Nuclear Opalescence 01 , Cortical 15 , PSC 1.4 .</criteria>
