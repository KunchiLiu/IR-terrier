	<brief_summary>The purpose study use brain image technology investigate role frontal lobe brain thinking individual schizophrenia neuropsychiatric disorder healthy volunteer . Participants study undergo positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan brain perform neuropsychological test . Some test involve cognitive operation depend upon frontal cortex . Interactions frontal lobe activation , cognitive behavior , neuropharmacology assess measure regional cerebral blood flow ( rCBF ) treatment drug may affect frontal lobe physiology .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose work investigate role frontal lobe , connection cognition health neuropsychiatric disease , particularly schizophrenia . Regional cerebral blood flow ( rCBF ) measure oxygen-15 water positron emission tomography ( PET ) subject perform variety neuropsychological test . Some test involve cognitive operation posit depend upon frontal cortex , use work memory abstract reason problem solving , formation maintenance conceptual set , set shifting , sequence , delayed response ; others control nonspecific sensory motor aspect measurement contrast condition posit depend brain region . Interactions regional activation , cognitive behavior , neuropharmacology assess measure cognitively-related rCBF treatment drug may affect frontal lobe physiology . Hypotheses genetic determinant relationship also test compare rCBF measure across individual harbor different genotype ( detemined protocol 95-M-0150 ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Participants study reflect diversity community . No one exclude discriminated ground race , gender , religion ethnic background . Every attempt make include woman minority study population . Children study radiation exposure limit group . Normal control subject recruit NIH normal volunteer program advertisement community primarily `` Genetic Study '' protocol 95M0150 . An additional control group nonschizophrenic sibling patient schizophrenia also recruit ( community protocol 95M0150 , A Neurobiological Investigation Patients Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders Their Siblings ) . Control subject match patient group age , sex , handedness . Control subject history psychiatric neurologic disorder medical illness surgery might relevance investigation brain physiology exclude . Normal subject take medication relevance cerebral blood flow metabolism exclude study . Patients schizophrenia recruit inpatient population NIMH Wards NIH Clinical Center sibling study protocol 95M0150 . Diagnoses make NIMH clinical staff accordance DSMIV ( R ) . Patients history neurological illness interest study , medical illness surgery might impact study brain physiology , exclude . Inpatients NIMH Schizophrenia Ward sign protocol 89MH160 `` Inpatient Evaluation Neuropsychiatric Patients ) study withdrawn medication two four week . They also study stabilized medication ; however , treatment decision , inpatient outpatient , base upon study . All inpatient carefully monitor NIMH/NIH ward per protocol 89MH160 . Additional neuropsychiatric patient ( affective disorder , Parkinson 's Disease , special genetic disorder ( e.g . William 's Syndrome ) , neuropsychiatric disorder ) recruit medical community , NIH inpatient outpatient service , National Alliance Mentally Ill ( NAMI ) . Patients identify presence typical symptom sign elicit history examination . Diagnoses conform accept diagnostic guideline applicable . Such patient exclude study 1 ) history psychiatric neurologic disorder investigation , 2 ) medical illness surgery might relevance investigation brain physiology , 3 ) current medication investigation relevance cerebral blood flow metabolism , 4 ) IQ le 70 . Outpatients may admit overnight necessary otherwise applicable ( e.g . town ) . No cognitively impaired nonschizophrenic subject study protocol . For Parkinsons Disease patient , information obtain refer physician , NIH medical record participant already enrol NIH system , phone potential participant . Further assessment carry neurologist psychiatrist upon arrival NIH . For Williams syndrome patient , IQ test do offsite certified clinical neuropsychologist refers patient study follow large number rare individual year .</criteria>
