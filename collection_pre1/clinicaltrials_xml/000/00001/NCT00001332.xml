	<criteria>Patients age great equal 18 year . Patients histologically proven gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma , mesothelioma , sarcoma . By standard stag study must evidence advance metastatic intraabdominal disease . Patients minimal extraabdominal metastatic disease symptom exclusively referable advanced intraabdominal malignancy consider study . Specifically , patient gastric cancer bulky N2 lymph node involvement patient primary malignant ascites peritoneal seed would consider optimal candidate . If gross peritoneal disease resect ( i.e. , gross omental implant remove gastrectomy ) , patient still eligible treatment . Patients must recover toxicity prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy ( 30 day ) . Patients must significant systemic illness ( e.g. , infection , cardiovascular , pulmonary ) would preclude operative candidate . patient must life expectancy least 8 week . Performance status ECOG level 0 , 1 , 2 . Patients must adequate renal function ( i.e. , serum creatinine less equal 2.0 creatinine clearance great equal 45 ml/min ) . Patients must HIV negative . Women child bear age must pregnant breast feeding . Patients prior CDDP eligible evidence exist irreversible CDDP toxicity . Patients suspect chronic CDDP toxicity evaluate clinically indicate . Patients may mild elevation ( less 2.0 time normal ) liver function test abnormality consistent advanced intraabdominal cancer . Abnormalities ( great 1 sec normal ) PT PTT severe thrombocytopenia ( le 75 K ) render patient ineligible . A low Hgb secondary chronic tumorrelated , blood loss acceptable patient willing able transfusion . Patients ineligible WBC le 3,000 .</criteria>
