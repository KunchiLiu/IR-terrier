	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All patient refractory solid tumor lymphoma eligible accord criterion list . Patients tumor marker evidence disease , eligible study . A patient must bone scan evidence metastatic disease . Patients must histopathological documentation cancer confirm Laboratory Pathology/NCI Clinical Center National Institutes Health prior start study . Patients must clinically progressive disease document prior entry . Progression must document least one follow parameter : two consecutively rise tumor marker level , and/or least one new metastatic deposit Tc99 bone scintigraphy , and/or progression soft tissue metastasis measure appropriate modality ( i.e. , image , palpation ) , and/or development new area malignant disease ( measurable evaluable ) . Patients must fail therapy proven efficacy disease . Patients metastatic melanoma , nonsmall cell lung cancer , renal cell carcinoma eligible without receive prior therapy . Initial treatment nonchemotherapy responsive malignancy ( e.g. , disseminate gastrointestinal , noncolorectal cancer ) may do discretion investigator . Patients must ECOG performance status less equal 2 . Patients must life expectancy three month . Hematological eligibility parameter ( within 1 week start therapy ) : Granulocyte count great equal 1,500/mm3 ; Hemoglobin great equal 9.0 g/dL ( pretreatment transfusion allow , provide hemoglobin maintain 30 day and/or active source bleeding identify treat ) ; Platelet count great equal 120,000/mm3 ; If creatinine great 1.5 mg/dL , obtain 24 hour urine collection . Creatinine clearance must great 60 mL/min ; Hepatic function : normal bilirubin ( total ) ; ALT le 2.5 time normal ; AST less 2.5 time normal . Patients must recover toxicity relate prior therapy , include surgery . Patients must prior chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , radiation therapy , biological therapy least 4 week prior initiation COL3 . Patients receive mitomycin C , nitrosoureas , carboplatin must 6 week last administration chemotherapy . Patients receive suramin must 3 month last administration . Patients prostate cancer must continue receive LHRH agonist ( unless orchiectomy do ) must fail antiandrogen withdrawal . Patients prostate cancer undergone surgical castration must continue treatment LHRH agonist . If reason LHRH agonist discontinue prior entry study , reinstituted disease progression must document prior enrollment . Patients local complication require urgent local medical therapy eligible , may become resolution acute problem ( i.e. , severe bone pain , spinal cord compression , urinary flow obstruction , etc. ) . Patients must acute , critical illness , include serious untreated infection . Ureteral stent , foley catheter , although often colonize , contraindication enrollment . Patients history unstable newly diagnose angina pectoris , recent myocardial infarction ( within 6 month enrollment ) , New York class IIIV congestive heart failure , chronic obstructive lung disease require oxygen therapy uncontrolled seizure activity eligible . Patients must willing travel home NIH followup visit . All patient childbearing capability require use contraception treatment two month completion COL3 treatment . All female patient childbearing potential negative pregnancy test . Patients must able understand sign attach informed consent form . Patients must older 18 year age . Although prior radiation therapy primary , metastatic lesion , exclude individual study , exclude lesion optional biopsy . Thus , individual primary lesion radiate , participate portion study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Active infection , include positive serology HIV . Colonized urinary tract instrumentation exclude . Patients brain metastasis primary CNS malignancy . Concurrent therapy cancer ( i.e. , radiation therapy , chemotherapy , etc. ) . Patients pregnant lactate . No data currently available excretion COL3 breast milk . Also , toxicity data gestate animal exist present time . Until data nature become available , exclude patient pregnant lactate . Patients know HIV positive eligible protocol . Since COL3 known inhibitor neutrophil gelatinase , HIV patient exclude increase risk infection . HIV test require . Patients currently take anticonvulsant ( phenobarbital , phenytoin , carbamazepine ) . Patients take rifampin also exclude . There potential drug interaction COL3 class drug .</criteria>
