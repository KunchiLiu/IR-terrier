	<brief_summary>Patients enrol NIH protocol 95-I-0133 Clinical Center may participate extension phase study drug prednisone eliminate treatment regimen . Prednisone associate avascular necrosis , condition find number patient study . Also , certain patient protocol may receive future interleukin-2 treatment cycle home . Home administration IL-2 injection involve less frequent data safety monitoring medical evaluation Clinical Center except begin cycle . To eligible home administration IL-2 , patient must : - Be enrol current NIAID protocol IL-2 therapy receive least 1 year treatment protocol , least two well-tolerated outpatient cycle stable dose . - Have history tolerable side effect receive IL-2 without frequent medical intervention , intravenous fluid replacement dose reduction . - Not significant clinical laboratory abnormality day 0 5 last two outpatient cycle . - Have strong relationship private physician health-care provider involve patient 's care willing help supervise patient 's care home IL-2 cycle . - Live home easy telephone access prove reliable respond telephone call clinic staff . - Give clinic staff contact information close friend relative agree serve caregiver home cycle , provide patient non-medical assistance check condition daily . - Have reasonable access emergency medical service nearby medical facility . - Have prove reliable consistent use sterile technique , reconstitute IL-2 vial administer subcutaneous IL-2 injection . - Be receive outpatient IL-2 injection cycle least every 6 month part normal protocol participation . - Have access home weight scale able weigh day safety monitoring . Participants receive IL-2 cycle schedule follow original protocol participation . They see Clinical Center regularly schedule follow-up visit cycle medical evaluation blood draw start cycle determine safety administer cycle . During home cycle , patient 's case manager team member place monitor telephone call day 2 4 cycle week later . The timing number call may change depend finding ongoing assessment usefulness . Patients require notify study team promptly complication problem develop therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In initial phase study , HIV-infected patient CD4 count 200 500 randomize receive either IL-2 alone continuous IV infusion 5 day every 8 week , IL-2 plus anti-TNF antibody , IL-2 plus thalidomide . The primary endpoint study safety tolerability IL-2/TNF inhibitor combination . Secondary endpoint include change CD4 count , frequency severity IL-2 related side effect , change serum TNF level , plasma viral load change . The study period one year , optional extension period follow . Enrollment forty-five IL-2-naive patient . In amended phase study , 60 patient HIV infection CD4 count equal great 350 studied determine ability prednisone ameliorate IL-2 related toxicity . Patients randomize one four group : IL-2 alone ; IL-2 plus prednisone ; prednisone alone ; treatment . All four group treat combination regimen antiretrovirals include least one protease inhibitor . IL-2 dose SQ start dosage 7.5 mlU bid x 5 day every 8 week , prednisone ( placebo ) dose 0.5 mg/kg/day IL-2 cycle . Primary endpoint frequency IL-2 associate fatigue fever , CD4 count change , viral load change . Secondary endpoint include frequency IL-2 side effect , concomitant medication use , steroid associate side effect , cytokine change IL-2 , IL-2 total exposure IL-2 plus steroid vs. IL-2 plus placebo arm . The study period one year optional extension period follow .</detailed_description>
