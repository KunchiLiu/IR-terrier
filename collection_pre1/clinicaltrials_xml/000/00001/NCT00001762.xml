	<brief_summary>This study examine risk factor facial waste avascular necrosis ( AVN , type damage hip bone ) HIV-infected patient . The prevalence natural history AVN also evaluate . This study use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) identify monitor condition patient without diagnosed AVN identify risk factor . HIV-infected patient 18 year age old may eligible study . HIV-infected child 4 year old tolerate magnetic resonance image without sedation may also participate . Candidates may screen participation medical history , physical examination , blood urine test possibly electrocardiogram . Volunteers provide medical history may brief physical examination . The study currently close normal volunteer . HIV-infected patient MRI scan hip bone , possibly bone . Before scan , provide medical history interview questionnaire physical examination . Those diagnosed AVN also blood draw help identify potential risk factor AVN . For MRI , patient lie flat stretcher move cylindrical machine strong magnetic field . Earplugs worn muffle thump sound produced radio wave form image . Patients speak staff member via intercom system time procedure . Repeat MRI study request approximately 3- 12-month interval 5 year , see change occur time . If medically indicate , additional diagnostic study may do obtain information need appropriate medical care . Blood drawn periodically examine immune parameter viral blood level . Patients AVN may periodic consultation rehabilitation medicine service orthopedic surgeon .</brief_summary>
