	<brief_summary>This study evaluate HIV-negative patient unusually low level CD4+ T lymphocytes ( type white blood cell ) learn clinical symptom , cause , immunology , biology problem . CD4+ T lymphocytes play important role immune function , low count may leave people susceptible unusual infection . CD4+ T cell deficiency often associate HIV infection . Patients 8 year age old CD4+ T cell count 300 cells/mm3 test negative HIV infection standard blood test may eligible study . Patients ' family member partner may also enrol investigate possible role genetic factor exposure agent problem . Patients evaluate NIH Clinical Center least , generally two time . The evaluation , may do inpatient outpatient basis , include follow test procedure : - Complete physical examination . - Medical history , include question sexual contact , intravenous drug use , travel , blood transfusion , previous illness , include sexually transmit disease , health family member . - Urine test . - Blood test routine research purpose , include test HIV , hepatitis , syphilis infection , evaluation immune function , culture virus HIV family . No 1 pint blood drawn every 6 week . - Pregnancy test woman childbearing potential . - Skin test tuberculosis immune function . These test involve inject small amount substance test skin look raise area 1 2 day later . - Apheresis . Whole blood collect arm vein ( similar donate blood ) , circulate cell separator machine , spun separate component . The red cell return patient either needle needle arm , plasma white cell extract study . The procedure , take 1 2 hour , may repeat 3 time . Family member 60 cc ( 4 tablespoon ) blood drawn determine CD4+ T cell count .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation HIV-Negative Patients With Low CD4+ T Lymphocyte Counts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low CD4+ T-cells absence know etiology call idiopathic CD4+ T lymphocytopenia , case definition establish CDC CD4 count le 300 cells/mL 2 consecutive sample patient uninfected HIV disease treatment might provide reasonable alternative explanation CD4 lymphocytopenia . Early investigation center search novel retrovirus , others find evidence retrovirus . The patient see heterogeneous , appear likely multiple etiology syndrome . We currently continue follow subject long term see new subject order continue characterize clinical aspect patient meet case definition ; determine natural history ICL , provide sample researcher interested investigation pathogenesis ICL .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Adults great equal 18 year age . CD4 count le 300 cells/mmL 2 consecutive sample . Uninfected HIV determine ELISA confirmatory Western Blot Absence disease treatment might provide reasonable alternative explanation CD4 cell count might confound evaluation . Examples disease would acute , severe medical illness resolve CD4 cell count obtain ; active tuberculosis ; leukemia lymphoma ; previously characterize immunodeficiency disorder . Treatment might provide reasonable alternative explanation include chemotherapy field could affect bone marrow supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy . Capable provide informed consent .</criteria>
