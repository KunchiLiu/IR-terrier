	<brief_summary>This study evaluate reliability new test call Real-Time Polymerase chain reaction ( RT PCR ) detect cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) blood predict course CMV disease patient recently bone marrow transplant . The test 's effectiveness compare `` pp65 antigenemia assay '' routinely use purpose . CMV common virus transmit person person close personal contact . In healthy people , CVM remain body indefinitely without cause harm . But , people weaken immune systems-including undergone bone marrow transplant-CMV infection cause serious , possibly fatal , complication . Drugs available treat infection , however . Optimum treatment depend early accurate detection . Patients age 10 80 year schedule undergo bone marrow transplant NIH Clinical Center part NIH protocol may eligible 2-phase study . In phase 1 , patient blood draw RT PCR antigenemia test bone marrow transplantation weekly first 100 day transplant . During Phase 2-which begin immediately end phase 1 continue one year transplant-blood sample test draw week . The sample test collect time take catheter ( thin flexible tube insert vein ) already place transplant study . RT PCR test require extra 5 milliliter ( 1 teaspoon ) need antigenemia testing , amount maximum one-half pint extra course 1-year study . It hop new RT PCR test prove accurate detecting CMV infection predict disease development , thus enable doctor plan early effective treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Two Test Methods-NASBA Antigenemia-for Detecting Cytomegalovirus Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , standard care use pp65 antigenemia assay guide anti-cytomegalovirus therapy hematopoietic stem cell transplant patient . Nevertheless , past two year institution , approximately 10 % antigenemia-positive patient go develop overt CMV disease 22 % patient document clinical CMV disease positive antigenemia test two week prior diagnosis ( data file ) . Recently , test call CMV Real-Time PCR apply diagnosis CMV infection . Preliminary data suggest test may value detect active CMV replication . Thus , may able predict CMV disease help guide antiviral therapy . We propose prospective observational study compare CMV Real-Time PCR test pp65 antigenemia . This do take extra blood sample ( approximately 5 mL ) CMV Real-Time PCR test hematopoietic stem cell transplant patient whenever sample pp65 antigenemia test drawn . No separate venipuncture anticipate . These sample draw approximately weekly basis first 100 day post-transplant , currently do pp65 antigenemia test alone . Additionally , time blood drawn pp65 antigenemia test 100 day , also take blood CMV Real-Time PCR test , one year post-transplant . The result CMV Real-Time PCR test use guide therapy . Overt CMV disease identify via real-time chart review patient interview one investigator study . The primary goal study evaluate ability CMV Real-Time PCR test accurately detect active CMV viral proliferation predict ultimate overt CMV disease compare currently-used pp65 antigenemia test .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female patient 10 year age old 80 year age include . Patients must enrol protocol NIH Clinical Center result patient receive allogeneic stem cell transplant ( AHSCT ) . Patients yet receive pretransplant chemotherapy radiation therapy condition regimen eligible . Patients must negative IgG serologic test CMV whose hematopoietic stem cell donor also negative IgG serologic test report Bone Marrow Transplant staff . Patients must documentation prior cytomegalovirus antigenemia disease prior start condition regimen .</criteria>
