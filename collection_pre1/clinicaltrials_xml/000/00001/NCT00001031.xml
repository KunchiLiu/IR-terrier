	<brief_summary>To evaluate safety immunogenicity SF-2 rgp120 vaccine MF59 versus MN rgp120 vaccine alum volunteer seronegative HIV-1 . AS PER AMENDMENT 07/02/97 : To determine ability immunization MN rgp120/HIV-1 combination alum SF-2 rgp120 combination MF59 induce HIV-1 envelope-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) response volunteer receive rsgp120/MN skin test . The amino acid sequence HIV-1 gp120 vary much 40 percent isolate isolate . Thus , identification immunogen elicit broadly neutralizing antibody HIV-1 major challenge AIDS vaccine development . Two candidate vaccine , recombinant envelope subunit proteins SF-2 MN isolate HIV-1 , show immunogenicity good tolerance healthy immunocompetent adult . This study expand test large population base , particularly target individual high risk HIV infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The amino acid sequence HIV-1 gp120 vary much 40 percent isolate isolate . Thus , identification immunogen elicit broadly neutralizing antibody HIV-1 major challenge AIDS vaccine development . Two candidate vaccine , recombinant envelope subunit proteins SF-2 MN isolate HIV-1 , show immunogenicity good tolerance healthy immunocompetent adult . This study expand test large population base , particularly target individual high risk HIV infection . HIV-seronegative volunteer ( include four population high risk HIV infection two population low risk ) receive one four regimen . Two treatment group receive 50 mcg SF-2 rgp 120 ( BIOCINE ) MF59 adjuvant 600 mcg MN rgp120 ( Genentech ) alum . Two control group receive vehicle ( placebo ) MF59 adjuvant alone alum adjuvant alone . Immunizations give month 0 , 1 , 6 . AS PER AMENDMENT 10/93 : patient enrol June 15 , 1993 , receive fourth immunization month 12 18 ( 50 percent patient schedule ) . Patients follow 2 year first injection . AS PER AMENDMENT 05/10/94 : special study vaccine acceptability HIV-related risk behavior conduct time month 12 18 . AS PER AMENDMENT 07/02/97 : special DTH study conduct consent volunteer receive three four immunization . The injection give end study ( day 1 , &amp; 56 ) . Followup extend 56 day administration intradermal injection .</detailed_description>
