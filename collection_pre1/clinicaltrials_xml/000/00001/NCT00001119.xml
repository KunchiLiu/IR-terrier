	<brief_summary>The purpose study find whether powerful combination anti-HIV drug safe effective use patient early stage HIV infection find patient ' immune system react HIV anti-HIV drug . Doctors generally treat patient early stage HIV infection anti-HIV drug take patient HIV long time . These drug low level HIV blood . However , doctor know whether patient take anti-HIV drug early stage HIV infection actually live long few AIDS-related disease . This study help doctor answer question . In main study , doctor look 2 different anti-HIV drug combination affect immune system . In 2 substudies , doctor look body reacts hepatitis B vaccine tetanus vaccine . These substudies may help doctor learn HIV-infected patient respond new infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Immune System Anti-HIV Drugs Patients Recently Infected With HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current treatment guideline recommend combination ART acute primary HIV-1 infection . However , know whether ART give acute infection delay progression AIDS improve survival rate . Preliminary study suggest ART give early HIV infection reduce viral load also restrict CD4+ cell loss , delay development opportunistic infection , preserve T-helper cell naive T cell . The immunologic basis protective effect characterize thoroughly . This protocol assess ART 's effect immune response early HIV infection variety cellular , humoral , virologic assay , include 2 substudies . The substudies focus antibody response neoantigen immunization ( hepatitis B tetanus ) . Primary endpoint analysis occur Week 72 , patient may follow long-term outcome . In main study , patient HIV-1 infection less 120 day give option take potent ART combination abacavir ( ABC ) , efavirenz ( EFV ) , indinavir ( IDV ) , lamivudine ( 3TC ) 96 week . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 9/15/00 : Patients choose either Regimen 1 : ABC , 3TC , IDV , ritonavir ( RTV ) Regimen 2 : ABC , 3TC , EFV . ] Patients decline treatment provide concurrent , non-randomized comparison group . These patient may choose consider study treatment time start antiretrovirals provide another source . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 9/15/00 : If patient initially start therapy subsequently start antiretroviral therapy provide study ( within 120-day limit ) , visit schedule re-set . ] During treatment period , patient undergo regular physical exam blood test characterize T cell , viral resistance , antibody response , marker . Patients present within 30 day HIV-1 infection undergo leukapheresis ( available ) prior start ART . At Month 12 , patient untreated patient undergo leukapheresis ass proportion latently infect CD4+ T cell . In addition , patient main study patient 2 comparison group ( Cohorts A B ) participate 1 2 substudies antibody response neoantigen . Volunteers recruit 2 cohort serve control . Cohort A volunteer establish HIV-1 infection . Cohort B volunteer HIV-1 seronegative high risk HIV . In first substudy , hepatitis B-seronegative patient main study Cohorts A B receive hepatitis B vaccine Weeks 40 , 44 , 64 undergo humoral cellular response assessment Week 68 . In second substudy , patient main study Cohorts A B qualify hepatitis B vaccination undergo intramuscular vaccination tetanus toxoid Week 64 immune response assess Week 68 . Volunteers Cohorts A B receive anti-HIV medication part substudies .</detailed_description>
