PFD may occur alone part McCune-Albright Syndrome ( MAS ) , syndrome originally define triad PFD , cafe-au-lait pigmentation skin , precocious puberty . The bony lesion frequently disfigure painful , depend location lesion , cause significant morbidity . Lesions weight-bearing bone lead disable fracture , lesion skull lead compression vital structure cranial nerve . The natural history disease poorly describe clearly-defined systemic therapy bone disease . The purpose study define natural history disease without treatment .</brief_summary>
