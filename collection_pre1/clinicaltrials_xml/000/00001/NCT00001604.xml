	<brief_summary>Stuttering abnormality speech affect rhythm speech . People stutter know wish say , time unable say involuntary repetition , unnecessary lengthening ( prolongation ) , early stopping ( cessation ) . Stuttering characterized repetition prolongation first syllable , silent prolongation , sometimes know block . Researcher intend study genetic basis stuttering . The goal study find gene help cause stutter determine region human genetic make-up ( genome ) link stuttering.. To researcher study pattern inheritance family member stutter . The study two objective . The first objective develop large collection DNA sample individual stutter family , include member stutter stutter . The second objective study find basic combination gene ( genotype ) make participant DNA . Once complete researcher hope map find area region DNA link stutter . Genetic linkage initial step positional cloning , clone gene predispose individual stutter long term goal research study. &lt; TAB &gt;</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Linkage Studies Stuttering</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A primary goal study ascertain region human genome show genetic linkage stuttering . Genetic linkage determine first obtain genomic DNA affect unaffected adult child family contain pairs individual stutter adult . Individuals stutter genetically isolated population also sample . Phenotype assign speech-language pathologist , DNA sample obtain affected unaffected family member 2 cc . saliva 20 cc . blood . These DNA sample genotyped use marker distribute across human genome . The genotypic information analyze determine marker variant show linkage stuttering . The initial goal study identify specific genetic variant , predispose individual stutter . No genetic information provide back participant . A secondary goal study perform broad clinical evaluation individual find mutation cause stutter . These take place NIH Clinical Center include standard procedure include history physical , neurological exam , audiological exam , ophthalmologic exam , electromyographic ( EMG ) exam , electroencephalography ( EEG ) , X-rays , speech evaluation , brain imaging include MRI fMRI .</detailed_description>
