	<brief_summary>This study test safety effectiveness hydroxyurea , anti-cancer drug , give together anti-HIV drug didanosine , stavudine efavirenz treat child infect human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . Some study find hydroxyurea may help certain anti-HIV drug work well virus become resistant , drug . This study also examine hydroxyurea affect body 's immune system virus level . Patients 3 21 year old HIV infection may eligible 52-week study . They screen eligibility thorough physical examination , include chest X-ray , electrocardiogram echocardiogram , head CT scan , eye examination blood test . All patient study take didanosine twice day , stavudine twice day efavirenz day . All patient also take hydroxyurea twice day , take low dose drug , others take high dose . Within two group ( high low dose ) patient start take hydroxyurea day begin anti-HIV drug ; others start hydroxyurea take anti-HIV drug 5 week . Patients physical examination every 3 week week 12 , every 4 week week 24 , every 8 week end study . Blood test measure virus level do every day first 7 day periodically . For first 8 week start hydroxyurea , blood test do weekly . An eye examination , chest X-ray , electrocardiogram , CT scan head do every 6 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This pilot study determine safety , toxicity , virologic immunologic effect combination therapy hydroxyurea , cytostatic chemotherapeutic agent , two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor child HIV infection . We enroll HIV-infected child detectable viral load ( great 10,000 copies/ml ) . Patients stratify upon enrollment CD4 cell count ( less great 200 CD4 cells/mm ( 3 ) ) . Two dose level hydroxyurea utilize ( 7.5 mg/kg/dose twice daily 12.5 mg/kg/dose twice daily ) . It anticipate 15 patient enrol Low Dose Level 10 patient High Dose Level hydroxyurea within CD4 cohort , total 50 patient study . Within dose level patient receive antiretroviral agent didanosine , stavudine efavirenz begin study Day one randomize receive hydroxyurea either Day 1 week 6 . The cohort escalate analyzed separately . The study duration 52 week . This study attempt define effective tolerable dose hydroxyurea .</detailed_description>
