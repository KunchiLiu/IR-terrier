	<brief_summary>This study inflammatory muscle diseases-polymyositis dermatomyositis relate disorders-will examine cause diseases describe clinical feature ( sign symptom ) associate . Inflammation degeneration skeletal muscle disorder lead weakness muscle wasting . The skin , lung organ may also involve . Patients 16 year age old polymyositis , dermatomyositis , relate disorder may eligible study . Participants undergo complete history physical examination , include routine blood urine test . Additional procedure diagnosis , treatment research may include : 1 . Blood sample genetic study . 2 . Muscle biopsy-removal tissue sample microscopic examination . Under local anesthetic , 1/2- 1-inch long incision make thigh upper arm , small piece muscle remove . 3 . Electromyography-measurement electrical activity muscle . A needle inserted skin muscle record electrical activity . 4 . Magnetic resonance imaging-visualization organ tissue , use magnetic field radio wave . The patient lie table inside narrow cylinder ( MRI scanner ) strong magnetic field scanning . 5 . Manual muscle strength test physiotherapist . 6 . Swallowing study use ultrasound ( image use sound wave ) X-rays ( barium swallow ) evaluate swallow speak ability . 7 . Questionnaires swallow ability ability perform daily live activity 8 . Pulmonary function tests-measurement movement air lung . The patient breathes machine evaluate lung function . 9 . Chest X-rays evaluate lung function . 10 . Electrocardiogram , necessary , Holter monitoring ( measurement electrical activity heart ) echocardiogram ( ultrasound image heart ) evaluate heart function . 11 . Apheresis-collection white blood cell research . Whole blood collect needle place arm vein . The blood circulates machine separate component . The white cell remove rest blood return body needle second one place arm . 12 . MR guide muscle biopsy-measurement glycogen muscle tissue use magnetic resonance imaging . Certain patient may undergo experimental procedure compare MRI finding muscle biopsy . The affected muscle identify use MRI biopsy incision make . MRI use guide biopsy needle muscle small piece remove . Patients eligible experimental treatment study offer opportunity join . Others advise treatment recommendation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Polymyositis , dermatomyositis related disorder , also know idiopathic inflammatory myopathy ( IIM ) , uncommon , heterogeneous group diseases . This omnibus protocol design continue description rare group disease , delineate important group patient , obtain useful material study immunological abnormality , pathogenesis etiology IIM . Often diagnosis IIM confuse illness ( adult-onset dystrophy ) , therefore , evaluate patient illness ( refer preliminary diagnosis IIM ) . Patients evaluate IIM receive ( informed consent ) best standard therapy available consideration entry therapeutic protocol . MRI perform healthy volunteer help develop mathematical method quantitating edema muscle MRI patient . MRI/PET perform patient healthy volunteer evaluate role understanding muscle disease .</detailed_description>
