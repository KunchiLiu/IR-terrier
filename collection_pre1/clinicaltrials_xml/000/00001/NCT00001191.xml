	<brief_summary>Patients Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome suffer ulcer upper gastrointestinal tract , high normal level gastric acid , tumor pancreas know non-beta islet cell tumor . Patients Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome require continuous control gastric acid secretion . If gastric acid level permit rise higher normal , patient may develop severe ulcer complication . This study attempt determine effectiveness Omeprazole ( Prilosec ) treatment patient Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome . Omeprazole drug function decrease amount gastric acid secrete . Patients study select base previous diagnosis Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome and/or idiopathic ( unknown cause ) high level gastric acid secretion . The patient undergo evaluation include history physical examination well necessary laboratory test . The proper dose Omeprazole determine patient . The proper dose Omeprazole consider minimum amount omeprazole require low gastric acid safe level . Every year patient participate study undergo physical examination history . They question symptom associate Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome . Gastric acid level take evaluated patient undergo upper gastrointestinal endoscopy . The effectiveness treatment measure clinical history determine control symptom due high level gastric acid secretion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use Oral Omeprazole Intravenous Pantoprazole Patients With Hypersecretion Gastric Acid</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients Zollinger-Ellison syndrome require continuous control gastric acid secretion else severe complication peptic ulcer disease occur . This study investigate long-term efficacy oral gastric acid antisecretory drug , Omeprazole , function H+ - K+ ATPase inhibitor . Long-term safety also investigate . Also investigated ability parenteral H+-K+ ATPase inhibitor , pantoprazole control acid secretion short-term , oral Omeprazole use . In study proper maintenance dose oral Omeprazole determine patient determine minimal dose drug reduces acid secretion safe level . Patients examine least annually evidence continue efficacy safety . Efficacy assess clinical history ass control symptom due gastric acid hypersecretion , measurement gastric acid secretion Omeprazole determine continue effectiveness drug upper gastrointestinal endoscopy ass change gastrointestinal mucosa . Safety determine assess clinical laboratory parameter change hematologic clinical chemistry parameter . Possible drug induce change gastric mucosa assess gastric biopsy . With intravenous pantoprazole ability recommend dose 80 mg three time day control acid secretion investigate fails , 80 mg four time day assess .</detailed_description>
