	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety effectiveness food additive 1-octanol treat essential tremor . This disorder , involuntary shaking , usually hand , satisfactory treatment . It affect one every 100 people general population , figure climb nearly 4 every hundred among people 40 year old . In animal study , 1-octanol reduce chemically induced tremor rat . This study test effect accept daily intake 1-octanol ( 1 milligram per kilogram body weight ) essential tremor human . Patients essential tremor 21 year old old wish enroll study undergo eligibility screen medical history physical examination include test thyroid , liver kidney problem . Participants randomly assign receive either 1-octanol placebo ( inactive substance ) . Patients group intravenous catheter ( thin , plastic tube ) place arm vein collect blood sample study . Those 1-octanol group give 1-octanol capsule ; placebo group receive look-alike capsule contain active ingredient . Neither patient doctor know patient take 1-octanol placebo end study . Tremors measure catheter place , every 15 minute first 2 hour take capsule , twice third hour ( 30 minute apart ) , 5 hour . The tremor measure use procedure call accelerometry surface electromyography . For procedure , electrode tap skin ; needle use . Blood sample collect take capsule , every 15 minute first hour half take capsule 2 hour , 4 hour 5 hour take capsule . Vital sign ( blood pressure , pulse , respiratory rate ) measure every 15 minute first 2 hour take capsule , every 30 minute third hour , 4 hour 5 hour . Participants stay hospital overnight observation return 3 day follow-up physical examination , include blood test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Essential tremor ( ET ) common movement disorder ; however , currently satisfactory drug treatment . The neural mechanism underlie ET remain unknown . One prevalent hypotheses ET result defective mechanism normally dampen natural oscillation inferior olive ( IO ) neuron whose intrinsic oscillatory activity attribute presence low threshold calcium channel ( LTCC ) . 1-Octanol known inhibit LTCC olivary neuron find reduce tremor induced rat harmaline , alkaloid know hyperpolarize IO neuron increase tendency fire rhythmically rest . The aim study assess effect 1-octanol ET human . This study design double-blind , placebo-controlled , single-dose trial untreated patient ET . Electromyography ( EMG ) acclerometry use assess tremor 1-octanol administration . The accepted daily intake ( ADI ) 1-octanol ( 1 mg/kg/d ) food additive give single dose . Toxicity octanol monitor clinically liver function electrolyte measurement .</detailed_description>
