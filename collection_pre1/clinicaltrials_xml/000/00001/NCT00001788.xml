	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Samples patient know suspected primary immunodeficiency , include treated stem cell transplant gene correction therapy , family accept worldwide primarily tertiary care center treat patient immunodeficiency . Such patient document evidence either opportunistic infection , recurrent infection , unusually severe response infectious agent cause mild illness unaffected individual . Either patientderived B cell line primary blood sample accept although case buccal swab also accept . Blood sample may obtain unaffected child . Infants SCID primary immunodeficiency see ; physician care clinical material send patient . Medically stable patient mild moderate immunodeficiency may see NIH . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Inability provide inform consent . A presence medical condition would , opinion investigator , confuse interpretation study ( e.g. , HIV infection ) .</criteria>
