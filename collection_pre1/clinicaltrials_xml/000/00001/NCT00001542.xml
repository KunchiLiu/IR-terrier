	<detailed_description>Oropharyngeal candidiasis ( OPC ) occur 93 % person human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection time course illness . OPC usually respond well initial antifungal therapy , increase immunodeficiency usually recur become resistant clinical microbiologic cure . Therapy usually begin topical agent , follow systemic therapy azole antifungal fail . Amphotericin B also use , less well tolerate usually effective parenteral form . Because bioavailability efficacy , fluconazole become commonly use agent treat OPC . Recurrences often lead frequent re-treatment prophylactic therapy fluconazole . Daily prophylaxis fluconazole ( 200 mg ) show decrease incidence OPC . With widespread prolong use fluconazole report clinical failure yeast decrease susceptibility appear . This resistance appear associate advanced immunosuppression azole exposure . The effective regimen decrease relapse morbidity OPC minimize development resistance establish . Could less frequent and/or lower dose prophylaxis fluconazole decrease incidence recurrence slow development drug resistance ? We plan perform two phase study low-dose fluconazole prophylaxis HIV infect patient history OPC . Patients advanced immunosuppression ( CD4 le equal 150 cell/mm3 ) receive prior fluconazole prophylaxis include . Phase 1 study placebo-controlled trial fluconazole dose 200 mg three time weekly . Phase 1 examine whether low-dose prophylaxis delay recurrence OPC . Phase 2 study open-label prophylaxis fluconazole first 200mg thrice weekly , 200mg daily patient develop recurrent OPC . In phase primary question answer whether subject start placebo arm Phase 1 progress le rapidly clinical fluconazole failure compare starting fluconazole arm . We learn natural history fluconazole resistance , include gradually change occur , much fluconazole patient receive time resistance develop whether resistance occur patient 's isolate acquisition new isolate . Other evaluation include compliance , cost , host organism-associated factor . If thrice weekly fluconazole prophylaxis increase time development resistance decrease episodes OPC group severely immunocompromised individual , would increase effective use ( include cost-effective use ) fluconazole treatment OPC .</detailed_description>
