	<brief_summary>Background : - Combined therapy rituximab fludarabine treatment choice advance stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma ( CLL/SLL ) . - A new technology call deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) microarray use gain knowledge genetic basis CLL/SLL . - Genetic study CLL/SLL may improve understand happens disease , help determine patient likely respond treatment fludarabine rituximab , identify new treatment . Objectives : -To gain knowledge CLL/SLL role rituximab fludarabine treat disease . Eligibility : -Patients 18 year age old low , intermediate high-risk CLL/SLL . Design : - Patients low-risk CLL/SLL receive treatment , follow every 3 6 month donate cell ( apheresis ) lymph node , , research purpose . - Patients intermediate high-risk CLL/SLL receive standard treatment rituximab fludarabine six 28-day treatment cycle . Rituximab give day 1 fludarabine give day 1-5 . ( For first cycle , fludarabine treatment start day 2 . This delay permit blood sample day 1 effect rituximab white blood cell . ) - Laboratory test image study do periodically monitor drug side effect response treatment . Tests include bone marrow biopsy aspiration , blood test x-ray , include positron emission tomography ( PET ) compute tomography ( CT ) scan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Due synergistic action non-overlapping toxicity profile , combination Rituximab Fludarabine treatment choice advance stage chronic lymphocytic lymphoma ( CLL ) /small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) . - As , design protocol well understand genetic basis CLL/SLL , identify predictor treatment response study molecular effect Rituximab Fludarabine leukemic cell . - A new technology utilizing complementary deoxyribonucleic acid ( cDNA ) microarrays permit simultaneous quantitation expression thousand gene ; methodology evaluate define cellular pathway , also discover novel gene influence cell biology . - In addition improve understanding pathogenesis CLL/SLL , molecular study may identify new therapeutic target CLL/SLL , may help identify CLL/SLL patient likely respond combination Fludarabine Rituximab . Objectives : - Evaluate CLL/SLL patient follow Rituximab Fludarabine chemotherapy change lymphocyte gene expression use DNA microarray analysis . - Evaluate gene expression DNA microarray analysis leukemic cell blood , bone marrow lymph node . Eligibility : - Low , Intermediate High-Risk Category CLL/SLL , use Modified Three- Stage Rai Staging System - Age great equal 18 year . - Patients must receive previous cytotoxic monoclonal antibody therapy . - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0-2 . - Patients must pregnant breast-feeding . - Patients active autoimmune hemolytic anemia ( AIHA ) ) grade III high ( transfusion steroid indicate ) immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP ) grade III high ( platelet le 50,000/microL ) shall enrol . - Any patient medical condition require chronic use corticosteroid shall enrol . Design : - Patients require treatment follow every 3-6 month donate cellular product , bone marrow biopsy , bone marrow aspirate and/or lymph node research purpose . - Patients require treatment receive standard dose Rituximab monoclonal antibody standard dose Fludarabine total six cycle . In first cycle , Rituximab give day 1 Fludarabine give day 2-6 . This allow appropriate sampling effect Rituximab lymphocytes end first 24 hour . In subsequent cycle 2-6 , Rituximab day 1 Fludarabine give day 1 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Diagnosis chronic lymphocytic lymphoma ( CLL ) /small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) make accord World Health Organization ( WHO ) diagnostic classification . A lymphocyte count excess 5000/mcl typically find leukemic variant prerequisite diagnosis SLL . Low , Intermediate HighRisk Category CLL/SLL , use Modified ThreeStage Rai Staging System follow : Risk Category : Low Risk Rai Stage : 0 Clinical Features : Elevated blood marrow lymphocyte number ( L ) . ( lymphocytes great 5000/microl blood , lymphocytes great 30 percent marrow ) . Risk Category : Intermediate Risk Rai Stage : I Clinical Features : L + enlarge lymph node ( LN ) Risk Category : Intermediate Risk Rai Stage : II Clinical Features : L + enlarge spleen liver Risk Category : High Risk Rai Stage : III Clinical Features : L + anemia ( Hemoglobin le 11 gm/dl ) Risk Category : High Risk Rai Stage : IV Clinical Features : L + thrombocytopenia ( platelet le 100,000/microl ) Patients modify Rai high risk group select patient intermediate risk group undergo treatment Rituximab Fludarabine . To meet treatment criterion patient intermediate risk group evidence active disease demonstrate least one follow criterion : 1. massive progressive splenomegaly lymphadenopathy ; 2. presence weight loss great 10 % precede 6 month ; 3. constitutional symptom extreme fatigue , night sweat recurrent fever great 100 degree F ( documented fever must occur without evidence specific infection ) , bone pain ; 4. progressive lymphocytosis increase great 50 % 2 month period , anticipate double time le 6 month ; 5. chronic infection either increased number prolonged infection ; 6. high risk prognostic indicator excess elevation beta2microglobulin , cluster differentiation 38 ( CD38 ) expression adverse cytogenetics may use well appraise risk individual patient . Patients diagnosis CLL/SLL meet eligibility criterion receive Rituximab Fludarabine ( intermediate highrisk CLL/SLL ) , enroll protocol purpose donate cellular product . Such patient receive rituximab fludarabine chemotherapy . At later date , document patient meet criterion , patient may receive Rituximab Fludarabine ( discussion Principal Investigator ) . In limited number case , patient lowrisk CLL/SLL may initiate Rituximab Fludarabine treatment . For example , individual candidate bone marrow transplantation may start Rituximab Fludarabine induction regimen prior transplantation . Additionally , lowrisk patient may start Rituximab Fludarabine psychological reason ( patient insistence start chemotherapy prior disease progression ) . However , must stress lowrisk CLL/SLL patient discourage initiate therapy except specific case . Age great equal 18 year age . Patients must receive prior cytotoxic monoclonal antibody therapy . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 2 . Required initial laboratory test : Blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) Creatinine value must less equal 1.5 time normal value ; alternatively , patient creatinine clearance great 50 ml per minute also eligible . Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) value must less equal 2.0 time normal value ; patient laboratory value great level may enrol protocol ( specific approval Principal Investigator ) value due know , preexist liver disease . Bilirubin must less equal 2.0 mg/dl unless due Gilbert 's disease . The patient must competent sign informed consent , sign protocol consent form . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must pregnant breastfeeding . Patients active autoimmune hemolytic anemia ( AIHA ) ) grade III high ( transfusion steroid indicate ) immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP ) grade III high ( platelet le 50,000/microL ) shall enrol . Patients history prior therapy control either AIHA ITP eligible , provided require maintenance corticosteroid , receive monoclonal antibody therapy past 6 month . Patients develop AIHA ITP protocol may manage medically indicate protocol generally undergo fludarabine/rituximab treatment resolution hemolysis thrombocytopenia less grade III . Any patient medical condition require chronic use corticosteroid shall enrol .</criteria>
