	<brief_summary>This study test safety effectiveness genetically alter T lymphocyte ( white blood cell immune system ) reduce viral load patient infected human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . The lymphocyte two gene insert ; laboratory-manufactured anti-HIV gene design inhibit HIV reproduction ( either RevTD Rev-TD-antiTAR gene ) , `` marker '' gene show whether insert gene gotten cell . Identical twin pair 18 year age older- one HIV-positive ( infected human immunodeficiency virus ) HIV-negative ( infect ) may eligible study . All participant complete medical history physical examination , blood test tetanus booster shot , indicate . The non HIV-infected twin undergo lymphapheresis collect lymphocytes . In procedure , whole blood collect needle place arm vein . The blood circulates machine separate component . The lymphocyte remove , red cell plasma return donor , either needle second needle place arm . The donor cell grown laboratory day , new gene insert . The genetically altered cell grown laboratory several day number increase approximately thousand-fold . They infuse intravenously ( vein ) infect twin . These procedures-lymphapheresis , gene modification infusion-will repeat approximately 2-month interval four time . Each lymphocyte infusion take 60 minute . The patient 's vital sign ( temperature , pulse , blood pressure breathe ) monitor frequently infusion hourly 4 hour infusion . Blood sample take day infusion , 3 day later , weekly monitor gene-modified cell , immune status , viral activity , factor . These test may do less often study progress learn safety infusion . The infusion do outpatient basis unless side effect require do hospital post-infusion monitoring least 24 hour . Patients follow long-term effect treatment monthly first 3 month , month next 9 month yearly . This study contribute information use side effect gene therapy HIV infection may lead new treatment strategy . A potential direct benefit HIV-infected individual participate study reduce viral load ; laboratory study , RevTD Rev-TD-antiTAR gene inhibit HIV spread test tube . However , early phase study , likelihood receive benefit unknown .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This phase I/II pilot study evaluate safety , relative survival , potential efficacy infusion activate , genetically engineer , syngeneic CD4+ T lymphocytes obtain HIV-1 seronegative identical twin . T cell seronegative twin obtain apheresis , enrich CD4+ cell , induce polyclonal proliferation anti-CD3 rIL-2 stimulation , divide aliquot individually transduce control retroviral vector two additional retroviral vector contain potentially therapeutic gene ( antisense TAR and/or transdominant Rev ) . These engineer T cell population expand 10-1,000 fold number 1-2 week culture , infuse seropositive twin . The relative survival uniquely engineer T cell population monitor vector-specific PCR , recipient ' functional immune status monitor standard vitro vivo test protocol . A total 4 cycle treatment may give use identical different combination control anti-HIV-1 retroviral vector .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : An identical twin pair , one seropositive HIV1 , twin seronegative , standard ELISA Western blot test . Patients Kaposi 's sarcoma limit skin and/or mucous membrane eligible study , must receive systemic therapy KS within 4 week prior entry . The diagnosis KS must confirm biopsy . Free serious psychological emotional illness able provide write informed consent . Anticipated survival great 3 month . 18 year age old . Treatment FDAapproved and/or expand access antiretroviral agent ( ) patient baseline CD4 count 500 cells/mm ( 3 ) . Patients baseline CD4 count 500 cells/mm ( 3 ) eligible receive cell therapy protocol , must treat antiretroviral therapy evidence significant persistent viral activation occur association cell infusion . `` Significant persistent viral activation '' define 50 percent great increase baseline virologic parameter least 2 consecutive week . Recipient 's CD4 count great 50 cells/mm ( 3 ) . Recipient Donor willing sample store undergo HLA testing . EXCLUSION CRITERIA ( Donor Recipient ) : Lymphomas . Unwillingness comply current NIH Clinical Center guideline concern appropriate notification current sexual partner individual regard HIV1 positive serostatus risk transmission HIV1 infection . Recent history substance abuse unless evidence provide ongoing therapeutic intervention ( i.e . medical therapy counseling ) control abuse . Pregnant entry unwillingness practice barrier birth control abstinence study . No experimental therapy within 4 week study participation . Antiretroviral agent available FDAsanctioned , expand access basis permit . EXCLUSION CRITERIA ( Donor ) : Untreated inadequately treated medical condition ( e.g. , cardiopulmonary disease , acute infection ) , judgement Principal Investigator , preclude apheresis .
