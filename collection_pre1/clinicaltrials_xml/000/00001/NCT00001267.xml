	<brief_summary>Several dideoxynucleosides show activity HIV different toxicity . This study involve therapy patient AIDS ARC two agent , AZT 2 ' , 3'-dideoxyinosine ( ddI ) , different toxicity profile , 2-year period time . The rationale use two drug reduce toxicity also possibly delay prevent development resistance . Patients randomize receive either alternate regimen continuous simultaneous regimen two drug .

	<criteria>Patients AIDS symptomatic HIV infection 10350 CD4+ T cell per mm ( 3 ) estimate lifeexpectancy 3 month . For purpose study , patient define symptomatic HIV infection history active thrush ( oral candidiasis ) ; history active oral hairy leukoplakia ; herpes zoster within last 3 year ; recurrent seborrheic dermatitis puritic folliculitis ; weight loss 4.5 kg 10 percent body weight caused dieting ; unexplained intermittent diarrhea ( 2 liquid stool per day ) within last 4 month ; night sweat ; mild cognitive impairment ; fatigue interfering activity within past 6 month . Lymphadenopathy , , consider sufficient consider symptomatic HIV infection . All patient must serum antibody HIV , ambulatory status , capacity give inform consent . No prior use dideoxynucleoside therapy ( include restrict AZT , ddC , ddI ) 3 month . However , preference give patient receive 1 month less . No pregnancy possibility become pregnant drug administration . Female patient childbearing age must negative pregnancy test prior enrollment agree practice birth control protocol . No past present evidence renal disease ( CRC1 estimate determine less 50 ml/min/1.73 m2 ) . Patients exclude one follow hematologic abnormality : Hb le 10.0 gm per dl transfusion within last month , WBC less 2000 per mm ( 3 ) Platelets less 75,000 per mm ( 3 ) . No history hepatic cirrhosis present hepatic dysfunction : Total bilirubin great 3.0 mg per dl ( 2x upper limit normal ) . Alkaline phosphatase great 372 U per l ( 3x upper limit normal ) . AST/GOT great 132 U per l ( 3x upper limit normal ) . No evidence severe diarrhea ( 5 stool per day ) , underlie severe infection ( include CMV retinitis , colitis , pneumonitis ) ; evidence Kaposi 's sarcoma tumor likely require specific antitumor therapy within 24 month enter study : As practical matter , patient Kaposi 's sarcoma cutaneous lesion mucosal internal lesion eligible . Patients ineligible evidence active lifethreatening infection bacterial , viral , fungal , protozoan pathogen time entry study . In general , patient fever 39 degree Celsius within past 10 day general ineligible unless apparent result severe underlying infection . No known hypersensitivity reaction major toxicity AZT ddI . ( This would include anaphylaxis reaction , hive , Stevens Johnson syndrome , would include minor rash occasionally see ddI . ) Patients must willing give informed consent , attend outpatient clinic , refrain unprotected sexual contact activity may result reinfection HIV . Present use illicit drug ( example , heroin cocaine ) ingestion substantial alcohol ( enough increase risk pancreatitis ) exclude patient study . No evidence underlie cardiac disease , history pancreatitis , peripheral neuropathy . No treatment within last 4 month suramin , treatment within last 3 month ribavirin , treatment within past 4 week antiretroviral drug , cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent , steroid , interferon , immunomodulating agent .</criteria>
