	<brief_summary>This study determine growth factor involve promote inhibit mastocytosis-an abnormal increase mast cell one organ system . Mast cell release chemical cause itching , blister , flushing , bone pain , abdominal pain . Little known disease cure . Steroids antihistamines help reduce symptom . Patients birth 80 year age increase mast cell least one organ system may eligible 3-year study . Family member may also enrol genetic testing . Patients evaluate yearly NIH Clinical Center follow test procedure : - Medical history physical examination . - Blood sample . - Laboratory blood test , medically indicate . - Bone marrow aspiration biopsy - For bone marrow aspiration biopsy , back hipbone puncture sterile needle . Five milliliter ( 1 teaspoon ) marrow withdrawn syringe 1/2-inch piece tissue extract special needle . The blood bone marrow sample use clinical care research determine mastocytosis due mast cell growth factor genetic change . Patients require evaluation test recommendation make primary physician . Any patient require immediate treatment admit hospital . Standard medical treatment may include antihistamine itch ; steroid severe abdominal symptom cramp , diarrhea , evidence increase mast cell determine upper GI study ; adrenaline anaphylactic shock . Patients respond conventional treatment may offer participation experimental therapy study . Participating family member medical history blood sample drawn look genetic abnormality .</brief_summary>
