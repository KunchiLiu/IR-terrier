	<brief_summary>Patients study undergo PET scan ( type nuclear image test ) look abnormality certain brain protein associated seizure . Studies animal show serotonin-a chemical messenger produce body-attaches protein brain cell call 5HT1A receptor change way may help control seizure . There little information change , however . A new compound highly sensitive 5HT1A , use PET imaging measure level activity receptor try detect abnormality . Changes receptor activity may help determine brain seizure originate . Additional PET scan do measure amount blood flow brain rate brain use glucose-a sugar brain 's main fuel . Blood flow measurement use calculate distribution serotonin receptor , glucose use help determine seizure affect brain function . The information gain study use try help guide patient 's therapy determine surgery might beneficial control patient 's seizure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : study serotonin receptor patient localization-related epilepsy . Studies experimental animal suggest : Serotonin anticonvulsant neurotransmitter number seizure model ; anticonvulsant action mediate activation 5-HT ( 1A ) receptor ; drug antiepileptic effect may release 5HT block reuptake , mechanism appear relate therapeutic effect . 5HT ( 1A ) receptor abundant region entorhinal cortex , hippocampus , temporal neocortex , epileptogenic zone frequently find . Considerable evidence literature indicate alteration 5-HT ( 1A ) receptor exist experimental model generalize complex partial seizure . There little data change 5-HT receptor epileptic patient . Study population : 75 patient localization-related epilepsy 20 normal control , age 18-60 . Design : Using new PET compound highly selective 5-HT ( 1A ) silent antagonist refer ( 18 ) FCWAY , attempt detect abnormality serotonin receptor vivo patient epilepsy . The patient ( 18 ) FCWAY serotonin receptor study ( include ( 15 ) H2O-CBF PET ) high resolution T1-weighted MRI co-registration . ( 18 ) FDG-PET perform patient part seizure focus localization . We also test subject serotonin transporter polymorphism associate depression , perform standard depression battery . Outcome measure : 5HT-1A receptor bind Glucose metabolism measure PET .</detailed_description>
