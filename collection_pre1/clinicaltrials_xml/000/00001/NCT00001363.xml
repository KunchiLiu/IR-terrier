	<brief_summary>Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) technique use investigate functional activity brain . The PET technique allow doctor study normal process brain ( central nervous system ) normal individual patient neurologic illness without physical / structural damage brain . When region brain active , use fuel form oxygen sugar ( glucose ) . As brain use fuel produce waste product , carbon dioxide water . Blood carry fuel brain waste product away brain . As brain activity increase blood flow area activity increase also . Knowing fact , researcher use radioactive water ( H215O ) PET scan observe area brain receiving blood flow . This study attempt determine area brain activate planning process decision making . Researchers ask patient participate test game ( chess ) stimulate area brain involved decision make plan undergoing water PET blood flow technique .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This protocol attempt determine topographical distribution brain cognitive component plan use [ 150 ] water PET blood flow technique . We administer perception , motor , simple decision , plan task use game chess Tower Hanoi Test paradigm . Utilizing `` subtraction technique '' hope identify area cerebral cortex activate planning process . It predict dorsolateral frontal area prominently activate . It also predict essential component plan process regardless type plan execute . The data collect value determine 1 ) neural representation planning process 2 ) guide cognitive model plan system .</detailed_description>
