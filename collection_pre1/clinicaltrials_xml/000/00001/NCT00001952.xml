	<brief_summary>The effectiveness local anesthetic reduce inflammation present , make difficult control pain procedure root canal wisdom teeth removal . This set study assess effectiveness opioid ( synthetic narcotic ) fentanyl enhance local anesthetic lidocaine ( deliver epinephrine ) use inflamed molar teeth . In first study , topical anesthetic patch placebo place gum tissue next four five low posterior teeth . The patch remove either 5 , 10 , 15 minute . An electronic test sends light electronic impulse tooth , lip sensitivity testing ( `` Is lip numb ? `` ) , discomfort report start immediately removal patch repeat every 5 minute 30 minute . An oral surgeon remove patient 's wisdom teeth ( tooth ) . In second third study , topical anesthetic place gum tissue . An electronic test sends light electronic impulse tooth , lip sensitivity testing ( `` Is lip numb ? `` ) , discomfort report start do several time throughout test . Then two small opening , one side tooth , drill bony tissue surround tooth . A narcotic drug fentanyl placebo drug deliver opening , allow placement drug next nerve difficult numb . Lidocaine , along small amount epinephrine , deliver . An oral surgeon remove patient 's wisdom teeth tooth ( study 2 ) root canal ( study 3 ) . In fourth study , topical anesthetic place gum tissue . Then two small opening , one side tooth , drill bony tissue surround tooth . A narcotic drug fentanyl placebo drug deliver opening . Lidocaine , along small amount epinephrine , deliver one three rate ( 15 patient rate ) . Blood pressure , heart rate , breathe rate take topical anesthetic patch apply , 2 minute , every 5 minute next 45 minute . Blood sample take 6 time course 60 minute . When test complete , oral surgeon remove wisdom teeth ( tooth ) . One month later , blood sample take use different drug delivery method order compare result .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The clinical efficacy local anesthetic reduce presence inflammation , sometimes limit ability perform necessary therapeutic procedure . Recent study suggest , however , opiate receptor express dental pulp oral mucosal tissue increase number condition inflammation . The propose clinical study assess therapeutic effectiveness opioid , fentanyl , enhance profoundness local anesthetic lidocaine 1:100,000 epinephrine use inflamed mandibular molar teeth . Delivering lidocaine 2 % 1:100,000 epinephrine intraosseously immediately deliver fentanyl intraosseously predict increase success rate local anesthesia inflame pulpal tissue mandibular molar . Three different strategy study assess fentanyl adjunct local anesthesia . The first study ass efficacy individual drug normal condition patient whose mandibular molar healthy pulpal tissue . Pulpal anesthesia measure electronic pulp tester drug deliver intraosseously . A second study evaluate local anesthetic success use drug route administration patient whose mandibular molar inflame pulpal tissue . Root canal treatment test clinical effectiveness local anesthesia . A third study assess systemic side effect use different rate intraosseous drug delivery . This series study may provide rationale adjunctive administration opioids clinical condition inflammation limit effectiveness local anesthetic alone .</detailed_description>
