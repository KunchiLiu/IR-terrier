	<detailed_description>DNA-based immunization mimic live-attenuated virus vaccination stimulation humoral cellular arm immune system ; thus , potentially provide advantage live virus vaccination without potential risk . It essential novel vaccine strategy ( include DNA-based immunization ) continue develop enter Phase I human test date , candidate vaccine approximately 30 AVEG Phase I II trial progress Phase III efficacy trial . Use Biojector jet gun vaccine delivery may also potential psychological , comfort , safety immunologic advantage traditional needle syringe method delivery . A total 40 volunteer receive four immunization ( month 0 , 1 , 2 6 ) follow : 10 volunteer enrol 100 microgram dose give intramuscularly ( IM ) needle syringe . If dose appear safe well tolerate Day 14 , 20 volunteer enrol 300 microgram dose ; 10 receive vaccine administer needle syringe , 10 receive vaccine administer Biojector . If 300 microgram dose appear safe well tolerate Day 14 10 volunteer receive intramuscular ( IM ) injection needle syringe , additional group volunteer enrol 1000 microgram dose give needle syringe . NOTE : Within group 10 volunteer , 8 receive APL-400-047 , 2 receive control preparation ( bupivacaine carrier alone ) . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 07/98 : An additional group 12 volunteer treat dose 3000 microgram administer needle syringe . Ten volunteer receive APL-400-047 formulate bupivacaine facilitating agent ; remain 2 patient receive control preparation ( bupivacaine carrier alone ) . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 4/27/99 : Volunteers previously prim either 300 1000 microgram APL-400-047 vaccine receive additional dose DNA ( control , control volunteer original protocol ) follow one month later two monthly canarypox ( placebo control volunteer original protocol ) boost . ]</detailed_description>
