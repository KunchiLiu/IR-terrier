	<brief_summary>Early study show immune system may play role development stroke . Conditions high blood pressure , high cholesterol , diabetes , old age activate immune system increase risk develop harden artery ( atherosclerosis ) damage blood vessel . Researchers attempt characterize factor may contribute atherosclerosis stroke measure certain component immune system , cytokine leukocyte activation . Measurements take patient consider stroke prone patient without risk factor development stroke . Researchers measure immune system component begin study , six month , one-year completion study . The study attempt determine ; I ) If patient risk factor stroke increase activation immune system II ) If patient risk factor stroke symptomatic high level immune system activation compare patient symptom III ) If patient increase activation immune system accelerate harden artery ( atherosclerosis )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Preliminary study indicate activation immune system risk factor stroke ( hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , diabetes age ) increase risk atherosclerosis formation intravascular thrombosis . By measure level cytokine leukocyte activation stroke prone population age match control without risk factor , attempt make characterize factor potentially increase risk carotid atherosclerosis subsequent cerebral infarction . A total one hundred twenty subject risk factor stroke forty control enrol two year period follow one year . All subject blood drawn time enrollment , six month , one year measure cytokine level ( include Interleukin-I , Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha , Interleukin-8 ) leukocyte activation/receptor ( include Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) , Endothelial Leukocyte Adhesion Molecule-1 ( ELAM-1 ) , V-Cell Adhesion Molecule ( VCAM ) , Macrophage Antigen-1 ) . Carotid doppler perform time enrollment one year . An analysis perform : 1 ) determine patient risk factor stroke increase activation baseline cytokine level leukocytes , 2 ) determine patient stroke risk factor symptomatic increase activation cytokine leukocyte vs. asymptomatic patient , 3 ) determine patient increase cytokine/leukocyte activity accelerate atherosclerosis carotid artery .</detailed_description>
