	<brief_title>Genetic Study Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : Schizophrenia complex genetic disorder likely involve many gene produce slight increase risk . Finding weak-acting gene complex genetic disorder challenge likely require number approach large clinical sample . Several strategy emerge recently appear markedly improve power genetic study detect gene . These include use association ( rather linkage ) use intermediate phenotype addition DMS-IV diagnosis . Study Population : We propose take advantage technique study quantitative trait relate schizophrenia patient , sibling , control . Design : We employ association design , rather linkage . Traits include quantifiable neurobiological variable implicate previously possible phenotype relate schizophrenia . These include test attention cognition , variety parameter use brain imaging magnetoencephalography . Outcome Measure : We use several statistical method show specific genetic polymorphism affect phenotype , include case control family base association study .</detailed_description>
