	<brief_summary>Glutamate amino acid release brain cell act excite cell . Glutamate attach special site cell call AMPA ( alpha-amino-2,3-dihydro-5 methyl 3-oxo-4-isoxazolepropanoic acid ) receptor . The brain cell responsible release glutamate damage Alzheimer 's disease condition affect think reason . Researchers would like see give patient drug attache AMPA receptor improve symptom Alzheimer 's disease . CX516 ( Ampalex ) test drug affect AMPA receptor . This study investigate effectiveness safety CX516 patient Alzheimer 's disease . Patients give capsule CX516 placebo ( sugar pill neither harm help ) 16 week different amount . The effectiveness drug measure neurological test . Safety monitor frequent check-ups lab examination .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stimulation neuronal excitatory amino acid receptor important step formation memory . It unknown whether stimulation receptor patient Alzheimer 's disease dementing disorder improve cognitive function . To determine whether positive modulation AMPA receptor , active animal model dementia , improve cognitive function demented patient , CX516 , dose 900mg TID , administer orally 12 week patient dementia . In randomized , control proof-of-principle study , drug-induced alteration intellectual function measure standardized neuropsychological test . Safety monitor frequent clinical assessment laboratory test .</detailed_description>
