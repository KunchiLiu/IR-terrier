	<brief_summary>The purpose research study new way test chromosome abnormality . Chromosomes strand DNA ( genetic material cell nucleus ) make genes-the unit heredity . Chromosome abnormality usually investigate stain chromosome dye ( Giemsa stain ) examine microscope . This method detect many duplication deletion piece chromosome accurate diagnose certain abnormality . It useful , however , identify small abnormality . This study evaluate accuracy test method use 24 different dye find small chromosome abnormality . Children adults various chromosome abnormality may eligible study , include , example , people developmental delay mental retardation , abnormal growth feature growth retardation , certain behavioral disorder . Participants evaluate clinic 1- 3-day period , depend symptom . All participant examine genetics specialist physical examination possibly X-rays , computerize tomography ( CT ) scan , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , ultrasound study medical photography . Blood drawn chromosome testing-about 3 tablespoon adult 1 3 teaspoon child . When test result available , participant return clinic follow-up evaluation review test finding . The genetic medical evaluation , along implication , discuss .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There range genomic aberration aneuploidy single base pair deletion insert . Present technology use microscopic cytogenetics detection large rearrangement ( great 2 Mb ) molecular technique small rearrangement ( less 2 Mb ) . There gap practical diagnostic technology microscopic cytogenetics poor sensitivity aberration less 5 Mb molecular technique cumbersome clinical use megabase range . In many case possible determine aberration present microscopic cytogenetics characterize . We propose use Spectral Karyotyping ( SKY ) supplementary FISH molecular technique characterize aberration . Subjects see OP9 clinical genetics evaluation phlebotomy SKY . Confirmation SKY result perform standard FISH , genomic content mapping , standard technique .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Physical anomaly developmental anomaly . Karyotype show derivative chromosome abnormality fully characterize . No abnormal parental karyotype . No prenatal specimen . Probands age , gender , ethnic origin eligible . The proband must nonmosaic abnormal Gbanded chromosome analysis good quality show one derivative chromosome whose foreign component determine standard Gbanding technique . The parent also Gbanded chromosome analysis prior eligibility consent 2 . If do refer physician , may do part protocol . The proband abnormal karyotype one follow feature : dysmorphic feature ; developmental delay mental retardation ; growth retardation , microephaly , short stature failure thrive ; behavioral disorder Biological parent must willing supply blood specimen . If feature list , must attend clinic proband eligible . The proband must evaluate NCHGR clinical genetics service PI , coinvestigator , associate . Mothers query potential nonpaternity . If nonpaternity possible , family need undergo clinical paternity evaluation enrol study .</criteria>
