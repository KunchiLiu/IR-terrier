	<brief_summary>The purpose study understand biologic basis schizophrenia determine symptom related illness related medication use treat illness . Schizophrenia related psychosis chronic brain disorder whose prognosis often poor whose pathophysiology remain obscure . Brain image technology positron emission tomography ( PET ) , functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) offer opportunity study pathophysiology psychotic disorder evaluate brain function . However , use anti-psychotic drug may interfere result study . In study , psychotropic medication discontinue patient short period time distinguish effect illness brain without interference medication 's effect brain . Given risk patient 's symptoms increase , ask stay inpatient unit NIMH clinical staff available help 24 hour day . This study conduct three phase . In Phase 1 , participant admit Clinical Center continue take medication undergo diagnostic interview , physical laboratory assessment , physiological monitoring , neuropsychological testing . Behavioral rating also perform blood urine sample collect . During Phase 2 , participant continue take medication blind fashion 8 12 week . The active medication replace placebo ( inactive pill ) part time . PET , fMRI , MRI scan use monitor continuation lack medication affect brain . Psychological test also give measure change cognition . In Phase 3 , participant opportunity clinical stabilization .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : Schizophrenia relate psychosis chronic brain disorder whose prognosis often poor whose pathophysiology remain obscure . Neuroimaging technology PET ( positron emission tomography ) , fMRI ( functional magnetic resonance imaging ) , DTI ( diffusion tensor image ) MRSI ( magnetic resonance spectroscopic image ) offer opportunity elucidate pathophysiology study brain function live research subject . The use technique study psychotic disorder severely limit , however , critical methodological confound : antipsychotic treatment . The purpose protocol admit research subject schizophrenia related disorder Clinical Center , carefully evaluate neuropsychiatric status , discontinue psychotropic medication brief period research subject study without confound antipsychotic treatment . Study Population : 600 participant The study include research subject schizophrenia . Study Design : There several phase protocol . The first phase evaluation phase include gather historical data , structure diagnostic interview , general physical laboratory assessment , basic physiological monitoring , neuropsychological testing , limited collection blood urine sample , serial behavioral rating . In second phase , research subject receive blind compound contain inactive placebo active antipsychotic administer crossover fashion . Patients unit clinical nursing staff evaluate care patient blind arm status . Each arm normally last 4 6 week . The total duration phase 8 12 week . During coded antipsychotic period , research subject enrol series neuroimaging approved study design elucidate neurobiology disorder . These include study use neuropsychological testing , MEG , PET , fMRI , DTI , MRSI . The antipsychotic free period essential distinguish effect illness versus medication . Outcome Measures : Parameters investigation include trait candidate phenotype genetic study state-dependent aspect brain function . The combined use many neuroimaging modality allow u look functional relationship variety brain abnormality hypothesize play role schizophrenia . These include hippocampal neurochemical abnormality , deficit prefrontal cortical activation , dysregulation subcortical dopamine single research subject .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Age 18 old Male female Diagnosis Schizophrenia , Schizoaffective Disorder Psychosis NOS . Subjects neuropsychiatric disorder may also admit participate protocol sufficient evidence believe underlying , undiagnosed schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder psychosis NOS . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Currently treat depot medication . Because long halflife depot medication paliperidone palmitate ( Invega Sustenna ) , applicants program exclude currently receive depot medication monthly . However , applicant may decide switch depot oral medication , conjunction personal physician , come program . This part research participate decision . A sufficient washout period base particular longacting injectable medication elimination halflife require order prospective participant eligible . Most medication require 6month washout period , short elimination halflives , risperidone powder ( Risperdal Consta ) , require 3 month . Subjects may complete last 3 month washout inpatient unit evaluate standard protocol . Major medical illness . Research subject identify major medical problem primary neuropsychiatric disorder exclude admission . Applicants judge unsuitable medication free study also exclude . Possible reason exclusion include prior history dangerousness self others , particularly medication . Applicants pregnant exclude study . Volunteers find pregnant testing terminate study refer OBGYN follow care . Infection syphilis , hepatitis , HIV . History substance alcohol abuse 5 year lifetime total exclusionary . Subjects recent substance abuse ( 3 month prior admission ) could consider admission case case basis long 5 year lifetime abuse criterion present . Lack capacity provide consent .</criteria>
