	<brief_summary>This study investigate , condition eosinophils ( type white blood cell ) become activated examine function immune reaction . Eosinophil count often rise response allergy , asthma , parasitic worm infection . They also go uncommon autoimmune condition , rarely , association tumor . Elevated level cell call eosinophilia . Usually , eosinophilia cause apparent symptom , rare case may local swell itching , allergic lung problem , heart disease nerve damage cause release toxic substance cell body tissue . Patients 1 100 year age eosinophil count great 750/ml abnormal accumulation eosinophil skin body tissue may eligible study . All participant thorough medical history , physical examination blood test . Depending person 's age symptom , diagnostic test may do , include specialized study eye , lung , skin , bone marrow , nerve heart . This treatment study , experimental treatment offer . Patients require treatment receive standard medical care . Certain procedure may request solely research purpose . All participant ask donate extra blood laboratory study investigate immune cell immune substance blood act stimulate rise eosinophil . In addition , participant may undergo one following : - &lt; TAB &gt; Annual Follow-up evaluation - Physical examination blood test evaluate change patient 's condition eosinophil count time . - &lt; TAB &gt; Bone marrow biopsy aspiration recommend initial evaluation , certain patient time important look directly newly develop cell bone marrow . For procedure area skin bone anesthetize xylocaine ( anesthetic similar use dentist ) , sharp needle use sample bone marrow evaluation . Bone marrow biopsy aspiration side effect pain and/or bleeding skin soft tissue site procedure . Rarely area biopsy site become infected , treated antibiotic . - &lt; TAB &gt; Genetic testing : Some blood draw part study use genetic test . Genetic test help researcher study health illness pass parent child . Any genetic information collect discover family confidential . - &lt; TAB &gt; Leukapheresis ( patient 18 year old ) collect large number certain cell - In procedure , whole blood collect needle place arm vein . The blood circulates machine separate component . The white cell remove rest blood return body , either needle use draw blood second needle place arm ... .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Activation Function Eosinophils Conditions With Blood Tissue Eosinophilia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects admit protocol elevate eosinophil count peripheral blood tissue relatives subject eosinophilia . Eosinophilic subject undergo extensive clinical evaluation focus identification cause eosinophilia presence end organ manifestation . In addition , characterize detail immunologically , blood cell and/or serum collect provide reagent ( eg . specific antibody , T-cell clone , etc . ) use laboratory address broad question relate etiology eosinophilia , immunoregulation , degree source eosinophil activation , and/or functional role eosinophil afferent arm immune response prominent . While protocol primarily design study treatment patient blood tissue eosinophilia , clinical immunological response various medically indicated therapy carefully monitor . The subject follow time determine kinetics nature factor affect degree eosinophilia level activation degranulation eosinophils various time point response various stimulus . It anticipated subject receive degree clinical evaluation , care monitoring extensive generally available specimen collect prove valuable reagent laboratory study relate eosinophilia , eosinophil activation function . Recognized cause subject hypereosinophilia treat appropriately either clinical service refer physician . Standard care therapy may provide indicated HES variant . This protocol also allow clinical laboratory evaluation family member subject eosinophilia order help identify genetic cause eosinophilia provide control immunologic study . Interviews conduct subset HES patient provide information patient sign symptom use development patient-related outcome questionnaire use future treatment study . Finally , adult subject gastrointestinal involvement may ask provide stool sample microbiome analysis assessment stool level eosinophil granule protein explore role microbiome eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease . Stool sample may also obtain adult subject undergo endoscopy and/or colonoscopy part initial evaluation and/or assessment response treatment . Potential confounding variable , include body mass index , diet , stool transit time vitamin D level assess time stool collection .</detailed_description>
