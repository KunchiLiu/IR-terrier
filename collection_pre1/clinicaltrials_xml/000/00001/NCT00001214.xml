	<brief_summary>Aplastic anemia condition cell normally find blood greatly decrease . The normal level white blood cell , red blood cell , platelet much low patient aplastic anemia . Because low level blood cell , patient aplastic anemia variety immune system abnormality . However , low level blood cell make difficult collect specialized white blood cell ( mononuclear cell ) research study . This study design collect lymphocytes patient low level blood cell ( pancytopenia ) use research . Patients participate study undergo special procedure know lymphapheresis . During lymphapheresis blood take patient manner similar blood donation . The white blood cell selectively remove spinning ( centrifugation ) , remain red blood cell platelet place back ( re-infused ) donor blood stream . Patients participate study benefit directly . However , cell collect study may increase scientific knowledge improve understanding treatment disease like aplastic anemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collection Blood From Patients With Pancytopenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients aplastic anemia , myelodysplasia , marrow failure syndrome variety immunologic abnormality include lymphocyte phenotypic lymphokine production dysregulation . Because low blood count , difficult obtain sufficient peripheral blood mononuclear cell research study . Patients agree protocol lymphapheresed equivalent one two unit cell ( approximately 1-2 x 10 ( 8 ) cell ) , use research purpose .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All patient aplastic anemia bone marrow failure would expect obtain 1 X 10 ( 8 ) mononuclear cell 100 mls peripheral blood ( i.e . absolute lymphocyte count approximately less 2000 per mm ( 3 ) ) . Age great equal 18 . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients unable comprehend investigational nature procedure . Patients unable tolerate temporary reduction blood volume equivalent one unit blood .</criteria>
