	<brief_summary>Occasionally tumor parathyroid gland detect standard x-ray diagnostic procedure ( CT scan , MRIs , ultrasounds ) . In order tumor remove surgically must first localize . To often require procedure know parathyroid arteriography parathyroid venous sampling . This procedure begin place catheter blood vessel groin . The catheter guide blood vessel reach area neck . The blood vessel region flow thyroid parathyroid . An X-ray dye inject catheter artery thyroid/parathyroid ( parathyroid arteriography ) . The alternative take small sample vein find region ( parathyroid venous sample ) . Researchers prefer parathyroid arteriography cause less discomfort patient require less experience procedure . However , parathyroid arteriography provide positive result 50 % patient undergoing procedure . Parathyroid venous sample provide great amount positive result reading often imprecise . Parathyroid tissue secrete hormone know PTH ( parathyroid hormone ) . The release PTH stimulate low level calcium blood . The idea behind study inject dye area parathyroid cause release PTH . Several parathyroid venous sampling take follow abrupt elevation PTH . This provide information effectiveness intraarterial hypocalcemic stimulus ( injection dye artery parathyroid calcium blood level low ) venous sample technique improve localize parathyroid tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although noninvasive diagnostic study [ ultrasound ( US ) , compute tomography ( CT ) , sestamibi scanning , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ] detect parathyroid pathology one-half patient refer NIH recurrent persistent hyperparathyroidism ( 1 ) , invasive study ( direct aspiration PTH , arteriography , venous sample ) must perform remain patient provide definitive preoperative localization ( 2 ) . Arteriography positive less half patient must proceed parathyroid venous sampling , technique require broad experience yield positive , imprecise result regard localization . The abrupt lowering calcium blood perfuse parathyroid adenoma stimulate release PTH could detect simultaneous venous sampling . This principle , intraarterial injection secretagogue subsequent sampling release hormone , apply successfully localization insulinomas ( 3 ) gastrinomas ( 4 ) . In fact , portal venous sampling longer perform group patient , completely replace intraarterial injection secretin calcium appropriate secretagogues gastrin insulin . Since release PTH parathyroid adenoma stimulate hypocalcemic perfusion , propose perform serial venous sample catheter position SVC detect abrupt elevation PTH follow injection contrast agent vessel selectively catheterized time parathyroid arteriography ( superior thyroid artery , thyrocervical trunk , internal mammary artery ) . Samples SVC catheter obtain 20 second interval one minute patient simultaneous peripheral sample . An elevation parathyroid hormone 1.5 time baseline consider diagnostic . This technique apply routinely injection standard parathyroid arteriography even absence angiographically-visualized adenoma : elevation PTH provide localize information comparable venous sampling . In addition , image study suggest particular anatomic site likely location patient 's adenoma , sodium citrate , calcium chelating agent , inject artery supply region . Blood sample obtain similar fashion sample take contrast injection measure PTH release follow sodium citrate injection determine whether effective hypocalcemic stimulant .</detailed_description>
