	<brief_summary>This study measure normal range human electro-oculogram ( EOG ) people various age group . EOGs record electrical signal generate retina ( light-sensitive tissue back eye ) go dark bright environment . They provide valuable information function eye health disease . A knowledge result expect test normal , healthy eye valuable assess EOG result patient know suspected retinal disease . Normal volunteer age 6 65 healthy eye normal eyesight participate study . Candidates undergo test check vision health eye . Study participants electro-oculogram . In test , eye drop place eye enlarge pupil . Two electrode ( small disk pick electrical signal ) attach leave right eye one forehead . ( These similar electrode place body electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , measure electrical signal heart . ) During EOG recording , volunteer look inside hollow sphere , follow eye small red light turn . The background light also turn test . Some volunteer may ask repeat EOG another time . Study participant may also ask provide blood sample test study immune cell blood respond protein find retina . The response normal volunteer compare patient eye disease like retinitis pigmentosa .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Electro-oculograms ( EOGs ) record volunteer different age group normal visual function . The fast slow oscillation EOG study . For analysis fast EOG oscillation , peak-to-peak amplitude ( micro V ) , peak-to-trough ratio , phase ( degree ) measure . The analysis slow EOG oscillation include measurement ratio light peak dark trough ( Arden ratio ) , implicit time ( latency ) light peak ( m ) , amplitude dark trough ( micro V ) .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subjects must best correct visual acuity equal well 20/20 . Subjects must normal visual field . Subjects must normal color vision . Subjects must normal ophthalmological exam . Subjects subjective objective evidence visual loss . Subjects subjective evidence abnormal night vision subjective evidence abnormal light sensitivity . Subjects personal history nontrivial ocular disease . Subjects family history hereditary ocular disease . Subjects current systemic disease . Subjects currently take neuropharmacological medication . Subjects admit abnormal ophthalmological examination . Subjects need ability cooperate EOG recording .</criteria>
