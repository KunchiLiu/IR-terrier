	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate physiology associate plasticity motor system . Plasticity refer process neighbor brain cell assume responsibility damage diseased brain cell . The mechanism behind process unknown . However , researcher several theory plastic change take place . Possible explanation include growth new connection brain cell use previously unused connection . Researchers plan use transcranial magnetic stimulation drug intervention order determine mechanism responsible specific type plasticity . Previous study show certain drug affect mechanism involve change . By use one drug time , researcher plan evaluate role several different mechanism brain reorganization .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate physiology associate plasticity motor system see number different circumstance . Techniques use involve combination transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) pharmacologic intervention . We propose use drug judge safe , either potentiate GABA relate intracortical inhibition , change presynaptic release excitatory aminoacids like glutamate , decrease activity NMDA receptor ( mostly antiepileptic drug ) . If plastic change express large motor map motor evoke potential ( MEP ) TMS secondary intracortical disinhibition , administration drug potentiate intracortical inhibition may result decreased plasticity small motor map MEP . This finding would identify intracortical disinhibition mechanism responsible type plasticity . Similarly , plastic change decrease drug inhibits release excitatory aminoacids , antagonize action NMDA receptor , mechanism underlie plasticity likely mediate modulation release excitatory aminoacids activity NMDA-receptors . Results study provide information relative involvement intracortical disinhibition , modulation release excitatory aminoacids , role NMDA receptor different setting human plasticity .</detailed_description>
