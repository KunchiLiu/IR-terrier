	<brief_summary>Bone marrow transplant ( BMT ) one form treatment disorder blood , include leukemia . However , procedure often associate potentially life-threatening reaction , usually reserve patient serious illness age 60 year old . One serious reaction complicate bone marrow transplant refer graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . GVHD potentially fatal incompatibility reaction . The reaction cause antigen find cell patient present cell donor . The antigen recognize transplanted white blood cell ( lymphocyte ) . These lymphocytes begin attack recipient cell tissue may lead death . In order avoid GVHD , researcher develop technique use peripheral blood instead bone marrow allow transplantation stem cell removal lymphocyte . Stem cell cell responsible return blood cell production normal . Lymphocytes white blood cell cause GVHD . The technique require two step . In first step blood cell collect donor receive dos growth factor . The growth factor ( granulocyte colony stimulate factor ) design increase production donor stem cell . In second step white blood cell lymphocytes remove collected blood , leave stem cell . The main goal study develop improve method processing cell collect stimulation growth factor ( G-CSF ) , remove white blood cell lymphocytes cause graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) keep stem cell necessary healthy blood cell building . In addition , researcher interest study whether give G-CSF effect lymphocyte function , may influence immune reaction occur bone marrow transplantation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The NHLBI Hematology Branch Stem Cell Transplantation program explore way make allogeneic transplantation safer widely applicable . Prior Hematology Branch transplant protocol evaluate strategy use T cell deplete marrow transplant follow delayed lymphocyte add-back control prevent GVHD conserve useful donor immune function residual leukemia infectious agent . Over past ten year , number increasingly efficient method use deplete T cell retain stem cell , show safety utility delay T cell add-back approach . We also find positive relationship administration high CD34+ cell dose outcome . Investigation highly purify graft add-back specific T cell population ongoing , ability test new purification approach device clinical-scale PBSC product critical continue development new transplantation approach program . This require test approach G-CSF mobilize PBSCs collect apheresis healthy donor , since cell source use clinical allogeneic transplantation protocols program . Therefore , primary intent protocol provide mechanism mobilizing , collect , store , analyze G-CSF mobilized apheresis sample healthy volunteer . Cells use develop method processing cell collect stimulation G-CSF , remove lymphocyte , mediate GVHD retain stem cell necessary hematopoietic reconstitution . At time study whether G-CSF administration effect lymphocyte , function may influence immune reaction occur allogeneic bone marrow transplantation . Furthermore CD34+ cell collect valuable resource experimental study lymphocyte-stem cell interaction laboratory .</detailed_description>
