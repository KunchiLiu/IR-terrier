	<brief_summary>To compare proportion patient sustain suppression plasma HIV RNA undetectable level [ AS PER AMENDMENT 09/19/97 : 200 copies/mL Roche UltraSensitive assay ] among 3 regimen maintenance phase . The objective antiretroviral therapy reduce HIV replication , preserve immunologic function delay development HIV-related complication . In patient administered potent antiretroviral regimen , HIV RNA level reduce 500 copies/ml plasma level detection commercially available assay . This protocol attempt learn less intensive regimen successfully sustain viral suppression induction triple-drug regimen . The study also address whether HIV eradicate patient follow prolonged treatment induction maintenance regimen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective antiretroviral therapy reduce HIV replication , preserve immunologic function delay development HIV-related complication . In patient administered potent antiretroviral regimen , HIV RNA level reduce 500 copies/ml plasma level detection commercially available assay . This protocol attempt learn less intensive regimen successfully sustain viral suppression induction triple-drug regimen . The study also address whether HIV eradicate patient follow prolonged treatment induction maintenance regimen . All patient receive open label induction therapy zidovudine ( ZDV ) , lamivudine ( 3TC ) indinavir ( IDV ) 6 month . Following 6 month induction phase , patient undetectable plasma HIV RNA week 16 , 20 24 enter maintenance phase [ blind maintenance phase AS PER AMENDMENT 09/19/97 ] randomize one three maintenance regimen , i.e. , either continue ZDV/3TC/IDV ( control ) , ZDV/3TC/IDV placebo ZDV placebo/3TC placebo/IDV . Prior randomization , patient stratify accord entry HIV RNA level ( great equal 30,000 less 30,000 copies/ml ) prior ZDV therapy ( least 7 day less 7 day ) . After 12 month [ AS PER AMENDMENT 09/19/97 : 18 month ] maintenance therapy , treatment withdrawn 6-month interval randomly-selected patient achieve undetectable HIV RNA . AS PER 09/19/97 AMENDMENT : After 18 month blind maintenance therapy , treatment unblinded patient whose HIV RNA level remain detectable . Such patient receive optimal therapy , either continue protocol regimen initiate alternative therapy . AS PER AMENDMENT 2/27/98 : An interim review conduct January , 1998 demonstrate strategy less intensive antiviral therapy 6 month IDV/3TC/ZDV induction therapy less effective continuation triple drug therapy except ZDV-naive patient assign ZDV/3TC . Therefore , maintenance phase study discontinue . Patients currently blind maintenance unblinded immediately option reinitiating open-label triple therapy IDV/3TC/ZDV discontinue study treatment . Patients currently induction may register continue open-label triple therapy may discontinue study treatment . This amendment allow treatment extension subject may receive open-label triple therapy May 31 , 1998 . At time , rollover protocol another modification longer period drug supply may become available . Patients choose go treatment follow May 31 , 1998 . AS PER AMENDMENT 04/23/98 : This study provide treatment open-label ZDV/3TC/IDV August 1 , 1998 . A rollover protocol another 343 protocol modification longer period drug supply may become available , guarantee . AS PER AMENDMENT 06/19/98 : This study provide treatment open-label ZDV/3TC/IDV either November 1 , 1998 3 month rollover study ( A5025 ) available study site ( whichever come first ) .</detailed_description>
