	<brief_summary>The purpose study see observe therapy help HIV-positive patient stick anti-HIV medication schedule . Observed therapy mean nurse watch patient take medication make sure take correctly . It important HIV-positive patient take anti-HIV medication correctly get best possible benefit . Taking drug correctly , call `` adherence , '' may keep HIV virus level blood ( viral load ) low long time . Adherence also slow development drug resistance , especially important patient early HIV infection begin treatment . However , anti-HIV medication schedule often complicate , many patient difficulty remember take drug correct time . This study look effectiveness plan help patient problem .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Adherence Plan Help HIV-Positive Patients Take Their First Anti-HIV Medications Correctly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Novel approach need improve adherence combination antiretroviral therapy . Nonadherence lead reduce drug level inadequate viral suppression , accelerate drug resistance . Thus nonadherence first month primary HIV infection limit therapeutic option individual year later . Barriers optimal treatment adherence patient early HIV infection include complex treatment regimen disrupt daily routine , drug intolerance , concomitant illness include depression . Directly observed therapy successful improve overall effectiveness antituberculosis therapy may useful strategy HIV-infected patient . All patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy didanosine ( ddI ) , stavudine ( d4T ) , efavirenz ( EFV ) , nelfinavir ( NFV ) . Patients randomize self-administered ( SAT ) versus observe ( MAT ) therapy 24 week . Patients randomized MAT receive one directly observe dose ( ddI , d4T , EFV , NFV ) antiretroviral regimen field worker nurse clinic 5 day per week . As reminder second NFV d4T dose , MAT patient provide alarm watch program sound dose time . The alarm watch also serve reminder weekend dose directly observe . Patients randomized SAT receive standard care . All patient monitor monthly plasma HIV RNA level CD4 CD8 cell count . At Week 24 , patient cross SAT additional 48 week follow-up .</detailed_description>
