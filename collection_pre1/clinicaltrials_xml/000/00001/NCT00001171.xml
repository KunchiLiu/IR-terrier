	<brief_summary>Presently , patient primary malignant brain tumor life expectancy 15 week follow surgery unless receive additional type therapy ( chemotherapy , radiotherapy , and/or immunotherapy ) . Patients receive additional therapy increase life expectancy 50 week . The statistic life expectancy survival increase effort among researcher develop new treatment primary malignant brain tumor . This research project involve growth study human brain tumor cell outside body laboratory part attempt well understand tumor develop effective treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This protocol involve study human brain tumor cell outside body laboratory part attempt well understand tumor develop effective therapeutic measure . Malignant primary brain tumor patient present life expectancy approximately 15 week follow surgery unless adjunctive measure take . With currently available adjunctive therapy life expectancy reach 50 week . These survival data spur extensive effort develop new treatment modality . Radiation , chemotherapy immunotherapy mildly helpful adjunct use largely empirical ground basis experimentation animal tumor model often quite different nature human brain tumor . Our group seek develop data upon devise new treatment strategy patient malignant brain tumor . The foundation approach rest upon use vitro study cell biology patient 's tumor . It plan utilize tumor vitro investigation immunology , biology , biochemistry molecular biology brain tumor . Optimal conventional therapy give patient seek learn scientific information obtain use help .</detailed_description>
