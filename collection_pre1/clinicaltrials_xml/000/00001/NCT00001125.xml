	<brief_summary>The purpose study see varicella-zoster virus ( VZV ) vaccine safe help prevent shingle HIV-infected child already chickenpox . VZV virus cause chickenpox . If virus reactivate body , also cause shingle . Shingles common child HIV chickenpox , although usually life-threatening . The VZV vaccine use study may able prevent HIV-positive child chickenpox develop shingle .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Varicella ( chickenpox ) result primary infection VZV . Varicella , common usually benign illness normal child , severe HIV-infected child may result condition HZ ( shingle ) . HZ due reactivation latent VZV acquire varicella common HIV-infected child natural varicella . While HZ likely life-threatening child , cause considerable morbidity interfere quality life . Use live-attenuated VZV vaccine may able boost immunity child . Two immunologic cohort enrol . Cohort A include child CD4 cell percentage great equal 20 percent document stable least 6 month prior time varicella develop ( confirm minimum 2 test ) CD4 cell percentage great [ AS PER AMENDMENT 10/27/99 : equal ] 15 percent document stable least 6 month prior enrollment ( confirm minimum 2 test ) . Cohort B include child CD4 cell percentage great equal 10 percent less 15 percent document stable least 6 month prior time varicella develop stable least 6 month prior enrollment ( confirm minimum 2 test ) . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 4/20/01 : Cohort B include child CD4 cell percentage le 15 % document minimum 1 preferably 2 test within 1 year onset varicella ( i.e. , within 1 year 1 year varicella ) CD4 cell percentage great equal 15 % document minimum 2 test time enrollment . ] A pilot study precede full study . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 10/27/99 : The pilot study Cohort A precede full study Cohort A pilot study Cohort B . The pilot study Cohort B precede full study Cohort B . ] The pilot study include 10 child cohort receive live-attenuated VZV Weeks 0 8 . If 3 pilot-study patient cohort meet toxicity endpoint related vaccine , dose regimen fail safety criterion cohort . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 10/27/99 : If 3 child pilot study Cohort A meet toxicity endpoint deem related vaccine , dose regimen fail safety criterion cohort . If 3 child pilot phase Cohort B meet toxicity endpoint deem related vaccine , dose regimen fail safety criterion Cohort B . ] If , 12 week immunization , least 5 pilot-study patient cohort respond safety profile deem adequate , pilot study extend full study immunization additional 20 patient cohort . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 10/27/99 : If , Week 12 , least 5 pilot-study patient Cohort A meet immunologic criterion safety profile deem adequate , full study Cohort A pilot study Cohort B open . If immunologic safety criterion meet pilot study Cohort B , full study Cohort B open . ] If either cohort show inadequate immunologic response safety profile , study team review result determine another regimen consider . In full study , patient receive 2 immunization , Weeks 0 8 . Varicella antibody titer vitro responder cell frequency ( RCF ) assay measure Weeks 0 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 52 , 78 , 104 . Symptoms , HIV progression , VZV presence monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
