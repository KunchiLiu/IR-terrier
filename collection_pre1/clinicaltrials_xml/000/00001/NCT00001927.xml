	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Effective treatment prevention strategy childhood stroke porencephaly develop cause understood . There increase evidence inherit acquire coagulation abnormality , alone combination environmental factor , predispose arterial venous thrombosis . Inherited abnormality factor V leiden , prothrombin , protein C , protein S , antithrombin III may account many thromboses . At present little information exist distribution coagulation anomalies child thrombosis . Recent report suggest clot abnormality may responsible instance intracranial hemorrhage , porencephaly , cerebral palsy fetal death . The objective protocol : 1 ) determine frequency coagulation abnormality child porencephaly stroke compare healthy child , 2 ) determine frequency coagulation abnormality child porencephaly stroke compare family member , 3 ) determine frequency coagulation abnormalities mother child stroke compare mother healthy child , 4 ) describe exogenous condition , concert coagulation factor , may lead development thrombosis child stroke . STUDY POPULATION : This study examine : 1 ) child history porencephaly stroke , 2 ) biological mother , father , sibling , 3 ) healthy volunteer child , 4 ) healthy volunteer mother . DESIGN : This case-control study conduct National Institute Neurological Disorders Stroke . Children history porencephaly stroke 18 year life , first-degree relative , healthy volunteer child , healthy volunteer mother enrol . Each subject may complete blood draw , buccal smear , questionnaire , and/or review medical record depend study group . OUTCOME MEASURES : This study measure frequency several coagulation factor among study 's different population group well examine exogenous condition may contribute stroke child . Analysis descriptive quantitative .</detailed_description>
