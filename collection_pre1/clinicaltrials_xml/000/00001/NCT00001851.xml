	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effectiveness new bone injection technique treat bone disease patient polyostotic fibrous dysplasia McCune-Albright syndrome . In patient , bone develop area much less mineral , make bone prone fracture deformity cause pain . This new treatment intend reduce risk fracture , minimize deformity improve overall function patient . Patients 4 year age old bone lesion highly likely cause significant pain illness may eligible 2-year study . Participants must simultaneously enrol NIDCR 's research protocol 98-D-0145 ( Screening Natural History Patients Polyostotic Fibrous Dysplasia McCune-Albright Syndrome ) 98-D-0146 ( A Randomized , Placebo-Controlled Trial Alendronate Treatment Polyostotic Fibrous Dysplasia McCune-Albright Syndrome ) . Within 14 day bone injection procedure , patient medical history , routine blood test , urinalysis check vital sign ( blood pressure , pulse temperature ) complete 30-minute quality-of-life questionnaire . Women child-bearing potential pregnancy test . Patients recent X-rays bone density scan available review new one take . When study complete , patient undergo bone injection procedure , follow immediately bone densitometry coned-down X-rays , follow : - Bone injection - Patients give anesthetic either make sleepy put sleep completely . A portion bone marrow withdrawn needle insert hip bone , time , abnormal bone arm legs suck use needle . The abnormal bone replace mixture bone marrow collagen ( connective tissue protein ) inject hole bone . The area injection close - Bone densitometry - X-rays operated bone opposite normal bone take . - Coned-down X-rays - Magnified normal X-rays take close-ups active lesion . Patients history physical examination local physician NIH every month first 4 month procedure . Every 6 month procedure , patient return NIH follow-up , include physical examination completion quality-of-life questionnaire . Imaging study inject site do 3 , 6 , 12 month procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bone Marrow Injection Replace Diseased Bone Polyostotic Fibrous Dysplasia McCune-Albright Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia ( PFD ) sporadic disorder affect multiple site skeleton . The bone sit rapidly resorb replace abnormal fibrous tissue . PFD may occur alone part McCune-Albright Syndrome ( MAS ) , syndrome originally define triad PFD , cafe au lait pigmentation skin , precocious puberty . The bony lesion frequently disfigure painful . In addition , depend location lesion , cause significant morbidity . Lesions weight-bearing bone lead disable fracture , lesion skull lead compression vital structure cranial nerve . Currently clearly-defined systemic local therapy bone disease , result use conventional surgical treatment site impend fracture universally disappointing . In study , treat osteolytic lesion long bone upper low extremity , sit potential fracture , novel surgical approach . This involve 1 ) removal abnormal tissue percutaneous aspiration , 2 ) use skeletal precursor cell take unaffected site , mixed bone graft substitute , inject affected site bring improvement local bone quality overall patient function .</detailed_description>

All patient must actively enrol Screening Natural History Protocol possibly Bisphosphonate Protocol . Patients enrol study lytic lesion humerus , femur , tibia satisfies least one follow criterion : lesion encompass least 50 % width bone point AP lateral radiograph ; lesion cause change anatomical shape contour bone ; lesion bone density le 50 % density contralateral , normal side . Patients previous concomitant therapy eligible enrollment . Patients Bisphosphonate Protocol must receive least one month treatment protocol receive bone marrow injection protocol . Women childbearing age offer barrier method contraception decrease risk pregnancy period one year follow transplant . Subjects become pregnant year one study transfer inactive participant group . Pregnancy test perform prior research procedure surgery . Subjects use oral contraceptive agent include . Women without normal menstrual cycle offer hormone replacement therapy period 3 cycle prior treatment . Subjects must agree travel NIH first 24 month remain Bethesda area postoperative period define protocol requirement . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects exclude receive phenobarbital relate antiepileptic agent , include Dilantin Tegretol . Medical problem preclude participation study include : pregnancy ; chronic active dermatological disease ; chronic anemia ( thalassemia , etc . ) ; diabetes mellitus ( fast blood glucose excess 140 mg/dl ) ; active chronic pulmonary disease include COPD , chronic bronchitis , asthma require medication ; active chronic gastrointestinal disease include gastric duodenal ulcer disease inflammatory bowel disease ; history cancer except dermal lesion ; intestinal malabsorption , chronic active renal disease include serum creatinine 1.8 mg/dl ; chronic active hepatic disease include hepatitis ; HIV infection .
