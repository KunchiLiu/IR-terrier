	<brief_summary>Some HIV-infected adult develop lipodystrophy include significant change body shape , fat loss face , arm legs , fat gain trunk . This lipodystrophy often accompany disorder metabolism , increased level fat insulin blood . The majority case see patient take medication call protease inhibitor . These anti-retroviral medication design treat patient HIV . It unclear lipodystrophy result HIV medication use treat HIV . It suggest , proven , lipodystrophy direct side effect protease inhibitor . In addition , unknown HIV-infected child develop significant lipodystrophy take protease inhibitor . This study investigate prevalence metabolic disorder change body fat distribution child take protease inhibitor anti-retroviral medication . The result compare three group ; ( 1 ) child suffer non-HIV chronic infection , ( 2 ) HIV-infected child take protease inhibitor , ( 3 ) healthy child . The study look HIV-infected child already start take protease inhibitor . It evaluate child disorder metabolism well body fat change . In addition , study follow HIV-infected child begin take protease inhibitor . The study follow child 18 month detect development disorder metabolism / body fat change .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Some HIV-infected adult develop lipodystrophy include significant change body shape , fat loss face , arm legs , fat gain trunk . This lipodystrophy often accompany hypertriglyceridemia , hypercholesterolemia , hyperinsulinemia . So far , almost case lipodystrophy occurred patient treat protease inhibitor-containing antiretroviral therapy . Whether lipodystrophy result use protease inhibitor therapy employ HIV infection , one many manifestation HIV infection , unmasked longevity achieve treated protease inhibitor remain uncertain . It suggest , although proven , condition may adverse effect protease inhibitor treatment . It also unknown whether HIV-infected child develop significant lipodystrophy expose protease inhibitor . We propose investigate whether initiation protease inhibitor-containing antiretroviral regimen child HIV infection affect prevalence dyslipidemia , insulin resistance , alteration body fat distribution , study pathophysiology change . The incidence abnormality compare child non-HIV-related chronic infection , HIV-infected child treat protease inhibitor spar regimen , healthy control . This study cross-sectional longitudinal component . Children HIV infection , begin take protease inhibitor already take protease inhibitor part treatment HIV infection , recruit single cross-sectional evaluation include study lipid glucose metabolism body composition . In longitudinal component , child HIV infection , study begin take protease inhibitor , follow prospectively 18 month delineate relationship treatment development lipodystrophy abnormality lipid glucose metabolism . If cross-sectional study show prevalence lipodystrophy associate metabolic alteration increase function exposure protease inhibitor , terminate prospective study . Changes triglyceride level , insulin level , regional body fat evaluate primary outcome measure . As part evaluation perform cross-sectional longitudinal study , investigate pathophysiology dyslipidemia HIV-infected child assess lipoprotein subclass , apolipoproteins , lipoprotein lipase level activity .</detailed_description>
