	<brief_summary>This study design randomize , open trial intermittent continuous infusion Interleukin-2 HIV seropositive patient CD4 cell count 200 500 cells/mm ( 3 ) . The goal study determine optimal duration infusion , optimal interval infusion . Thirty-six patient randomize 3 group : Group A control group regimen five day infusion IL-2 every eight week ; Group B receive IL-2 infusion every eight week , however duration infusion determine parameter reflect T cell proliferation , discontinuation infusion point response appear maximize ; Group C receive five day infusion IL-2 ; however interval infusion determine response see prior infusion , goal administer infusion CD4 cell count remain baseline prior infusion . The dose interleukin-2 use 9 MIU continuous infusion daily . All patient evaluate NIH least every 4 week , time safety lab immune study perform . In addition , patient Groups B C undergo laboratory evaluation weekly , time immune parameter , include CD4 number percent , spontaneous blast transformation , soluble IL-2 receptor level , viral parameter , include branch DNA assay p24 antigen , determine . The study duration approximately one year .</brief_summary>

The study duration approximately one year . Significant modification original protocol describe , include : 1. alter number cycle Group B Group C participant receive increase frequency duration ; 2. drop Group B original randomization process ; 3. provide continue administration IL-2 first year protocol ; 4. change target CD4+ count participant extension receive additional cycle ( ) IL-2 ; 5. increase blood volume draw visit accommodate additional storage plasma serum ; 6. administer corticosteroid 5 day IL-2 administration patient fail respond IL-2 least one year administration ; 7. provide participant receive intravenous IL-2 outpatient basis without assistance caregiver ; 8. administer individualize IL-2 regimen patient first year participation . It also provide revised patient monitoring schedule keep IL-2 protocol long-term monitoring patient longer receive IL-2 . 9. modification steroid administration allow 7-day therapy tapering schedule ; 10. allow use non-licensed , expanded access anti-retrovirals ; 11. allow , select subject , home ( off-site ) self-administration IL-2 .</detailed_description>

Home patient must enrol good stand current NIAID protocol involve use IL2 therapy . The patient must already undergo least one year treatment protocol IL2 therapy give , include least 2 welltolerated outpatient cycle scIL2 stable dose . Home The patient must history generally tolerable side effect receive IL2 require frequent medical intervention , intravenous fluid replacement , and/or IL2 dose reduction . Conditions generally suitable home scIL2 administration would include ( limited ) unusually heavy requirement narcotic usage cycle , significant urticaria ( hive ) allergic condition , history possible airway compromise due throat swell . Home Patient must experience serious ( grade 3 high ) clinical laboratory abnormality medical significance day 05 last 2 outpatient scIL2 cycle . Home The patient must strong relationship private physician healthcare provider home demonstrate close involvement patient 's care date would willing help supervise patient 's care home scIL2 cycle . Because need identify single healthcare provider home agree available render care ( need ) patient 's scIL2 cycle , patient currently receive home care rotate staff member general clinic setting may eligible home scIL2 administration . A signed write statement acknowledge willingness participate monitoring must receive clinic 8 study team private physician healthcare provider prior first home scIL2 cycle . In addition , communication must occur clinic 8study team designate physician healthcare provider prior subsequent cycle confirm individual 's continued willingness serve onsite provider serious medical condition might develop cycle . Home The patient must live home address easy access telephone must demonstrate reliability respond telephone call clinic 8 staff member . The patient must also able provide study team reliable contact information close family member friend agree serve capacity `` caregiver '' cycle : i.e . someone able render nonmedical assistance patient able check condition daily event emergency medical assistance need summon . It become patient 's responsibility ensure local `` caregiver '' communicate willingness serve capacity telephone clinic 8study team prior cycle .
