	<brief_summary>The purpose study see add 1 drug anti-HIV drug combination early treatment HIV low viral load ( amount HIV blood ) level low measure ( undetectable ) . The drug add treatment abacavir ( ABC ) . Many patient take 3 anti-HIV drug together able achieve low viral load , example , viral load 50 copies/ml . However , patient take 3 drug able achieve viral load low . Doctors hope , add drug ABC current treatment , viral load 50 copies/ml achieve . Doctors would like find effective start patient 3 drug add another drug ( treatment intensification ) treatment work well hop .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Early Addition Abacavir Anti-HIV Drug Combination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Combination antiretroviral therapy offer patient potent suppression HIV replication improve immunologic functioning . However , despite aggressive antiretroviral regimen currently use , 50 60 percent patient attain plasma viral load 50 copies/ml 24 week . Initiating treatment 4-drug regimen may increase percentage , may also contribute patient non-adherence , drug-related toxicity , potential cross-resistance drug use future regimens , high financial cost . Another strategy early intensification ( add single drug exist regimen ) patient risk attain incomplete viral suppression 24 week therapy . ABC may produce significant antiviral effect use intensification agent patient stable antiretroviral regimen . The result study offer insight potential benefit early treatment intensification . Patients enter study initiate potent antiretroviral therapy . Between 60 90 day [ AS PER AMENDMENT 1/9/01 : 60 104 day ] begin background regimen , patient randomize add either ABC ( Arm A ) match placebo ( Arm B ) 12 week . Patients complete 12 week treatment continue study additional 24 week Week 36 . Patients discontinue treatment virologic failure occur time . Patients still return clinic HIV-1 RNA measurement Weeks 12 36 , depend discontinuation occur . Patients discontinue treatment Week 12 due virologic failure offer open-label ABC remainder study ( Week 36 ) . Blood sample collect Weeks 4 , 8 , 12 , 20 , 28 , 36 . Plasma sample population sequence HIV-1 PR RT gene collect patient study entry time virologic failure . Baseline genotype ( presence absence PR RT resistance mutation number resistance mutation ) correlate treatment outcome . Samples time failure analyze accumulation additional resistance mutation . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 5/5/00 : Patients primary care physician unblinded patient 's treatment study complete Week 36 virologic failure occur Week 12 [ AS PER AMENDMENT 1/9/01 : ABC hypersensitivity suspect ] . ]</detailed_description>
