	<brief_summary>Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder condition characterize decreased attention span , hyperactivity , and/or impulsiveness inappropriate certain age . Typically , young child know subtle neurological sign . These involuntary movement one part body occur child make voluntary movement another part body . This referred synkinesis , overflow movement . These overflow movement disappear normal development usually go age 10 . However , child ADHD overflow movement tend intense last long age 10 . This lead researcher believe abnormality maturation development brain area associate motor activity child ADHD . Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) non-invasive technique give information brain function . It useful study area nervous system related motor activity ( motor cortex , corticospinal tract , corpus callosum ) . A magnetic signal give special instrument hold close patient 's head stimulate small area brain control muscle ( example , muscle control one finger ) . Doctors put electrode ( small piece metal tap area body ) muscle measure electrical activity muscle produce make movement . When magnetic signal activates muscle electrode pick record electrical activity movement muscle make response magnetic signal . Researchers study normal child diagnose ADHD use TMS find clinical abnormality ADHD associate delay abnormality maturation area nervous system responsible motor activity ( motor cortex corticospinal tract ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subtle neurological sign ( synkinesis mirror movement ) present normal child 9 10 year age . In addition , speed repetitive sequential movement increase 5 8 year age time child perform movement close adult speed . Based clinical study normal child child corticospinal tract lesion , postulate subtle motor sign reflect neurodevelopmental immaturity intracortical interhemispheric inhibitory system disappearance occur result maturation . The presence subtle neurological sign accurately distinguish child attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) healthy control . The increased intensity neurological sign young age group persistence beyond age 9 year suggest child ADHD may delay abnormal neuromaturational development ; particular , development inhibitory system motor cortex . This concert theory cognitive abnormality see child behavioral study indicate child ADHD difficulty executive function test look specifically motor inhibition . Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) non-invasive tool give information cortical function . It particularly useful study motor cortex connection via corticospinal tract corpus callosum . A single suprathreshold stimulus motor cortex produce motor evoke potential ( MEP ) inhibition ongoing muscle activity ipsilateral contralateral target muscle . TMS study demonstrate difference velocity central motor conduction , ability evoke motor inhibition compare adult child 10 year age . These difference suggest cortical inhibitory facilitatory system undergo normal developmental change first decade life , may form neural substrate clinical developmental change occur child period time . We propose study child ADHD single pair pulse TMS determine clinical abnormality present child reflect underlying delay abnormality maturation inhibitory facilitatory system cortex corticospinal tract . If present , finding would give objective evidence abnormal inhibitory system attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ; presence ( absence ) may differentiate different subtypes ADHD . Since stimulant ameliorative effect neuropsychological functioning child , future study would able determine whether similar effect motor system . TMS associate click 120 dB peak sound level maximum stimulator output . Studies adult child show long-lasting permanent hearing loss TMS , information regard transient decrease hear threshold immediately TMS occur listen music headphone use personal cassette recorder . As part main study , conduct safety study determine risk temporary hearing loss TMS child .</detailed_description>
