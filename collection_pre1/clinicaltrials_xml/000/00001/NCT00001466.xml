	<brief_summary>This study investigate cause natural history ( medical problem appear time ) certain genetic disorder . It also try locate abnormal gene responsible condition eventually develop test predict likely affect degree . Patients know suspected genetic disorder certain category , involve chromosomal metabolic abnormality , immune system blood disorder , abnormal growth , benign tumor , others may eligible study . Participants interviewed specialist genetics condition family history . They may also ask physical examination certain test need study specific individual 's condition . These may include collection blood sample ( 3 tablespoon ) ; image study , computerize tomography ( CT ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , ultrasound echocardiography ; skin biopsy ( removal small sample skin tissue local anesthetic ) , procedure . DNA test may reveal genetic abnormality responsible disorder . Participants wish opportunity talk expert health implication test result . This study may provide information lead improve treatment management inherited disorder , well effective genetic counseling family .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Individuals family affect disorder potentially genetic basis within six broad category evaluate time characterize natural clinical history various specific disorder . Medical laboratory evaluation complete identify area management concern previously describe . Further protocol develop address specific disorder number affect individual investigate sufficient query various aspect disorder . Issues diagnosis medical management affect certain genetic disorder collate address within national consensus conference format . In addition , phenotype genotype correlation establish understand specific molecular alteration phenotypic expression . This broad-based protocol also facilitate training fellows medical genetics , graduate post graduate training genetics genetic counseling .</detailed_description>
