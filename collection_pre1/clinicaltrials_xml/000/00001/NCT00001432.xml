	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All volunteer Clinical Center recruit registered NIH Volunteer Office . Volunteers collaborate institution recruit Associate Investigators institution accord institutionally IRB approve method . All volunteer may normal volunteer diagnosis lymphoid/hematologic malignancy ( chronic myelogenous leukemia , multiple myeloma , lymphoma , acute myelogenous leukemia , chronic lymphocytic leukemia , acute lymphocytic leukemia ) . To eligible peripheral blood apheresis , normal volunteer must hematocrit great equal 36 % peripheral platelet count great equal 100,000/mm ( 3 ) . Volunteers lymphoid/hematologic malignancy must hematocrit great equal 30 % peripheral platelet count great equal 100,000/mm ( 3 ) . All volunteer , include volunteer lymphoid/hematologic malignancy , must white blood cell count great equal 4,000/mm ( 3 ) . Volunteers lymphoid/hematologic malignancy must white blood cell count le 100,000/mm ( 3 ) . To eligible venipuncture bone marrow aspiration , normal volunteer volunteer lymphoid/hematologic malignancy must history abnormal bleeding tendency document predisposition infection . For venipuncture bone marrow aspiration , peripheral blood platelet count normal volunteer must great 100,000/mm ( 3 ) volunteer lymphoid/hematologic malignancy , platelet count must great equal 50,000/mm ( 3 ) . All normal volunteer volunteer lymphoid/hematologic malignancy eligible receive apheresis ( do NIH Clinical Center ) , bone marrow sampling , venipuncture . Apheresis perform Clinical Center National Institutes Health . Apheresis peformed collaborate institution . Normal volunteer volunteer lymphoid/hematopoietic malignancy may donate sample apheresis , venipuncture , bone marrow sample multiple occasion . Repeated donation apheresis allow long period least eight week elapse since previous apheresis . Repeated donation peripheral blood bone marrow allow long period least four week elapse since previous donation . For give volunteer , total number aphereses exceed six per year total number peripheral blood bone marrow donation exceed eight per year . All normal CML volunteer must undergo repeat physical examination complete blood count evaluation determine eligibility prior donation . Normal volunteer volunteer lymphoid/hematologic malignancy test HIV hepatitis determine eligibility protocol . However , DTM guideline require patient undergoing apheresis subsequent ex vivo elutriation collect product require test HIV hepatitis B C. Volunteers require test HIV Hepatitis inform time enrollment sign appropriate inform consent test . Volunteers find HIV positive hepatitis B C still donate blood product , product subject ex vivo elutriation . Volunteers lymphoid/hematologic malignancy may receive therapy chemotherapy chronic interferon alpha injection . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Any normal volunteer volunteer lymphoid/hematologic malignancy significant history cardiac , renal , pulmonary , neurologic disease ineligible . Any normal volunteer volunteer lymphoid/hematologic malignancy know history HIV hepatitis B C ineligible . Any normal volunteer volunteer lymphoid/hematologic malignancy require chronic anticoagulation steroid therapy ineligible . Any volunteer lymphoid/hematologic malignancy peripheral blast count exceed 25 % total lymphocyte count exceed 100,000/mm ( 3 ) ineligible apheresis . Volunteers lymphoid/hematologic malignancy currently enrol experimental therapy NCI protocol ineligible . Any normal volunteer volunteer lymphoid/Hematologic malignancy know AIDS and/or hepatitis B C exclude . Volunteers history diabetes mellitus exclude receive [ 6,6 ( 2 ) H ] [ U ( 13 ) C9 ] glucose infusion . A pregnancy test give female volunteer volunteer pregnant exclude study .</criteria>
