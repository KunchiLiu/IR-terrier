	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate , treat follow patient cysticercosis , infection larval form pork tapeworm , T. solium . When people ingest cyst T. solium egg , cyst develop muscle , brain organ . The cyst enlarge cause inflammation , usually brain . Patients may develop seizure , headache , nausea , vomit , inability walk , poor vision due enlargement brain , increased pressure brain . Other neurological problem may develop depend location cyst . The drug praziquantel albendazole use treat cysticercosis , clear drug effective patient , calcified cyst brain enlargement . Patients suspect confirmed cysticercosis may eligible study . Participants hospitalize 2 _ 3 week take either praziquantel albendazole mouth 2 week . They may receive corticosteroid lessen side effect drug therapy . Patients evaluate medically indicated test procedure may include : - Blood test . - X-rays head long bone . - Electroencephalogram record electrical activity brain - Lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) examination cerebrospinal fluid bathe brain spinal cord . For procedure , local anesthetic give needle inserted space bone ( vertebra ) low back . About 2 tablespoon fluid collect needle . - Eye examination . - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) examine brain . MRI use strong magnetic field radio wave instead X-rays demonstrate structural chemical change brain . During scan , patient lie table narrow cylinder ( scanner ) . He speak staff member via intercom system time procedure . - Computed tomography ( CT ) examine brain . CT do different angle allow doctor view brain small section 3-dimensions . The patient lie table head position CT scanner . Some test may repeat last day therapy 3 6 month longer therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol allow evaluation , treatment follow patient cysticercosis . Cysticercosis define infection larva form Taenia solium include infection brain ( neurocysticercosis ) account symptomatic disease serious complication . Evaluation treatment follow accept clinical practice information learn observational . Two drug , praziquantel albendazole , use extensively treatment cysticercosis accept therapy . Albendazole recently approve treatment cysticercosis praziquantel approve FDA proven efficacy safety . To decrease provoked inflammation induce treatment decrease inflammation active disease , corticosteroid immunosuppressive use . Anti seizure medication also commonly use .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patients age 2 75 year consider therapy . Children age 18 normally eligible use immunosuppressive corticosteroid . 2 . Patients proven likely neurocysticercosis . The diagnosis neurocysticercosis depend presence cyst MRI CT scan and/or presence typical calcification CT. Serology usually , always , positive depend burden type disease . 3 . Willing sign consent see prescribe interval 4 . Patients pregnant include , however , offer treatment albendazole , praziquantel and/or methotrexate etanercept pregnancy unless clinical condition severe , e.g . life threaten , opinion PI . They may receive corticosteroid . 5 . Patients positive PPD quantiferon assay TB strongyloidiasis started/treated infection , per standard protocol , shortly thereafter treat neurocysticercosis . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . &lt; 2 year age 2 . Unwilling undergo effective birth control measure use anthelmintic immunosuppressive ( corticosteroid ) require . 3 . Breastfeeding anthelmintic immunosuppressive medication require . 4 . Allergic albendazole praziquantel 5 . Active tuberculosis strongyloides infection make bad immunosuppression infection likely make bad unless neurocysticercosis life threatening .</criteria>
