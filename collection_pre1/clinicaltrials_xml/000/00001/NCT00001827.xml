	<brief_summary>This study examine whether vaccination p53 peptide boost immune response ovarian cancer side effect vaccine . Many patient ovarian cancer alter ( mutate ) gene call p53 cause production abnormal protein find tumor cell . The body immune system may try , unsuccessfully , fight abnormal protein . In study , ovarian cancer patient p53 abnormality vaccinate p53 peptide part abnormal protein find tumor try boost body immune response cancer . Patients divide two group . Group A four p53 peptide vaccination three week apart , injected skin . The injection include drug call ISA-51 , increase effect vaccine . This group also receive two drug boost immune system , IL-2 GM-CSF . Group B four p53 peptide vaccination three week apart . The peptide mixed patient blood cell infuse vein . This group also receive IL-2 , GM-CSF . All study candidate test see cancer p53 abnormality immune system mount defense . These test may include tumor biopsy ( removal small part tumor microscopic examination ) ; lymphapheresis ( procedure take blood , remove white blood cell call lymphocyte , return red cell ) ; immune response test similar skin test tuberculosis . During study , patient additional skin test blood test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>P53 commonly mutate gene human cancer ; find mutate almost 50 % ovarian cancer . Genetic mutation p53 result stabilization increase level protein . In case , overexpression p53 protein could also occur tumor without detectable mutation open reading frame . Therefore , p53 could function antigen two different mechanism , mutant `` foreign '' protein selfoverexpressed protein . The p53:264 - 272 wild type peptide show high affinity HLA-A2 . It also show naturally process endogenously present HLA-A2 different type tumor cell line CTL recognition . These CTL able lyse tumor cell overexpressing wild type mutant p53 protein fail lyse normal cell express normal level wild type p53 . In protocol vaccinate HLA-A2+ ovarian cancer patient carry tumor overexpress p53 wild type p53 peptide ( 264-272 ) . This give either subcutaneously admixed ISA-51 GM-CSF adjuvant , intravenously pulse dendritic cell along low dose subcutaneous IL-2 . In addition , patient express mutant p53 may also vaccinate mutant p53 peptide , correspond mutation harbor tumor , patient progress p53 ( 264-272 ) peptide .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must 18 year age old . Histologic diagnosis adenocarcinoma ovary . Tumor tissue availability determination p53 protein expression genetic mutation ( paraffin block , fresh tissue ) . Immunohistochemical analysis tumor must demonstrate positive p53 stain . Patients ovarian cancer marker disease patient stage III , IV recurrent NED post therapy . ECOG performance status 1 0 . Expected survival 3 month . The patient receive chemotherapy , radiation therapy , immunotherapy systemic dos steroid least 4 week prior start vaccination . And patient recover acute toxicity previous treatment . Patients receive bone marrow transplantation within year eligible trial . Patients must understand sign inform consent document explain neoplastic nature his/her disease , procedures follow , experimental nature treatment , alternative treatment , potential risk toxicity . Patients HLAA2.1 haplotype . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Any condition fit eligibility criterion . Any following : Platelets le 100K/mm ( 3 ) Creatinine great 2.0 mg/dl Serum Bilirubin great 2.0 mg/dl , SGOT , SGPT great 4 time normal HIV Hepatitis B C ( i.e . detectable HBS Antigen HC Ab ) since condition might effect immune system . Pregnant woman nurse mother ineligible since effect investigational treatment health embryo know . Women reproductive potential must negative pregnancy test must use adequate contraception . Patients active ischemic heart disease ( i.e . Class III IV cardiac diseaseNew York Heart Association ) , recent history myocardial infarction ( within last 6 month ) , history congestive heart failure , ventricular arrythmias arrythmias require therapy . Second malignancy ( within past 2 year ) curatively treat carcinoma insitu cervix basal cell carcinoma skin . These patient exclude possibility existence different mutation primary malignancy . History CNS metastasis . Patients underlie immune deficiency history autoimmune disease e.g . ( autoimmune neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , hemolytic anemia ; systemic lupus erythematosus , Sjogren syndrome , scleroderma ; myasthenia gravis ; Goodpasture syndrome ; Addison 's disease , Hashimoto 's thyroiditis , active Graves ' disease , diseases qualify autoimmune origin ) . Patients active infection require antibiotic . Patients require chronic suppressive antibiotic eligible trial . If , opinion principal associate investigator , best medical interest patient enter study , patient ineligible .</criteria>
