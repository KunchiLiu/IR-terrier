	<brief_summary>The purpose study identify gene gene responsible inherited form Parkinson 's disease learn disease develop . In Parkinson 's disease , deficiency brain chemical call dopamine impairs function part brain control movement . As result , patient may difficulty move may uncontrolled movement hand finger . Parkinson 's disease usually occur sporadically , know cause . In family , however , disease seem inherit gene mutation ( change ) . There 50-50 chance parent mutate gene pas child . Children inherit abnormal gene may may go actually develop Parkinson 's disease-the relative chance happen know . Individuals 18 year age old family Parkinson 's disease appear inherit may eligible study . Participants medical record review , provide personal family medical history ( telephone person ) , small blood sample ( 2 tablespoon ) take genetic study . The total time require study 1 2 hour . Participants encourage meet NIH investigator genetics specialist local area test talk possible implication family test result ... .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gene Analysis Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mutational analysis patient Parkinson 's disease positive family history undertaken effort identify good understand function defective gene cause Parkinson 's disease individual . DNA individual important resource screen candidate gene mutation , confirm gene identify approach alter patient , define mutational spectrum gene ( genotype/phenotype correlation ) . Unrelated , anonymous normal individual serve control sequence comparison . Information genotype communicate back individual part study . While mutational analysis continue , participant recruit study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Individuals age 18 family three individual affect Parkinson 's disease ( within three generation ) proband affected person available willing participate study The diagnosis must support accept clinical criterion : tremor , bradykinesia , responsiveness LDOPA . PD may associate dementia . The study lose power individual mental impairment PD exclude . For reason , decisionallyimpaired individual enrol . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : No one 18 enrol , exception rare autosomal recessive PD due parkin mutation , PD affect minor . Study design involve test fetus .</criteria>
