	<brief_summary>This study examine whether cyclosporin A eye drop alleviate dry eye syndrome , disorder tear deficiency excessive tear evaporation . The condition damage surface eye cause discomfort . Age-related dry eye syndrome may result problem immune system cell call lymphocyte infiltrate tear gland cause chronic , progressive inflammatory process . Previous study suggest cyclosporin A may increase tear production decrease inflammation surface eye , , improve dry eye symptom . Patients study undergo complete eye examination , small tear sample collect study tear consistency composition . A small amount conjunctiva ( clear , thin cover eye lining eyelid eyeball ) remove study substance might provide information cause dry eye . A blood sample also take look antibody find patient Sjogren 's syndrome , disorder characterized dryness mouth , eyes mucous membrane . Patients also fill form provide information extent dry eye bother . Patients randomly divide two treatment group : one take cyclosporin 0.1 % eye drop emulsion ; take emulsion vehicle alone-that , drop without active ingredient cyclosporin . Both group take one drop eye 4 time day 2 month . Neither patient doctor know patient receive medication study end . All patient also give artificial teardrop use comfort need .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dry eye syndrome , also know keratoconjunctivitis sicca KCS , disorder tear film lead damage ocular surface ocular discomfort . In aqueous tear deficient dry eye , inadequate tear production . Patients dry eye include KCS severe form KCS associate Sjogren 's Syndrome ( SS ) . In SS , lymphocytic infiltration lacrimal gland lead destruction acinar structure impair glandular function . Although case KCS due Sjogren 's Syndrome , lymphocytic infiltration lacrimal glands non-Sjogren 's KCS patient demonstrate author suggest age-related atrophic change lacrimal gland may secondary chronic progressive inflammatory process . Several clinical study indicate systemic topical CsA improve objective subjective sign KCS patient without SS . In protocol , patient aqueous tear deficient KCS randomize treatment topical CsA 0.1 % emulsion vehicle . To determine safety efficacy CsA 0.1 % treatment patient KCS , comprehensive ophthalmologic examination standardize symptom assessment perform . In addition , determine ability topical CSA alter ocular surface inflammation , pre- post-treatment conjunctival biopsy specimens analyzed infiltrating lymphocyte .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis CS document symptom sign ( require ) despite conventional management may include artificial tear , gel ointment , sympathomimetic agent parasympathomimetic agent : Schirmer ( without anesthesia ) less equal 8 mm/5 min least one eye ; HOWEVER , Schirmer ( without anesthesia ) zero ( 0 ) mm , Schirmer nasal stimulation great equal 3 mm/ 5 min eye , OR ; Schirmer ( anesthesia ) less equal 10 mm/ 5 min least one eye sum interpalpebral stain great equal 3+ corneal stain great equal 1+ eye . Able willing provide inform consent . Willingness ability meet followup requirement . Female patient childbearing potential must use reliable form contraception study . A negative pregnancy test result woman childbearing potential . Normal lid position closure . The following topical ( cream , ointment patch ) systemic medication allow long patient stable dose least 90 day baseline visit : Estrogenprogesterone , estrogen derivative . If use concomitant medication , patient 's condition stable , patient must agree remain stable dose concomitant medication throughout study period , patient 's condition stable , must agree use concomitant medication . Review instruction use concomitant medication study , prior eye examination , agreement patient comply instruction . A copy instruction must give patient prior enrollment . Patient must uncontrolled systemic disease ( e.g. , hypertension , diabetes ) presence significant illness ( e.g. , serious gastrointestinal , renal , hepatic , endocrine , pulmonary , cardiac , neurologic disease , cancer , AIDS , cerebral dysfunction ) could , judgment investigator , interfere interpretation study result . Patients must use ophthalmic topical systemic cyclosporine past 90 day . Patients must Schirmer reading le 3 mm/5 min , without anesthesia , eye stimulation thereby indicate end stage lacrimal gland disease . Patient must active ocular infection nonKCS ocular inflammation . Patient must history recurrent herpes keratitis active disease within last six month . Patient must corneal disorder abnormality effect corneal sensitivity normal spread tear film ( except SPK ) . Patient must severe blepharitis obvious inflammation lid margin judgment investigator may interfere interpretation study result . No plug placement ( laser , cautery , silicone , collagen implant ) within one month prior screen visit . No punctal occlusion perform study . Patient must history anterior segment surgery trauma could affect corneal sensitivity ( e.g. , cataract surgery surgery involve limbal corneal incision within last 12 month ) . Patient must KCS secondary destruction conjunctival goblet cell occur vitamin A deficiency scar cicatricial pemphigoid , alkali burn , StevensJohnson syndrome , trachoma , irradiation . Patients must use Saligan antihistamine 3 time week .</criteria>
