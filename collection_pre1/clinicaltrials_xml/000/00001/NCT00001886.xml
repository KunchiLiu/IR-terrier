	<brief_summary>An echocardiogram ultrasound technique use gather information heart . Standard echocardiograms create image heart two dimension , thereby name 2D ( two-dimensional ) echocardiography . A new technique develop allow image take heart three dimension ( real time 3D echocardiography ) . The 3D echocardiogram us high frequency sound wave see record movement function heart muscle . The echocardiogram take place instrument call transducer chest wall heart . In study patient undergo dobutamine stress echocardiogram . Dobutamine drug cause heart beat strong faster , similar act exercise . Dobutamine allow researcher tell heart suffer lack oxygen exercise form stress , permanently damage . The purpose study determine whether stress 3D echocardiography feasible accurate detection heart disease ( coronary artery disease ) . Results 3D echocardiogram compare result standard 2D echocardiogram .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Real Time 3-Dimensional Stress Echocardiography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stress echocardiography become valuable technique non-invasive detection coronary artery disease . Its accuracy show superior exercise electrocardiogram comparable myocardial perfusion imaging . The adequacy stress echocardiography conventional two-dimensional imaging , however , highly dependent operator expertise . Further , interpretation test result subjective qualitative , base analysis wall motion arbitrary segmentation leave ventricle . Real time 3-dimensional ( RT3D ) echocardiography new technique permit unrestricted assessment leave ventricular wall motion function single cardiac beat without ECG respiratory gate . We hypothesize RT3D echocardiography similar great accuracy detection wall motion abnormality compare conventional two-dimensional examination . We therefore propose acquire RT3D echocardiographic image patient know suspected coronary artery disease undergo stress echocardiography . We correlate result finding coronary angiography compare ability RT3D echocardiography detect coronary artery disease conventional two-dimensional exam .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients older 18 year age know suspected coronary artery disease agree undergo stress echocardiography undergone undergo coronary angiography within 3 month stress echocardiogram . No premenopausal patient lactate , pregnant potentially pregnant judged history , physical examination , ultrasound urine pregnancy test . No unstable angina . No recent myocardial infarction ( less 1 month ) . No ventricular ectopy baseline condition ( i.e. , couplet , frequent PVC 's [ great 6/min ] , early coupling [ `` RonT '' phenomenon ] , ventricular bigeminy ) might potentially predispose patient development dangerous dysrhythmias dobutamine infusion . No congestive heart failure . No significant hypertension ( systolic blood pressure great 170 mmHg ) hypotension ( systolic blood pressure le 100 mmHg ) . No sinus tachycardia great 100 beats/min . No acute medical illness . No atrial fibrillation , inadequate twodimensional echocardiographic window .</criteria>
