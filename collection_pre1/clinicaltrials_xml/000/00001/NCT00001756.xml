	<brief_summary>This study investigate mast cell precursor circulate blood . In group disease collectively know mastocytosis , mast cell accumulate abnormal amount skin , lymphoid tissue , bone marrow , liver spleen . Some form mastocytosis generally good prognosis ; others , prognosis poorer . There known cure form disease . A good understanding mast cell respond certain substance may provide insight lead effective treatment mastocytosis . Patients systemic mastocytosis normal healthy volunteer age 20 60 may eligible 8-day study . Participants undergo follow procedure : - Day 1 Medical history , physical examination , blood test assess general health status - Days 2 6 Daily injection skin G-CSF hormone stimulate white blood cell production - Day 7 Leukapheresis procedure collect large number white blood cell . In leukapheresis , blood drawn needle place arm channel cell separator machine . The white cell collect rest blood return body needle arm . The procedure take 3 hour . - Days 7 8 Blood draw ( 1 teaspoon ) monitor white blood cell count .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol obtain large number CD34+ cell peripheral blood healthy volunteer patient systemic mastocytosis relate allergic , hematological , immunological condition leukapheresis culture characterization mast cell progenitor cell response various cytokine anti-mitotic agent . Healthy volunteer patient adult sex 18 70 year age . Granulocyte colony stimulate factor ( G-CSF ) administer healthy volunteer dose 10 mcg/kg/day subcutaneous dose daily 5 day exceed 960mcg . Patients receive Plerixafor dose 0.24 mg/kg single subcutaneous dose exceed 24mg night leukapheresis mobilize agent CD34+ cell . In identified patient leukapheresis yield consider adequate without stimulation principal investigator , leukapheresis may proceed without stimulation . Healthy volunteer undergo single leukapheresis day 7 , patient undergo single leukapheresis day 3 4 . This therapeutic protocol involve reinfusion manipulate cell , virus DNA construct back human subject .</detailed_description>
