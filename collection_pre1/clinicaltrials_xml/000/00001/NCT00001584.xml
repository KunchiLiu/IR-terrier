	<brief_summary>Virus present semen likely contributes substantially sexual transmission HIV . However , source HIV semen unknown . Some evidence suggest prostate may source least virus semen . This study design determine whether prostate may serve source virus semen compare concentration HIV-1 RNA semen donate normally , semen obtain follow prostatic massage , express prostatic secretion . Finding source semen HIV would provide important insight several aspect HIV sexual transmission . Since drug enter prostate well , find virus produce prostate might suggest prostate could serve reservoir HIV , lead development resistance antiviral agent .</brief_summary>
