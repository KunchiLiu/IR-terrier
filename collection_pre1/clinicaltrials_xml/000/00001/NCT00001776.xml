	<brief_summary>Imaging study brain reveal different area involve process learn reasoning . However , specific role region play process , stimulate area improve process unknown . Researchers would like use repetitive transcranial stimulation ( rTMS ) good understand role individual brain region process learn reason . Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) involve placement cool electromagnet figure-eight coil patient 's scalp , rapidly turn magnetic flux . This permit non-invasive , relatively localized stimulation surface brain ( cerebral cortex ) . The effect magnetic stimulation varies , depend upon location , intensity frequency magnetic pulse . The purpose study use rTMS help determine role different brain region development implicit learn motor sequence analogic reason . In addition , researcher hope evaluate stimulation region speed process learn analogic reasoning .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The human frontal cortex subserves number psychological process include necessary adequate implicit learn visuomotor sequence analogical reasoning . 1 . Implicit learn form procedural learning indicated behavioral improvement without awareness repeat stimulus structure lead improved performance . This type learning associate activation primary motor cortex ( M1 ) neuroimaging study . While neuroimaging study contribute identify region , provide information relative role process implicit learning . Is activity region necessary implicit learn occur ? Is possible `` energize '' region use subthreshold transcranial magnetic stimulation accelerate implicit phase learning ? The purpose protocol transiently stimulate focally M1 dorsolateral prefrontal cortex acquisition implicit learn evaluate effect reaction time accuracy performance . We plan study group normal volunteer , three group patient demonstrate impaired visuomotor procedural learn task : Parkinson 's disease , cerebellar disease , focal frontal lesion . The result expect study advance understanding role motor cortex dorsolateral prefrontal cortex play implicit learn health disease . Additionally , expect able shorten implicit phase learn rTMS particularly patient group exhibit abnormal procedural learning . 2 . Analogical reasoning require subject adequately process different form information perform mapping process allow recognize similarity two form information . Evidence provide indicates process analogical mapping subserve frontal cortex . We plan study group normal volunteer , three group patient demonstrate impaired performance test analogical reason problem-solving : Parkinson 's disease , frontal lobe dementia , focal frontal lesion . We predict subthreshold rTMS facilitate analogical reason promote activation establish novel neural activation pattern represent actual mapping decision process require analogical reasoning . Additionally , expect facilitate response time accuracy analogical mapping patient exhibit abnormal analogical reasoning performance .</detailed_description>
