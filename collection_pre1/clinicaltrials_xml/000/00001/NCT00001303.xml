	<brief_summary>Bacterial infection progress life-threatening illness call septic shock , characterize low blood pressure vital organ damage . The syndrome thought cause part bacteria body immune response infection . A major bacterial product interacts immune defense call endotoxin . This study examine body response endotoxin lung bloodstream . When endotoxin give small amount human , even though infection , trigger set response typical one would see true bacterial infection . This allow u study early change molecule cell involve bacterial infection . This type model safe use human many year understand body response infection . Normal volunteer 18 45 year age may eligible study . Candidates history physical examination , blood urine test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) chest X-ray . In addition , volunteer 40 45 year old exercise stress test screen asymptomatic coronary artery disease . Participants undergo one follow procedure : Bronchoscopy , Bronchoalveolar Lavage , Bronchial Brushings , Endobronchial Mucosal Biopsies : These technique examine lung function use routinely patient care clinical research . The mouth nasal lung airway numb anesthetic . A bronchoscope ( pencil-thin flexible tube ) pass nose large airway lung . Cells secretion airway rinse salt water ( bronchoalveolar lavage ) flexible brush size pencil tip pass bronchoscope scrape cell line airway . Lastly , piece tissue ( size ball ballpoint pen ) lining airway remove examination microscope . Intravenous Endotoxin : A small dose endotoxin inject vein . Blood sample draw regular interval 8 hour injection 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 14 day analyze body immune response bacteria blood . Instilled Endotoxin Lungs : A small amount ( 2 teaspoon ) salt water squirt bronchoscope lobe one lung , salt water contain small dose endotoxin squirt lung . Bronchial lavage , brushing , biopsy ( see ) do study response lung endotoxin . In addition , air withdrawn bronchoscope study air component lung instill salt water endotoxin . Nitric Oxide Therapy : Endotoxin instill lung ( see ) nitric oxide colorless , odorless , tasteless gas mixed room air concentration 40 part per million , give cushion mask place mouth nose . ( Some participant give nitric oxide mixture others breathe room air mask test effect nitric oxide lung inflammation . ) The mask wear continuously 6 hour remove repeat bronchoscopy lavage , brush biopsy . Some procedure require placement catheter ( thin plastic tube ) wrist artery monitor blood pressure heartbeat heartbeat collect blood sample . First , skin numb anesthetic ( lidocaine ) . A needle inserted artery , catheter slip needle vessel , needle remove .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Endotoxin unique molecule represent important probe investigate humoral cellular basis septic shock . Endotoxin administration human provide opportunity evaluate early response activate exposure important bacterial component . Many alteration organ function circulate mediator evaluate model . These change qualitatively similar change occur sepsis septic shock . The application new technology model useful adjunct define mechanism acute inflammatory response . Defining pathways interaction may allow good understand factor control altered critical illness . In current study , plan extend previous observation heart lung function endotoxin administration four separate study . 1 . Bronchoalveolar lavage bronchial brushing normal subject . Bronchoalveolar lavage bronchial brushing perform normal subject obtain alveolar epithelial pulmonary cell use vitro assay respiratory cell function . 2 . Inflammatory effect systemic endotoxin administration . In order evaluate late inflammatory response IV endotoxin , blood obtain acutely 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 14 day post endotoxin challenge . 3 . Pulmonary effect instill endotoxin . Using bronchoscopy , effect direct instillation endotoxin lobe lung use assess local pulmonary inflammatory response result neutrophil influx lung . 4 . Effects inhale nitric oxide pulmonary inflammatory response follow endotoxin administration . In order systematically study effect inhale nitric oxide local lung inflammation , healthy subject undergo local endotoxin instillation , breath NO mask 6h , repeat bronchoscopy do 6h assess ability NO suppress local inflammation lung .</detailed_description>
