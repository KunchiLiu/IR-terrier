	<brief_summary>Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) technique use investigate functional activity brain . The PET technique allow doctor study normal biochemical metabolic process central nervous system normal individual patient neurologic illness without physical / structural damage brain . Radioactive water H215O PET scan permit good visualization area brain related speech . Most PET scan study conduct concentrate learning language form decode . Few study conduct speech production . This study aim use radioactive water ( H215O ) Positron Emission Tomography ( PET scan ) measure blood flow different area brain order well understand mechanism involve speech motor control . When region brain active , use fuel form oxygen sugar ( glucose ) . As brain use fuel produce waste product , carbon dioxide water . Blood carry fuel brain waste product away brain . As brain activity increase blood flow area activity increase also . Knowing fact , researcher use radioactive chemical ( H215O ) PET scan observe area brain receiving blood flow . Researchers ask patient perform task affect speech , voice , language . At time patient undergo PET scan . The task design help researcher observe blood flow brain area associate voicebox ( laryngeal ) function , movement muscle jaw , tongue , mouth , aspect motor speech . Special study conduct evaluate certain therapy task draw symptom illness speech language affect . Results test use study evaluate neurologic mechanisms disease like Tourette 's syndrome parkinson 's disease. &lt; TAB &gt;</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective The primary objective protocol use multimodal neuroimaging combine complementary electrophysiological hemodynamic method characterize brain-language relationship healthy subject neurological disorder affect speech language . A secondary objective utilize finding develop evaluation measure future treatment study . Study Populations We focus four neurological disorder affect language processing post-stroke aphasia , traumatic brain injury , epilepsy developmental stuttering . Each constitute significant clinical problem central NIDCD mission . These disorder impair language several level - elementary perceptual motor feature , peripheral building block language , high level language formulation , include word , sentence narrative processing . Design We utilize set task design evaluate language level clinical pathology emerges . We combine hemodynamic ( functional MRI ) electrophysiological ( EEG , MEG ) modality capitalize superior spatial resolution former temporal resolution latter method . Whenever possible task paradigm use technique . We conduct crosssectional sub-studies , address specific question disorder interest ; also conduct longitudinal sub-studies recovery neuroplastic reorganization post-stroke aphasia . Outcome Measures Outcome measure include speech-language psychological test , measure behavioral performance scan correspond MRI , EEG MEG data . Relationships datasets evaluate use statistical analytic package .</detailed_description>
