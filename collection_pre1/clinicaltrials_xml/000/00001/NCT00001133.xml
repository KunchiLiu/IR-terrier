	<brief_summary>In study , protease inhibitor indinavir ( IDV ) ritonavir ( RTV ) study patient high level virus take protease inhibitor . The purpose study see body take , distribute , get rid IDV RTV . This study also look side effect IDV RTV cause . IDV effective anti-HIV drug , difficult patient take . For IDV work HIV , must take 3 time day high dose certain diet . Doctors believe IDV may easier take give RTV . Patients take IDV RTV together may able take IDV twice day low dose . This study gather information safety side effect use IDV RTV together .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Tolerance Indinavir Plus Ritonavir HIV-Positive Patients Failing Therapy With Amprenavir , Nelfinavir , Saquinavir</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IDV , protease inhibitor , show excellent clinical virologic response combine 2 nucleoside analogue . Although effective , pharmacokinetics IDV make difficult use many patient . The drug short half-life require administration high dos every 8 hour significant dietary restriction . Research show IDV kinetics improve significantly addition RTV , allow administration IDV low dos every 12 hour . The half-life IDV prolong 3- 5-fold administer RTV . Based result , reasonable study combination twice-daily dose regimen . Patients randomize receive 1 2 dos IDV/RTV 24 week ( Arms A B ) . All patient also receive 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) . The NRTIs provide study . Clinical assessment take place Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 include virology assessment . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 4/21/00 : Patients experience confirm virologic failure ( define protocol ) elect remain study treatment , follow Week 24 . Patients experience confirm virologic failure elect discontinue study treatment final evaluation time treatment discontinuation . ] Patients hospitalize 12 hour Week 2 study visit intensive pharmacokinetic analysis .</detailed_description>
