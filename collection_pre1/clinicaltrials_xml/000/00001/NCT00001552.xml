	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine genetic cause specific voice disorder run family . Researchers particularly interested two condition ; 1 . Spasmodic dysphonia 2 . Vocal fold paralysis Familial vocal fold paralysis life-threatening disorder cause difficulty vocal fold movement breathe voice sometimes swallow . Studies ongoing NIH good understand pathophysiology relate genetic pattern inheritance . Families recruit participate study provide information disorder genetic counseling desire . Physician referral request affected member family vocal fold paralysis unknown cause occur least 2 generation . All travel , lodge , examination counseling cost cover affected unaffected member family . Examinations include : voice , laryngeal , neurological , electrodiagnostic testing , genetic counseling , radiological study ... .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : Our purpose examine evidence genetic risk factor associate idiopathic laryngeal motor control disorder . During conception protocol , interested investigating pattern inheritance familial voice disorder , specifically spasmodic dysphonia tremor . Interestingly , initial search family reveal several large family idiopathic vocal fold paralysis family member experience symptom spasmodic dysphonia . During subsequent year , research focus inherited form vocal fold paralysis attempt determine relationship laryngeal motor control disorder associate neuropathy , determine existence specific genetic abnormality . These idiopathic laryngeal motor control disorder one manifestation peripheral neuropathy may isolate disorder laryngeal involvement . Subsequently , shift emphasis back identification genetic risk factor spasmodic dysphonia . Hypothesis 1 ) Familial risk factor spasmodic dysphonia result particular phenotype genotype . Hypothesis 2 ) Environmental risk factor may differentiate affect unaffected member family spasmodic dysphonia . Hypothesis 3 ) Whole genome screen identify SNPs associate occurrence spasmodic dysphonia . STUDY POPULATION : Families multiple member affect spasmodic dysphonia , vocal fold paralysis , tremor ascertain . DESIGN : A pedigree develop via questionnaire voice history . Affected unaffected family member examine determine presence extent laryngeal motor control disorder . Affected family member also undergo neurological examination nerve muscle study determine loci pathology . A genotype develop affected unaffected family member , DNA test blood sample . OUTCOME MEASURES : This natural history study characterize phenotype genotype idiopathic laryngeal motor control disorder .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Symptoms present speech apparent rest , Symptoms less evident whisper , sing falsetto . Symptoms become bad prolonged speaking , practice anxiety . Reflexive emotional aspect voice function unaffected , cough , laughter cry . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Any patient history airway obstruction exclude study . Structural abnormality affect larynx vocal fold nodule , polyp , carcinoma , cyst , contact ulcer , inflammation ( laryngitis ) . Reduction vocal fold movement range nonspeech task whistle would suggest either paralysis paresis , joint abnormality neoplasm . No smoker tobacco user include study . Subjects history psychiatric disorder , care psychiatrist , medication treatment psychiatric disorder exclude study . Examples psychiatric disorder exclude : somatoform disorder , conversion disorder , currently treatment major depression , history schizophrenia bipolar disorder . However , history previous episode minor reactive depression would exclude person participation .</criteria>
