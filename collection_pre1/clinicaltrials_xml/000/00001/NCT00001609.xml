	<brief_summary>The objective study discover gene responsible development hereditary cataract family . A cataract clouding lens eye obstruct passage light may impair vision . Information study may provide good understand hereditary cataract form perhaps lead development test predict likely affect degree . Patients family member patient inherited cataract participate study ask question family history , especially concern eye disease cataract , family tree drawn . They undergo complete eye examination , include photographs document clarity opacity lens . In addition , small blood sample drawn use gene map study inherit cataract .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although etiology secondary cataract become well understood certain animal model promise elucidate relationship lens crystallin hereditary cataract , little known cause congenital cataract human . Even classification different type cataracts cumbersome imperfect . A good understanding cataractogenesis come understand molecular component lens eye way lesion component manifest structurally functionally opacity lens . It well know cataract exhibit mark genetic heterogeneity . In mouse human , hereditary cataract show result lesion many distinct locus cataract correspond one locus morphologically heterogeneous , implying environmental factor may modify phenotype cataract molecular lesion cause . Nonetheless , molecular biological characterization cataract mouse guinea pig suggest alteration lens crystallins cause hereditary cataract make reasonable candidate gene cause hereditary cataract human . In addition , apparent hereditary lesion mimic contribute additively environmental stress know cause cataract might candidate gene cause hereditary cataract . This knowledge increase feasibility genetic linkage study provide rationale basis begin molecular analysis naturally occur hereditary cataract . Therefore , purpose protocol concentrate upon hereditary cataract .</detailed_description>
