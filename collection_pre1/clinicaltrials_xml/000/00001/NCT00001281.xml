	<brief_summary>This study examine effect HIV infection substance produce immune cell increase decrease HIV infection . HIV-infected patient healthy normal volunteer may eligible study . Participants require yearly medical evaluation , include blood test cell count chemistry , blood urine pregnancy test woman , laboratory test medically indicate research purpose . Participants donate blood reproductive fluid , . From 20 150 cc ( 4 30 teaspoonful ) blood drawn arm use small needle . Participants may ask provide blood sample one occasion course study . No 450 cc ( le 1 pint ) blood draw 6-week period . Males give private room semen donation ; fluid female collect cotton swab speculum insertion . Participants may also ask buccal swab . For procedure , inside cheek gently scrap blunt-ended stick brush obtain cell ( buccal mucosal cell ) . The tissue use variety study effect HIV infection factor increase decrease HIV infection . Some tissue collect study may also use follow test : - Hepatitis screen Blood may screen different type viral liver infection , hepatitis A , B , C , D , E , G. - Genetic test DNA blood cheek cell may examine mutation deletion affect chemokines , cytokine family enzymes call caspase . Chemokines cytokine important mediator immune response . Alterations gene substance influence HIV infection . Caspases regulate process cell death , know apoptosis . Caspase gene variation may determine rate cell death HIV-infected person , therefore , rate HIV progression . Patients abnormality gene may invite join study role genetic defect HIV infection . - HLA test Blood may test HLA type genetic marker immune system . These test may use try identify factor associate rate progression HIV disease related condition . Determining HLA type necessary able perform certain research study . Some HLA type associate increase risk certain disease like arthritis rheumatologic problem .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We study pathogenesis HIV infection . Because lack adequate animal model generally necessary utilize human peripheral blood cell study aspect either vivo vitro HIV infection . We wish able continue elucidate many pathogenic aspect HIV infection use human peripheral blood mononuclear cell model .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 18 year age old . Adequate venous access . Have blood pressure less equal 180/100 : pulse rate 50100 , unless low pulse rate consider normal volunteer . Have adequate blood count ( HIV positive volunteer : hemoglobin great equal 9.0 g/dL , HCT great equal 28 % , platelet great equal 50,000 ; HIV negative healthy normal volunteer : hemoglobin great equal 12 g/dL , HCT great equal 38 % , platelet great equal 150,000 ) Be willing able provide write informed consent screen every 5 year , comply study requirement procedure , comply clinic policy Willingness allow blood sample use future study HIV infection/pathogenesis , undergo genetic test include HLA testing , undergo hepatitis screen EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Pregnant and/or breastfeeding female . Active substance abuse history prior substance abuse may interfere protocol compliance compromise patient safety .</criteria>
