	<brief_summary>AMENDED : To investigate whether subcutaneous ( SC ) injection IL-2 produce biological response parallel observe IV dose . Original design : To evaluate short-term effect combine administration zidovudine ( AZT ) increase dos recombinant interleukin-2 ( aldesleukin ; IL-2 ) patient infected HIV , lymphadenopathy , otherwise asymptomatic ( symptom ) . The first phase clinical trial establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . How quickly drug get blood long remain ( pharmacokinetics ) also study dose well effect HIV . Since AZT effect cell contain inactive virus ( latently infect cell ) cell may act viral reservoir , second agent destroy infect cell would useful combination AZT . The different activity AZT IL-2 , well non-overlapping nature mechanism action toxicity , increase theoretical benefit combine AZT , drug clinically significant activity HIV-related disease eliminate infect cell , IL-2 , drug may enhance anti-HIV immunity , destroy chronically infected cell , allow immune recognition latently infect cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Since AZT effect cell contain inactive virus ( latently infect cell ) cell may act viral reservoir , second agent destroy infect cell would useful combination AZT . The different activity AZT IL-2 , well non-overlapping nature mechanism action toxicity , increase theoretical benefit combine AZT , drug clinically significant activity HIV-related disease eliminate infect cell , IL-2 , drug may enhance anti-HIV immunity , destroy chronically infected cell , allow immune recognition latently infect cell . Five patient already receive tolerated oral AZT least 8 week continue AZT treatment time receive IL-2 schedule 5 day drug , 2 day drug . The IL-2 administered 30-minute intravenous ( IV ) infusion accord schedule 4 week . The first week IL-2 treatment inpatient basis remain 3 week outpatient basis . Toxicity monitor every week . Maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) define maximum dose 3 5 patient experience Grade 3 toxicity course IL-2 administration . A second cohort five patient receive IV IL-2 . If MTD reach , five additional patient receive IV IL-2 . All five patient give cohort must complete full 4-week course IL-2 subsequent patient enter next high dose level . After IV dose complete three level , additional 5-patient cohort receive subcutaneous ( SC ) IL-2 accord schedule . Each patient restrict one dosage group . Patients treat follow total 24 week . Patients receive ibuprofen fever chill .</detailed_description>
