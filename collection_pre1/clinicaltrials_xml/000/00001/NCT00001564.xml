	<brief_summary>Arm A : Peripheral blood apheresis harvest chemotherapy-naive T cell population enrich professional APCs . T cell APCs separate apheresis product use countercurrent centrifugal elutriation monocyte rich fraction collect . Autologous T cell transplantation immunotherapy . Arm B : Cell harvest perform soon possible . Both Arm A B : Patients receive intravenous infusion irradiate peptide-pulsed antigen present cell vaccination ( APC ) product well intramuscular injection influenza vaccine day . Recombinant human IL-2 administer within 4 hour peptide pulse vaccine continuous intravenous infusion 4 day per week 3 successive week . Primary toxic effect therapy expect related IL-2 therapy . Patients Grade 2 neurologic cardiac Grade 3 4 toxic effect discontinue IL-2 therapy . If toxic effect resolve 72-hours , patient may remain study receive IL-2 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Tumor-Specific Peptide Vaccination IL-2 With Without Autologous T Cell Transplantation Recurrent Pediatric Sarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nearly patient non-metastatic Ewing 's sarcoma family tumor ( ESFT ) alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma ( AR ) dramatic initial response multiagent chemotherapy . However , approximately 30 percent patient develop recurrent disease conventional chemotherapy ineffective treatment option limit . Immunotherapy may represent effective approach treatment recurrent ESFT AR . Experimental evidence show immune mediate anti-tumor effect occur vivo T cell recognize respond antigen present tumor cell . In ESFT AR , tumor-specific chromosomal translocation result production novel fusion protein identify great majority tumor . Peptides derive fusion protein show function tumor antigens cytolytic T cell animal study . This protocol study safety , feasibility efficacy tumor-specific peptide vaccination administer interleukin-2 therapy without autologous T cell infusion patient recurrent ESFT AR .</detailed_description>
