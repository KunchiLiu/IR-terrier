	<brief_summary>Patients whose parathyroid activity elevate normal referred hyperparathyroidism . This study help researcher well understand cause hyperthyroidism evaluate improve method diagnosis treatment . In study , patient diagnose suspected hyperparathyroidism select participate . In addition , patient related condition parathyroid tumor , also select . Subjects ask provide blood urine test confirm condition . They surgically treat removal parathyroid gland ( ) ( parathyroidectomy ) . Subjects parathyroid tumor undergo several diagnostic test determine exact location tumor well tumor 's activity . The test may include ; ultrasound , nuclear scanning , CT scan , MRI , specialize blood testing . Sometimes parathyroidectomy lead hypoparathyroidism . Options treat patient surgical procedure also address . Calcium Vitamin D supplement typically mainstay post parathyroidectomy therapy . Other potential treatment include transplant parathyroid gland ( ) area body .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients confirm suspected primary hyperparathyroidism complication therefrom ( postoperative hypoparathyroidism ) admit diagnosis treatment . The principal diagnostic component calcium serum urine parathyroid hormone serum . Patients moderately highly severe primary hyperparathyroidism treat . Treatment mainly parathyroidectomy . Other option medication intervention . Patients hyperparathyroid syndrome may manage extraparathyroid feature . Preoperative test localize parathyroid neoplasm ( ) use usually extend method case prior neck surgery . Preoperative tumor localization test select accord clinical indication follow : ultrasound , technetium-thallium scan , computerized tomography , magnetic resonance imaging , fine needle aspiration parathyroid hormone assay , selective arteriogram , selective venous catheterization parathyroid hormone assay . Options management postoperative hypocalcemia include calcium , vitamin D analog , parathyroid autograft synthetic parathyroid hormone . Research specimens may consist blood tumor .</detailed_description>
