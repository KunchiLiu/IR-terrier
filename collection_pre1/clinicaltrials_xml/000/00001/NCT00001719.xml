	<brief_summary>This study use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) examine blood flow pattern artery vein liver abdomen . It 1 ) determine best way measure blood flow vessel , 2 ) make detailed measurement blood flow pattern vessel . Information normal liver blood flow may help explain role blood flow liver disease . Normal healthy volunteer 18 year age old may eligible study . They undergo MRI-a diagnostic tool use strong magnetic field radio wave show structural chemical change tissue speed move blood . The patient lie stretcher inside metal cylinder ( scanner ) 1 1.5 hour require lie still 10 15 minute time . Blood pressure , heart rate , breathe amount oxygen fingertip measure scan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The involvement liver certain disease process non-uniform may relate hepatic anatomy dynamic portal blood flow . These difference may result inhomogeneous delivery hepatic toxin trophic substance , tumor secretion product tumor metastasis different portion liver . In addition effect natural history hepatic disease , feature may affect performance ( planning/methods ) interpretation diagnostic study , hepatic venous sample measurement tumor secretion product . This study combine non-invasive quantitative vivo measurement blood flow vitro model vascular system . The purpose study define normal hemodynamics hepatic blood flow , particularly portal flow , use Magnetic Resonance Angiography ( MRA ) draw inference regard role hemodynamics natural history hepatic disease .</detailed_description>
