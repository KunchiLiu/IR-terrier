	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Documentation HIV1 infection license ELISA test kit confirm second method ( e.g . Western Blot ) . Absolute CD4+ Tcell count great equal 300/mm ( 3 ) within 30 day randomization ( For patient status postsplenectomy , also CD4+ Tcell great 20 % ) . For patient cohort 2 , lowest document CD4+ Tcell count must great equal 200 cells/mm ( 3 ) . Receiving HAART ( least 2 NRTIs NNRTI PI ) least 1 viral load test limit detection ( least less 500 copies/ml ) great equal 3 month cohort 1 4 great equal 6 month cohort 2 , 3 5 screening . A confirmatory viral load le 50 copies/ml prior enrollment . Age least 18 year . For woman childbearing potential , negative pregnancy test ( serum urine ) require within 14 day prior randomization . Laboratory value ( within 30 day prior randomization ) : AST 5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; Total direct bilirubin 2 time ULN unless pattern consistent Gilbert 's syndrome patient receive indinavir ; Creatinine 2.0 mg/dL ; Platelet count least 50,000 microliters . Willingness provide blood sample storage may use future study HIV infection and/or immunopathogenesis . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Concurrent malignancy , disease state , require cytotoxic chemotherapy . Symptomatic significant HIVrelated illness , opportunistic infection malignancy mucocutaneous Kaposi 's sarcoma . Use experimental antiretrovirals less equal 6 month prior enrollment . An exception may make hydroxyurea accord judgment Principal Investigator . For cohort 1 extension cohort 2 , current use IL2 history use IL2 . Cohorts 2 , 3 , 4 5 , patient must currently receive cycle IL2 . For extension cohort 2 , participation previous STI study HAART great 2 week consecutively last year . Pregnancy breastfeed study period . Significant cardiac , pulmonary , kidney , rheumatologic , gastrointestinal , CNS disease detectable routine history , physical examination , screen laboratory study exclude . If abnormality contraindication specific drug , alternative drug within class may use . Psychiatric illness , opinion PI , might interfere study compliance . Active substance abuse history prior substance abuse may interfere protocol compliance compromise patient safety . Refusal practice safe sex use precaution pregnancy ( effective birth control abstinence ) . Known history laboratory evidence chronic hepatitis B infection include surface antigen positivity . Patients receive salvage HAART , i.e . evidence clinical resistance license antiretrovirals . Patients cohort 1 receive nevirapine time enrollment . Patients receive nevirapine abacavir time enrollment . Expanded access medication allow time enrollment study .</criteria>
