	<brief_summary>The purpose study see safe effective add interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) standard drug combination ( paromomycin plus azithromycin ) use treat cryptosporidiosis AIDS patient . Doctors would like find combination IL-12 , paromomycin , azithromycin effective paromomycin azithromycin alone . Cryptosporidiosis type opportunistic ( AIDS-related ) infection see HIV-positive patient immune system weaken . It cause parasite invades intestinal tract , cause watery diarrhea , stomach cramp , upset stomach , fever . Antibiotics ( paromomycin azithromycin ) usually use treat cryptosporidiosis . In study , doctor look effectiveness use IL-12 . IL-12 type protein naturally produce certain type cell immune system believe important immune function . Doctors hope IL-12 help boost immune system fight cryptosporidiosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Chronic Cryptosporidiosis AIDS Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cryptosporidium parvum , intracellular protozoan parasite , frequent cause chronic diarrhea HIV-infected patient , cause significant morbidity mortality . Highly effective antiparasitic treatment infection currently available . Paromomycin azithromycin efficacy use combination small number patient . Immune reconstitution highly active antiretroviral therapy appear effective therapy , possible patient . Interferon gamma expression strongly associate control cryptosporidiosis , IL-12 cytokine primarily responsible stimulation interferon gamma expression vivo . It hop treatment recombinant human IL-12 result stimulation intestinal cytokine response AIDS patient cryptosporidiosis response combine chemotherapy lead elimination detectable number Cryptosporidium oocysts stool . All patient receive azithromycin paromomycin , patient randomize add either IL-12 placebo . IL-12 ( placebo ) injection give twice week . Patients take study medication 4 week . During time , ask record bowel movement symptoms experience . Patients return clinic least twice week receive IL-12 ( placebo ) injection . At Weeks 2 4 , patient see one principal investigator . Blood sample obtain viral load measurement CD4 count , well routine urinalysis . Patients undergo upper endoscopy jejunal biopsy colonoscopy ileal biopsy Weeks 2 4 therapy assay intestinal cytokine expression . A final clinic visit occur 12 week post-therapy physical exam blood test .</detailed_description>
