	<brief_title>A Study Two Adherence Plans Help HIV-Positive Patients Take Their Medications Correctly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adherence antiretroviral ( AR ) therapy become increasingly important management HIV infection . Adherence AR regimens think critical factor maintain therapeutic drug level , thus help ensure viral suppression minimize risk drug resistance .

Special training session hold staff participate unit assign medication manager and/or electronic medication reminder system intervention . The medication manager research staff member work individually study patient , address knowledge , motivation , skill necessary adherence . The electronic medication reminder system ALR ( A Little Reminder ) . This small , portable alarm program sound flash time patient 's schedule AR medication dos . Patients enrol either FIRST MDR-HIV study clinical site authorize carry study offer option participate adherence intervention clinical site randomly assign . Data collect FIRST MDR-HIV protocol use address Adherence study objective . Patients FIRST protocol assess time first plasma HIV-RNA level 2,000 copies/ml . Also , patient FIRST MDR-HIV study assess change viral load , resistance , CD4 cell count , adherence , factor .</detailed_description>
