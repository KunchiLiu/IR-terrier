	<brief_summary>This study attempt develop validate improve subjective measure pain sensation use measure evaluate pain sensitivity patient . Normal healthy volunteer dental patient undergoing third molar extraction may eligible study . Participants undergo follow procedure : Volunteers : Volunteers participate two 90-minute session receive rate four heat stimulus per minute apply skin maximum 36 minute . The heat stimuli range 37째 ( Degree ) C 51째 ( Degree ) C ( 99째 ( Degree ) F 124째 ( Degree ) F ) last 2 3 second . A drug commonly use dental treatment may administer second session .

	<detailed_description>Mismanaged pain still major medical problem . Many pain syndrome effective treatment , many manage poorly . Basic apply research pain treatment hamper unobservable nature pain sensation lack validate measure perception . The purpose protocol develop validate improve subjective measure pain sensation use measure evaluate pain sensitivity clinical population . Normal volunteer rate experimentally-evoked pain sensation double-blind administration opioid fentanyl saline placebo . Patients rate experimentally-evoked pain sensation without drug administration .</detailed_description>
