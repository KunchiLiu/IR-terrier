	<brief_summary>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) disease nervous system . The exact cause MS unknown , believe autoimmune condition . Autoimmune condition diseases cause body 's immune system natural defense attack healthy cell . In case MS , immune system begin attack myelin , cell make sheath cover nerve . Without myelin nerve unable transmit signal effectively symptoms occur . Researchers interested test safety , tolerability , effectiveness new therapy ( CGP77116 ) Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) . CGP77116 small protein similar protein myelin . CGP77116 design modify immune reaction destroy normal myelin . CGP77116 experimental therapy meaning approve U.S. Food Drug Administration . However , preliminary study animal show effective modifying autoimmune reaction associate development MS . The purpose study assess safety effect CGP77116 disease activity patient Multiple Sclerosis measure magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) immunological study . The study break three part : I ) BASELINE : first part study patient undergo 6 MRIs 5 month period . During time , patient evaluate base presence MS lesion see MRI . Patients whose MS lesions highly active enter second part study . II ) TREATMENT : second part study , patient active MS lesion begin receive CGP77116 . The drug give injection week one month month 8 additional month . III ) FOLLOW-UP : third final part study , patient undergo MRI every 2 month 6 month every 3 month 6 additional month . The result MRIs use measure effectiveness CGP77116 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This trial evaluate safety , tolerability effect cranial magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) immune response CGP 77116 patient demyelinate autoimmune disease , multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . The purpose trial ass whether CGP 77116 modifies inflammatory disease activity measure MRI immunological technique , facilitate dose selection future pivotal trial progressive relapsing-remitting MS. CGP 77116 alter peptide ligand ( APL ) design around immunodominant epitope human myelin basic protein ( MBP ) correspond amino acid 83-99 , treatment multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . Substitution key T cell receptor contact residue alanine result non-stimulatory peptide analogue . Recent evidence suggest T cell-mediated immune response immunodominant myelin protein peptides MBP ( 83-99 ) involve MS pathogenesis ( 1 ) . MS result immune system unable keep autoreactive T cell enter central nervous system initiate demyelination myelin sheath . By target MBP autoreactive T cell , CGP 77116 may downregulate MBP-specific immune response lead amelioration MS .</detailed_description>
