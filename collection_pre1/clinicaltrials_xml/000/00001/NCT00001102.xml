	<brief_summary>The purpose study see take certain anti-HIV drug affect way body metabolize fat . This study evaluate patient enrol CPCRA 058 ( FIRST [ Flexible Initial Retrovirus Suppressive Therapies ] study ) look change cholesterol level , level fat blood , body fat distribution . Patients FIRST study receive anti-HIV drug regimen contain protease inhibitor ( PI ) , nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) , . Anti-HIV drug therapy use PIs become common treatment HIV-positive patient . Recently , however , serious side effect involve body use fat report patient take PIs . Examples side effect redistribution body fat , high cholesterol level , development diabetes . However , side effect also see patient take PIs . It important determine whether side effect directly relate PI use . In study , patient different drug combination , either without PI , compare .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Anti-HIV Therapy Fat Metabolism HIV-Positive Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Close 3 year widespread PI use , several toxicity , include metabolic alteration , report increasingly conjunction use PI-containing regimen . Some manifestation metabolic alteration include hyper/dyslipidemia , hyperglycemia , insulin resistance glucose intolerance , lipodystrophy ( face extremity ) , body fat redistribution ( e.g. , central obesity buffalo hump ) . Despite report increase prevalence metabolic complication among PI user , question whether result PI therapy answer . Some complication , e.g. , decrease peripheral fat increase visceral fat buffalo hump , observe HIV-infected individual receive PIs . This study compare 3 different antiretroviral regimen use FIRST study ( CPCRA 058 ) , 1 contain PI , examine metabolic alteration occur . This study enroll patient simultaneously co-enrolling FIRST protocol ; 120 patient FIRST study strategy group . At entry , Months 1 4 , every 4 month , blood drawn measure serum glucose , insulin , total cholesterol , HDL cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , triglyceride level . At entry Months 4 , 8 , 12 , every 12 month , body cell mass , body fat bioelectrical impedance analysis ( BIA ) assess . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 7/5/01 : At Months 4 , 8 , 12 , every 4 month closure FIRST protocol ] patient weigh skinfold measurement body circumference measurement do . The skinfold body circumference measurement discontinue study collect minimum 2 year follow-up data participant . Statistical evaluation perform data .</detailed_description>
