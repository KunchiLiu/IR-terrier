	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn immune cell blood ( CD4 cell , example ) healthy child order well understand difference blood cell child infect HIV . Because child 's body still develop , cell different adult , body respond differently infection HIV . In order understand immune cell grow mature fight HIV , important see cell behave normal child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Early life , cell involve immune selection differentiate CD4+ CD8+ cell . Currently insufficient information cell maturation activation peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) subsets normal child . The critical need information bring pediatric HIV/AIDS epidemic , require measurement peripheral blood CD4+ T cell cell type interpretation HIV disease progression . The immunopathogenesis pediatric HIV infection differs adults well understood . In order well understand HIV disease progression HIV-infected child , PBMC subsets must study normal child control value establish . Healthy infant , child , adolescent present routine care elective surgery single blood sample obtain . Blood use complete blood count , peripheral blood mononuclear cell flow analysis surface marker , plasma cell storage . Demographic information include age , sex , race , ethnicity obtain time blood draw . The reason patient 's visit also document . No study drug administer supply part study . Statistical analysis use estimate median distribution CD4 CD8 subset .</detailed_description>
