	<brief_summary>The purpose study identify gene gene responsible inherited form Parkinson 's disease learn disease develop . In Parkinson 's disease , deficiency brain chemical call dopamine impairs function part brain control movement . As result , patient may difficulty move may uncontrolled movement hand finger . Parkinson 's disease usually occur sporadically , know cause . In family , however , disease seem inherit gene mutation ( change ) . There 50-50 chance parent mutate gene pas child . Children inherit abnormal gene may may go actually develop Parkinson 's disease-the relative chance happen know . Individuals 18 year age old family Parkinson 's disease appear inherit may eligible study . Participants brief medical examination , provide personal family medical history , small blood sample ( 2 tablespoon ) take genetic study . The total time require study 1 2 hour . Participants encourage meet NIH investigator genetics specialist local area test talk possible implication family test result ... .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Analysis Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals , possible multiple family member , family inherit Parkinson 's disease enrol . We also enrol people sporadic Parkinson 's disease . Known disease gene sequence look mutation . In event mutation detect sample multiple family member , linkage analysis undertaken effort identify region region genome harbor defective gene cause inherit Parkinson 's disease . Candidate gene reside region link disease sequence effort find mutation responsible disease . Genetic linkage study include available , informative family member , gene sequence analysis perform affected individual spousal control . In event identify mutation clear pathogenicity one know Parkinson 's gene , contact participate family member notify discovery gene cause PD family offer individual counseling test CLIA approve lab . To assess impact cause offer subsequent pursuit genetic test administer questionnaire assess psychological well-being prior follow testing .</detailed_description>
