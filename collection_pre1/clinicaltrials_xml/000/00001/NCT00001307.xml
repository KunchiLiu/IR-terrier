	<brief_summary>This study examine brain process pain signal different part brain work response painful stimulus . A good understanding people experience pain may helpful develop effective treatment . Healthy normal volunteer , patient require third molar ( wisdom tooth ) extraction , patient persistent pain due disease , injury reason may eligible study . Participants receive one follow sensory stimulus , may cause brief discomfort pain : - Heat/Cold - apply electronically control device touch skin , temperature-controlled water bath , thermally control brass cylinder subject grasp - Capsaicin ( active ingredient hot chili pepper ) - inject small volume fluid skin muscle - Mechanical stimulation - brushing vibration normally cause pain - Ischemic stimulation - inflation blood pressure cuff arm leg 30 minute These stimulus apply positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan . This test show part brain active important study different part brain work together feel react specific sensation . For procedure , subject lie table PET scanner series scan take different sensory condition . At begin scan , radioactive water inject arm vein catheter ( thin plastic tube ) . A special camera record arrival disappearance radiation various brain area , create picture brain 's activity various region . Oral surgery patient may PET scan wisdom tooth extraction . Alfentanil , commonly use narcotic pain reliever , also give PET procedure determine brain respond sensory stimuli effect pain killer . Participants also magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan brain help interpret PET result . MRI use magnetic field radio wave show structural chemical change tissue . During scan , subject lie table cylindrical machine ( scanner ) . He speak staff member via intercom system . Some sensory study may require place arterial and/or intravenous line . Following injection local anesthetic , catheter place artery arm . At regular interval various sensory stimulus , small blood sample draw artery measure blood gas substance . Samples may also draw catheter place vein . Subjects may also ultrasound monitor evaluate blood flow artery , vein brain . A gel spread skin blood vessel hand-foot-and-mouth device place gel . The device emit high-frequency sound wave produce picture speed blood flow artery diameter vessel .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Regional cerebral blood flow ( rCBF ) measure normal subject , patient post-operative pain , patient neuropathic abnormality pain sensation expose battery somatosensory stimuli activate know pathway subserve touch , temperature pain sensation . We perform series study genetics pain , assessed sensitivity ( via subjective rating ) series warm painfully hot thermal pulse . Subjects range insensitive ( i.e . rating 49 degree C 0.8 versus 10 10 point scale ) , yet mathematically could define inflection point transition warm hot nearly everyone , thus subject encode nociceptive input alter rating threshold C-fiber afferent firing ( 45 degree C ) . We need understand brain responds use objective blood flow endpoint . Our previous study disclose distinct pain-intensity driven network region activate hot thermal stimulus use repetitive scan determine degree activation network sensitive insensitive subject . We also develop new treatment cancer arthritic pain involve deletion primary afferent C-fibers . We midst get approval FDA use patient cancer pain . Assuming obtain approval , may potential scan appropriate patient treatment determine impact treatment explore alteration pain network subject without C-fiber afferent use experimental stimulus . We also expect eventually treat patient peripheral neuropathy chronic pain condition cause spontaneous pain , hyperalgesia , allodynia ( pain sensation normally non-noxious stimulus ) examine without applied experimental stimulus treatment .</detailed_description>
