	<brief_summary>A total fifty severely affect patient homozygous sickle cell disease sickling disorder ( e.g . B negative B positive Thalassemia/Sickle ) great 18 year age eligible treatment . Such patient must able tolerate extensive period without blood transfusion relatively well preserved renal hepatic function ( creatinine le 1.5 mg/dl normal liver function test exception mild elevation transaminase ) . Evidence severe sickle cell anemia include recurrent pain crisis , chronic bone oain , evidence aseptic necrosis symptom , intractable leg ulcer , etc . On admission study , patient receive complete history physical examination . These data standard laboratory evaluation , include test pregnancy appropriate , adequate ascertain whether criterion exclusion present . Each patient must accept responsibility use effective mean contraception . Patients find HIV positive exclude study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hydroxyurea Treatment Patients With Sickle Cell Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hydroxyurea cell-cycle specific agent block DNA synthesis inhibit ribonucleotide reductase , enzyme convert ribonucleotides deoxyribonucleotides . Hydroxyurea show induce production HbF , initially non-human primate , fifty patient sickle cell anemia . The majority patient sickle cell disease respond drug two-fold increase HbF level ; patient percent HbF exceed 10 15 percent . It estimate level 20 percent require substantially reduce sickling propensity red cell modulate disease severity . We propose treat several patient chronically hydroxyurea monitor durability response , examine unanticipated long term side effect determine hematological change occur longitudinally . Such patient candidate protocol determine ability agent enhance HbF synthesis , especially hydroxyurea non-responders . Finally , series vitro study plan attempt develop predictor response .</detailed_description>
