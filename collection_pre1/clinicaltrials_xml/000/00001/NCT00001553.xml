	<brief_summary>Researchers interested change associate motor function human suffer stroke . Presently , mechanism person recovers motor function follow stroke poorly understood . There little information available area brain involved recovery limb function . Recently , new set technique develop may useful reduce physical impairment often associate stroke . The best way identify area brain associate regain function test patient , , function regain . This study compare two therapy determine good improve recovery motor function . The first technique involve immobilize functional limb actively train affected dysfunctional limb . The second technique involve immobilization , passive movement affect limb . Results study indicate two therapy well improve motor function . Additional diagnostic test help identify change brain function associate recover use affected limb .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Motor Changes Associated With Recovery From Stroke After Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We interest study plastic change associate recovery motor function human variety lesion central ( spinal cord injury ) peripheral nervous system ( amputation , reversible deafferentation ) motor learn . At present , mechanisms underlying recovery motor function stroke poorly understood . Little inconsistent information available specific brain region newly recruit patient chronic ischemic subcortical stroke reacquisition use affect limb . Recently , new set technique propose useful reduce chronic incapacitate motor impairment often associate stroke develop . In essence , consist prolonged restraint unaffected upper extremity practice use affected arm . These technique increase significantly use affected arm daily activity two trial report . The beneficial effect , produce , appear last year intervention . The best way identify brain region associate reacquisition motor function stroke test patient , reacquisition accomplish . In case , propose patient test , one two specific intervention : one involve immobilization healthy arm plus active training affect arm ( test procedure ) involve immobilization , passive manipulation affect arm . Results study indicate two therapy well improve recovery motor function . Comparison neurophysiological imaging study perform , intervention allow identification plastic change brain function associate specifically recovery use affect hand patient chronic ischemic subcortical stroke . Methodologically , multimodality approach use . Magnetic stimulation allow detail analysis map representation area primary motor cortex motor threshold evaluation central motor conduction . EEG movement-related cortical potential provide information coherence time activation different brain region . PET scan identify region activate association performance motor task . Registration information onto MRI allow precise identification brain region associate reacquisition motor skill affect side stroke . We hypothesize use affected arm associate decreased use unaffected arm useful trigger plasticity reacquisition motor function stroke . We expect identify cortical subcortical region newly activate patient reacquisition use affect arm , understand coherence time activation new brain region recruit quantify plastic change motor representation area target arm muscle affect unaffected arm .</detailed_description>
