	<brief_summary>Gaucher disease lysosomal storage disease result glucocerebroside accumulation macrophage due genetic deficiency enzyme glucocerebrosidase . It may occur patient age . The condition mark enlargement liver spleen ( hepatosplenomegaly ) , low blood platelet count , bone abnormality . The condition pass generation generation via autosomal recessive inheritance . There actually three type Gaucher disease . Type I common form . It chronic non-neuronopathic form , mean disease affect nervous system . The symptoms type I appear age . Type 2 Gaucher disease present prenatally infancy usually result death patient . Type 2 acute neuronopathic form affect brain stem . It severe form disease . Type 3 Gaucher disease also neuronopathic , however subacute nature . This mean course illness lie somewhere long-term ( chronic ) short-term ( acute ) . Currently cure Gaucher disease . Treatment disease traditionally supportive . In severely affected patient , bone-marrow transplant correct enzyme deficiency , consider high-risk procedure recovery slow . Enzyme replacement therapy another therapy option approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use type 1 patient . PEG-glucocerbrosidase drug design clear accumulation lipid ( glucocerebroside ) blood stream . The drug actually enzyme attached large molecule call polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) . The large molecule PEG allow enzyme remain blood stream long periods time . By modify glucocerebrosidase PEG , believe small dos require , mean reduction cost patient convenient administration drug . The purpose study evaluate effect safety enzyme replacement therapy use PEG- glucocerebrosidase treatment Gaucher disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PEG-Glucocerebrosidase Treatment Gaucher Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose clinical study evaluate biochemical therapeutic effect safety enzyme replacement therapy use polyethyleneglycol ( PEG ) modify glucocerebrosidase treatment Gaucher disease evaluate benefit risk ratio . The study design determine safety efficacy Gaucher patient recombinantly produce human glucocerebrosidase , PEG modify . Parameters monitor include hemoglobin , platelet count , organ size , extent bony involvement . Pharmacokinetic , pharmacodynamic , antibody study also evaluate .</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Gaucher Disease</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patients must least 3 year age . Must biochemically confirm ( enzyme ) and/or genetically confirm diagnosis type 1 type 3 Gaucher disease . Clinical laboratory sign suggest need therapy include least 2 follow : hemoglobin le 11 gm/dl ; platelet le 90,000/mm ( 3 ) ; hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly . Patient/Guardian must provide write informed consent . No pregnant breast feed woman . No women/men reproductive potential unless agree use effective contraceptive method . No patient treat alglucerase imiglucerase 6 month prior study entry . No patient diagnosis type 2 Gaucher disease . No patient lifethreatening disease gravely ill. No patient rapidly progress fatal illness concomitant malignancy . No patient chronic infectious disease include HIV hepatitis B . No patient chronically medication may interfere drug 's metabolism activity . No patient receive blood transfusion within month prior study entry .</criteria>
