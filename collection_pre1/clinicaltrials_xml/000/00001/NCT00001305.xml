	<brief_summary>Growth deficiency key feature severe Osteogenesis Imperfecta ( OI ) frequent feature mild moderate form disease . The reason child OI short fully understood . We know detail number fracture suffer type OI fully explain short stature OI . Growth pattern define child OI Types I , III , IV . At 12 month age , child Types III IV OI demonstrate predictable plateau linear growth rate . Type IV OI child begin resume normal growth rate age four five year , `` catch '' normal height , `` lose '' significant period growth . The plateau usually continue child Type III OI . The reason growth plateau unknown . There study evaluate growth OI child age range . Our previous study growth OI child begin age 5 year . We study growth OI child past 10 year . Different medication try stimulate growth improve bone density . Some child respond growth hormone ( growth rate increase least 50 % ) . The majority child respond Type IV . However , need carefully treat study child try determine child benefit growth hormone medication . The Goals Study Are : 1 . We want try find cause growth plateau common type III IV OI . Long-term , goal develop treatment eliminate plateau . 2 . We want see long well OI bone respond growth stimulation . 3 . We hope find `` predictor '' respond growth hormone , measure child 's endocrine growth hormone function receive growth hormone treatment . 4 . We want measure effect growth stimulation bone density , quality OI bone . 5 . We want see long term benefit result treatment form final adult height , trunk height , possibly improve function respiratory system . Median Subject Age ( p. 1 webpage ) : 1-15 year ( replaces 0-20 )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Growth deficiency cardinal feature severe Osteogenesis Imperfecta ( OI ) frequent feature mild moderate form disease . Despite prevalence short stature among people OI , study examine treatment option feature OI . Recombinant human growth hormone ( rGH ) treatment growth deficiency investigate . In initial study find many OI child responsive rGH especially type IV OI . The purpose protocol examine effect growth hormone treatment linear growth child type III IV OI correlate growth responsiveness growth hormone-somatomedin axis histomorphometry parameter OI bone .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients recruit goal include least 10 individual clinical/biochemical criterion type III IV OI 3 8 year age . Height : Individuals type III OI severe short stature definition ; individual type IV OI recruit study height le 3rd percentile age . All individual require furnish growth record , especially height head circumference , least precede two year . Long bone status : Participants must radiographic evidence long bone epiphyses yet fuse . In addition , 60 degree great angulation femur exclude child , pending surgical management medical clearance . Spine : Prospective participant evaluate scoliosis spinal compression . Participants scoliosis great 40 degree exclude unless evidence present scoliosis stable prior two year . Participants corrective rod spine exclude . Neuro status : All patient coenrolled 97CH0064 , screen Basilar Invagination protocol . Children initially screen spiral CT scan MRI confirmation determine severe BI exclude participation study . Severe BI define NIH data distortion angle pons medulla compression posterior fossa content . We begin define parameter BI population , know child BI progress severity . Until question answer , feel would prudent stimulate growth child know severe form BI enrollment . Pulmonary status : All child coenrolled 97CH0064 , pulmonary function test protocol . Tests schedule require protocol ; namely , PFTs every 2 year normal , every year abnormal . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients develop scoliosis great 40 degree and/or patient progress severe basilar invagination study remove study . Failure comply outline procedure ( blood draw , endocrine testing , bone biopsy , visit schedule ) also criterion withdrawal protocol . Patients become pregnant .</criteria>
