	<brief_summary>This study continue follow child participate earlier National Cancer Institute trial HIV treatment protease inhibitor . Children study receive combination least three drug include least one protease inhibitor one reverse transcriptase inhibitor . The study examine extent drug restore immune function HIV-infected child length time . It look change amount virus specific type immune cell body 96-week trial period . It also examine patient ' immune system response influenza tetanus vaccination . The child either continue receive anti-HIV drug take , medicine change different combination protease inhibitor reverse transcriptase inhibitor . Before study , patient undergo various test , include physical examination , blood test chest X ray , immune response test , CT scan , eye examination , electrocardiogram echocardiogram . A procedure call apheresis may do collect white blood cell . In procedure , whole blood drawn similar donating blood , white cell separate machine , red cell return body .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study evaluate extent immunoreconstitution child receive combination antiretroviral therapy include protease inhibitor reverse transcriptase inhibitor . The child evaluate follow study previously study protease inhibitor-containing anti-HIV protocol within HIV AIDS Malignancy Branch . This study provide mechanism assess long-term immunologic change potent combination therapy unique population relate virologic change . A total 50 HIV-1 infected child study . The child enrol protocol either continue current combination protease inhibitor reverse transcriptase therapy , deem clinically appropriate , change new , best available combination protease inhibitor reverse transcriptase inhibitor . Long-term immunoreconstitution , define repopulation naive CD4+T lymphocyte , study determine presence extent production new naive ( thymic derive ) CD4+T cell ability patient mount new helper T cell response immunization influenza tetanus toxoid . Expansion T cell receptor also explore subset enrol patient . In addition , unforeseen toxicity attributable use combination antiretroviral therapy recognize described adult patient . This study evaluate abnormality lipid glucose metabolism , change distribution body fat , surrogate marker cardiovascular disease risk cohort pediatric patient .</detailed_description>

Currently least three drug combination include protease inhibitor ( PI ) reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( RTI ) therapy least 6 month . Patient must receive initial protease inhibitor treatment study HIV AIDS Malignancy Branch need enrol another NIH study eligible protocol . Ageadjusted CD4+ T lymphocytes great 200 cells/ml . Measurements CD4+45RA+ CD4+45RO+ T lymphocytes take within 9 week time initiation proteaseinhibitor therapy . Availability parent guardian provide inform consent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA Critically ill clinically unstable child . Patients receive treatment infection require prolonged treatment must stable therapy least 14 day prior study entry . Administration chemotherapeutic agent use immunomodulating agent high dose corticosteroid , interferon , pentoxifylline , GCSF/GMCSF , erythropoietin , growth hormone growth factor within one month enrollment . However , patient antiinflammatory drug stable dos immunoglobulin ( include hyperimmune immunoglobulin ) eligible unless latter direct Tcell specific antigen .
