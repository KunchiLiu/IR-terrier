	<brief_summary>A study child adolescent ( current N=100 ) early onset age 12 ( COS ) DSM-III-R define schizophrenia ( 97-M-0126 ) examine clinical , neurobiological , early neurodevelopmental , genetic , clinical drug response characteristic case . Earlier study document continuity COS adult onset case ( See Jacobsen Rapoport , 1998 review ) . The focus shift increase sample size evaluation familial risk factor include : psychiatric diagnosis family member ; smooth pursuit eye movement ; neuropsychological test deficit , obtain blood cell line genetic study ( family member , also cover 96-M-0060 , Dr. Ellen Sidransky ) . A study obstetrical record COS probands indicated increase adverse pre perinatal event case compare obstetrical record sibling ( Nicolson et al submit ) . In contrast , several finding point increase risk probands . To date , total 5 ( 10.4 % ) COS subject find previously unknown cytogenetic abnormality ( Microdeletion 22q11 ( 3 case ) , ( Usiskin et al , submit ) , Mosaic 45X0 ( one case ) ( Kumra et al , 1998 ) balance 1:7 translocation ( Gordon et al 1994 ) . The study first degree relative rare case address hypothesis risk factor , probably genetic , increased immediate family member relative community control relatives patient chronic , treatment resistant , adult-onset schizophrenia ( AOS ) . A second hypothesis COS familial risk factor show significant relationship developmental delays/abnormalities observe COS probands . As total 50 additional COS subject study next 5 year , pediatric control sample probands also increase , determine need concurrent measure patient control maintain measurement validity . Thus total 600 additional subject study include 50 control COS probands , 150 COS relative , 150 control COS relatives , 250 relative adult onset schizophrenic ( AOS ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A study child adolescent early onset age 12 ( COS ) DSM-III-R define schizophrenia examine clinical , neurobiological , early neurodevelopmental , genetic , clinical drug response characteristic case , Protocols 97-M-0126 03-M-0035 . Earlier study document continuity COS adult-onset case . The focus shift increase sample size evaluation familial risk factor include : psychiatric diagnosis family member ; neuropsychological testing , anatomic functional brain imaging , obtain blood fibroblast cell line genetic study . A study obstetrical record COS probands indicated increase adverse pre perinatal event case compare obstetrical record well sibling . In contrast , several finding point increase genetic risk probands . The study first-degree relative rare case address hypothesis risk factor , probably genetic , increased immediate family member relative community control relatives patient chronic , treatment resistant , adult-onset schizophrenia ( AOS ) . A second hypothesis COS familial risk factor include similar form developmental delays/abnormalities observe COS probands . Preliminary data suggest great abnormality frontal-parietal circuit early onset patient relative see adult onset illness . We examine brain development unrelated healthy volunteer sibling COS probands combine resting- task-related magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) imaging . Imaging study may lead great understanding course , mechanism , influence brain development high-risk sibling may lead improve understanding risk factor , early identification , optimization brain maturation . For 20 year , image do separate protocol ( 89-M-0006 ) ; however , plan incorporate image study protocol ( well main patient screen follow-up protocol ( 03-M-0035 ) previously submit amendment ) .</detailed_description>
