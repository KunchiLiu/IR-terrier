	<brief_summary>This study ass value magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) detect heart attack heart attack risk patient come hospital emergency room chest pain . It also investigate whether MRI help predict coronary status patient 4 6 week 1 year emergency room admission . Patients come emergency room Suburban Hospital Bethesda , MD , chest pain may ask enroll study diagnose heart attack . Participating patient undergo MRI scan soon emergency room doctor determine stable condition . For procedure , patient lie table slide MRI scanner-a large tubular machine magnetic field . During scan , contrast material inject vein . This material brighten image heart blood flow see . The scan show area heart muscle receive insufficient blood flow . A second scan do within 72 hour look coronary artery blockage may require treatment . Patients follow telephone 4 8 week scan 1 year scan ask significant medical problem may occur time period . This study provide information may improve emergency treatment patient acute chest pain clarify patient require immediate medical treatment , admit hospital evaluation , may safely discharge hospital .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Coronary artery disease remain leading cause death United States result high diagnostic therapeutic cost . The overall cost associate care patient cardiovascular disease project $ 286.5 billion . Although MRI relatively expensive technology , methodology provide noninvasive diagnostic test necessary evaluate triage patient coronary artery disease . This `` one stop shop '' potential low overall testing important patient population well delineate patient require intervention . Beyond reproduce result exist diagnostic test , MRI unique ability characterize myocardial tissue add information assessment patient attainable currently available methodology . This study examine hypothesis MRI assessment regional LV function , rest myocardial perfusion , myocardial tissue characteristic accurately detect high fraction patient acute myocardial infarction possible ECG perform emergency department .</detailed_description>
