	<brief_summary>This study design evaluate efficacy high dose melphalan autologous bone marrow transplantation give consolidation therapy patient inflammatory metastatic carcinoma breast complete remission . All patient enter receive induction therapy cyclophosphamide , adriamycin , methotrexate 5-fluorouracil hormonal synchronization utilize tamoxifen premarin previous Medicine Branch protocol ( MB-160C ) . Among patient inflammatory carcinoma breast , pathologic complete responder receive irradiation breast regional lymph node ; convertible partial responder clinical complete responder residual disease biopsy undergo surgical resection bulk disease follow irradiation chest wall regional lymph node exclude axilla . Both group responder randomize receive either systemic consolidation therapy high dose melphalan ( 180 mg/M2 total dose 3 day ) autologous bone marrow transplantation follow maintenance therapy maintenance therapy alone . Complete responder noninflammatory group receive therapy since , historically , do well follow induction local therapy , maintenance therapy alone . Patients metastatic breast cancer assess response throughout induction therapy . Complete convertable partial responder receive consolidative therapy randomize ABMT follow 6 month maintenance therapy vs. maintenance alone .</brief_summary>
