	<brief_summary>This study design evaluate blood Th1 Th2 immunoregulatory cytokine production hormonal level associate third trimester pregnancy postpartum state . Cytokine hormone level assess blood specimen obtain healthy pregnant postpartum female compare level premenopausal non-pregnant non-postpartum female . Blood sample obtain 30-36 week gestation 2-6 week postpartum primary study point . Samples also obtain pregnant , postpartum , non-pregnant , non-postpartum , premenopausal female patient rheumatoid arthritis . Additional data generate sample normal male , compare data female . We expect find pregnancy associate enhance Th2 cytokine expression postpartum state associate enhance Th1 cytokine expression . We expect see difference cytokine expression male females well . We seek gather data support view distinct hormonal environment regulate contrast immunological state .</brief_summary>
