	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety effectiveness prednisone methotrexate treat severe Wegener 's granulomatosis systemic vasculitides . These disease involve inflammation blood vessel ( vasculitis ) may affect brain , nerve , eye , sinus , lung , kidney , intestinal tract , skin , joint , heart site . Current treatment prednisone anti-cancer drug cyclophosphamide effective , significant side effect high rate disease recurrence . In small number patient vasculitis , prednisone methotrexate , another anti-cancer drug , lead mark improvement , few side effect see cyclophosphamide . This study evaluate drug combination large patient population . Patients 10 80 year age active Wegener 's granulomatosis , polyarteritis nodosa , Churg-Strauss vasculitis , microscopic polyangiitis overlap may eligible 2 1/2 3-year study . In addition , patient glomerulonephritis ( type kidney disease ) positive blood test C-ANCA ( antibody find certain vasculitic kidney disease ) inflammatory sinusitis lung nodule infiltrate absence infection may also enrol . Participants take prednisone daily , mouth , low-dose methotrexate weekly , mouth injection either skin , muscle vein . Patients significantly improve treatment gradually reduce , eventually stop , prednisone . If remission last , methotrexate also reduce stop 2 1/2 year . If active disease recurs , original treatment program may start . Patients never achieve complete remission treatment whose symptom well control experience serious side effect may choose either continue low-dose methotrexate stop therapy . Patients hospitalize 4 6 time year , 2 8 day time , depend disease severity response illness . In addition , follow test procedure : - Medical history physical examination ( upon admission study every 1 3 month ) . - Blood test blood cell count level enzymes indicate liver damage ( upon admission , weekly , finally , less monthly ) . - Additional blood test measure blood chemistry evaluate kidney function ( upon admission clinically indicate ) . - Chest X-rays ( upon admission clinically indicate ) . - Computerized tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( need ) . - Electrocardiogram ( upon admission clinically indicate ) . - Lung function study ( upon admission least every 6 month clinically indicate ) . - Ear , nose throat evaluation ( clinically indicate ) . - Liver biopsy , blood test monitor liver function persistently abnormal . This procedure do hospital sedation induce relaxation drowsiness . The skin liver ( upper right abdomen ) numb local anesthetic needle pass rapidly liver collect small tissue sample microscopic examination .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Previous study NIH demonstrate 90 % case Wegener 's granulomatosis ( WG ) systemic necrotizing vasculitides , glucocorticoid ( GC ) daily low dose cyclophosphamide ( CP ) therapy result marked improvement even remission . However , therapy associate 50 % relapse , 10 % resistance initial treatment significant toxicity almost patient . Consequently , attempt identify alternative therapy systemic vasculitides would less toxic daily CP . An NIH study efficacy intermittent high dose intravenous CP daily GC ( Protocol # 88-I-56 ) reveal 79 % 14 patient WG either fail respond treatment , sustain improvement could tolerate continued treatment period approximately two year . In another study ( Protocol # 89-I-18 ) , evaluate treatment GC weekly oral dos methotrexate ( MTX ) 15 patient Takayasu 's arteritis , disease previously fail controlled GC , GC + CP , remission treatment follow relapse . Fifty-three percent ( 8/15 ) patient previously dependent GC able achieve remission discontinue GC therapy . Five seven patient remain GC remission receive least 50 % less GC prior MTX therapy . Only three patient progressive disease . The mean follow-up period 20 month . We also recently analyze result MTX + GC therapy 29 patient WG . Seventy-six percent patient mark improvement 69 % achieve remission . Seventy-two percent remission require GC therapy mean period 10 month . We conclude weekly low dose MTX therapy feasible alternative CP treatment systemic vasculitis . Judgement ultimate value therapy defer great number patient studied long period time .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Diagnosis : Wegener 's granulomatosis . Age : 1080 year . Qualifications eligibility : Prior documentation vasculitis base clinical characteristic histopathological and/or angiographic evidence vasculitis . Patients eligible study regardless whether currently receive immunosuppressive therapy . Failure respond prior therapy cytotoxic agent toxicity agent , set persistent disease , constitute one reason eligibility study . In absence histopathological and/or angiographic evidence vasculitis , patient follow criterion also eligible : A . Positive CANCA ( do NIH ) , B. Glomerulonephritis evidence presence red blood cell cast proteinuria renal biopsy show necrotizing glomerulonephritis absence positive immunofluorescence immunoglobulin complement , C. One following : Inflammatory sinusitis histopathological evidence granulomatous inflammation negative special stain mycobacteria fungi . Sinusitis must present least 3 month fail respond least 2 week antibiotic therapy direct likely pathogen ( H. influenza , S. pneumonia , upper respiratory tract anaerobic bacteria ) ; Pulmonary nodule infiltrate patient absence infection . Evidence active disease define Vasculitis Disease Activity Index great equal 3 ( Appendix I ) begin immunosuppressive therapy outside institution , history Vasculitis Disease Activity Index great equal 3 past 6 month . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Evidence infection gram stain and/or culture specimen . In instance infection rule gram stain culture secretion collection fluid involved organ , may necessary obtain biopsy affected tissue microbiological histopathological study . Recent ( within four week ) increase GC cytotoxic drug therapy . Patients pregnant nursing infant eligible . Fertile woman negative pregnancy test within one week prior study entry use effective mean birth control . Processes would predispose enhanced risk MTX toxicity : acute chronic liver disease , alcohol abuse ( great 14 oz 100 proof liquor equivalent per week ) , active peptic ulcer disease , inability comply study guideline . Serological evidence infection human immunodeficiency virus ( serological determination perform within two week study entry ) .</criteria>
