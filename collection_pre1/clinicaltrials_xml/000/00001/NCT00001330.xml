	<brief_summary>This study examine possible relationship silicone implant injection connective tissue disease scleroderma myositis . It explore whether certain factor blood immune system factor involve development disease follow silicone implantation injection . Men woman 18 year age old meet follow criterion may eligible study : Group 1-Patients silicone implant injection later develop scleroderma myositis Group 2-Patients scleroderma myositis silicone implant injection Group 3-Healthy volunteer silicone implant injection develop symptom medical feature connective tissue disorder . Participants thorough history physical examination , blood urine test , chest X-ray lung function test . In addition , patient complete questionnaire procedure ( include information type implant device injection , reason procedure , post-operative complication , illnesses medical condition present procedure , etc . ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This multicenter study attempt determine epidemiologic , clinical , serologic immunogenetic factor associate patient develop scleroderma/systemic sclerosis silicone prosthesis implantation silicone injection . This accomplished comparing patient group appropriately match patient idiopathic scleroderma/systemic sclerosis without silicone exposure , appropriately match volunteer receive similar silicone implant injection develop symptom , physical examination finding , laboratory abnormality associate autoimmune/connective tissue disease . Patient physician questionnaire self-administered , collect data regarding : number type implant silicone device injection ; indication nature surgical procedure ; peri- post-operative complication ; initial subsequent clinical presentation ; therapy clinical course patient . Routine clinical test immunologic laboratory evaluation perform . Also , study conduct proportion circulate activate lymphocyte level soluble mediator inflammation ( cytokine , sIL-2R , sCD4 , sCD8 , TNF ) , type HLA T cell receptor gene present patient , presence titer anti-silicone antibody autoantibody .</detailed_description>
