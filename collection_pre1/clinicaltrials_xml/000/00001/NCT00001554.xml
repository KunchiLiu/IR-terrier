	<brief_summary>It extremely important identify distinguish healthy brain tissue diseased brain tissue neurosurgery . If normal tissue damage neurosurgery result long term neurological problem patient . The brain tissue appear prior operation CT scan MRI occasionally different appear actual operation . Therefore , necessary develop diagnostic procedure use operation Presently , technique use intraoperative mapping brain reliable case use . Researchers study develop new approach may allow diseased brain tissue locate operation little risk . This new approach use nfrared technology locate diseased tissue identify healthy brain tissue . The goal study investigate clinical use intraoperative infrared ( IR ) neuroimaging locate diseased tissue distinguish normal functioning tissue operation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It important neurosurgical procedure identify preserve eloquent functional cortex adjacent resectable lesion . Resection lesion infiltrate vital cerebral cortex associate postoperative neurological deficit surgeon clearly distinguish infiltrate border lesion surround functionally eloquent tissue . Spatial relationship lesion surround normal brain change significantly determine preoperative method CT MRI scan . Necessary intraoperative intervention cerebrospinal fluid drainage , osmotic diuresis lesion debulking cause quantitatively unpredictable brain shift three dimension . Therefore functional localization real time perform operating room desirable . However , intraoperative real-time functional mapping technique available use many surgical situation sufficiently reliable case use . We develop intraoperative approach may permit reliable lesion localization brain functional mapping real time minimal risk . This approach make use infrared technology identify functionally active eloquent cortex may differentiate abnormal tissue normal cortex . The goal study investigate clinical use intraoperative infrared ( IR ) neuroimaging differentiate intracranial lesion surround normal functionally important tissue real time . Reliable real-time intraoperative functional mapping eloquent cortex adjacent lesion technique would improve safety effectiveness many neurosurgical procedure .</detailed_description>
