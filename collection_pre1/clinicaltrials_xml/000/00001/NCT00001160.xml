	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate method preoperative diagnosis therapy thyroid cancer screen patient participation protocol . Study subject include adult child thyroid nodule cancer require diagnostic fine needle aspiration biopsy , surgery , radioiodine scan therapy persistent recurrent disease . In natural history protocol , use method follow-up patient use radiopharmaceutical tracer ( 131 ) I , ( 123 ) I , ( 201 ) T1 chloride , ( 99 ) mTc-Sestamibi , ( 111 ) Inpentetreotide 18-FDG PET evaluate . All radionuclides administer accord standard clinical practice indication publish guideline . The limitation significance serum thyroglobulin ( Tg ) measurement diagnose tumor recurrence assess . The study permit continue evaluation risk/benefit ratio already establish method administer ( 131 ) I therapy include impact pre-treatment dosimetric calculation administration lithium ( well establish , yet widely use , adjuvant ( 131 ) I treatment ) , especially select case thyroid cancer high-dose ( great 150mCi ) ( 131 ) I therapy clinically indicate . Under protocol , sample benign nodule cancer tissue specimens research study collect assess new immunohistochemical marker , technique characterize tumor correlation response therapy prognosis . Blood urine specimen collect future clinical research study hypothyroid euthyroid state . Coded clinical data enter National Thyroid Cancer Registry select patient .</detailed_description>
