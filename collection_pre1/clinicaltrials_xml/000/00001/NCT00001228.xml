	<brief_summary>This study examine safety effectiveness interferon-a octreotide treatment Zollinger-Ellison syndrome ( gastrinoma ) advance non-B islet cell cancer . Gastrinoma tumor produce pancreas secretes hormone gastrin , turn stimulates production gastric juice cause ulcer . Some tumor malignant . Gastrinomas spread surgically remove require drug treatment ( chemotherapy ) . Current drug regimen , however , provide temporary benefit , case , produce life-threatening side effect . In study patient tumor similar gastrinoma , drug octreotide interferon-a , alone combination , show effect stop tumor growth well tolerate chemotherapy . At least one-third patient respond treatment either drug least 6 month ; two drug give together may produce good response either one alone . Patients currently enrol NIH study Zollinger-Ellison syndrome whose gastrinoma spread original site surgically remove may eligible study . Participants admit NIH Clinical Center blood urine test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , chest X-ray imaging study ( CT , ultrasound , MRI , octreoscan , bone scan ) begin treatment evaluate size extent tumor . Patients start interferon-a octreotide , , give injection skin . Treatment continue least 6 month , unless side effect require stop drug early . Patients whose tumor shrink remain stable may continue treatment indefinitely . Those respond treatment take study offer standard chemotherapy . Patients admit hospital first day two therapy monitor side effect learn self-inject drug continue therapy home . Both drug give [ Note : often ? day , twice day , weekly ? ] ( Octreotide also available long-acting form , patient prefer may give drug month doctor . ) During treatment period , patient see personal physician every 2 week first month month thereafter medical evaluation check adverse side effect treatment . In addition , admit NIH Clinical Center every 3 month medical evaluation imaging study , include CT , MRI , ultrasound , bone scan , octreoscan , assess effect treatment tumor size .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Heretofore morbidity mortality Zollinger-Ellison syndrome cause severe ulcer disease . The advent specific drug cure ulcer disease extend life metastasis non-B-islet cell tumor event cause death . Patients metastatic gastrinoma surgically resectable increased size 4-6 month period prior study treat interferon-alpha , 5 million international units/day . The drug administer subcutaneously patient . Tumor response side effect monitor . Patients receive 6 month therapy reduction stabilization tumor mass , therapy continue long response maintain .</detailed_description>
