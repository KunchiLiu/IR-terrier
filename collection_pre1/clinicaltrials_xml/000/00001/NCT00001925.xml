	<brief_summary>Tremors involuntary movement part part body occur alternate contraction relaxation muscle . The cause behind tremor poorly understood . Some study suggest tremor could cause abnormality particular area brain call olivary nucleus . Researchers believe cell make olivary nucleus may responsible generate central rhythm body may therefore also responsible generation tremor . Consumption alcohol know reduce tremor patient . Researchers believe alcohol may work directly cell olivary nucleus . As result , researcher would like determine effect alcohol three different kind tremor ( physiological , symptomatic palatal , essential palatal ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Alcohol Tremors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pathophysiology anatomical basis tremor remain poorly understood . One particular theory essential tremor , olivary hypothesis , gain support various study . These study point olivary nucleus possible central rhythm generator . Cells olivary nucleus show spontaneous rhythmic discharge suppress alcohol . Since alcohol know suppress tremor patient essential tremor , one theorize effect olivary nucleus ; , inferior olive generator tremor . Given assumption , intend study effect alcohol three different kind tremor : 8-12 Hz component physiological tremor , symptomatic palatal tremor essential palatal tremor . Our hypothesis central generator type tremor lie inferior olive ingestion alcohol reduce amplitude tremor , similar effect alcohol see essential tremor .</detailed_description>
