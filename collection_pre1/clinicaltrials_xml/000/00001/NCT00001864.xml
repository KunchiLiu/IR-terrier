	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare result two standard treatment amblyopia order find one effective . Amblyopia , develop childhood , also call `` lazy eye , '' one eye use properly . The brain favor eye reason , cross turn eye , vision weak eye reduce . Amblyopia treat force child use weak eye . There two way : 1 ) patch place `` good '' eye force child use weak eye ; 2 ) eye drop place `` good '' eye day blur vision eye make child rely weak eye . The success rate method report ; study try identify one effective . Children randomly assign computer one follow two treatment method : Patch The child initially wear patch `` good '' eye 8 12 hour every day . If vision weak eye improves , patch time decrease . If vision remain good 3 month , patch stop , unless child 's doctor believe treatment continue . If vision weak eye improve , patch time increase . Eye Drops The child give one drop per day atropine `` good '' eye . If vision weak eye improves , drop give less often . If vision remain good 3 month , drop stop , unless child 's doctor believe treatment continue . If initial daily drop improve vision weak eye , child 's eyeglass may change try blur vision `` good '' eye . After 6 month , treatment may stop successful . If treatment successful 6 month , may continue reduced amount stop . Follow-up visit schedule every 4 week first 6 month every 2 4 month end 2-year study . During visit eye examine eye movement vision , pupil dilate examine inside eye .</brief_summary>
