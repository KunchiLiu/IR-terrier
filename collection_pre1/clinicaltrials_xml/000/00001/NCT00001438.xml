	<detailed_description>Patients congenital acquired immunodeficiency increase risk develop polyclonal oligoclonal lymphoid malignancy . Some develop lymphoproliferative disorder follow clinically aggressive course may represent pre-malignant lesion . Although lymphoproliferative disorder B-cell origin , T-cell non-B-non-T-cell process also observe . The pathogenesis partially understood . The Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) think play important role human herpes virus type 6 ( HHV-6 ) implicate well . An imbalance expression several cytokine observe currently clear whether sustains aberrant proliferation result thereof . In case pre-malignant condition often difficult know whether therapeutic intervention necessary careful consideration potential treatment-associated morbidity indicate . Therapies range influence possible infectious etiology ( treat acyclovir ) , decrease amount immunosuppression ( transplant patient ) , use immunomodulatory agent , include interferon interleukin . Recent data indicate use differentiating agent , retinoids , might offer yet another treatment option . In current study try get good understand pathogenesis natural course lymphoproliferative disorder immunodeficient child . The study mainly open child infect human immunodeficiency virus patient develop lymphoproliferative disorder post-transplant part another immunodeficiency state may also enrol . The study two part : initial observation period obtain information natural course disorder , six month treatment period combination differentiate agent ( 13-cis-retinoic acid use all-trans-retinoic acid become available 7/96 ) immunomodulatory agent ( interferon-alpha2a , IFN-alpha2a ) .</detailed_description>
