	<brief_summary>The purpose investigation gain additional knowledge cause type 1 type 2 Usher syndrome-inherited disease cause balance problem impair hear vision-and develop well diagnostic test . Patients type 1 Usher syndrome usually deaf birth speech balance problem . Patients type 2 disease generally hear impaired balance problem . All patient develop eye problem cause difficulty see dark . The development newer sophisticated diagnostic test may detect subtle difference sign symptom allow accurate distinction two type Usher syndrome . This study use test classify syndrome eventually identify gene responsible . Study participants medical family history take family tree construct . They undergo thorough eye examination , include special test color vision , field vision , ability see dark . An electroretinogram do measure function cell retina , procedure call fluorescein angiography do look photograph blood vessel retina . Special hearing balance test also do . Hearing test include physical examination ear wear earphone listen tone . Balance coordination test require task walk straight line stand dark eye close . A caloric stimulation test also do , small amount water irrigate ear canal . For gene study , blood sample collect patient available family member .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Usher Syndromes , Type 1 Type 2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Usher Syndromes ( USH ) , characterize autosomal recessive inheritance , genotypically distinct disease share specific phenotypic characteristic . Affected individual congenital neurosensory hearing impairment variable severity progressive pigmentary retinal degeneration commonly refer retinitis pigmentosa . Interfamilial difference USH patient great intrafamilial difference investigator propose least two distinct phenotype type ; Usher Syndrome type 1 ( USH 1 ) Usher Syndrome type 2 ( USH 2 ) ( Fishman 1983 ) . Patients USH 1 profoundly deaf birth , unintelligible speech absent vestibular function . Nightblindness apparent 1st 2nd decade accompany extinguish electroretinogram ( ERG ) profound loss visual field . Patients USH 2 moderate severe hearing loss normal vestibular function . Nightblindness occur 2nd 3rd decade , variable field loss variable response ERG ( Fishman 1983 ) . Heterogeneity verify linkage study least three USH 1 locus two USH 2 locus know ( Kimberling et al 1990 ; Lewis et al 1990 ; Kaplan et al 1992 ; Smith et al 1992a . ) With increasingly sophisticated clinical testing , subtle difference may permit accurate distinction two USH phenotype . The purpose study classify accurately possible patient ' clinical feature careful audiologic , vestibular , psychophysical electrodiagnostic test correlate genetic mutation identify linkage study eventually gene ( genetic mutation ) become identify .</detailed_description>
