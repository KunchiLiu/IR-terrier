	<criteria>Children age 217 neutropenia ( absolute count less equal 5000/mm ( 3 ) ) one follow condition : leukemia lymphoma , exclude patient 's maintenance therapy ; bone marrow peripheral stem cell transplantation ; aplastic anemia ; myelodysplastic syndrome ; chemotherapy anticipate incur great 10 day neutropenia . Patients new onset fever neutropenia initiate onto broad spectrum empirical antibacterial therapy . Patients must sufficient venous access permit administration study drug , collection pharmacokinetic sample monitor safety variable . Concomitant therapy : Patients may receive continue receive antineoplastic therapy medication supportive care . Females childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test must agree use barrier method contraception throughout study . Informed consent patient , parent , legally authorize representative obtain prior entry . Verbal assent obtain minor capable understanding . No patient active proven deeply invasive fungal infection . No patient moderate severe liver disease , define : AST ALT great 2.5 time upper limit normal total bilirubin great 2.5 time upper limit normal . No patient receive intravenous amphotericin B formulation amphotericin B within 72 hour enter study require treatment systemic antifungal agent FK463 . Patients may continue receive fluconazole prophylactically ( 400mg/day 12mg/kg/day ) study . All systemic antifungal agent must discontinue prior first dose FK463 . No patient phase I trials investigational agent . No patient previously enrol study . No concomitant condition , opinion investigator , would preclude patient 's participation study .</criteria>
