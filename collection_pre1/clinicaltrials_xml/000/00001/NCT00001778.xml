	<brief_summary>Objective : Human T-lymphotropic virus type-I-associated myelopathy / tropical spastic paraparesis ( HAM/TSP ) rare neurologic disorder affect less 5 % patient infected HTLV-I virus . The purpose protocol study natural history HAM/TSP monitoring clinical progression patient longitudinally . Additionally , attempt define virological immunological change HAM/TSP . Study Population : Patients HAM/TSP fulfill World Health Organization diagnostic criterion eligible participate protocol . Asymptomatic seropositive individual individual indeterminate HTLV-1 serology also eligible participate . Design Outcome Measures : A longitudinal assessment clinical , virological immunological progression HAM/TSP accomplish periodic test evaluation . Asymptomatic seropositive individual , seroindeterminate HTLV-I serology normal volunteer may serve control . Longitudinal standardize neurological examination perform . Longitudinal sample serum , plasma , lymphocytes may obtain participant . Lumbar puncture may perform participant . These sample use virological immunological assay . A focus relationship characteristic viral infection , immune response , genetic makeup .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Participants meet one follow criterion : Test positive HTLV1 infection ( positive HTLV1 ELISA follow positive EIA Western blot ) Positive HTLVI ELISA Western Blot partially fulfill criterion ( seroindeterminate ) Have family member/significant HTLV1 positive , may expose virus Healthy volunteer AND Willingness participate protocol evaluation procedure . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Unwillingness inability participate protocol evaluation procedure . The presence medical , social , psychiatric condition opinion investigator may affect safety patient compliance protocol . Children age 18 exclude .</criteria>
