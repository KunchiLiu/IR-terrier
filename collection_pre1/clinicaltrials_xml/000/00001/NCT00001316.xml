	<brief_summary>Our laboratory previously demonstrate lymph node major reservoir human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) major site active virus replication infect individual ( 1-3 ) . There least 10 fold great viral burden per give number CD4+ T lymphocytes obtain lymph node versus peripheral blood infect individual . These data accumulate predominantly individual progressive generalize lymphadenopathy ( CDC Class A1 A2 ) . It unclear present whether pattern hold true category HIV infect individual . We propose seed lymph node HIV early course HIV infection persistent production virus lymph node throughout course infection major factor pathogenesis HIV virtually infected individual . In addition , likely selective perturbation various T cell subset ( i.e. , V-B class CD4+T cell ) observe peripheral blood much dramatic lymph node give great viral burden lymph node compare peripheral blood . In order investigate hypothesis , essential study simultaneously lymph nodes peripheral blood individual study different individual various stage disease early course infection ( CDC Class A ) advance disease ( CDC Class B C ) . If , suspect , active virus replication lymph node early course infection , even time little virus burden active replication peripheral blood , would justify anti-retroviral therapy early possible time course infection . In addition , certain patient initiate treatment anti-retroviral agent zidovudine didanosine private physician , would important know whether treatment actually reduce viral burden virus replication lymph node . The effect therapy viral burden replication compare lymph node versus peripheral blood mononuclear cell parameter compare level plasma viremia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Several year ago , others demonstrate lymph node major reservoir human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) major site active virus replication infect individual . Subsequent study group show virologic cross talk B cell CD4+ T cell occur within microenvironment lymphoid tissue ( LT ) , immunosuppressive CD25+CD4+ regulatory T ( Treg ) cell enrich LT . Furthermore , Treg cell isolated LT particularly effective suppress HIV-specific cytolytic activity . More recently , follicular helper ( Tfh ) CD4+ T cell describe LT find play important role provide help B cell germinal center reaction . These Tfh cell expand HIV-infected viremic individual number correlate frequency germinal center B cell , consistent longstanding observation HIV-induced GC hyperplasia untreated infected individual . Despite increased frequency Tfh GC B cell LT , also evidence reduce immune function due over-expression negative regulatory molecule . We currently investigate several issue relate impact HIV infection/replication immune competence home profile numerous cell type within LT . Given paucity Tfh GC B cell peripheral blood , study appropriately conduct tissue sample . We also pursue immunological , migrational virologic characteristic various cell type include B cell subsets CD4+ , CD8+ NK cell LT bone marrow ( BM ) tissue . In regard , BM site B-cell development know long-lived repository plasma cell responsible maintain humoral immunity . While HIV infection show impair hematopoiesis BM , relatively little known regard effect HIV infection plasma cell home back BM maturation .</detailed_description>
