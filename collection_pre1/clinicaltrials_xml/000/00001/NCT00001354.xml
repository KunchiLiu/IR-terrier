	<brief_summary>Certain patient participate NIH protocol involve interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) therapy HIV disease may request follow change addition study protocol : - 3-day subcutaneous ( sc ) IL-2 administration : Patients currently receive IL-2 intravenously ( injection vein ) may switch subcutaneous administration ( injection skin ) . Injections give twice day 3 5 day ( one treatment cycle ) , cycle repeat often every 8 week . - Home treatment sc IL-2 : Home administration IL-2 injection involve less frequent data safety monitoring medical evaluation Clinical Center except begin cycle . Participants receive IL-2 cycle schedule follow original protocol . They see Clinical Center regularly schedule follow-up visit cycle medical evaluation blood draw start cycle determine safety administer next cycle . During home cycle , patient 's case manager team member place monitor telephone call day 2 4 cycle week later . The timing number call may change depend finding ongoing assessment usefulness . Patients require notify study team promptly complication problem develop therapy . - Stored specimen HLA testing : Stored blood tissue sample patient used future research HIV , AIDS relate medical condition , immune system . The sample may label identify information , identify information , patient 's name , code study team link patient . Some blood drawn may use HLA typing , genetic test marker immune system . Usually used match bone marrow organ transplant , HLA type might also use try identify factor associate progression HIV disease related condition . Determining HLA type also necessary able perform certain research study . - Tonsillar biopsy : Examination tonsil tissue may provide information effect IL-2 immune system expression HIV . Patients randomize IL-2 study ( 93-CC-0113 ) may tonsillar biopsy do three times-soon enrollment , month 4 , month 12 . Patients open IL-2 study ( 91-CC-0143 ) would procedure often every 3 month , follow exception : patient either study willing repeat biopsy perform IL-2 therapy procedure do three time round IL-2 : Il-2 therapy , day 2-3 IL-2 therapy , day 4-6 IL-2 therapy , sequential biopsy safely perform . The area biopsied numbed local anesthetic 1 2 small piece tissue biopsied . - Skin biopsy : Examination skin tissue may help explain IL-2 cause change skin . Biopsies obtain area skin affect IL-2 well normal , unaffected area comparison . Patients Kaposi sarcoma also biopsies normal skin allow comparison IL-2-induced change Kaposi sarcoma lesion . The area biopsied numbed local anesthetic 2-mm ( 1/10th-inch ) piece skin biopsied site .</brief_summary>
