	<brief_summary>The purpose study see 7 drug , give high dos normal , safe tolerate young patient AIDS fail respond treatment . The study also see effect take several anti-HIV drug together high dos body 's ability fight HIV infection . The 7 drug give study stavudine ( d4T ) , didanosine ( ddI ) , lamivudine ( 3TC ) , nelfinavir ( NFV ) , ritonavir ( RTV ) , saquinavir ( SQV ) , nevirapine ( NVP ) . ( This study change 8-drug regimen 7-drug regimen . Patients longer receive drug hydroxyurea [ HU ] . ) Doctors see many HIV-positive child get good long-term result current anti-HIV drug . Some doctor believe anti-HIV drug fail drug level body low . In study , doctor give patient 7 drug , high dos normal . Since important patient study take drug , doctor make easy possible . Doctors want try child advance AIDS treatment choice .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Safety Effectiveness Treating Advanced AIDS Patients Between Ages 4 22 With 7 Drugs , Some Higher Than Usual Doses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinicians increasingly confront HIV-positive child fail available antiretroviral therapy viable treatment option . Virologic failure patient may result antiretroviral resistance , likely result poor adherence treatment regimen inadequate dose . This study design achieve adherence observation drug administration first 8 week study overcome resistance intensive , high-dose , multi-drug therapy . Treatment 4 drug study formally child , pediatrician care child AIDS use strategy study success . Dose intensification may also aid overcome resistance ; therefore , trial , d4T , 3TC , NFV administer twice standard dos . Given limited therapeutic option available HIV-positive child poor prognosis , high-dose , multi-drug therapy merit study . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 01/07/00 : Pancreatitis , may fatal case , occur therapy ddI . The risk pancreatitis may increase ddI use combination HU . ACTG A5025 , study d4T/ddI/HU arm , terminate significant toxicity concern relate HU-containing arm . Patients enrol ACTG P1007 may increase risk develop pancreatitis give advanced disease state use multiple drug include HU . The study amend address concern . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 12/19/01 : HU remove drug regimen . ] Patient enrollment stag allow study physician aggressively monitor patient sign toxicity . Initially , patient admit hospital clinical research center 2 week , initiate [ AS PER AMENDMENT 12/19/01 : `` 8-drug regimen '' replace `` 7-drug regimen '' ] undergo frequent physical exam blood test assess [ AS PER AMENDMENT 12/19/01 : glucose level ] , pharmacokinetics , virologic response , toxicity . If investigator identify important drug interaction require modification combination regimen , early regimen-terminating toxicity , trial halt address concern . After 2 week , patient discharge return home . Study personnel visit patient 's house twice day 6 week observe drug administration , patient continue receive regular physical exam blood test . At end Week 24 , patient plasma RNA level 10,000 copies/ml less offer opportunity continue regimen Week 48 . Patients plasma RNA level 10,000 copies/ml Week 24 patient experience virologic rebound Week 24 take study unless patient 's family investigator feel best interest child remain study . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 12/19/01 : The 2-week hospital GCRC stay longer require . A 2-day stay hospital GCRC purpose drug regimen train recommend , mandatory . Study personnel visit patient day 6 week agree upon location phone contact .</detailed_description>
