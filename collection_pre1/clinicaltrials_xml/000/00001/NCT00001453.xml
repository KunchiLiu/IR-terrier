	<brief_summary>Patients Cushing disease hormone produce tumor pituitary gland . Often tumors small detect magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . The inferior petrosal sinuses small vein drain blood pituitary gland . By take small sample blood sinus , doctor differentiate small tumor pituitary gland tumor body produce hormone . Patients Cushing disease high level hormone ACTH petrosal sinus . Patients cause Cushing syndrome increase level ACTH petrosal sinus . The procedure collect blood petrosal sinus call Inferior Petrosal Sinus Sampling ( IPSS ) . The technique sensitive tell difference pituitary tumor cause Cushing syndrome nearly 100 % time . However , IPSS difficult perform available hospital . Therefore , researcher look another possible way diagnose Cushing syndrome would less technically difficult readily available patient . ACTH produce pituitary gland response production Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone ( CRH ) brain ( hypothalamus ) . This study compare ACTH level internal jugular vein CRH stimulation obtain conventional IPSS patient Cushing 's syndrome . Obtaining blood jugular vein simple , practically risk free procedure could do easily community hospital patient basis . Researchers believe CRH stimulation increase ACTH production tumor pituitary gland ( corticotroph adenoma ) diagnostic information jugular venous sample would equivalent IPSS . This proposal develop jugular venous sampling ( JVS ) CRH stimulation test differential diagnosis Cushing Syndrome would potentially contribute greatly medical care patient Cushing syndrome , less costly , safer widely available alternative IPSS. &lt; TAB &gt;</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sampling inferior petrosal sinuses ACTH level differentiate Cushing disease ectopic ACTH syndrome nearly patient . Patients corticotroph tumor petrosal-to-peripheral ACTH gradient 2 , patient cause Cushing syndrome low gradient . Bilateral petrosal sinus sample also often provide useful information lateralization adenoma neurosurgeon . The widespread application inferior petrosal sinus sample limited concern potential complication technical failure hand less experienced radiologist . In protocol , compare ACTH level internal jugular vein CRH stimulation obtain conventional inferior petrosal sinus sample patient Cushing 's syndrome . Obtaining blood jugular vein simple , practically risk-free procedure could accomplish easily community hospital outpatient basis . We hypothesize corticotropin-releasing hormone ( CRH ) stimulation increase ACTH production corticotroph adenomas diagnostic information jugular venous sample would equivalent obtain catheterization petrosal sinus . Currently few ten center United States sufficient technical expertise inferior petrosal sinus sampling ( IPSS ) ensure reliable result . This proposal develop jugular venous sampling ( JVS ) CRH stimulation test differential diagnosis Cushing syndrome would potentially contribute greatly medical care patient Cushing syndrome , less costly , safer widely available alternative inferior petrosal sinus sample . Initial data 35 patient undergoing JVS IPSS reveal technical problem either procedure . IPSS correctly identify 28/31 patient Cushing disease , JVS correctly identify 23 patient use conventional criterion ( petrosal : peripheral great 2 3 CRH administration ) . Thus , JVS may useful initial procedure institution IPSS available . However , since likely jugular : peripheral ratio low patient ectopic ACTH secretion ( far , 1.2 - 2.04 ) , protocol evaluates also performance JVS patient ectopic ACTH secretion determine whether criterion interpretation JVS different use IPSS .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients follow characteristic may include protocol : Age 1875 year . Evidence Cushing syndrome . Evidence suggest overactivity hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis , increase urinary excretion glucocorticoid lack suppressibility low dose dexamethasone conjunction clinical feature , seek prior admission . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients exclude entry protocol : A clearcut pituitary tumor present T1weighted conventional pituitary MR scan . There contraindication catheterization . Patients know reaction contrast material exclude elective study strong history previous contrast medium reaction study safely give medical prophylaxis procedure . The patient pregnant . Combined blood withdrawal six week precede study exceed 450 ml , hematocrit entry le 33 % . Because increase risk morbidity cause contrast dyes patient renal dysfunction , patient creatinine great 1.3 mg/dl exclude . Patients diastolic blood pressure persistently great 100 mm Hg ( without medication ) exclude sampling procedure . They radiation exposure previous year represent significant additive risk combination expect dose protocol . Patients doctor question exposure radiation accept protocol . For questionnaire , patient speak read English exclude . This instrument validate nonEnglish speaker .</criteria>
