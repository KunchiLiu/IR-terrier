	<brief_summary>Glycogen , storage form glucose . It usually form sugar store liver . When tissue , muscle , need glucose fuel store glycogen convert glucose help enzyme produce body . Glycogen storage disease ( GSD ) refers group condition characterize abnormal storage glycogen due absence particular enzyme need process store use glycogen . This study address relate metabolic abnormality glycogen storage disease ( GSD ) . As patient disorder glycogen metabolism follow becomes apparent condition much complex initially think . Researchers believe patient suffer glycogen storage disorder follow monitored heritable metabolic disorder . This study attempt determine frequency associate disorder patient GSD . In addition , study look current management patient see prognosis course disease change .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study address relate metabolic abnormality glycogeneses . As old individual glycogen storage disease follow study , become apparent individual glycogenosis view longitudinal perspective , condition much complex diverse relate condition one would reason believe , even hindsight . It relevant follow individual , search abnormality glycogen storage disease mind , also heritable metabolic disorder , include cystinosis cystic fibrosis , reflect accumulation associate disorder age often apparent direct association GSD .</detailed_description>
