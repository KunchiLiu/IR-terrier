	<brief_summary>The drug rhIGF-1 ( CEP-151 ) show play key role preclinically oligodendrocyte differentiation survival , well , myelin integrity function . Moreover , animal model MS , myelin expression , well receptor upregulated time myelin sheaths regenerate . Finally , administration exogenous rhIGF-1 rat EAE effectively , close disrupt BBB , reduce number severity demyelinate lesion , improve neurological function . Thus seem reasonable examine efficacy safety , tolerability , effect CEP-151 brain MRI lesions patient MS .</brief_summary>
