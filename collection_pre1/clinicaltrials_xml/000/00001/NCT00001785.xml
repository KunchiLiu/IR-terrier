	<brief_summary>HTLV stand human T cell leukemia virus . HTLV-1 virus attack specific kind white blood cell call T cell . T cell part natural defense system body . HTLV-1 associate leukemia lymphoma . In addition , approximately 1 % patient infected HTLV-1 develop condition know HTLV-1 associate myelopathy ( HAM ) / tropical spastic paraparesis ( TSP ) . Currently clearly define , effective treatment patient HAM/TSP . Steroids use therapy able provide temporary relief symptom . Human interferon small protein release different kind cell body . Interferon known antiviral immunological effect use treat hepatitis multiple sclerosis . Interferon Beta release cell call fibroblast . These cell play role production connective tissue . The purpose study evaluate possible role recombinant interferon beta ( Avonex ) treatment HAM/TSP . The study break three phase , pre-treatment phase , treatment phase , post-treatment phase . The total duration study 44 week . Patients participate study receive injection Avonex 1 2 time week . Throughout study patient regularly submit blood sample undergo diagnostic test MRI measure somatosensory evoked potential .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HTLV-1 link chronic , slowly progressive neurologic condition term HTLV-1 associate spastic paraparesis tropical spastic paraparesis ( HAM/TSP ) affect 1 % infected individual . The disease think due T cell viral induce immunopathological process . A high frequency HTLV-1 specific CD8 T cell find patient HAM/TSP . The immune system patient infect HTLV-1 appear dysregulated , increase spontaneous T cell proliferation demonstrate vitro . This part due continuous antigenic stimulation due transactivation HTLV-1 encode Tax protein host immunomodulatory gene CD80 , CD86 , IL-2 receptor . In addition , increase viral load demonstrate symptomatic individual compare asymptomatic HTLV-1 carrier . It think local immune response virus within central nervous system play role pathogenesis progressive spastic encephalomyeloneuropathy HAM/TSP . Therefore , reduction spontaneous T cell proliferation viral replication , well decrease compromise blood brain barrier may ameliorate immune-mediated component process lead inflammatory destruction nervous tissue HAM/TSP . Currently clearly define , effective treatment patient HAM/TSP . Corticosteroids mainstay therapy provide mostly transient symptomatic relief . Treatment human interferon show improve acute chronic hepatitis anti-viral cytostatic effect . Further , patient relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis , disease think least part T cell mediate , immunopathological process , exhibit marked reduction frequency new lesion formation medication . This latter effect may part explain anti-inflammatory effect interferon allow repair blood brain barrier . To evaluate possible role interferon beta treatment HAM/TSP , study effect induction regulatory factor spontaneous vitro proliferation peripheral blood lymphocyte ( PBLs ) HTLV-I infected individual . Recombinant interferon beta-1b inhibit spontaneous proliferation PBLs asymptomatic HTLV-1 carrier patient HAM/TSP dose dependent manner induced expression interferon regulatory factor-2 associate regulation proinflammatory cytokine interferon gamma . These preliminary result indicate treatment interferon-b may ameliorate immune dysregulation induce HTLV-1 may therapeutic effect treatment HAM/TSP . Twelve patient treat administration recombinant human interferon-beta1a . Assessment efficacy base reduction spontaneous proliferation proviral load . As secondary measure clinical response patient evaluate . The study entail 8-week pretreatment period , 28-week treatment phase escalation interferon-beta1a dose , 12-week post-treatment phase . In case dose escalation lead intolerable side-effects , patient continue high tolerate dose medication . Spontaneous proliferation , viral load , clinical parameter determine monthly .</detailed_description>
