	<brief_summary>The primary goal Phase I/II study ass immune response safety recombinant human CD40 ligand ( rhuCD40L ) patient X-linked hyper IgM syndrome ( XHIM ) . XHIM rare genetic disease cause mutation gene encode CD40 ligand . Individuals syndrome fail make gamma immune globulin , frequently suffer opportunistic infection , increase risk develop cancer . Despite treatment gamma globulin replacement therapy , expect survival patient XHIM le 20 percent age 25 . In mouse model syndrome , treatment man-made CD40 ligand protein protect mouse opportunistic infection , restore mouse 's ability make gamma globulin , improve survival . We want determine similar approach work human XHIM . The study conduct Clinical Center National Institutes Health Bethesda , Maryland . For patient , rhuCD40L administer injection skin period six month follow-up exam require 2-month interval additional 6 month . During study , patient maintain intravenous gamma globulin , antibiotic protect opportunistic infection , , need , growth factor control neutropenia . The immune response rhuCD40Lwill measure routine method measure patient 's ability synthesize gamma globulin challenge immunization keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( KLH ) Bacteriophage Phi-X 174 ( Phi-X 174 ) . Our long-term goal define therapeutic regimen provide effective immunological reconstitution patient XHIM improve life expectancy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Immune Responses Safety Recombinant Human CD40 Ligand Patients With X-Linked Hyper-IgM Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose Phase I/II study evaluate clinical response safety follow administration recombinant human CD40 ligand ( rhuCD40L ) 5 patient X-linked hyper IgM syndrome ( XHIM ) . XHIM rare genetic disease cause mutation gene encode CD40 ligand ( CD154 ) characterize hypogammaglobulinemia , opportunistic infection , increase risk neoplastic disease . Despite treatment intravenous gamma globulin , expect survival patient XHIM le 20 % age 25 . The propose protocol proof principle study design determine administration rhuCD40L reverse core immunologic defect patient XHIM . To end , immunize patient neo antigen , specifically keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( KLH ) Bacteriophage Phi-X 174 ( PhiX174 ) evaluate antigen-specific B T cell response . Clinical response toxicity evaluate use routine hematological clinical evaluation , quantitation KLH PhiX174 specific IgG serum , measurement proliferation cytokine production KLH simulation vitro , FACS analysis quantitate memory B T cell . Our long-term goal define therapeutic regimen provide effective immunological reconstitution patient XHIM improve life expectancy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All patient must diagnosis Xlinked hyper IgM syndrome confirm either molecular analysis CD40L gene flow cytometry analysis demonstrate failure CD40L expression activate T cell , and/or clear Xlinked inheritance ( multiple affect male ) association defective CD40L expression . Age great equal 4 year Patient parent ( child age 18 ) must able understand sign inform consent . Life expectancy great 6 month . Average ANC great 250 cells/microL measure 3 day week prior plan administration rhuCD40L . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Serious ongoing opportunistic infection . Use immunebased therapy IVIG corticosteroid ( dose prednisone great 0.4 mg/kg/d 4 week within 6 month prior enrol study use corticosteroid equivalent great equal 5 mg prednisone time enrollment ) immunomodulating drug within 6 month prior enrollment study . Current use investigational drug . Chronic liver disease confound medical illness judgement investigator would pose added risk study participant ( e.g . cancer , severe allergy , chronic renal pulmonary disease ) . SGOT , SGPT great 2 time normal range ; creatinine great 2.0 time normal ANC le 250/microL ; Platelets le 50,000/microL ; Hematocrit less 25</criteria>
