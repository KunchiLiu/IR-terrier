	<brief_summary>Severe Aplastic Anemia ( SAA ) rare serious blood disorder bone marrow stop produce cell make blood ; red blood cell , white blood cell , platelet . Researchers believe cause autoimmune reaction , condition natural defense system body begin attack . In SAA immune system begin attack bone marrow . Red blood cell responsible carry oxygen organ system body , low number ( anemia ) cause difficulty breathe fatigue . Platelets responsible normal blood clot low number result easy bruising bleed deadly . White blood cell responsible fight infection , low number lead frequent infection , common cause death patient aplastic anemia . SAA treat bone marrow transplant ( BMT ) drug design slow immune system ( immunosuppressant ) . BMT successful , require donor match bone marrow , make therapy available patient . BMT unmatched bone marrow fail cause dangerous side effect . Presently , two drug use treat SAA slow immune system ( immunosuppression ) antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ) cyclosporin A ( CSA ) . When use combination two drug improve patient condition . However , one third patient respond therapy experience relapse SAA . In addition , patient treat ATG/CSA later develop disorder blood . Recently , researcher find another immunosuppressive drug call cyclophosphamide , successful treat patient SAA . In addition , patient treat cyclophosphamide experience relapse develop disorder blood . In study researcher would like compare combination antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ) cyclosporin A ( CSA ) cyclophosphamide cyclosporin A ( CSA ) treatment SAA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Therapies Treatment Severe Aplastic Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe aplastic anemia ( SAA ) disorder poor prognosis untreated . Current accept therapeutic strategy include bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) immunosuppression , offer cure amelioration majority patient . Although BMT successful use human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) match sibling bone marrow , 25 % probability find HLA identical sibling within family render approach available minority patient . BMT utilizing HLA-matched , unrelated donor carry high risk treatment failure along considerable toxicity . While combined immunosuppression antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ) cyclosporine A ( CSA ) produce hematologic improvement patient , relapse common , occur third responder . Late evolution aplastic anemia serious hematologic disorder significant problem follow successful treatment ATG/CSA paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ( PNH ) occur approximately 13 % , myelodysplasia 10 % , acute leukemia 7 % . Recently , result immunosuppression SAA another potent immunosuppressive agent , cyclophosphamide , report 10 patient . In small group , overall response rate similar see ATG/CSA , relapse late clonal disease see median follow-up great 10 year . In large randomized trial propose , compare sustain hematologic response rate either conventional immunosuppression ATG/CSA high dose cyclophosphamide CSA . Secondary endpoint include response duration , event free survival , overall survival .</detailed_description>
