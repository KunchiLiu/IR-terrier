	<brief_summary>This study monitor long-term effect gene therapy patient severe combine immunodeficiency disease ( SCID ) due deficiency enzyme call adenosine deaminase ( ADA ) . It also follow course disease child receive gene therapy , may receive enzyme replacement therapy drug PEG-ADA . ADA essential growth proper function infection-fighting white blood cell call T B lymphocytes . Patients lack enzyme , therefore , immune deficient vulnerable frequent infection . Injections PEG-ADA may increase number immune cell reduce infection , enzyme replacement therapy definitive cure . In addition , patient may become resistant allergic drug . Gene therapy , normal ADA gene insert patient 's cell , attempt correct underlying cause disease . Patients SCID due ADA deficiency may eligible study . Patients may may receive enzyme replacement therapy gene transfer therapy , . Participants follow-up visit National Institutes Health Bethesda , Maryland , least year physical examination , blood test , possibly follow additional procedure evaluate immune function : 1 . Bone marrow sample - A small amount marrow hip bone drawn ( aspirate ) needle . The procedure do local anesthesia light sedation . 2 . Injection small amount fluid arm study patient 's lymphocyte respond normally . 3 . Administration vaccination shot . 4 . Collection white blood cell apheresis - Whole blood collect needle place arm vein . The blood circulates machine separate component . The white cell remove , red cell , platelet plasma return body , either needle use draw blood second needle place arm . 5 . Blood drawing obtain study patient 's lymphocyte .</brief_summary>
