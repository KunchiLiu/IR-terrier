	<brief_summary>Children extreme short stature ( height ) family often experience significant psychological stress relate concern adult height . In addition , short stature often result life-long emotional , social , physical obstacle affect person . Normal growth occur two phase . The first phase , know childhood growth , occur age 10 . The second phase growth , teen-age adolescent growth , begin age 10 15 . In addition , puberty mark time bone 's growth plate ( epiphysis ) begin close , initiate completion linear growth ( height ) . Some child suffer condition call precocious puberty , mean puberty begin young age normal . The development medication know synthetic LHRH analog provide method delay puberty treat patient . LHRHa ( deslorelin ) hormone create act like naturally occur LHRH . It use patient 's diagnose precocious ( early onset ) puberty . The drug able regress patient 's clinical sign puberty , decrease level adult sex hormone produce , slow rate bone aging .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone Analog ( LHRHa ) Pubertal Patients With Extreme Short Stature</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children extreme short stature family frequently experience significant psychological stress relate concern adult height . Additionally , extreme short stature often present life-long emotional , social , physical obstacle affect individual . The onset puberty patient present critical management problem puberty initiate process epiphyseal closure terminates linear growth . Until recently , way delay onset puberty patient . The development synthetic LHRH analog , however , provide method . Administration analogs child precocious puberty cause regression clinical sign puberty , decrease gonadotropin sex steroid , slow rate bone age advancement . We propose treat pubertal child extreme short stature long-acting analog luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( D-Trp6-Pro9-NEt-LHRHa ) . The goal LHRHa treatment child halt normal progression puberty thereby delay epiphyseal fusion . We postulate delay puberty prolong pre-pubertal growth prior pubertal spurt subsequent epiphyseal fusion , thus enhance ultimate height . This study test hypothesis double-blind , randomize comparison effect LHRHa placebo final adult height . Patients treat LHRHa placebo 4 year , follow complete puberty stop grow .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients extreme short stature qualify inclusion protocol meet follow criterion : Age 9 15.99 year start treatment . Tanner IIV pubertal development . Height least 2.25 S.D . median chronologic age time pubertal onset , predict adult height least 2.25 S.D . median adult height . The height criterion must meet study entry , necessarily actual date patient start take protocol injection advance puberty may cause increase height velocity temporarily increase height standard deviation score . Unfused carpal phalangeal epiphyses bone age xray .</criteria>
