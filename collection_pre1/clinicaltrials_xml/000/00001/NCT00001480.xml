	<detailed_description>The temporal origin Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) marker progression disease process relatively obscure . Despite outstanding advance understand underlying biology AD , clinical diagnosis still make consensus follow progressive cognitive deterioration confirm autopsy . The protocol serve two function . First , evaluate longitudinally follow cohort first-degree relative AD subject currently normal increase risk develop AD sometime future . This cohort compare group normal control along multiple behavioral , cognitive , motor function , genetic biologic parameter period year . While differential rate conversion AD might eventually expect base family history fix variable ( i.e. , APO E status ) , study power simply study conversion AD . Rather , study biomarker change time distinct cohort people increase risk develop AD . Conversion clinical diagnosis AD one variable ; others include cognitive testing , neuroimaging , genetic marker , assessment functional capacity cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) measure may ultimately function disease surrogate . As part risk cohort , recruit longitudinally follow series pre-symptomatic symptomatic subject know genetic mutation ( presenilin 1 , presenilin 2 , APP ) . Second , follow large cohort dementia subject diagnosis either AD relate dementia . The purpose second part follow-up study identify track biologic change occur progressive illness , furthermore , relate change know cognitive emotional disturbance characterize AD . By longitudinally follow separate cohort normal control without family history AD , normal control family history AD , subject mild cognitive impairment diagnose dementia subject , hope track spectrum AD clinical biologic origin . As result , study diagnostic screening protocol natural history protocol . It address series important clinical biological question among wide range normal diseased individual serve basis development biologic marker AD could use diagnostic therapeutic purpose future . A long-term goal protocol identify marker eventually individual people increase risk develop AD typical cognitive change AD become manifest . In pursuit goal , also carefully monitor evaluate clinical medication take subject see influence course AD .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA : DEMENTIA PATIENTS : Dementia Alzheimer type define gradual onset continue cognitive decline due central nervous system condition cause progressive deficit memory . The cognitive decline must include memory impairment must also accompany least one cognitive disturbance aphasia , apraxia , agnosia , disturbance executive functioning . The deficit must cause significant impairment social occupational performance represent decline function . Longitudinal subject exclude specific aspect study contraindication procedure involve specified Hazards Precautions section . Furthermore , subject exclude able willing assign durable power attorney ( DPA ) appropriate person . MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT ( MCI ) : Is define operationally evidence cognitive difficulty , include memory problem significant generate worry individual surround family member yet sufficient elicit diagnosis possible Alzheimer 's disease evaluate physician . As Alzheimer 's Disease Cooperative Study , subject memory complaint least one abnormal memory function , still fall within normal limit globally . AT RISK INDIVIDUALS : At risk individual define one follow criterion : ( ) presumptive diagnosis AD one firstdegree relatives ; ( b ) belong family know presumed genetic mutation AD ; ( c ) test within normal range battery cognitive test time baseline evaluation . NORMAL CONTROLS : They positive family history dementia firstdegree relative , test within normal range battery cognitive test list previously .</criteria>
