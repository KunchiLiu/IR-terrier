	<brief_summary>Every cell human body contain hundred thousand gene protein make gene . Sometimes change take place gene protein may make cell likely develop cancer . An experimental protein profile test find change may able provide information whose cancer stay remission whose return . Volunteer patient whose epithelial ovarian cancer remission eligible study . Specimens collect blood , saliva , urine first protein profile test . Sample set protein profile test collect follow-up visit 1 month 3 month later every 3 month afterward . If cancer return , additional sample set obtain biopsy relapse tumor take protein profile test review function structure disease ( pathology review ) . The protein profile sample compare sample already collect detect protein pattern change . The amount lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA ) blood , sign ovarian cancer , also measure see LPA useful detect return ovarian cancer . If patient get fluid stomach chest , test cancer cell proteins make tumor . If physical exam CT scan indicate possible return cancer , biopsy perform sample saved protein profile .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Protein Profile Test Ovarian Cancer Patients Remission See Protein Changes Can Predict Relapse ( Predictive Cancer Relapse )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over 80 percent advance stage epithelial cancer patient relapse attain first clinical remission standard platinum/paclitaxel-based chemotherapy . Surrogate biomarkers need evaluation efficacy treatment use predictor disease screen relapse diagnosis . CA-125 , exist ovarian cancer marker , become elevated relapse 80 percent patient increase initial diagnosis . Elevation CA-125 may precede clinical evidence relapse much 6 - 10 month lag behind clinical relapse time interval , make less satisfactory clinical tool . Emerging proteomic technology allow scan cellular protein simple , short , reproducible , quantitative chemical assay . We hypothesize change patient protein pattern detectable reliably associate relapse . This protocol pilot study ability ascertain evaluate sample ovarian cancer patient follow first clinical remission , investigate whether analysis sequential protein fingerprint yield reproducible pattern change may associate relapse .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA All patient first clinical remission treatment FIGO stage III/IV primary peritoneal , fallopian tube , epithelial ovarian carcinoma stage IIC clear cell histology epithelial ovarian cancer define : normal CA125 , normal physical exam , normal post hysterectomy pelvic examination , evidence disease CT scan noninvasive reassessment . Entry within 9 week completion final cycle chemotherapy ( within 12 week last administration chemotherapy ) . S/P completion primary therapy standard platinum/paclitaxel carboplatin/paclitaxelcontaining chemotherapy confirm clinical complete response . At least one block primary tumor must receive . ( If available , sample frozen primary tumor also forward ) . ECOG performance status 0 , 1 , 2 . EXCLUSION CRITERIA Patients nonepithelial ovarian cancer , mixed epithelial/nonepithelial ovarian cancer . Patients may receive chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , alternative therapy , radiation therapy . No therapy kind allow patient onstudy . Replacement hormonal therapy allow .</criteria>
