	<brief_summary>This study use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) look brain activity patient view picture people 's face familiar emotional attachment . The functional MRI ( fMRI ) procedure allow researcher `` see brain work . '' It use powerful magnetic field weak electromagnetic radiation ( radiowaves ) standard structural MRI . However , functional MRI also show area increase blood flow , relate increased activity brain cell . This research study build previous study identify specific area brain activate visual stimulus show face . However , previous research use anonymous face stimuli . This study use face individual know patient . There three experiment conduct study ; 1 . Experiment 1 attempt determine effect familiarity photograph face brain activity pattern . Patients view familiar face , face close friend relative , face famous people . 2 . Experiment 2 look maternal attachment affect response visual stimulus . Mothers view picture first bear child , well familiar child relate , unfamiliar child , unfamiliar adult . 3 . Experiment 3 explore effect interpersonal attachment loss response visual stimulus . In experiment , bereave spouse view picture decease spouse , live family member , unfamiliar people .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This functional magnetic resonance imaging protocol use face recognition activation task ascertain brain activation pattern differ depend subject 's familiarity , emotional attachment , person depict visual stimulus . In series study , subject view unfamiliar familiar ( include personally familiar famous ) face ; mother view picture child familiar unfamiliar child ; bereave non-bereaved spouse view picture spouse , family member , unfamiliar people . The use emotionally significant face activation stimulus may help elucidate neural circuitry underlie interpersonal attachment psychological response loss .</detailed_description>
