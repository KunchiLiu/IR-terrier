	<brief_summary>This single arm study . The tumor specimen analyze presence fusion protein correspond available peptide . Patients undergo T cell harvest 10 day initial prim peptide-pulsed antigen present cell ( APC ) vaccine perform . Fresh APCs utilized initial prim vaccination . All subsequent vaccination use cryopreserved APCs . Minimum number APCs administer per vaccination 100,000/kg maximum 100,000,000/kg . Patients undergo cytoreductive therapy treatment particular malignancy . This therapy usually consist multiagent chemotherapy context separate protocol . Following chemotherapy , infusion harvest T cell follow infusion peptide-pulsed APC vaccination occur every 6 week total 3 post-priming vaccination . Influenza vaccine administer intramuscular injection concurrent peptide-pulsed APC vaccine . Interleukin -2 ( IL-2 ) administer continuous intravenous ( IV ) infusion 4 days/week 3 successive week start day T cell /peptide-pulsed infusion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Autologous T-Cell Transplantation With Vaccine Driven Expansion Anti-Tumor Effectors After Cytoreductive Therapy Metastatic Pediatric Sarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eradication low tumor burden occur vivo T-cell mediate response generate specific tumor antigen . The Ewing 's sarcoma family tumor ( ESFT ) alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma ( AR ) display several feature make candidate disease trial immunotherapy . First , intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy generally able eradicate bulk disease patient metastatic disease , tumor relapse eventually occur nearly patient . Second , tumor-specific chromosomal translocation result production novel fusion protein identify great majority tumor . Peptides derive fusion protein show function tumor antigens cytolytic T cell animal study . Third , study immune reconstitution intensive cytotoxic therapy provide evidence antigen-specific T cell generate vivo adoptive transfer peripheral T cell antigen provide period T cell regeneration . This process augment murine model use human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) active protease inhibitor , indinavir , potentially inhibition program cell death expand T cell . Merging concept , protocol attempt eradicate minimal residual disease pediatric patient metastatic ESFT AR via vaccination tumor-specific peptide undertaken concomitant autologous T cell transplantation indinavir .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients fusion protein bearing , metastatic malignancy follow histologic subtypes eligible evaluation treatment protocol : alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma ( AR ) , Ewing 's sarcoma family tumor ( ESFT ) include classical , atypical extraosseous Ewing 's sarcoma , peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor , peripheral neuroepithelioma , primitive sarcoma bone , ectomesenchymoma . Eligibility confirm presence tumorspecific fusion protein document reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RTPCR ) correspond one tumorspecific peptides available vaccination . Patients Stage IV metastatic disease eligible enrol study time initial presentation tumor , prior cytoreductive therapy . Alternatively , patient recurrent disease , remotely treat ( complete antineoplastic therapy great equal one year prior enrollment patient great 5 year age , complete antineoplastic therapy great 6 month prior enrollment patient less equal 5 year age ) , also eligible enrollment prior subsequent cytoreductive therapy . Patients receive cytoreductive therapy Stage IV metastatic disease may enrol time completion cytoreductive therapy apheresis specimen available collect processed prior cytotoxic therapy accord guideline describe protocol Section 3.2.2 . Such product obtain apheresis Clinical Center , National Institutes Health ( NIH ) , informed consent administer per protocol 98C37 , 97C0050 describe standard government request form 2626 invasive procedure . Patients must less equal 35 year time initial diagnosis alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma ESFT , weight great 10 kg time apheresis . Patients 1015 kg must approve apheresis unit Department Transfusion Medicine ( DTM ) prior enrollment protocol . All patient legal guardian must give write informed consent indicate understanding investigational nature risk study . Patients must adequate renal function ( serum creatinine ( Cr ) less 1.5 mg/dl creatinine clearance ( Cr Cl ) , great 60 ml/min./1.73 m^2 liver function ( transaminases less 3 time normal , bilirubin less 2.0 mg/dl ) . Patients exclude base upon abnormal hepatic function relate hepatic involvement tumor . For remotely treated patient , CD4 count great equal 400 cells/mm^3 require . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Women pregnant lactating . Patients human immunodeficiency virus infection due confound effect immune function . Patients hepatitis B hepatitis C infection exclude due untoward risk personnel work blood specimen . Patients require daily oral corticosteroid therapy underlie disease exclude . Topical inhale corticosteroid permit . Patients allergic egg , egg product , thimerosal , history GuillainBarre syndrome may enrol study ineligible receive influenza vaccine .</criteria>
