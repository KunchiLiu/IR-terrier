	<brief_summary>A heart condition call hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) cause abnormal thicken heart muscle , obstruct flow blood heart . The thickened muscle obstruction blood flow believe cause chest discomfort , breathlessness , fainting , sensation heart pound . Treatment option child HCM include medicine , heart operation , cardiac transplantation . However , evidence medicine prevents thicken heart muscle ; operation carry risk death ; donor heart always available . Several study show pacemaker treatment reduce obstruction improves heart complaints patient HCM . This study investigate efficacy pacemaker treatment child . Patients exercise test treatment beta blocker verapamil eligible study heart complaint reduce exercise performance continue . A pacemaker treat slow heart rhythm insert . The patient sedate local anesthesia administer numb area . The procedure take hour . The study last two year . Patients place one two pacemaker program first year another second year . At 3- 6-month follow-up visit , pacemaker check echocardiogram perform . After 1 year , patient admit NIH 2 3 day exercise test , echocardiogram , cardiac catheterization . Also , pacemaker change second program . At 15- 18-month follow-up visit , pacemaker check echocardiogram perform . After 2 year , patient admit 2 3 day exercise test , echocardiogram , cardiac catheterization . A pregnancy test give female child-bearing age cardiac catheterization electrophysiology study . At end study , pacemaker set program work well . Risks pacemaker insertion include lung collapse , infection , blood vessel damage , bleeding , heart attack , death . Risks cardiac catheterization include infection , bleeding , blood clot , abnormal heart rhythm , perforation heart , need surgery , death . However , safety record procedures NIH excellent . The radiation exposure exceed NIH radiation guideline child , exposure adult associate definite adverse effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Studies suggest DDD pacemaker therapy effective improving symptom reduce intra-ventricular pressure pressure gradient child obstructive HCM period rapid body growth severity disease expect worsen . We propose randomize , cross-over study DDD pace versus placebo ( AAI pace mode ) child limited exercise performance and/or symptom despite medical therapy ( beta-blocker verapamil ) . Study subject receive pacemaker randomize one two pace mode ( DDD , AAI ) . After 1-year follow-up evaluation child cross-over alternative pacing mode , re-evaluated year . All child continue receive optimum medical therapy ( beta-blocker verapamil ) base improvement symptom exercise performance . The subject undergo outpatient evaluation ( exercise test echocardiography ) 3 , 6 , 15 , 18 month pacemaker implantation , inpatient evaluation ( exercise test , echocardiography , cardiac catheterization ) 1 year 2 year entry study . Primary end-points exercise duration severity LV outflow obstruction . The patient , parent , refer physician , individual supervising exercise test blind pace mode .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Children either gender , age 4 18 year . Obstructive HCM define LV hypertrophy , LV intracavitary pressure gradient measure cardiac catheterization great equal 30 mm Hg rest great equal 50 mm Hg follow isoproterenol infusion heart rate great equal 100 beat per minute . Cardiac symptom ( chest discomfort , dyspnea , lightheadedness presyncope , syncope , cardiorespiratory arrest , palpitation , excessive fatigue ) ; and/or exercise duration le 10th percentile predict age/gender despite trial betablocker therapy trial verapamil therapy . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Other systemic disease prevent assessment exercise test cardiac catheterization . Chronic atrial fibrillation . Positive pregnancy test : A negative urine pregnancy test require cardiac catheterization , electrophysiologic study thallium study . Pregnant lactate subject may participate study due potential teratogenic effect radiation .</criteria>
