	<brief_summary>The purpose study see give anti-HIV drug nevirapine ( NVP ) HIV-positive pregnant woman infant help reduce chance mother give HIV baby delivery . NVP promising medication block HIV transmission HIV-positive mother infant . NVP inexpensive easily absorbed mother transfer infant .

	<brief_title>A Study Nevirapine Prevent HIV Transmission From Mothers Their Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NVP several property make attractive candidate antiretroviral therapy interrupt HIV-1 transmission intrapartum early postpartum period . The pharmacokinetic profile suggest NVP would rapidly absorb mother transfer infant utero give labor delivery . The HIV-1 antiviral activity rapid significant reduction plasma virus occur within day drug administration . In addition , NVP show penetrate cell-free virion inactivate virion-associated reverse transcriptase ( RT ) situ . This property would potentially useful inactivate cell-free virion genital tract well breast milk . These characteristic NVP suggest treatment HIV-infected pregnant woman labor oral dose NVP may provide prophylactic level NVP infant time exposure virus birth canal and/or maternal blood . In addition , NVP may inactivate virion-associated RT present cell-free virion genital tract breast milk . Mothers randomize receive either single oral dose NVP labor correspond NVP placebo . Randomization occur time 28th week gestation . To assure balance treatment group , randomization stratify use 2 factor : ( 1 ) antiretroviral therapy current pregnancy ( antiretroviral therapy , monotherapy [ multi-agent therapy ] duration , multi-agent therapy duration ) , ( 2 ) CD4 cell count time randomization ( le 200 cell , 200 399 cell , 400 cell great ) . Mothers follow on-study 4 6 week postpartum . All mother require incorporate zidovudine ( ZDV ) current treatment regimen continue ZDV delivery give ZDV infant recommend . ZDV provide part study . Infants receive single oral dose NVP ( correspond placebo ) administer 48 72 hour life . The infant 's study drug mother 's randomize treatment assignment . Infants dose study drug accord randomization group regardless whether mother receive study drug . Infants follow 6 month life test HIV birth , 4 6 week life , 3 month life , 6 month life .</detailed_description>
