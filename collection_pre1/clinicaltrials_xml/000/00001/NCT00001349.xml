	<brief_summary>This study collect blood plasma white blood cell laboratory research use procedure call apheresis . Apheresis method collect large quantity certain blood component safely collect simple blood draw . Patients 7 year age old parasitic infection condition associate parasitic infection ( i.e. , elevate level IgE antibody type white cell call eosinophil ) currently enrol NIH clinical research protocol may eligible study . Relatives patient normal healthy volunteer also enrol . Candidates medical history , physical examination blood test . Individuals weigh less 25 kilogram ( 55 pound ) may participate . Participants undergo one follow two apheresis procedure : - Automated pheresis Whole blood drawn needle place arm vein circulate cell separator machine . The plasma ( liquid part blood ) white cell extract , red cell re-infused donor needle arm . The procedure take 1 2 hour . - Manual pheresis Whole blood drawn needle place arm vein circulate cell separator machine . The red blood cell separate rest blood return donor needle . Usually one needle stick require procedure take 30 45 minute . This method use individual weigh less 35 kg ( 77 pound ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In order carry vitro research procedure plasma leukocyte component blood , often necessary obtain large quantity plasma , leukocyte , platelet safely obtain simple phlebotomy . These component easily safely obtain use apheresis procedure Clinical Center Apheresis Unit . This protocol specifically design conform requirement Apheresis Unit donor apheresis procedure ( great 7 year age great equal 25 kg ) protocol research protocol . Donors must first admit another approved clinical research protocol NIAID may apheresis procedure describe protocol .</detailed_description>
