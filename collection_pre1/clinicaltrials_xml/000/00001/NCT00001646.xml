	<brief_summary>Invasive aspergillosis fungal disease increase incidence increase immunocompromised person population . Persons prolong neutropenia secondary cytotoxic chemotherapy high risk acute aspergillosis . Patients undergo bone marrow transplantation , receive prolonged corticosteroid immunosuppressive therapy , person HIV infection AIDS also risk . Even antifungal therapy , aspergillosis acute invasive form high mortality . In bone marrow transplantation patient whose infection involve brain , mortality great 90 % . Amphotericin B conventional form , current standard treatment disease . Response therapy amphotericin B usually range 20-60 % study . The high response rate usually see patient tolerate agent least 14 day . Because nephrotoxicity adverse effect , alternative conventional amphotericin B sought . These currently include liposomal form amphotericin B itraconazole . Although form show decrease adverse effect , efficacy drug show equivalent conventional amphotericin B. Voriconazole investigational antifungal drug currently bring phase III trial US . This azole show active Aspergillus spp . vitro , animal model early human trial effective aspergillosis . It show well-tolerated available intravenous oral formulation . This study evaluate efficacy , safety , toleration voriconazole compare conventional therapy amphotericin B primary treatment acute invasive aspergillosis immunocompromised patient . Patients randomize open-labelled therapy voriconazole amphotericin B one-to-one ratio .</brief_summary>
