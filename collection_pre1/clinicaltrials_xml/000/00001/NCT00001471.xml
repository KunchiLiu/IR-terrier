	<brief_summary>This study examine tissue tonsil , lymph node large bowel HIV-infected patient investigate change viral load certain white blood cell treatment . Normal volunteer HIV-infected patient 18 year age old may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test possibly electrocardiogram ( EKG ) . Blood test may include HLA type , genetic test immune system marker . Participants may undergo follow procedure : - Blood test ( patient volunteer ) - Biopsies The frequency biopsy give patient may vary , depend specific therapy . Typically , biopsy do single time , patient start new therapy , biopsy could perform start therapy , therapy possibly completion therapy . - Tonsil biopsy ( patient volunteer ) Volunteers one tonsil biopsy . Patients six tonsil biopsy , three 10-day period . The biopsy do ear , nose throat specialist outpatient procedure . The tonsil numb local anesthetic , one four piece tissue extract . - Lymph node biopsy ( patient ) Patients four lymph node biopsy , perform frequently month . The biopsy do surgeon may require 2- 3-day hospital stay . The skin lymph node numb local anesthetic , incision make tissue remove . Alternatively , needle biopsy may do , small amount lymph tissue withdrawn special needle inject site . - Intestinal biopsy ( patient volunteer ) Volunteers one intestinal biopsy procedure . Patients may six intestinal biopsy procedure , separate least 10 day . This do gastroenterologist outpatient procedure . A flexible tube ( sigmoidoscope colonoscope ) light special lens tip insert rectum large bowel . Wire instrument pass tube use extract small tissue sample . - Bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ; patient volunteer ) Volunteers patient undergo bronchoscopy flexible tube ( bronchoscope ) light special lens tip insert nose mouth lung , line lung sample wash airways small amount saline . The procedure perform pulmonologist critical care specialist , usually outpatient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Examining tissue outside bloodstream HIV-infected patient , patient Idiopathic CD4 lymphopenia ( ICL ) , comparison , HIV-uninfected healthy volunteer ( hereafter refer healthy volunteer ) , provide insight pathogenesis HIV infection ICL . This protocol provide mechanism sample tissue site . A total 430 HIV-infected patient , 100 ICL patient 105 healthy volunteer enrol study . To assess change viral load immunological parameter site outside bloodstream therapy HIV-infected patient , sequential tonsillar , lymph node , intestinal biopsy , bronchoscopy bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) undertaken course therapy . In small number patient , sequential simultaneous lymph node biopsy perform . In addition , uninfected healthy volunteer enrol tonsillar intestinal biopsy , bronchoscopy BAL ; allow comparison immunologic parameter HIVinfected uninfected tonsillar intestinal tissue , BAL fluid . Finally , ICL patient may tissue sample assess lymphocyte distribution possible function tissue well understand pathogenesis lymphopenia . Sequential simultaneous tissue sampling may occur longitudinal sample may also obtain assess stability tissue compartment effect possible immunomodulatory treatment .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Greater equal 18 year old . Ability sign inform consent . For woman childbearing potential , negative result serum urine pregnancy test within 1 week prior procedure . Willingness allow storage blood biopsy sample possible future use study HIV/AIDS , related disease immune system ; willingness permit HLA testing . FOR PATIENTS UNDERGOING BIOPSIES : No medical contraindication tonsillar , lymph node , intestinal biopsy . For tonsillar biopsy , presence visible tonsillar tissue ; lymph node biopsy , palpable lymph node . No aspirin piroxicam ( Feldene ) 10 day prior procedure ; non steroidal antiinflammatory drug ( e.g . ibuprofen ) must discontinue day prior procedure . Acetaminophen [ Tylenol ] permit time . FOR PATIENTS UNDERGOING BAL : Hematocrit great 27 percent , platelet great 50,000/ml . Baseline pulseoximetry record 94 percent great unless clinical indication bronchoscopy . No medical contraindication bronchoscopy . In addition : FOR HIV POSITIVE VOLUNTEERS : HIV infection must confirm ELISA western blot dot blot . For patient acute HIV infection negative HIV serology , plasma HIV viral load great 10,000 copies/ml . FOR HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS : No underlie significant medical problem , especially immunodeficiency autoimmune disease , underlie problem require immunosuppressive therapy . Absence HIV infection confirm negative ELISA , indicate , western blot dot blot . FOR ICL PATIENTS : Patients must meet definition ICL accord CDC criterion : document absolute CD4 T lymphocyte count le 300 cell per cubic millimeter le 20 percent total T cell one occasion usually two three month apart , without evidence HIV infection define immunodeficiency therapy associate depressed level CD4 T cell . Absence HIV infection confirm negative ELISA , indicate , western blot dot blot . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : FOR ALL VOLUNTEERS UNDERGOING BIOPSIES : Platelet count le 75,000 platelets/mm ( 3 ) . PT PTT prolong great 2 second . Known underlie bleed disorder . Pregnancy . FOR HIVPOSITIVE OR ICL VOLUNTEERS FOR LYMPH NODE BIOPSIES : Use narcotic ( prescribed physician ) cocaine le 1 week prior date biopsy . FOR ALL VOLUNTEERS FOR INTESTINAL BIOPSIES : Use narcotic ( prescribed physician ) cocaine le 1 week prior date biopsy . Significant heart valve abnormality . Presence pacemaker , artificial joint vascular surgery graft . FOR ALL VOLUNTEERS FOR BAL : Use narcotic ( prescribed physician ) cocaine le 1 week prior date biopsy . Pregnancy . Any medical condition investigator believe bronchoscopy may contraindicate . Allergy lidocaine . History asthma require therapy .</criteria>
