	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn role genetics pain sensitivity . Pain perception varies widely among individual , information gain trial may lead good method prevent control pain . The study consist two part , describe . All enrollee participate part 1 ; patient need oral surgery removal third molar may also participate part 2 . Normal volunteer , oral surgery patient , family member group may eligible study . Part 1 -Sensitivity test hot cold . Participants rate pain response hot cold stimulus scale `` pain '' `` bad pain imaginable . '' Heat sensitivity measure use small probe place skin second . The hot temperature test may cause pain second produce burn . Response cold measure place hand cold water 3 minute occasionally flex fist . Participants rate pain level every 15 second . In addition testing , blood sample draw examine gene relate pain . Part 2 - Oral surgery . Patients third molar remove local anesthetic ( lidocaine ) inject mouth sedative ( Versed ) give vein arm . A small tissue biopsy take tissue one third molar . Patients stay clinic 7 hour surgery anesthetic wear rate pain may accord rating scale use Part 1 study . Pain medication ( ketorolac , Toradol ) give need , patient complete pain questionnaire 3 hour drug give rate effectiveness . Patients receive additional pain reliever , need . A second biopsy side opposite first take local anesthetic measure change chemical signal produce response surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence Genetics Pain Sensitivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Variability pain sensitivity well know phenomenon . Clinicians involved care post-surgical patient familiar variation sensitivity . The variability also extend experimental pain stimulus ( e.g. , thermal pulse forearm ) demonstrate normal volunteer . In clinic , variation intensity onset acute pain oral surgery model , subject match similar level tissue injury range little post-operative pain report severe pain unrelieved standard analgesic . While variety factor may account variability race gender ( Gordon 1998 ) , preclinical data indicate genetic factor profoundly influence pain sensitivity . Thus , propose study seek investigate genetic contribution acute experimental clinical post-operative pain . We recently show strong correspondence pain report use thermal heat stimuli post-operative pain report . This observation give u important quantitative screening tool genetic analysis moderate-sized cohort subject direct clinical relevance . Normal subject sibling and/or parent undergo two somatosensory test determine pain phenotype provide blood sample analyze genetic polymorphism contribute sensitivity pain . Some subject also candidate oral surgery protocol similar pain rating obtain post-operatively . The initial study examine know polymorphisms candidate gene code pain sense pain suppressing molecule .</detailed_description>
