	<brief_summary>Major improvement treatment childhood non-lymphoblastic lymphoma take place last ten year . Though survival rate low risk patient ( i.e. , stage I &amp; II disease serum LDH le 350 IU/dL ) high 90 % previous Pediatric Branch protocol , 32 % patient high risk group achieve long term remission . The present protocol design improve survival high risk group use alternate non-cross resistant drug regimen . We plan determine whether use granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulate factor ( GM-CSF ) group would increase dose-intensity ameliorate myelotoxicity . We also plan study effect survival decrease duration treatment three month present year-long therapy low-risk patient .</brief_summary>
