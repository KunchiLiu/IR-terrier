	<detailed_description>Early course HIV infection , primary humoral immune response appear highly strain specific direct hypervariable portion viral gp120 . The F105 human monoclonal antibody react CD4 bind region gp120 show neutralize IIIB , SF2 , MN strain HIV concentration readily achievable human . In Part A , three cohort four patient receive single intravenous ( IV ) injection F105 human monoclonal antibody 1 3 dos . The IV catheter remain patient 's arm 12 hour injection subsequent draw blood sample . The third group ( high dose ) study first two group analyze pharmacokinetics . No two patient enrol per week . Patients Part A undergo follow-up three four time within first week injection weekly thereafter 7 week . Pharmacokinetic toxicity data generate Part A used select two dose level intermittent administration Part B . In part , cohorts four six patient receive one two dos F105 8-12 week . Per 9/30/94 amendment , eight patient receive one dose F105 every 21 day four dos ( dose determine analysis Part A data ) .</detailed_description>
