	<brief_summary>The efficacy laser photocoagulation treatment diabetic retinopathy demonstrate several National Eye Institute ( NEI ) sponsor clinical trial . The Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( DRS ) demonstrate scatter photocoagulation reduces risk blindness diabetic retinopathy . The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) extend finding provide information initiate scatter photocoagulation demonstrate focal treatment effective treat macula edema . The Krypton Argon Regression Neovascularization Study ( KARNS ) show scatter photocoagulation krypton red laser safe effective argon blue-green laser treatment proliferative diabetic retinopathy . Unfortunately , little data long term effect photocoagulation visual function . The first objective study assess long term effect photocoagulation diabetic retinopathy . A second objective provide additional information risk progression cataract person diabetes . All patient previously treat laser photocoagulation ( focal and/or scatter ) eligible participate long term study .
