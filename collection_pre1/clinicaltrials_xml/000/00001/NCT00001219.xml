	<brief_summary>Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) diagnostic test allow researcher look different chemical property tissue . Magnetic resonance image spectroscopy study use gather evaluate information various aspect patient body monitor change biochemistry physiology patient body . Unlike diagnostic technique ( CT scan PET scan ) MRI MRS use ionize radiation . Some study show MRI effective distinguish normal part anatomy abnormal anatomy , especially brain . MRI become diagnostic test choice evaluate patient multiple sclerosis . The purpose study evaluate normal volunteer patient variety diseases magnetic resonance imaging . Researchers attempt different magnetic resonance image method techniques well different level magnetic strength .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>MRI constantly evolve image modality MR. Pulse sequence often modify improve performance . However , many change yet approve FDA therefore , consider standard care . Some sequence require use new type image coil , also investigational . The major purpose protocol inform patient undergo MR scan Clinical Center may undergo scan FDA approve get patient 's consent . This formal research study since specific disease entity specific pulse sequence study systematic way . Rather , purpose give NIH patient access gradual improvement MR technology would otherwise available . A secondary purpose inform patient risk MRI gadolinium chelate commonly employ MRI .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All patient undergo MRI Clinical Center . Patients must able provide inform consent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : No contraindication MRI . Inability understand consent form consent process absence suitable guardian . Refusal Participate .</criteria>
