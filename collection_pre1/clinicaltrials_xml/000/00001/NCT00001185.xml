	<brief_summary>Polio poliomyelitis disease cause poliovirus . The virus attack cell spinal cord cause symptom fever , sore throat , headache , vomit , stiffness neck . Patients polio long-term weakness muscle result damage cell spinal cord . Occasionally , patient recover disease experience relapse muscle weakness . This occur long 25-35 year first polio . The condition call `` post-polio syndrome '' . Not nerve cell spinal cord damage poliovirus . Some nerve cell remain healthy take work damage cell . Researchers believe `` post-polio syndrome '' may cause failure overwork nerve cell . However , cause overworked nerve cell disintegrate unknown . The purpose study apply specific scientific test answer important question cause development post-polio syndrome . Researchers investigate possible genetic , immunologic , physiologic cause `` post-polio syndrome '' . The study provide therapy patient condition , may lead development therapy future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study `` Post-Polio Syndrome ''</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>`` Post-polio syndrome '' define new muscle weakness variety new difficulty daily live patient experience 25-35 year maximum recovery acute paralytic poliomyelitis . The new weakness appear due disintegration distal nerve terminal survive motor neuron whose soma stress year maintain large motor unit via excessive distal sprouting . The factor responsible disintegration axonal sprout manifestation new weakness fatigue unknown . Whether immune response poliovirus , immunogenetic , dysimmune age factor play role pathogenesis process also unknown . The purpose protocol apply specific neuromuscular , electrophysiological , histological , virological , immunological test answer pertinent question regard pathogenesis post-polio syndrome . Studied patient undergo series clinical neuromuscular evaluation , quantitative muscle testing , electromyography include single fiber EMG , immunogenetic , viral immunochemical study serum spinal fluid , muscle biopsy swallow evaluation . Although therapeutic study , information obtain would help u understand pathogenetic mechanism new weakness could help u design possible therapy .</detailed_description>
