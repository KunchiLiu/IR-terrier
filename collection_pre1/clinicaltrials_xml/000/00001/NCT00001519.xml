	<brief_summary>Measurements dynamic change oxygen uptake ( VO2 kinetics ) recovery exercise may describe regulatory control oxygen transport utilization great reliability less inherent risk assessment maximal oxygen uptake ( VO2max ) patient exercise limited pain , excessive fatigue , dyspnea motivation . The purpose pilot study evaluate effect exercise intensity time constant describing change VO2 ( tauVO2 ) recovery one minute constant work rate exercise . Five normal healthy volunteer age 18 old perform progressive maximal aerobic exercise test , use cycle ergometer , determine VO2max lactate threshold ( LT ) estimate gas exchange . Each subject also complete series maximal constant work rate test submaximal constant work rate test 80 % LT 50 % difference LT VO2max ( 50 % delta ) . Breath breath variability VO2 span use determine number constant work rate test repetition , subject exercise intensity , need establish confidence tauVO2 . A mean response profile VO2 recovery kinetics exercise intensity analyze use non-linear regression determine tauVO2 . To examine effect exercise intensity tauVO2 , one way analysis variance use determine whether difference exist among maximal submaximal ( 80 % LT 50 % delta ) time constant . We hypothesize significant difference among time constant VO2 recovery maximal submaximal constant work rate exercise last one minute . The result study expected provide increase understanding measurement VO2 kinetics recovery .</brief_summary>
