	<brief_summary>This study attempt identify gene responsible rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , inflammation joint . It known gene play important role RA , number significance determine . RA tend run family . This study examine DNA ( hereditary material ) patient RA family member try determine chromosome ( ) contain gene responsible disease . Patients rheumatoid arthritis family member may eligible study . Participants RA brother sister RA undergo follow procedure : - Review medical record - Medical history - Examination joint - Hand X-rays - Blood test Participants 1 ) RA relative disease , 2 ) RA relative brother sister disease provide blood sample buccal ( cheek ) cell sample . Cheek cell obtain swish small amount mouthwash mouth lightly bush inside cheek swab brush . The sample test rheumatoid factor , DNA study , HLA type ( blood type find white blood cell ) . Certain HLA type associate increase risk severity RA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol identify genetic susceptibility locus rheumatoid arthritis . The Genetics Genomics Branch Intramural Research Program NIAMS [ Inflammatory Diseases Section Intramural Research Program NHGRI ] join several extramural center form North American Rheumatoid Arthritis Consortium ( NARAC ) . The Consortium intend identify obtain clinical specimen total 1000 sibling pair rheumatoid arthritis ; 100 sibling pair recruit Clinical Center . Samples parent family member also obtain , appropriate . Rheumatoid factor , HLA-DR typing , hand film obtain sibling pair . In addition , DNA extract peripheral blood buccal scraping . The DNA 1000 sibling pair type set approximately 350 genetic marker order identify chromosomal region likely harbor gene confer susceptibility rheumatoid arthritis . For chromosomal region positive initial screen , family genotyped additional marker define disease-associated haplotype , high density single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) analysis conduct narrow region interest . Candidate gene choose narrowed region interest , and/or base functional consideration , screen mutation rheumatoid arthritis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : SIBLING PAIR : A diagnosis rheumatoid arthritis sib 1987 ACR criterion . Definite bony erosion least one affected sibling . Age disease onset great 18 year less 60 year least one sibling . Neither sibling psoriasis , inflammatory bowel disease , systemic lupus erythematosus . BLOOD RELATIVES OF AFFECTED SIBLING PAIRS : Age great 18 year . Where possible , affected sibling invite participate . Where possible , parent affect sibling invite participate . Other relative , affect unaffected , may invite participate , opinion investigator , sample individual would contribute important genetic information . Two case might happen : ) extend family several affected individual , conventional linkage analysis might apply ; b ) affect sibling pairs parent unavailable , additional sibling provide information parental allele transmit affected sibling . EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR AFFECTED SIBLINGS : Psoriasis , inflammatory bowel disease , systemic lupus erythematosus . Inability provide infomed consent . The sole criterion exclusion adult blood relative affect sibling pair would inability provide informed consent .</criteria>
