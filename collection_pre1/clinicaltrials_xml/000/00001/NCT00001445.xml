	<criteria>Children age 3 month 18 year . Diagnosis HIV1 infection define Centers Disease Control ( CDC ) Definition . Children adolescents vertically , transfusion sexually acquire HIV1 infection eligible . Availability parent guardian provide Informed Consent . ARM A : Children adolescent vertically , transfusion sexually acquire HIV1 infection . No moderate immune suppression time study entry define CDC Classification System , Immune Categories 1 2 . No history indication antiretroviral intervention time enrollment receive antiretroviral treatment : ( ) patient elect decline treatment ( b ) opinion patient 's health care provider , antiretroviral treatment currently recommend patient 's inability adhere therapy , promote development viral resistance . Children young 24 month age must plasma HIV1 RNA level great 8 X 10 ( 4 ) copies/ml previously time initial evaluation , confirm least two different time point 2 4 week apart , show sign increase ( increment less 0.5 log ( 10 ) . If child plasma HIV1 RNA level great 8 X 10 ( 4 ) copies/ml point prior initial evaluation , he/she place antiretroviral treatment must meet criterion Arm B . ARM B : Children adolescent vertically , transfusion , sexually acquire HIV1 infection , receive antiretroviral treatment longer 7 week . No moderate immune suppression time study entry define CDC Classification System , Immune Categories 1 2 . Children young 24 month age , meet inclusion criterion army B must plasma HIV1 RNA level less 5 X 10 ( 4 ) copies/ml receive optimal antiretroviral therapy , confirm least two different time point 2 4 week apart , show sign increase ( increment less 0.5 log ( 10 ) . If child previously treat antiretroviral drug 7 week ( therefore eligible arm A ) currently drug , he/she place optimal antiretroviral agent maintain viral RNA level 5 X 10 ( 4 ) copies/ml prior entry . Each child enrol arm B constant regimen antiretroviral treatment least 6 weeksprior first inoculation . Children immune category 1 2 time study entry allow enroll . Not critically ill clinically unstable presence active infection require ongoing ( induction ) therapy . No evidence severe immune suppression time study entry define CDC classification system , Immune Category 3 . For child young 24 month age , plasma HIV1 RNA level great equal 5 x 10 ( 4 ) copies/ml despite appropriate antiretroviral treatment , confirm least two different time point 2 4 week apart . No use tube feed intravenous hyperalimentation allow long stable regimen . No administration chemotherapeutic agent , use immunomodulating agent corticosteroid , interferon , GCSF , EPO , growth hormone ( GH ) IVIG within one month enrollment . No abnormalities laboratory finding within one month enrollment include follow : SGPT SGOT great 5 time normal value ; Total bilirubin great 3 time normal ; BUN creatinine great 2 time normal ; Total WBC great 150/mm ( 3 ) ANC great 750/mm ( 3 ) ; Hemoglobin great 8.0 g/dl ( transfusion allow ) ; Platelet count great 100,000/mm ( 3 ) .
