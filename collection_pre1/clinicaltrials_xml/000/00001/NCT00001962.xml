	<brief_summary>Participants study suffer rare serious blood disorder . In aplastic anemia , bone marrow stop produce red blood cell , platelet , white blood cell . In pure red cell aplasia , bone marrow stop produce red cell , amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenic purpura , bone marrow stop produce platelet . Current treatment approach disorder include bone marrow transplant and/or immunosuppression . However , bone marrow transplant always possible , immunosuppression serious side effect . This study investigate whether daclizumab use treat disorder . Daclizumab genetically engineer human antibody block interleukin-2 receptor immune cell . It use successfully many transplant patient reduce rate organ rejection . Participants undergo complete history physical examination . A bone marrow aspiration biopsy perform confirm type bone marrow failure . About 5 tablespoon blood drawn baseline test research purpose . Daclizumab administer every 2 week vein 30-minute infusion . The first dose give NIH next four may give NIH participant 's primary hematologist . The treatment last 8 week . Participants must also see refer physician NIH physician every 2 week blood count . In fourth eighth week study 3-month follow-up visit , 2 tablespoon blood drawn NIH . At 1-month follow-up visit NIH , 5 tablespoon blood drawn another bone marrow aspiration biopsy perform . Risks bone marrow aspiration biopsy blood draw include discomfort . Daclizumab usually well-tolerated ; however , may weaken immunity certain bacteria virus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Determine Whether Therapy With Daclizumab Will Benefit Patients With Bone Marrow Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many bone marrow failure syndrome human recognize result immunological mechanism . These disease include aplastic anemia ; single hematopoietic lineage failure pure red cell aplasia , Diamond Blackfan Anemia , agranulocytosis , amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenic purpura ; type myelodysplasia . Patients condition , may suffer variable degree anemia , leukocytopenia , thrombocytopenia , alone combination , show respond wide variety immunosuppressive agent , range corticosteroid cyclosporine ( CSA ) antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ) . However , except severe aplastic anemia , show appropriately treat either bone marrow transplantation combination ATG CSA , single agent regimens usually apply systematically immune-mediated hematologic disease . In effort discover especially less toxic treatment immunologically-mediated bone marrow disease , seek apply new therapy , humanize anti-interleukin-2 receptor ( lL-2R ) monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) , subset patient bone marrow failure . Anti-IL-2R mAb act activate lymphocyte , thus share important mechanism action ATG . However , mAb much less toxic ATG may administer outpatient relatively infrequent interval ( every 2 week ) . The primary objective test efficacy anti-IL-2R mAb ( daclizumab ) , propose treat four group patient : 1 ) moderate aplastic anemia , 2 ) single lineage failure state include pure red cell aplasia Diamond Blackfan anemia , 3 ) relapse severe aplastic anemia 4 ) refractory severe aplastic anemia respond horse rabbit ATG/CsA . Subjects receive daclizumab every week total 5 dos . Patients relapse response initial treatment may treat 2 additional course daclizumab . In November 2005 , relapse refractory severe aplastic anemia arm close Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) lack efficacy . In October 2008 , moderate aplastic anemia arm close DSMB data determine sufficient make statistical inference regard original hypothesis . In October 2008 , accrual Diamond Blackfan anemia arm close DSMB lack accrual . The Primary endpoint hematologic response 3 month . Secondary endpoint include transfusion dependence , overall survival , life threaten toxicity , transformation-free survival , response duration .</detailed_description>
