	<brief_summary>The purpose study 1 ) identify gene responsible certain immune disorder , 2 ) learn medical problem cause , 3 ) learn predict likely develop disorder risk pass child . The immune system body defense system . Some immune deficiency impair person ability fight infection ; others render person susceptible allergy , autoimmune disease lupus arthritis , immune cell ( white blood cell ) attack destroy body tissue . Patients immune disorder know suspected genetic basis family member may enroll study . Eligibility determine review patient medical record family medical history . Participants provide small blood sample genetic ( DNA ) white blood cell analysis . Gene sample ( white blood cell ) may also obtain mouth brush skin biopsy . For mouth brushing , small brush rub inside cheek 1 minute wipe cell . For skin biopsy , small circle skin ( 1/8 inch ) remove local anesthetic . Pregnant woman may ask provide fetal sample ( amniotic fluid cell chorionic villus sample ) . All sample use immune genetic study family immune disorder . If test result show specific genetic variation responsible family immune disorder , report send patient doctor genetic counselor , discuss implication family . NIH researcher genetic counselor also available explain result answer question . Information available case disorder yet link specific genetic abnormality . Information study increase knowledge immune system cause immune deficiency . Participants may also learn underlie cause immune disorder affect someone family information may useful guide treatment making decision regard family planning .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This protocol include study genetic defect immune system cause failure host defense infection , immune dysregulation autoimmune disease . Numerous rare disorder result inherit newly arise mutation gene involve development function innate adaptive immune system . As specific disease syndrome define responsible gene identify , mutation individual family seek . Correlation mutation sit clinical information help determine specific gene segment encode important functional domain proteins immune system within genetic defect . Rare , single gene disorder identify immunologic pathway might contribute common condition , failure respond vaccine , susceptibility allergy , autoimmune disease like arthritis lupus . Members family immune disorder know suspected genetic basis may eligible . Immunologic test DNA sequence analysis appropriate clinical condition perform need affected individual risk family member . Healthy family member may serve control . Probands , parent decease affected individual , entire family , may refer Investigators Initially , clinical family history well laboratory data review investigator determine eligibility . Subjects consider appropriate invite refer physician participate signing consent form send appropriate blood , DNA sample PI . Should genetic basis individual immune disorder identify clinical eligibility protocol meet , may invite visit NIH .</detailed_description>
