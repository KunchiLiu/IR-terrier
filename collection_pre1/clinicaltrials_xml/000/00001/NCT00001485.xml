	<brief_summary>As season change course year , many animal show major change behavior physiology . Many change trigger change length time night pineal gland produce hormone melatonin . Melatonin produce long time winter night long , summer night short . Some researcher believe melatonin may play similar role season effect mood patient seasonal affective disorder . Seasonal affective disorder ( SAD ) mood disorder seasonal pattern condition normal biorhythm disturb season , especially autumn-winter . Patients may begin experience experience worsen depressive symptom . Patients complain constantly tire , crave sugary food , overeat , sleep . Researchers collect preliminary data show duration nighttime melatonin secretion increase winter decrease summer healthy woman , healthy men . However , men diagnose SAD show long duration melatonin secretion winter , similar duration see healthy woman . If early finding confirm may explain SAD common woman men . The purpose study continue research difference melatonin secretion season healthy men woman , determine finding may apply patient SAD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Changes duration nocturnal melatonin secretion induce seasonal change length night trigger many dramatic seasonal change behavior occur animal . It hypothesize melatonin play similar role chemical mediator effect season mood patient seasonal affective disorder ( SAD ) . For hypothesis tenable , would necessary show duration nocturnal melatonin secretion change seasonal basis patient SAD . We preliminary evidence duration ( amplitude ) nocturnal melatonin secretion increase winter decrease summer healthy woman , healthy men . This gender difference , confirm , might explain SAD prevalent woman men . Interestingly , five men SAD study date exhibit lengthen melatonin secretion winter , occur healthy woman . However , response woman SAD le consistent . The purpose present protocol extend confirm find gender difference response melatonin secretion change season healthy individual , determine whether extent response occur patient SAD .</detailed_description>
