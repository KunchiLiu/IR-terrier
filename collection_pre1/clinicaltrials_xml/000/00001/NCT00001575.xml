	<brief_summary>This study examine use radioactive monoclonal antibody call yttrium 90-labeled humanize anti-Tac ( 90 Y-HAT ) treat certain cancer . Monoclonal antibody genetically engineer protein make large quantity direct specific target body . The anti-Tac antibody study target tumor cell tag ( label ) radioactive substance call Yttrium-90 ( Y-90 ) . The study determine maximum tolerate dose 90Y-HAT examine safety effectiveness . Patients 18 year age old Hodgkin 's disease , non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma lymphoid leukemia proteins cancer cell react anti-Tac may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood urine test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , chest x-ray , compute tomography ( CT ) scan ultrasound abdomen , positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan neck body , skin test immune reactivity antigen ( similar skin tuberculin test ) . Before begin treatment , participant may undergo additional procedure , include follow : - Patients suspicious skin lesion skin biopsy . An area skin numb circular piece skin 1/4-inch diameter remove cookie cutter-like instrument . - Patients hear loss hearing test . - Patients neurological symptom lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) . A local anesthetic give needle inserted space bone low back cerebrospinal fluid circulate spinal cord . A small amount fluid collect needle . - Patients bone marrow biopsy within 6 month screen also undergo procedure . The skin bone back hip numb local anesthetic small piece bone withdrawn needle . Patients receive 90 Y-HAT escalating dos determine high dose safely give . The first group three patient receive low dose , significant side effect dose , next three patient receive high dose . This continue subsequent group maximum study dose reach . 90 Y-HAT give vein ( intravenous ( IV ) ) 2-hour period . In addition , drug call Pentetate Calcium Trisodium Inj ( Ca-DTPA ) give via IV 5 hour 3 day help reduce side effect 90Y-HAT . In patient , 90 Y-HAT may also attach radioactive metal call Indium-111 monitor happen inject material . During infusion drug , patient undergo PET scan trace path inject material body . For procedure , patient lie scanner , remain one position entire infusion . Blood urine specimen collect periodically 6-week period follow infusion determine level radioactive antibody . Bone marrow , lymph node , skin biopsy may do determine much antibody enter site . Patients whose disease remain stable improves therapy may receive six infusion 90 Y-HAT , least 6-week interval treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anti-Tac ( 90 Y-HAT ) Treat Hodgkin 's Disease , Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma Lymphoid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Cluster differentiation 25 ( CD25 ) express malignant cell patient certain lymphoid malignancy well non-malignant T cell surround malignant tumor cell patient Hodgkin 's disease . Zenapax humanize monoclonal antibody bind CD25 . Zenapax chemically modify addition chelate molecule permit bind radioactive yttrium . The yttrium label Zenapax bind CD25 deliver radiation treatment tumor . Objective : To assess toxicity therapeutic efficacy ( 90 ) Yttrium-labeled humanize anti-Tac ( ( 90 ) Y-HAT ) patient Tac-expressing hematologic malignancy . To determine site localization radiolabeled Zenapax . Eligibility : Patients Hodgkin 's disease CD25 positive lymphoid malignancy . The patient must granulocyte least 1,200/mm^3 platelet count great 100,000/mm^3 . Design : Patients treat 10 mCi ( bone marrow transplant part patient 's previous therapy ) 15 mCi yttrium label Zenapax . Indium label Zenapax give demonstrate antibody distribution confirm localization sit tumor . Treatment give every six week tolerate patient hospitalize one week treatment . Tumor response evaluate every treatment . Stable respond patient continue treatment evaluation every cycle treatment . Patients treat seven cycle .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All patient must histologically confirm diagnosis Hodgkin 's disease . Patients allogeneic autologous transplant eligible 100 day posttransplant . At least 10 % patient 's malignant cell peripheral blood , lymph node , skin , extranodal site must react antiTac , determine immunofluorescent immunoperoxidase staining . Because high incidence Tac positivity infiltrate T cell Hodgkin 's disease , patient cluster differentiation 25 ( CD25 ) positive infiltrate T cell eligible even Hodgkin 's cell negative . Diagnoses Stage Disease : 1 ) NonHodgkin 's Lymphoma ( NHL ) : Patients histopathologic subtypes Tacexpressing NHL eligible . Patients indolent NHL Stages II IV eligible fail least one standard therapy disease require treatment . Patients aggressive NHL eligible relapse standard chemotherapy either eligible refused salvage chemotherapy bone marrow transplantation . 2 ) Hodgkin 's disease : Patients consider low potential cure conventional chemotherapy radiation therapy eligible . Specifically , patient stage IIIV Hodgkin 's disease eligible relapse fail attain complete remission firstline chemotherapy either eligible refused salvage chemotherapy bone marrow transplantation . 3 ) Cutaneous Tcell Lymphoma ( CTCL ) : Patients stage Tacexpressing CTCL eligible exception Stage Ia . Patients Stages Ib III eligible fail least one standard therapy . Patients stage IV eligible regardless whether previous therapy . 4 ) Peripheral Tcell Lymphoma ( PTCL ) : Patients stage I IV PTCL eligible relapse firstline chemotherapy either eligible refused salvage chemotherapy bone marrow transplantation . Other : Patients lymphoid leukemias lymphoma easily classified category eligible provide failed standard therapy eligible refuse bone marrow transplantation . Patients must Karnofsky performance status least 50 . Patients must creatinine less 2.0 mg/dl . If patient abnormally elevate creatinine creatinine clearance must great 50 ml/min . Patients must serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) less 5 time upper limit normal , bilirubin less 3.0 unless felt due malignancy . Patients must clinical cardiac failure . Patients symptomatic pulmonary dysfunction eligible due underlie malignancy . The patient must granulocyte count least 1,200/mm^3 platelet count great 100,000/mm^3 . Patients must able understand sign inform consent . Breastfeeding female eligible study . Omission cytotoxic chemotherapy systemic therapy malignancy 3 week prior entry trial . However , patient receive corticosteroid exclude . Patients receive corticosteroid must stable dose least three week receive yttrium 90labeled humanize antiTac ( 90YHAT ) study . Patients must life expectancy great 1 month . Patients must least 18 year old . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Female patient child bear potential tested pregnancy ; pregnant patient exclude study . Patients human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) antibody positive . Patients symptomatic disease due malignant involvement central nervous system . Patients active second primary cancer . Patients receive chronic anticoagulant therapy exclude study . Patients require urgent chemotherapy radiation therapy management malignancy exclude . Patients evidence myelodysplastic syndrome chromosomal abnormality screen bone marrow evaluation</criteria>
