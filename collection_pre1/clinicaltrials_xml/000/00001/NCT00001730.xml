	<brief_summary>Thyroid cancer typically treat surgery , radiation combination . Following surgical removal thyroid tissue patient receive thyroid hormone replacement medication . In addition patient undergo test determine status disease . One test conduct whole body scan use radioactive iodine detect locate remain cancerous thyroid tissue . Thyroid tissue use iodine make thyroid hormone ( T3 T4 ) . In order radioiodine scan work , cancerous thyroid tissue must `` hungry '' iodine . Thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) produce pituitary gland responsible make thyroid tissue `` hungry '' iodine . Once thyroid tissue absorbs radioactive iodine clearly visible scan locate removal . However , thyroid hormone replacement medication tend low activity pituitary gland amount naturally produce TSH . So necessary stop thyroid hormone replacement increase TSH . A problem arise lack thyroid hormone replacement cause patient experience hypothyroidism . This condition associate unpleasant physical emotional symptom . TSH create laboratory call Thyrogen . It basically TSH produce human pituitary gland . However , Thyrogen increase level TSH body without stop thyroid replacement medication . Therefore patient experience hypothyroidism prepare radioactive iodine scan . The objective study compare activity radioiodine ( 131I ) patient take Thyrogen normal thyroid activity versus patient hypothyroid activity thyroid replacement medication withdrawn . In addition study provide information radioactive iodine eliminate body . The study help researcher understand give Thyrogen radioiodine purpose scan therapeutic ablation ( destruction function ) cancerous thyroid tissue . The study accept patient non-medullary thyroid cancer prepare ablation therapy . The patient place one two group . Group one receive Thyrogen 2 dose 24 hour apart . Group two receive Thyrogen 3 dos 72 hour apart . The patient undergo two 131I whole body scan : one Thyrogen take thyroid hormone suppressive second withdrawal thyroid hormone . 131I ablative therapy give hypothyroid condition completion study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Radioiodine ( 131-I ) Uptake Following Administration Thyrogen Hypothyroid States During Thyroid Hormone Withdrawal .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-centered , open-labeled , randomize , two parallel-arm study design compare quantitative radiation dosimetry assessment obtain thyroid hormone suppression therapy recombinant human TSH ( Thyrogen速 ( Registered Trademark ) ) hypothyroidism thyroid cancer patient prepare post-surgical radioiodine ablation . The primary endpoint study identify ratio administer activity radioiodine ( 131I ) deliver target dose 30,000 rad thyroid remnant patient euthyroid Thyrogen速 ( Registered Trademark ) hypothyroid hormone withdrawal . Secondary endpoint identify compare effective 131I clearance cumulate activity whole body blood euthyroid hypothyroid state . All adult patient differentiate non-medullary thyroid cancer prepare ablation therapy eligible participation . Patients randomize one two different dose regimen Thyrogen速 ( Registered Trademark ) . Participants undergo two 131I whole body scan : one Thyrogen速 ( Registered Trademark ) take thyroid hormone suppressive therapy second withdrawal thyroid hormone . 131I ablative therapy give hypothyroid condition completion dosimetry study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients great equal 18 year age , welldifferentiated , nonmedullary thyroid cancer , include papillary ( include follicularvariant ) , follicular , Hurthle cell . Patients recently undergone total neartotal thyroidectomy schedule undergo initial 131I diagnostic study ablation . Patients must evidence residual thyroid tissue thyroid surgery confirm ultrasound imaging technique ( e.g. , technetium [ Tc 99 ] pertechnetate thallium scan ) . Patients undergone thyroidectomy thyroid surgery least 6 week prior enrollment . All patient sustain maintenance THST least 4 week , longer 12 week thyroidectomy . All patient confirm serum TSH level less equal 0.5 mU per liter within 7 day prior first Thyrogen dose , prior randomization . Female patient childbearing age must negative serum human chorionic gonadotropin ( HCG ) pregnancy test prior enter study within 5 day 131I administration must follow approve method contraception . Patients commit follow protocol requirement evidence provide write informed consent . Patients 131I scan currently contraindicate withdrawal THST option due pituitary dysfunction compel medical reason exclude . Patients concurrent major medical disorder ( e.g. , documented cardiac disease , debilitate cardiopulmonary disease , advance renal failure , advance liver disease advance pulmonary disease ) may ill adequately comply requirement study . Patients nonthyroidal condition know effect 131I uptake ( e.g. , congestive heart failure , renal failure ) exclude . Patients undergone intravenous water soluble radiographic contrast administration within previous 4 week . Patients receive intrathecal cholecystographic iodinate contrast agent administration within 3 month prior enrollment . Patients take drug affect thyroid renal function ( e.g. , renal drug , lithium , corticosteroid ) . Patients participate another investigational drug study study within 30 day enrollment study . No patient recent history alcoholism drug abuse , severe emotional behavioral psychiatric problem , opinion investigator , would able comply requirement study .</criteria>
