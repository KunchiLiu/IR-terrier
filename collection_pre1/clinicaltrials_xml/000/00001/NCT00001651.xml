	<brief_summary>This study examine quickly white blood cell call CD4 lymphocyte replicate ( divide ) long live HIV-infected non-infected people measure quickly genetic material ( DNA ) cell replicate . To , participant receive infusion glucose , non-radioactive form type sugar . Cells normally use glucose make various product need cell growth replication , include cell DNA . Measuring much glucose cell incorporate DNA provide important information cell replication . This rate incorporation examine compare HIV-infected people healthy , normal volunteer . HIV-infected patient non-infected healthy volunteer 18 year age old may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , chest X-ray , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) blood test . Participants give continuous infusion glucose dose 60 gram ( 2 ounce ) per day 5 day . The glucose deliver catheter ( thin plastic tube ) place arm vein . Blood sample collect often daily first week follow infusion twice week month 4 year . Alternatively , patient may undergo leukapheresis procedure collect quantity lymphocytes 10 time first month infusion , possibly later well , often every 2 week . For procedure , whole blood collect needle arm vein . The blood circulates machine separate component . The white cell remove rest blood return body either needle second needle arm . Participants may ask receive four glucose infusion . There least 2-week interval infusion . Participants three leukapheresis procedure within 3 week least 6 week infusion . Participants follow periodically outpatient clinic evaluation test . This study may provide good understand HIV cause disease progressive weakening immune system therapy affect immunity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Understanding rate lymphocyte replication destruction HIV-infected patient , well effect therapy lymphocyte replication lead well understanding mechanism behind immunodeficiency induce HIV . To examine directly , 100 HIV-infected patient receive 5 day continuous infusion [ 6,6- ( 2 ) H ( 2 ) ] -glucose , nonradioactive , stable isotope glucose safe administer . The deuterium incorporate DNA via metabolism glucose ribose incorporation nucleotide . The rate incorporation measure subpopulation cell determine rate replication cell . Fifty HIV-uninfected person also enrol protocol allow determination lymphocyte kinetics individual normally function immune system immune system may affect disease . All participant study reimburse inconvenience discomfort associate study participation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : FOR PATIENTS : 18 year old . Able provide inform consent willing comply study requirement clinic policy . Negative urine pregnancy test ( woman childbearing potential ) . Hemoglobin great 10 mg/dl . Adequate venous access arm blood draw 5 day infusion , lymphapheresis Willingness allow store sample use future study HIV infection and/or immunological function , willingness HLA typing perform . ( For previously enrol patient , patient would request , require , provide permission use store sample future , permit HLA test FOR HIV POSITIVE PATIENTS : Documented HIV infection ( ELISA/Western blot positive , acute seroconverters , PCR positive ) . FOR HIV NEGATIVE PATIENTS : Negative ELISA/Western blot . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Diabetes mellitus require drug therapy . Active substance abuse prior history substance abuse may interfere protocol compliance . Psychiatric illness disturbance , assessment protocol team , may affect patient safety compliance . Significant underlying cardiac , pulmonary , renal , gastrointestinal , rheumatologic CNS disease detectable routine history , physical exam , screen laboratory study . Patients would exclude acute chronic underlie medical problem judgment principal investigator could exacerbate participate protocol would make difficult comply protocol requirement .
