	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All patient 3 year age meningeal malignancy progressive refractory conventional therapy eligible study . Patients meningeal malignancy secondary underlie solid tumor eligible initial diagnosis conventional therapy . Diagnosis : Patients leukemia , lymphoma , solid tumor also overt meningeal involvement tumor . The definition meningeal disease protocol include : Leukemia/Lymphoma CSF cell count great equal 5/mm ( 3 ) AND evidence blast cell cytospin preparation cytology . Solid tumor Presence tumor cell cytospin preparation cytology OR presence measurable meningeal disease CT MRI scan . Patients must life expectancy least 8 week ECOG performance status 2 well . Patients unable walk paralysis , wheelchair consider ambulatory purpose performance score . Patients and/or parent must sign informed consent indicate aware investigational nature study . Patients must recover acute toxic effect prior intrathecal chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy , prior enter study must without significant systemic illness ( e.g . infection ) . Patients must receive CNS therapy within 1 week prior start treatment study craniospinal irradiation within 8 week prior start treatment study . Patients must receive intrathecal chemotherapy within 1 week ( 2 week prior DTC101 ) . Patients must clinically significant abnormality regard liver function , renal function metabolic parameter ( electrolyte , calcium phosphorus ) . A Durable Power Attorney ( DPA ) must offer patient great equal 18 year age . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients receive therapy ( either intrathecal systematic ) design specifically treat meningeal malignancy eligible study . However , patient receive concomitant chemotherapy control systemic bulk CNS disease eligible , provide systemic chemotherapy phase I agent , agent significantly penetrate CNS ( e.g. , high dose methotrexate , ( great 1 gm/m ( 2 ) ) , thiotepa , high dose cytarabine , ( great 2 gm/m ( 2 ) per day ) , 5fluorouracil , intravenous 6mercaptopurine topotecan ) , agent know serious unpredictable CNS side effect . Careful documentation systemic drug administer concurrently require . Patients clinical evidence obstructive hydrocephalus compartmentalization CSF flow document radioisotope Indium ( 111 ) Technitium ( 99 ) DTPA flow study eligible protocol . If CSF flow block compartmentalization demonstrate , focal radiotherapy site block restore flow repeat CSF flow study show clear blockage require patient eligible study . Patients leukemia lymphoma concomitant bone marrow relapse eligible study . Women childbearing age must pregnant lactating . Patients receive systemic investigational agent within 14 day prior , , study treatment . The 14 day period extend patient receive investigational agent know delayed toxicity 14 day . Patients must receive intrathecal investigational agent within 7 day prior , , study treatment . The 7 day period extend patient receive investigational agent know delayed toxicity 7 day prolong halflife .</criteria>
