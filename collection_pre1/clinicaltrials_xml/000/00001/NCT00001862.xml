	<brief_summary>This study investigate safety effectiveness drug TNFR : Fc treat uveitis ( eye inflammation ) patient juvenile rheumatoid arthritis . In study , TNFR : Fc significantly reduce joint pain swell adult patient rheumatoid arthritis , Food Drug Administration approve drug use . Because medicine arthritis often help patient eye inflammation , study examine whether TNFR : Fc help patient uveitis . Patients uveitis respond well standard treatment , steroid , patient side effect medicine use treat uveitis refuse treatment possible side effect may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , eye examination . The eye exam include check vision eye pressure , examination back eye ( retina ) , front eye , include measurement protein inflammation . Candidates also undergo fluorescein angiography-a procedure photograph take retina see leakage eye 's blood vessel . A blood test joint evaluation also do . Study participant give shot TNFR : Fc twice week 12 month may continue medicine may take , prednisone methotrexate . They follow-up examination week two month one , two , three four . Those wish continue treatment fourth month receive drug another eight month follow-up exams month six , nine 12 , one month treatment end . Each follow-up visit include repeat screen exams evaluation side effect discomfort medicine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TNRF : Fc Treat Eye Inflammation Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current treatment modality uveitis associate Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis ( JRA ) include corticosteroid immunosuppressive agent associate significant side effect . These treatment effective child . A soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR : Fc ) name Etanercept , may inhibit inflammatory response uveitis . This randomized double-masked phase I/II clinical trial provide limit safety efficacy information regard use Etanercept treatment uveitis associate JRA . Fifteen patient randomize 2 1 randomization plan ( 10 receive Etanercept , 5 receive placebo ) follow 6 month . After 6 month visit , patient receive open label Etanercept additional 6 month . Patients switch open label Etanercept , withdrawn study therapy prior 6 month , ) experience great 10 letter great drop visual acuity due inflammation , patient use ETDRS chart ( 2 line drop due inflammation , patient use B-VAT method ) b ) develop sight-threatening inflammatory ophthalmic joint lesion require immediate increase systemic anti-inflammatory therapy periocular injection corticosteriods c ) 4 month , great 1 plus anterior chamber cell grade either eye receive topical corticosteroid schedule TID frequently . Investigators remain masked original treatment assignment unless warranted clinical care consideration . Primary safety outcome include occurrence severe adverse event least possibly relate study therapy , include two step increase anterior chamber cell , occurrence serious infection sepsis . Primary ophthalmic outcome include measure anterior chamber cell change topical systemic anti-inflammatory medication use treat uveitis . Primary ophthalmic JRA outcome analysis perform 6 month , 12 month . Patients unmasked switch open label Etanercept prior month 6 withdrawing study drug prior month 12 consider failure .</detailed_description>
