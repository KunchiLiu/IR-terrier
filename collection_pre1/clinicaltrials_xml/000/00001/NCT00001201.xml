	<brief_summary>The peripheral nervous system portion nervous system outside brain spinal cord . It include 12 pair cranial nerve , 31 pair spinal nerve branch , nerve responsible sensation maintenance normal body function ( sympathetic parasympathetic nerve ) . Years research use clinical examination , microscopic examination , electrophysiology make peripheral nervous system best-studied available portion nervous system . However , even extensive study conduct peripheral nervous system , many condition remain unclassified . The EMG Laboratory NIH concentrate study disorder peripheral nervous system . This protocol design allow EMG Laboratory ; I ) Learn establish diseases peripheral nervous system II ) Identify characterize new disease peripheral nervous system III ) Assess current technique diagnosis diseases peripheral nervous system IV ) Refine old method develop new one diagnosis diseases peripheral nervous system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Combined careful clinical examination , electrophysiology histopathology render peripheral nervous system best study accessible level nervous system . But even intensive diagnostic evaluation peripheral neuropathy large diagnostic center , 24 70 % disorder remain unclassified . Analogous statistic disorder muscle neuromuscular transmission know probably similar , bad . Clearly , detail diagnostic characterization disorder peripheral nervous system first stage clinical intervention . Currently , EMG Laboratory NIH offer complete clinical , electrophysiologic , , appropriate , pathologic evaluation referral Branches Institutes . Since referral come primarily within NIH , disorder secondary systemic disease . This protocol design extend service direct referral primary disorder peripheral nervous system . The purpose first , learn establish disease ; second , identify characterize new disease ; third , assess current methodology technology ; fourth , refine old method develop new one . Under umbrella protocol , individual case clinical series investigate .</detailed_description>
