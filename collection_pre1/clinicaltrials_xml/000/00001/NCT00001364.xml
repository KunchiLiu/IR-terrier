	<brief_summary>Arteriovenous malformation ( AVM ) abnormally form blood vessel locate throughout brain spinal cord . Patients abnormality blood vessel locate around spinal cord develop many neurological problem . Some problem include , weakness , pain , difficulty walking , paralysis , even death . The treatment AVMs depend location , type malformation , area spine involve , condition patient time treatment . The treatment aim stop neurologic problem worsen possibly correct exist problem . There two commonly use treatment AVMs , surgery embolization ( block blood flow AVM ) . However , researcher limit experience treat condition rare . In addition , difficult classify different kind AVMs develop new treatment . This study design increase researcher understand AVMs admit follow patient diagnosed condition . By increase amount patient study diagnosed spinal blood vessel abnormality , researcher begin develop new management plan patient AVMs .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Spinal Arteriovenous Malformations rare lesion frequently effect young patient adults productive year . They cause progressive myelopathy , ultimately cause paraplegia quadriplegia untreated . Because rare lesion , experience treat sufficient number permit classification , investigation pathophysiology myelopathy , introduction new technique treatment possible center country . One essential element investigation selective spinal arteriography . Since selective spinal arteriography first introduce lesion NIH mid 1960 's Drs . John Doppman Giovanni DiChiro , NIH center expertise patient spinal arteriovenous malformation . Because , NIH , , national referral center patient . However , never approve protocol NIH investigation treatment patient . The purpose proposal present plan investigation treatment serve protocol admit patient permit continued accrual clinical experience serve guide others management patient .</detailed_description>
