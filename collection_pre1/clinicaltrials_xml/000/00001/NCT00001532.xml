	<detailed_description>This study design evaluate genetic mechanism lung disease survey polymorphic gene involve respiratory function examine gene expression lung cell individual pulmonary disease ( e.g. , alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency , asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , cystic fibrosis , sarcoidosis , history infection , genetic mutation consistent lung pathology ) . Emphasis define distribution allelic variant nitric oxide synthase , alpha 1-antitrypsin , cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene patient age- sex-matched healthy individual control population .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Inclusion criterion patient AAT deficiency include : ( 1 ) Diagnosis AAT confirm phenotype consider high risk category ; ( 2 ) Clinical phenotype consistent potential genetic disease genetic cause lung disease ( 3 ) symptom consistent pulmonary disease ; ( 4 ) chest xray consistent pulmonary disease ; ( 5 ) pulmonary function test consistent pulmonary disease ; ( 6 ) smoker , define individual current smoker ( 1 pack per day least 2 year ) nonsmoker , define neversmokers exsmokers quit smoke three year ago ; Inclusion criterion individual chronic obstructive pulmonary disease include : 1. symptom consistent pulmonary disease 2. chest xray consistent pulmonary disease 3. pulmonary function test consistent pulmonary disease ; 4. smoker , define individual current smoker ( 1 pack per day least 2 year ) nonsmoker , define neversmokers exsmokers smoke three year . Inclusion criteria patient cystic fibrosis include define genetic mutation ( i.e. , known variant CFTR gene , delta F508 allele ) cystic fibrosis phenotype clinical feature consistent disease . Children cystic fibrosis eight year age may include . Patients establish diagnosis sarcoidosis ; mycobacterial infection ; TSC ( definite possible ) ; cystic lung disease include genetic disease ; lymphangioleiomyomatosis disease associate lymphatic disorder ; history pneumothorax ; pulmonary fibrosis ; asthma ; histiocytosis X diabetes mellitus include protocol . Relatives patient may also see protocol . Children lymphangiomatosis two year age older may include . Research volunteer pulmonary control group define individual pulmonary disease ( e.g . rheumatoid arthritis without evidence pulmonary disease ) . Research volunteer diabetes control group define individual history diabetes , coronary artery disease , pulmonary disease . Because radiation exposure require , pregnant woman exclude study . Patients abnormalities ADPribosyltransferases , ADPribosylacceptor hydrolases , substrate . Children two year age old may study know defect ADPribosylation , family member defect ADPribosylation may affect . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Exclusion criterion participant include : 1. age less 18 great 90 except NIH patient diseases /disorders describe protocol ( except cystic fibrosis , lymphangiomatosis defect ADPribosylation ) 16 year age old , patient cystic fibrosis eight year age , patient two year age old lymphangiomatosis know defect ADPribosylation , family member defect ADPribosylation , unless patientspecific IRB approval obtain ; 2. inability obtain reliable pulmonary function test . As clarification , healthy volunteer , relatives patient ( except note ADPribosylation defect ) , asthmatic patient Suburban Hospital exclude less 18 great 90 year age . An exclusion criterion participate xray portion study pregnancy . Exclusion criterion participate bronchoscopy portion study : 1. presence contraindication fiberoptic bronchoscopy , lavage and/or bronchial brushing ; 2. advance stage pulmonary systemic illness risk judge significant even absence specific contraindication procedure 3. allergy topical anesthetic ( e.g. , lidocaine ) 4. current recent respiratory infection ( within last 4 week ) 5. pregnancy lactation 6. age less 18 great 65 .</criteria>
