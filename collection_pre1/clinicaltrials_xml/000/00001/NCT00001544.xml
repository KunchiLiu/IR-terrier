	<brief_summary>The purpose study improve understanding genetic cause specific neurologic psychiatric disorder . The study focus condition mental retardation , childhood onset schizophrenia , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , atypical psychosis childhood , bipolar affective disorder . The study address belief may several gene contribute illness . Researchers intend use several molecular genetic technique order identify area chromosome contain gene responsible development disorder . Patients select participate study base early age onset condition well severity illness frequency illness among family member . Researchers collect DNA sample patient well affected unaffected family member patient . The DNA sample collect analyzed variety genetic abnormality include ; triplet repeat expansion , chromosome rearrangement , polymorphism .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We propose use DNA probe study patient specific neurologic psychiatric disorder , especially focus patient early onset extreme phenotype childhood onset schizophrenia ( COS ) , mental retardation ( MR ) , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , atypical psychosis childhood , ( multi-dimensional impairment MDI ) , bipolar affective disorder ( BPAD ) . This study address hypothesis genetic risk factor contribute diverse phenotype . Several complementary molecular genetic technique employ identify chromosomal region contain gene contribute specific neurologic psychiatric disorder . Patients select study basis age onset severity neurologic psychiatric symptom , familial genetic load family structure . Individuals participate protocol clinically evaluate NIMH NIH clinical protocol , particularly Child Psychiatry Branch ( reference protocol number 85-M-0115 , 84-M-0050 , 97-M-0126 ) . Those subject meet inclusion criterion may undergo screening may include physical , neurologic psychiatric examination . As appropriate , initial screen may follow formal , structured instrument Schedule Affective Disorders ( SADS ) , revise Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale ( WAIS-R ) , Conner 's revised parent teacher rating , Diagnostic Interview Children Adolescents ( DICA- version IV ) confirm clinical diagnosis discretion treat physician . Venipuncture and/or buccal swab perform order obtain sample DNA extraction establish lymphoblast cell line use genetic test . Samples also collect family member control study .</detailed_description>
