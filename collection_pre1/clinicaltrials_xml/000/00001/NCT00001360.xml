	<detailed_description>Objective : Our goal study functional organization intact human brain combine cognitive task neuroimaging . Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) use measure brain activity healthy human subject engage perform cognitive task . These task address specific question concern neural system mediate perception , attention , memory , decision-making , emotion , plasticity social interaction . fMRI MEG , respectively , employed investigate spatial temporal aspect neural system . Study Population : Normal volunteer participant age 18-65 , good general health recruit local community study minimal risk protocol . Design : Subjects perform cognitive task behavioral and/or neuroimaging session ( fMRI MEG ) . Outcome Measures : Behavior performance cognitive task , brain activity ( fMRI MEG ) combine yield information neural correlate process underlie different aspect human cognition include visual perception , memory , learning , emotion , social cognition , decision-making attention .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Healthy adult , least high school education , age 18 65 year , recruit participate study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects exclude : NIMH employee relative evidence , history : major medical , neurological psychiatric illness serious head injury learn disabilitydrug alcohol abuse dependence past 3 month , except nicotine take prescription drug supplement may affect brain function serious vision hearing problem In addition , additional exclusion criterion apply MRI study : Female subject pregnant positive pregnancy test 24 hour prior experiment exclude neuroimaging study . All subject question prior MRI scan possible occupational exposure metal sliver shaving , may become accidentally lodged tissue head neck . Subjects surgical clip shrapnel near brain blood vessel , subject cochlear implant , subject metallic body eye CNS , subject form implant wire metal device may concentrate radiofrequency field exclude MRI scan experiment possible risk MRI scanning . Those whose history suggestive problem also exclude MRI portion experiment . They may still participate behavioral MEG experiment . Subjects unable lie flat back 2 hour may eligible participate MRI scan .</criteria>
