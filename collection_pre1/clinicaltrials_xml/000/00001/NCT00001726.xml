	<brief_summary>This study examine composition dental plaque-a naturally occur substance stick teeth cause tooth decay gum disease . A good understanding plaque build mouth may help develop improved way control . Healthy normal volunteer age 18 65 work National Institutes Health main campus Bethesda , Maryland , may participate study . Candidates screen eligibility medical dental history . This study involve maximum five visit dental clinic . At first visit , participant dental examination , mold make mouth . To make mold , small plastic tray contain impression material place volunteer 's mouth hold place 2 minute set . The tray remove mold make impression . The mold use make mouthpiece use study 1 , describe , tooth fitting use study 2 , also describe . Volunteers participate one two study . Study 1 . Volunteers study 1 mouthpiece check second visit , teeth cleaning , mold put place . The mouthpiece wear 8 hour , time soft food eaten . Mouthwash use device place . At volunteer 's third ( last ) visit , mouthpiece remove volunteer spit tube collect saliva examination bacteria . Study 2 . Volunteers study 2 teeth clean second visit tooth fitting place onto back teeth dental adhesive . The fitting wear 72 hour , time volunteer eat regular diet brush teeth . Mouthwash use fitting place . At third , fourth fifth visit , fitting remove , necessary , tooth surface polish . The last fitting remove fifth visit volunteer spit tube collect saliva examination bacteria .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dental caries periodontal disease closely associate dental plaque , biofilm result microbial colonization tooth surface . Various experimental model describe initial phase colonization , include one utilizes enamel chip position within oral cavity period time 24 hour . Scanning electron microscopy chip remove 4 hr vivo reveal individual bacteria attach pellicle-coated surface . Growth pioneer organism result microcolonies merge form spread monolayer cocci rod . Over 80 % bacteria present early biofilms identify member four closely related viridans streptococcal specie , Streptococcus sanguis , S. oralis , S. mitis S. gordonii . Veillonella spp , Actinomyces naeslundii compose 5 % . Interestingly , veillonellae , actinomyces streptococci increase first 24 hrs colonization thereby suggest important role bacteria normal daily plaque accumulation [ early biofilm development ] . One major uncertainty raise wide-spread ability cell oral bacteria interact physically vitro whether coaggregations function vivo . Using direct immunofluorescence , demonstrate coincident juxtaposition dental plaque streptococci actinomyces , suggest know coaggregating partner may use coaggregation mean colonize enamel . Our overall goal determine spatial organization different viridans streptococci biofilms form initial colonization tooth surface . These bacteria include two group distinctive property . One group contain strain S. sanguis S. gordonii GalNAc-sensitive adhesion contain strain S. oralis specie complementary receptor intrageneric coaggregation . The model biofilm formation include vitro flow-cell model streptococci know adhesive property attach grow saliva-coated surface vivo model enamel chip colonize within oral cavity period time 72 hour . The result study provide significant insight involvement interbacterial adhesion biofilm development . Our goal study investigate spatial organization streptococci coaggregation partner actinomyces veillonellae biofilms form vivo compare vitro . We hope make significant advance understand distribution specie initial dental plaque formation . Since streptococci predominant organism early dental plaque , propose understanding contribution microbial community lead important advance design effective oral health regimen .</detailed_description>
