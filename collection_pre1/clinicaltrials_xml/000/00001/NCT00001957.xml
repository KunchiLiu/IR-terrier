	<brief_summary>This study aim increase understanding difficulty people recognize spoken word , especially noisy situation . Subjects must 12 18 year old history voice disorder , autism , stutter , aphasia , multiple sclerosis , traumatic brain injury , severe language disorder , psychiatric disorder . Group A subject must show reduced speech-in-noise score Group B subject must demonstrate speech-in-noise score within normal limit . The child perform series hear task take 1.5 2 hour , break halfway . A routine hearing test give . The child sit sound-treated room wear earphone depress button response sound repeat word . The word may quiet mixed noise . In test call `` immitance , '' air pressure change tone send miniature probe ear 1 minute . TEOAE ( transient-evoked otoacoustic emission ) test test inner ear click sound . At time , noise present probe opposite ear . The child listen series recording speech quiet noise ask repeat heard . These recording include monosyllabic word part sound cut ; word present several voice speak together ; two word present time , one ear ( child must repeat word ) ; two sentence present time , one ear ( child must repeat sentence present chosen ear ) . The risk study tiredness listen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Testing Possible Cause Reduced Ability Children Process Speech Noise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Five ten percent school-age child United States identify learn disability 10 20 % attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) . Many child difficulty task challenge auditory system . It estimate 3 7 percent child difficulty auditory process major factor interfere education ( Chermak Musiek , 1997 ) . Pinpointing physiological cause auditory process difficulty elusive . Intervention hamper lack knowledge possible physical cause therefore intervention address system rather cause auditory process difficulty . Indeed , whether problem peripheral central origin unclear . Identification physiological difference child auditory processing disorder may lead electrophysiologic identification potential auditory processing disorder . Thus possibility early intervention might reduce educational impact problem . The aim study investigate relationship efferent auditory neural system ability process speech noise . The study measure suppression otoacoustic emission population adolescent auditory process difficulty demonstrate reduced ability process speech noise ( Group A ) . These subject compare age sex match group adolescent speech-in-noise test score within normal limit ( Group B ) . The study population include 100 child age 12 18 year . All subject must demonstrate normal puretone threshold , speech recognition score quiet middle ear function measure acoustic immittance test . Furthermore , subject ' otoacoustic emission must reproducibility percentage within normal limit 2000 , 3000 , 4000 5000 Hz frequency band . Subjects complete auditory speech recognition test battery ( Scan-A NU6 multi-talker noise ) otoacoustic emission suppression test . The auditory recognition test measure subject ' ability recognize speech presence various type noise and/or filter . A group design use . Outcome parameter amount suppression dB group subject normal speech understand noise group reduce speech score noise relationship speech measure degree suppression .</detailed_description>
