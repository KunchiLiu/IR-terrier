	<brief_summary>This study important establish synthetic human parathyroid hormone 1-34 ( PTH ) beneficial treatment hypoparathyroidism , superior conventional therapy calcium calcitriol . Providing synthetic human parathyroid hormone 1-34 ( PTH ) patient unresponsive conventional therapy enable severe case hypoparathyroidism manage effectively investigational drug , PTH . The primary goal study ( 1 ) provide long-term PTH therapy patient respond conventional therapy ; ( 2 ) understand long-term effect therapeutic PTH replacement kidney function bone mineral density ; ( 3 ) study track linear growth bone accrual child hypoparathyroidism . ( 4 ) determine subject reach normal level peak bone mass time comparable normal age-matched healthy control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Vitamin D analog , conventional treatment hypoparathyroidism , associate chronic hypercalciuria due lack calcium-retaining effect kidney . This side effect usually occur even maintain serum calcium normal range may lead calcium deposition kidney ( nephrocalcinosis ) renal insufficiency . This study examine long-term effect subcutaneous parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) therapy calcium metabolism , bone , renal function . Our previous short-term pilot study compare subcutaneous PTH calcitriol demonstrate significant decrease urinary calcium excretion PTH therapy . Based upon result , hypothesize treatment PTH physiologic provide improved long-term metabolic control . Additionally , treatment PTH may avoid adverse side effect kidney associate conventional therapy . Patients initially come Clinical Center two week inpatient evaluation . Subsequent follow-up occur semiannually outpatient basis .</detailed_description>
