	<brief_summary>The propose study aim evaluate , investigate , follow-up patient suffer acute chronic liver disease . The study focus understand disease affect liver . Patients participate study first undergo routine check-up outpatient . They ask provide blood urine sample laboratory test undergo ultrasound liver . Ultrasound examination use sound wave determine size texture liver . After initial visit subject request follow-up year outpatient department similar check-up . Additional test may request throughout study provide information research study individual consent request . These test may include liver biopsy , skin biopsy , / specialize blood , plasma , lymphocyte examination . Subjects qualify medication presently study may offer opportunity benefit experimental therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Patients With Liver Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This general clinical research protocol allow evaluation , investigation long-term follow patient acute chronic liver disease . The protocol design study natural history pathogenesis various liver disease acute chronic hepatitis B , C , D E , primary biliary cirrhosis , primary sclerosing cholangitis , Wilson 's disease , hemochromatosis , nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) , noncirrhotic portal hypertension , hepatocellular carcinoma , cryptogenic poorly define form chronic liver disease . Patients initially see outpatient department undergo medical history physical examination . They series blood urine test abdominal ultrasound . Patients follow outpatient department visit every 1 12 month time undergo interim medical history brief examination blood study take . Liver biopsies do part protocol clinically indicate , separate consent form provide . In addition , patient may ask undergo skin biopsy , plasmapheresis , lymphapheresis , genetic analysis , Fibroscan procedures research purpose ( immunologic , virologic , genetic , study ) separate consent form provide . Patients qualify therapeutic trial antiviral immunomodulatory agent liver disease invite enter study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : An indefinite number patient acute chronic liver disease enrol study . Criteria selection follow : Age 2 year , male female . Evidence acute chronic liver disease evaluation outside refer physician . Absence significant medical illness might interfere prolong follow evaluation . Willingness enter study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : There specific reason exclude patient protocol ( exception plasmapheresis lymphapheresis , genetic analysis serum sample ) entail significant risk patient excessive clinical burden Liver Diseases Branch . Patients resolve chronic liver disease , patient chronic hepatitis B become negative HBsAg patient chronic hepatitis C become negative HCV RNA continue follow despite lack apparent disease disability . This document clearance hepatitis virus , indeed , associate resolution liver disease lack longterm adverse effect . Because data suggest chronic HBsAg carrier become HBsAgnegative patient chronic hepatitis C whose liver disease become inactive , still develop longterm consequence disease ( especially hepatocellular carcinoma ) , follow patient important . Plasmapheresis lymphapheresis : Patients fulfill criterion NIH Department Transfusion Medicine regard lymphapheresis donor . These include age ( less 65 year ) , weight ( great 120 pound ) , hematocrit ( great 30 percent ) , blood pressure ( le 120 diastolic great 90 systolic ) , temperature ( le 37.5 degree C ) . Because research procedure obtain reagent assay material , patient active relatively fit ( i.e . disable liver disease ) ask undergo procedure . The strict exclusion criterion active therapy interferon . The basis exclusion finding retrospective analysis recent trial recombinant human alpha interferon therapy chronic hepatitis B . In study , `` response rate '' rate clearance hepatitis B virus alpha interferon therapy lower among patient underwent lymphapheresis therapy ( 48 percent ) ( p less .01 ) . Lymphapheresis perform treatment seem affect outcome interferon therapy . These finding unexpected lead u avoid plasmapheresis lymphapheresis patient receive alpha interferon therapy . The reason lymphapheresis might interfere response alpha interferon know , probably relate importance intact , healthy immune system process recovery chronic viral infection . Fibroscan : Consecutive adult patient ( age 18 older ) chronic liver disease liver biopsy perform within previous 6 month schedule undergo liver biopsy eligible participation aspect study . Patients liver biopsy inadequate histological scoring ascites exclude aspect study . Genetic Analysis Serum Samples : All adult subject Hct le 30 pediatric subject Hct le 26 excluded phlebotomy necessary isolation DNA material blood cell . Inability understand sign inform consent also exclude patient aspect study .</criteria>
