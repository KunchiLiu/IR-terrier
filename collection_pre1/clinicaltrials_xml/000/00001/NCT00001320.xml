	<brief_summary>Brain cell communicate release chemical call neurotransmitter . In order brain cell transfer information , one cell release neurotransmitter recognize receptor locate surface another cell . One neurotransmitter dopamine . Abnormal dopamine transmission see patient substance abuse different neuropsychiatric disorder include schizophrenia . A radioactive drug call IZBM ( I-123 iodobenzamide ) also bind certain dopamine receptor . IZBM see Single Photon Emission Tomography ( SPECT ) . Therefore , use IZBM SPECT scan , researcher find `` map '' location dopamine receptor brain . Patients participate study must also select genetic study conduct NIMH . Patients schizophrenia select NIMH research study title , `` Neurobiological Investigation Patients Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders Their Siblings '' ( 95-M-0150 ) . Normal patient volunteer select another NIMH study title , `` Inpatient Evaluation Neuropsychiatric Patients '' ( 89-M-0160 ) . All aspects clinical care genetic analysis patient covered study , information pertain IBZM SPECT scan cover study . This study directly benefit patient participate . However , information gather may contribute fast accurate diagnosis schizophrenia eventually well treatment disorder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Abnormalities dopaminergic neurotransmission describe substance abuse different neuropsychiatric disorder include schizophrenia . [ I-123 ] IBZM radioligand widely employ SPECT image dopamine type 2 type 3 receptor ( D2 D3 , respectively ) fluctuation level endogenous dopamine . [ I-123 ] IBZM SPECT use SPECT Lab Clinical Brain Disorders Branch several year without adverse effect . Pharmacological effect IBZM unlikely due minimal amount use observed . We propose use [ I-123 ] IBZM SPECT explore following question : 1 ) Can previously find relationship N-acetylaspartate ( NAA ) measure dorsolateral prefrontal cortex striatal dopamine activity patient schizophrenia replicate also find normal subject ? 2 ) Do allelic variant gene dopamine type 2 ( DRD2 ) type 3 ( DRD3 ) receptor , dopamine transporter ( SLC6A3 ) , enzymes involved dopamine biosynthesis ( TH ) metabolism ( COMT , MAOA ) affect D2 receptor availability vivo ? This technical protocol describe procedural aspect [ I-123 ] IBZM SPECT . It intend sufficient clinical study . All subject volunteer study recruit among individual previously consent participate clinical study one two NIH protocol include genetic testing . Schizophrenia patient recruit among NIMH inpatient participate NIH protocol # 89-M-0160 , `` Inpatient Evaluation Neuropsychiatric Patients '' ( Egan 1999a ) . Normal volunteer recruit among participate NIH protocol # 95-M-0150 , `` A Neurobiological Investigation Patients Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders Their Siblings '' ( Egan 1999b ) , include recruitment normal control group whose first degree relative free mental illness . All detail relate clinical care genetic analysis contain two protocol associated consent form ; detail relate [ I-123 ] IBZM SPECT study , per se , discuss protocol , require separate informed consent volunteer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients schizophrenia recruit exclusively among inpatient participate clinical study Clinical Brain Disorders Branch NIMH NIH protocol # 89M0160 ( Egan 1999a ) genetic data already available . Normal volunteer recruit exclusively among individual volunteer study NIH protocol # 95M0150 ( Egan 1999b ) normal control subject genetic data already analyze . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Pregnancy : All woman childbearing age must undergo pregnancy test prior injection radioactive isotope . If pregnancy test positive woman reason believe might pregnant , exclude study . Breastfeeding : Women breastfeed exclude study avoid unwarranted risk child . Iodine sensitivity : Subjects prior reaction iodine , iodine compound , shellfish exclude study . Also , subject history thyroid disease dysfunction exclude study . Substance abuse : Subjects history recent substance abuse exclude study . Metal object body : Subjects metal object body specify MRI protocol ( 91M0124 ) exclude study . INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA : Prior participation NIMH inpatient NIH protocol # 89M0160 . Schizophrenia diagnosis accord DSMIV criterion . EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA : Coexistence another mental illness time study . If patient experience mental illness past ( e.g . learn disability major depression ) , judge fully recover . INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR NORMAL CONTROLS : Prior participation normal volunteer NIH protocol # 95M0150 . No Axis I Axis II diagnose . EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR NORMAL CONTROLS : Subjects Axis I II disorder exclude . Subjects concomitant medical neurological disorder require ongoing medication , may affect central nervous system exclude .</criteria>
