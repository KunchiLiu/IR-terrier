	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety effectiveness thalidomide treat Sjogren 's syndrome . In autoimmune disease , immune system attack body 's tear gland salivary gland , cause dry mouth dry eye . Thalidomide show promise treat autoimmune disorder , rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus . Women Sjogren 's syndrome dry eye dry mouth may eligible study . Women childbearing potential consider participation severe birth defect associate thalidomide . Also , since Sjogren 's syndrome affect many few men woman , men exclude pilot study would number assess separate group . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test , electrocardiogram , chest X-ray pregnancy test . Tests also do measure conduction electrical impulse along nerve evaluate dryness eye . Participants randomly assign take either thalidomide placebo ( look-alike pill active ingredient ) . The thalidomide dosage increase gradually start dose 50 Mg. 300 Mg. , depend side effect . Women childbearing age tubal ligation longstanding infertility pregnancy test every 2 4 week . Participants come clinic first study visit week 4 , 8 12 follow procedure : - Patient assessment dry mouth ( rat scale `` bad ever '' `` best ever '' - Patient assessment dry eye ( rat scale `` bad ever '' `` best ever '' - Patient health questionnaire disease assessment rating - Saliva collection - Rose-Bengal dye test dryness - examination eye bright light follow administration drop contain dye - Schirmer 's I test dryness - placement thin rectangular strip filter paper eye follow administration anesthetic drop - Blood test measure blood cell count level various immune substance blood , evaluate liver kidney function - Urine test evaluate kidney function - Nerve conduction test - measurement speed nerve conduct electrical impulse . Two nerve arm one nerve leg test . Participants also contact telephone every week report side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Thalidomide Treat Sjogren 's Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sjogren 's syndrome ( SS ) systemic autoimmune disease predominantly affect woman . SS characterize lymphocytic infiltration lacrimal salivary gland lead secretory function loss , symptom dry eye dry mouth . After bone marrow transplantation , patient chronic graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) develop symptoms oral dryness salivary gland lymphocytic infiltrates indistinguishable SS . Thalidomide study treatment Sjogren 's syndrome , pilot study suggest may beneficial treatment number autoimmune disease include rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus , various skin disorder , well treatment chronic graft versus host disease . Major adverse effect thalidomide include teratogenicity , neuropathy sedation . The study 12 week randomize , double-blinded , pilot clinical trial design screen potential efficacy evaluate safety potential adverse effect 300 mg thalidomide daily compare placebo 28 patient primary SS ( PSS ) .</detailed_description>
