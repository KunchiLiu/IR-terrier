	<brief_summary>Stiff-man Syndrome ( SMS ) chronic , progressive disorder nervous system . It associate painful muscle spasm rigidity involve muscle limb , trunk , neck . The cause disease unknown , researcher believe may result autoimmune process . Patients Stiff-man Syndrome may produce antibody attack enzymes require normal function nervous system . Steroids , plasmapheresis , intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg ) give relieve symptom Stiff-man Syndrome . However , none therapy prove significantly effective . This study attempt determine effectiveness intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg ) treatment Stiff-mann Syndrome . Patients participate study divide two group . Group one receive 2 injection IVIg month three month . Group two receive 2 injection placebo `` inactive sterile water '' month three month . Following three month treatment , group one begin take placebo group two begin take IVIg additional 3 month . The drug consider effective patient receive experience significant improvement muscle function , mobility , stiffness .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stiff-man Syndrome ( SMS ) chronic , disable neurological disorder characterize severe painful axial limb rigidity enhance anxiety , sudden motion external stimulus . Although cause SMS unknown , immunologic mechanism implicate basis circulate autoantibody patient 's serum CSF , GAD ( glutamic acid decarboxylase ) , enzyme involved synthesis GABA ( gamma aminobutyric acid ) . Uncontrolled study also show plasmapheresis , corticosteroid high dose intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg ) variably effective improve clinical symptom patient . The purpose present study demonstrate double blind , placebo-control design , efficacy IVIg patient SMS . The effect IVIg assess series objective measurement include muscle function , mobility stiffness . Changes circulate anti-GAD antibody also examine pathogenetic role cause SMS determine . If IVIg prove effective , valuable tool treatment patient currently dependent high dos Valium ( 60-100 mg daily ) , steroids experience significant side effect .</detailed_description>
