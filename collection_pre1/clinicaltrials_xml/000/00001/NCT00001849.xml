	<brief_summary>Cushing Syndrome endocrine disorder cause production hormone cortisol . Cortisol produce adrenal gland response production ACTH pituitary gland . Between 10 % 20 % patient hypercortisolism ( Cushing Syndrome ) ectopic production hormone ACTH . Meaning , hormone release normal site , pituitary gland . In many case ectopic ACTH produce tumor lung , thymus , pancreas . However , approximately 50 % patient source ACTH find even use extensive imaging study CT scan , MRIs , nuclear scan ( 111-indium pentetreotide ) . The ability test locate source hormone production dependent change anatomy / dose adequate uptake radioactive agent . The inability detect source ectopic ACTH production often result unnecessary pituitary surgery irradiation . Unlike previously describe test , positron emission tomography ( PET scan ) ability detect pathologic tissue base physiologic biochemical process within abnormal tissue . This study test whether [ 18-F ] -fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) use high dose [ 111In-DTPA-D-Phe ] -pentetreotide use successfully localize source ectopic ACTH production. &lt; TAB &gt;</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Between 10 percent 20 percent patient hypercortisolism ( Cushing syndrome ) ectopic production adrenocorticotropin hormone ( ACTH ) cause cortisol excess . In approximately 50 percent patient , source ACTH find despite detailed extensive examination include image study compute tomography scanning , magnetic resonance imaging , octreotide scan use conventional low dose indium-111 pentetreotide ( [ ( 111 ) In-DTPA-D-Phe ] -pentetreotide ) . The sensitivity specificity image study depend anatomic alteration and/or dose adequate uptake radiopharmaceutical . In contrast , positron emission tomography ( PET ) ability detect pathologic tissue base physiologic biochemical process within abnormal tissue . This protocol test whether [ 18F ] -L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine ( 18F-DOPA ) use high dose [ 111In-DTPA-D-Phe ] -pentetreotide use localize successfully source ectopic ACTH production . In addition study examine whether administration glucocorticoid antagonist mifepristone improve sensitivity standard dose [ 111 In-DTPA-D-Phe ] pentetreotide . Patients participate arm study second standard dose scan rather high dose scan . Others receive high dose octreoscan instead .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All eligible patient invited participate protocol . Patients adult possible ectopic Cushing syndrome . Since men woman affect ectopic Cushing syndrome , sex study . All ethnic racial group risk include . Patients must willing return NIH followup study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Pregnant lactate woman . A pregnancy test perform woman childbearing potential ( age 55 ) unless history hysterectomy . Children ( age less than18 ) exclude . Because ectopic ACTH secretion rare age group , likelihood benefit less balance risk radiation . Patients take medication alter CYP3A4 activity eligible mifepristone study , since P450 system metabolize mifepristone . Such participant would receive clinical HOCT instead , LOCT negative . Patients hypokalemia ( K &lt; 3.5 mEq/L ) , despite medical therapy replacement mineralocorticoid antagonist also exclude mifepristone study . The presence : severe active infection . clinically significantly impaired cardiovascular ( e.g. , history abnormally low ejection fraction , presence moderate pulmonary fluid overload leg edema , blood pressure 190/100 ) , abnormal coagulation ( PT PTT elevate 30 percent normal value ) , hematopoietic ( hematocrit le 30 percent , hemoglobin 10 g/dl , white count 3000 K/UL , platelets 100,000 K/mm ( 3 ) ) , hepatic ( liver enzymes elevate 3fold normal value ) renal function ( plasma creatinine level 2.0 ) . impaired mental capacity markedly abnormal psychiatric evaluation precludes informed consent . body weight 136 kg , limit table use scan area . combine blood withdrawal , six week precede study , great 450 ml . know allergy [ 111InDTPADPhe ] pentetreotide somatostatin analogue . strong evidence Cushing disease . This include positive IPSS lesion pituitary MRI .</criteria>
