	<brief_summary>This study identify clinical sign symptom critical diagnose swallow disorder characterize swallow problem various patient population , patient Parkinson 's disease , stroke , post-polio syndrome , multiple sclerosis condition cause swallow abnormality . Patients swallow difficulty enrol NIH neurology speech pathology protocol may eligible study . Participants undergo follow procedure : 1 . Oral examination-A neurologist speech pathologist examine patient 's swallowing function . The patient interview difficulty food intake , chew swallow meal . 2 . Ultrasound examination-Ultrasound creates image area inside body use sound wave . With patient sit position , 3/4-inch transducer ( device transmit receive sound wave ) place chin visualize tongue movement swallow . 3 . Modified barium swallow-While standing sitting , patient swallow 1/2 teaspoon flavor barium ( radioactive substance ) six time ( total 3 teaspoon ) , tongue pharynx ( tube lead mouth esophagus ) scan videotaped . The barium give three consistencies-thin , medium thick ( pudding-like ) . 4 . Electromyography-A small plastic strip wire attach placed patient 's chin . The patient swallow 1/2 ounce barium three time row , movement chin muscle swallow displayed . Patients may also ask swallow 5/8 cup barium twice ; head tilt upward head untilted . Depending test result , patient may ask return follow-up study monitoring .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients neurological neuromuscular condition may silent aspirator risk laryngeal penetration aspiration abnormal oropharyngeal function thus risk aspiration pneumonia serious effect . By provide identification component abnormal swallow , compare swallow across task , may avoid aspiration instruct patient preventative compensatory swallow technique . We study oral , pharyngeal upper esophageal phase swallow use ultrasonic image videofluoroscopy patient neurologic , genetic , systemic , neuromuscular condition . Most previous study swallow utilized one diagnostic imaging technique thus provide incomplete swallow assessment procedure unique , limited capability visualize anatomy physiology swallow . We also plan compare discrete continuous swallow population . While motor physiology discrete swallowing ( i.e. , single swallow ) well study , little know detail oral , laryngeal , pharyngeal coordination sequential swallow part continuous drinking -- common event everyday eating . A portion protocol study effect fast-paced movement sequence coordination tongue , velum , larynx , pharynx continuous drinking . Videofluoroscopy ultrasound may pair use individually collect data normal subject patient know dysphagia perform sequential discrete swallow task . A number timing displacement measurement structure activate task make digitized video image swallow , analysis carry subsequently across task subject .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Any Clinical Center inpatients outpatient know suspected dysphagia NIH institute protocol include study well patient admit specifically protocol . Those patient risk oropharyngeal dysfunction screen initially complete selfassessment swallow questionnaire , interview staff and/or family member . Patients demonstrate appropriate sign symptom dysphagia oral motor impairment screen assessment consider protocol : Difficulty swallow food pill . Changed swallow ability . Coughing choke eat . Shortness breath swallow . Food back mouth nasal passage . Fever voice change swallow . Pain swallow . Unexplained loss weight . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients severely demented severely compromise exclude sufficient cognitive ability follow direction . Patients nonambulatory exclude brace support within fluoroscopy unit . Highly agitated individual also exclude unable remain confined equipment . Infants child age 3 exclude due radiation risk develop visual system .</criteria>
