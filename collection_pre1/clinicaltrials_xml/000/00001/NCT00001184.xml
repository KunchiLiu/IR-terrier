	<brief_summary>This study investigate patient Crohn disease ulcerative colitis body immune system control inflammation gastrointestinal tract ( stomach intestine ) specifically , lymphocyte ( type white blood cell ) function inflammatory response . This protocol involve experimental treatment . Patients age 8 75 year age Crohn disease ulcerative colitis symptom inflammatory bowel disease may eligible study . Screening test may include follow : medical history physical examination , routine blood test , examination stool specimen , X-rays barium enema upper GI series , proctosigmoidoscopy , colonoscopy , gastroduodenoscopy , small bowel biopsy . Participants receive medical treatment accord best generally accept measure treat Crohn disease ulcerative colitis . This may include anti-inflammatory drug , immunosuppressive drug , antibiotic treat infection . A surgical consultation may recommend patient whose disease respond medical treatment . If surgery remove intestinal tissue recommend , qualify gastrointestinal surgeon perform procedure . In addition , participant may undergo follow procedure : - Blood draw No 450 milliliter ( 30 tablespoon , 15 ounce ) blood take adults 6-week period . A maximum 7 ml ( 1/2 tablespoon ) blood per kilogram ( 2.2. pound ) body weight obtain child within time period , 3 ml/kg take one time . - Leukapheresis This procedure do collect large quantity white blood cell . Whole blood collect needle arm vein , similar donate blood . The blood circulate machine separate component , white cell remove . The rest blood return body , either needle another needle arm . - Intestinal biopsy Intestinal tissue obtain colonoscopy intestinal biopsy patient require procedure part standard medical care . Patients give sedative reduce anxiety , conscious procedure . A flexible tube insert rectum large intestine , allow physician see intestinal mucosa . At various place , small piece tissue pluck .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This natural history protocol provide evaluation patient idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease ( ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease , IBD associate immunodeficiency genetic disease chronic granulomatous disease Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome , additional undefined inflammatory condition gut ) either inpatient outpatient basis . The purpose protocol assess extent activity disease patient , conduct immunologic study lymphocyte antigen-presenting cell derive peripheral blood tissue , administer monitor treatment , study genetic risk factor diseases . This study also use provide mechanism procurement intestinal sample obtain site outside NIH time medically indicate surgical endoscopic procedure patient IBD . In addition , allow procurement ( send-in ) blood immunological study well DNA preparation IBD susceptibility gene discover work association genetic polymorphisms/mutations phenotype immune abnormality observe IBD patient . This protocol also allow procurement blood tissue sample healthy volunteer ( without IBD ) NIH use control group comparison immunologic genetic data obtain IBD patient enrol . The immediate aim study define immunologic abnormality present identify genetic susceptibility factor patient disease . The long-term goal protocol identify specific target development novel therapeutic inflammatory bowel disease .</detailed_description>

Patients clinical feature consistent unclassified inflammatory bowel disease histologic evidence inflammation intestine ; OR 3 . Patients clinical feature consistent inflammatory bowel disease ( intestinal inflammation ) , include limited abdominal pain , fistula , weight loss , diarrhea , hematochezia melena suggestive extraintestinal symptom ( pyoderma , erythema nodosum , axial articular arthralgia , uveitis , fatigue , fever ) , diagnosis verify ; OR 4 . Patients define genetic syndrome link inflammatory bowel disease risk without symptom finding consistent IBD . 5 . All subject enrol age 875 ( great equal 18 year old HermanskyPudlak syndrome patient subject without IBD ) . 6 . To participate research biopsy endoscopy , subject must follow lab value within two week procedure : Hematocrit great equal 30 % Platelet count great 100,000 PT INR less equal 1.3 PTT prolong less equal 3 second 7 .
