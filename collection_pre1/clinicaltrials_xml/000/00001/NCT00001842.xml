	<brief_summary>This study examine feasibility give cell growth stimulant granulocyte donor day donation rather day . People donate granulocyte ( infection-fighting white blood cell ) transfusion patient severe white cell deficiency often give steroid call dexamethasone growth factor call G-CSF day donation . These drug stimulate white cell production , allow many cell collect would otherwise possible . A single dose G-CSF give healthy people increase white cell count four five time next day . It would preferable , however , give G-CSF day donation , possible . Therefore , study measure white cell count healthy people various interval inject G-CSF alone G-CSF dexamethasone . The study compare follow : granulocyte count seven different interval injection drug drug ; effect G-CSF inject vein skin ; effect give G-CSF alone dexamethasone . Each participant undergo four procedure , four week apart follow : donate small blood sample ; receive injection G-CSF skin vein ; take either two dexamethasone tablet two placebo tablet . Small blood sample draw 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 24 hour drug give . Participants answer question feel drug give various interval take drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The administration granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) increase white blood cell count granulocyte donor prior donation become increasingly common practice . G-CSF give subcutaneously donor day prior donation , generally 12 24 hour start apheresis . It would advantageous able give G-CSF collect granulocyte day . However , single important factor optimize granulocyte collection donor 's pre-collection granulocyte count . Therefore , decrease count would result less cellular component . The purpose study assess granulocyte count healthy subject 8-hour period single 5 microgram/kg intravenous dose G-CSF without dexamethasone . Sixteen subject study . Each donor study four separate time . The four mobilization protocol study G-CSF 5 micrograms/kg give intravenously , G-CSF 5 micrograms/kg subcutaneously , G-CSF 5 micrograms/kg intravenously plus dexamethasone 8 mg orally , G-CSF 5 micrograms/kg subcutaneously plus dexamethasone 8 mg orally . The order route administration assign randomly . White blood cell count , neutrophil count donor symptom measure G-CSF administration 1/2 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 24 hour administration . The neutrophil count measure within first 8 hour G-CSF compare count measure 24 hour G-CSF .</detailed_description>
