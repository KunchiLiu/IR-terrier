IL-12 enhances cytolytic activity cytotoxic T NK cell , induces interferon-gamma ( IFN gamma ) production T NK cell . This open-label Phase I study design evaluate safety immunologic/microbiologic effect interleukin-12 administration HIV-infected patient concomitant disseminate Mycobacterium avium ( MAC ) infection . Fifteen patient document disseminated MAC randomize receive double-blinded placebo escalate dos IL-12 addition anti-MAC chemotherapy standard anti-retroviral therapy six week . IL-12 administer subcutaneously , escalate dos every month dose range 30 ng/kg , 100 ng/kg , 300 ng/kg , individual maximum tolerate dose ( IMTD ) reach . Should patient receive 2 consecutive blood culture negative MAC course study lower dose , he/she dose escalate . Those patient receive placebo 6 week cross receive full treatment course IL-12 . Each new dose dose escalation take place inpatient basis . Once patient clinically stable dose , patient maintain dose outpatient remainder month . Total IL-12 administration exceed 12 week , 24 total dos .</brief_summary>
