	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety effectiveness new formulation eye drop use treat cystine crystal form corneas patient cystinosis . Cystinosis inherit disease cause defective enzyme , excessive amount amino acid cystine accumulate body . Among others , symptom include poor growth development kidney failure . In addition , 10 20 year , cornea-the outside cover eye iris pupils-becomes pack cystine crystal small , painful break may develop . This corneal condition treat cysteamine eye drop . This study design provide additional information medication Food Drug Administration require approve marketing . The study examine , two separate simultaneous investigation , safety effectiveness new cysteamine formulation . In study , treatment begin , patient complete eye examination , photograph eye take use bright flash . Safety Study Children adult currently enrol cystinosis study National Institutes Health may participate trial . They receive current cysteamine formulation one eye new preparation eye . The drop give every hour waking hour . Patients observe daily first week treatment call 2 week 4 week check side effect , . At 6 month , undergo repeat eye examination . Patients ( parent ) keep daily diary record condition eye . Effectiveness Study Children adult Ann Arbor , Michigan , LaJolla , California , NEI clinic may enrol study . Participants receive medication describe safety trial . They observe daily first week repeat eye examination , include photograph , month 3 , 6 , 9 12 see crystal decrease . Patients keep daily diary condition eye .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>New Cysteamine Eye Drops Formulation Treat Corneal Crystals Cystinosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary purpose study evaluate safety efficacy new formulation cysteamine eye drop treat child adult cystinosis cystine crystal accumulation cornea . The safety new formulation evaluate among 30 child adults history cystinosis treatment NIH current preparation cysteamine eye drop . Patients randomize current preparation one eye new formulation eye . Vision , blurring , redness , pain , irritation , itch evaluate eye Week 1 , Week 2 , Week 4 , Month 6 . Complete ophthalmic evaluation include corneal slit lamp examination photograph perform baseline 6 month NEI Clinical Center . Efficacy evaluate among 15 patient ( 5 NEI Clinical Center , Ann Arbor Michigan , La Jolla , California ) receive cysteamine eye drop prior enrollment . Patients randomize current preparation one eye new formulation eye . Vision , blurring , redness , pain , irritation , itch evaluate eye complete ophthalmic assessment include corneal slit lamp examination photograph perform baseline , Month 3 , Month 6 , Month 9 , Month 12 . The primary efficacy outcome measure improvement new formulation treat eye 1.00 unit corneal photograph scale 0.00 3.00 0.25 increment compare baseline grade . This scale grade density number crystal cornea . The safety efficacy study conduct concurrently .</detailed_description>
