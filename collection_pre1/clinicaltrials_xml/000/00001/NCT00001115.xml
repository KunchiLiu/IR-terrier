	<brief_summary>Part A : To evaluate impact HSV suppression acyclovir ( ACV ) HIV burden patient asymptomatic HSV infection high risk HSV reactivation . Part B : To characterize change plasma HIV RNA level measure HIV burden 10 day course ACV treatment acute HSV infection . Approximately 70 % patient infected HIV concurrently infect HSV . There new evidence suggest HSV may act co-factor HIV disease progression . This study attempt determine upregulation HIV RNA occur symptomatic HSV reactivation also occur asymptomatic HSV reactivation suppression HSV result decrease level HIV RNA .

	<detailed_description>Approximately 70 % patient infected HIV concurrently infect HSV . There new evidence suggest HSV may act co-factor HIV disease progression . This study attempt determine upregulation HIV RNA occur symptomatic HSV reactivation also occur asymptomatic HSV reactivation suppression HSV result decrease level HIV RNA . There need determine pattern association HSV HIV . Part A : 60 approve HIV infect patient randomize either suppressive ACV therapy match placebo 12 week . Serology HSV serum antibody obtain screen full history physical exam perform Day 1 interval examination Weeks 2 , 4 , 8 12 . Extensive clinical exam conduct regular schedule throughout 12 week . Part B : 15 approve HIV infect patient receive treatment ACV resolution lesion . All patient monitor Day 9-12 ACV therapy crust resolution HSV lesion follow 3.5 month . AS PER AMENDMENT 3/11/97 : Noncommercial active acyclovir make available Part A patient wo develop acute HSV study Part B patient develop acute HSV completion acute phase treatment ( i.e. , follow-up phase ) .</detailed_description>
