	<brief_summary>The development brain female result combination factor . During puberty estrogen play role influence brain development . Cultural environmental factor also play role development brain . Female patient Turner syndrome lack ability produce estrogen due undeveloped ovary . Therefore , Turner syndrome perfect condition study estrogen ( lack estrogen ) influence person 's behavior thinking . This study compare cognitive difference ( visual motor skill , visual-spatial , psychosocial behavior , visual memory ) patient Turner syndrome normal patient control . Researchers use Weschler Intelligence Scale Children-Revised ( WISC-R ) along test scale measure different aspect patient 's cognitive ability . In addition study review patient Turner syndrome previously receive estrogen replacement infant child relate research study . Researchers hope demonstrate estrogen replacement improve cognition behavior girl Turner syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Estrogen Cognition Girls With Turner Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Estrogen influence brain development female puberty . Environmental cultural factor interact biological effect estrogen brain consequently cognition behavior . Turner syndrome female lack endogenous estrogen result dysgenetic ovary . Turner syndrome therefore represent unique , estrogen-deficient model study biological effect estrogen cognition behavior . The specific aim project : 1 ) document , cognitive difference girl Turner syndrome age 5 adult ( less equal age 50 ) versus age-matched , female control . 2 ) examine differential effect continuous estrogen replacement infancy early childhood cognitive social function unique , previously approve , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , treatment trial ( 87-CH-0152 ) . Specifically , hypothesize estrogen replacement early childhood reduce cognitive deficit girl Turner syndrome . In addition , hypothesize degree socialization ability girl correlate social-behavioral social recognition ability . Finally , hypothesize early ( infancy 8 year ) long estrogen replacement result less impairment visual-motor ability , visual-spatial ability , socialization ability , affective competence compare later ( 9 12 year ) estrogen replacement girl Turner syndrome . Children Turner syndrome control test Outpatient Departments two approve site protocol 87-CH-0152 ; NIH Thomas Jefferson University .</detailed_description>
