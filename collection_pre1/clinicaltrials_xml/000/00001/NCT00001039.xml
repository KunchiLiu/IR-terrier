	<brief_summary>To assess feasibility use culture stain technique quantify tissue Mycobacterium avium Complex ( MAC ) burden bone marrow . To correlate compare change MAC bone marrow burden quantitative MAC blood culture result baseline 4 8 week treatment . MAC easy detect blood , although doctor generally believe MAC blood `` spill-over '' infection part body . Traditionally , study potential treatment MAC focus MAC change blood . This study compare MAC change blood bone marrow , another tissue MAC often find .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>MAC easy detect blood , although doctor generally believe MAC blood `` spill-over '' infection part body . Traditionally , study potential treatment MAC focus MAC change blood . This study compare MAC change blood bone marrow , another tissue MAC often find . Patients receive clarithromycin ethambutol 48 week ; become intolerant study drug may receive suggest substitute drug ( azithromycin rifabutin ) . Patients receive bone marrow biopsy baseline either 4 8 week . Patients evaluate week 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 .</detailed_description>
