	<brief_summary>Turners Syndrome genetic condition female result abnormal chromosome . Girls Turner syndrome short child adult . Although growth hormone secretion almost always normal , give injection growth hormone Turner syndrome girl may increase rate growth . In addition , girl Turner syndrome normal ovary . In normal girl ovary begin produce small amount female sex hormone , estrogen 11 - 12 year age . As girl grow old level estrogen increase . Estrogen responsible change girl know feminization . During feminization hip grow wider , breast develop , increase rate growth , eventually girls experience first menstrual period . This study design evaluate effect low dose estrogen , growth hormone , combination low dose estrogen growth hormone adult height girl Turner syndrome . Patients enter study age 5 12 randomly place one four group . 1 . Group one receive low dose estrogen 2 . Group two receive growth hormone 3 . Group three receive low dose estrogen growth hormone 4 . Group four receive placebo `` sugar pill '' Once start , treatment continue patient approach adult height , growth slow less 1/2 inch precede year . This usually occur age 15 16 . Patients see outpatient clinic every 6 month study receive routine check-up blood urine test , hand/wrist X-rays determine bone age . On patient 's yearly visit density bone measure spine forearm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Biosynthetic Growth Hormone and/or Ethinyl Estradiol Adult Height Patients With Turner Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adult woman Turner 's syndrome quite short . Several treatment use increase growth rate patient . They include oxandrolone ( 1 ) , growth hormone ( 2 , 3 ) , low dose estrogen ( 4 ) . However , ability hormone treatment increase adult height never evaluate control clinical trial . We propose evaluate effect adult height low dose estrogen , growth hormone , combination low dose estrogen growth hormone . Patients enter study age 5 12 assign randomly one four group ( 3 treatment group placebo ) . The randomized assignment double-blind throughout study . Treatment maintain adult height ( first height measurement precede annual growth rate &lt; 1.5 cm ) . Beginning age 12 , estrogen treatment 4 group change standardized regimen increase estrogen dose , child study undergo secondary sexual change appropriate age . In addition , study assess effect growth hormone estrogen treatment bone density , parallel , separate , study , effect treatment cognition learn ability .</detailed_description>
