	<brief_summary>Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) represent common cause blindness patient age 60 . The major cause vision loss disease due development choroidal neovascular membrane formation ( CNVM ) . Several clinical trial proven eye `` well-defined '' CNVM lesion readily demarcate fluorescein angiography successfully treat laser photocoagulation . However , 87 % eye present `` ill-defined '' CNVM lesion well demarcate fluorescein angiography amenable laser photocoagulation . No beneficial treatment form choroidal neovascularization establish . Histopathologic study demonstrate presence inflammatory reparative response retina patient ill-defined choroidal neovascularization . Since corticosteroid show downregulate many cellular factor involve inflammation repair , present study design assess ability corticosteroid injection around eye prevent severe vision loss associate `` ill-defined '' choroidal neovascularization set age-related macular degeneration . The study organize randomize open label control clinical trial involve 2 phase . Phase 1 involve 40 patient establish feasibility safety treatment modality . Phase 2 place emphasis efficacy study .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis AMD define presence drusen one eye age 50 . Vision 20/400 bad fellow eye due exudative complication CNVM fovea . Visual acuity 20/80 20/200 study eye . Ineligibility clinically proven laser photocoagulation protocol . No patient age less 50 . No patient previous laser therapy surgery choroidal neovascularization study eye . No patient choroidal neovascularization , study eye , associate ocular disease pathologic myopia , ocular histoplasmosis , posterior uveitis , idiopathic , etc . No patient presence geographic atrophy serous pigment epithelial detachment fovea study eye . No patient decreased vision , study eye , due retinal disease attributable illdefined CNVM , serous retinal pigment epithelial detachment , nonexudative form ARM , geographic atrophy , inherit retinal dystrophy , uveitis , epiretinal membrane others . No patient decrease vision , study eye , due significant medium opacity corneal disease cataract . No patient systemic local therapy may alter natural course illdefined CNVM , especially antiangiogenic treatment thalidomide alpha interferon . No patient intraocular pressure great equal 26 history suggest glaucoma ( e.g. , history diagnosis glaucoma , past present use medication control intraocular pressure , disc/nerve fiber layer defect suggestive glaucoma ) glaucomatous visual field defect document Goldmann Humphrey perimetry take within 6 month qualification . No patient contraindication perform necessary diagnostic study , especially use fluorescein angiography . No patient know history untoward complication corticosteroid therapy , include elevate intraocular pressure response topical periocular corticosteroid . No patient medical problem make consistent followup treatment period unlikely ( e.g. , stroke , severe MI , terminal carcinoma . No patient current use likely need systemic ocular medication know toxic lens , retina optic nerve , : Deferoxamine , Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine ( Plaquenil ) , Tamoxifen , Chlorpromazine , Phenothiazines , Ethambutol , Ocular systemic steroid use steroidcontaining inhaler nasal spray utilize 6 day month averageany regular use pill contain steroid .</criteria>
