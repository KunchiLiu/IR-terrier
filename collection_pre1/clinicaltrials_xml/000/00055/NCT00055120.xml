	<brief_title>When Start Anti-HIV Drugs Patients With Opportunistic Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite advent highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) , many HIV infect patient without access antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) present acute OIs . Such presentation pose management problem , currently data available whether initiate HAART acute presentation benefit . Reports immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome ( IRIS ) mark increase hypoxia new pulmonary infiltrates associate initiation ART patient AIDS . There also concern drug interaction ART antimicrobial use treat present OI . This study evaluate possible benefit cost initiate ART HIV infect patient present AIDS-defining OI . There 2 step study . In Step 1 , patient randomly assign one two study arm . Arm A receive ART within 2 week start therapy acute OI . Arm B ART defer Step 2 , least 4 week 32 week begin therapy acute OI . Only Arm B participant enter Step 2 , likely begin Weeks 6 12 . The study make follow drug available construction antiretroviral ( ARV ) regimen : emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( FTC/TDF ) , lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/RTV ) , stavudine ( d4T ) . Use ARV drug discretion study official . Drug regimen addition substitution make case-by-case basis . Patients follow 48 week 10 study visit . All study visit include physical exam , medication history , blood collection . Patients ask complete questionnaire assess health status adherence select visit .</detailed_description>
