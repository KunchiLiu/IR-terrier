	<brief_summary>The purpose study compile registry patient Fabry disease , inherit metabolic disorder . In disease , enzyme call a-galactosidase A , normally break lipid ( fatty substance ) call globotriaosylceramide ( Gb3 ) , miss function properly . As result , Gb3 accumulate , cause problem kidney , heart , nerve , blood vessel . It know exactly lipid accumulation cause problem , another lipid storage disease call Gaucher disease illness reverse accumulated lipid remove repeat intravenous ( vein ) infusion deficient enzyme . The Fabry disease registry voluntary anonymous list patient include information health allow doctor follow change symptom test result time . It also allow doctor compare symptoms patient receive certain therapy receive therapy . The goal registry : - Better understand natural history Fabry disease , include disease variation within affected family ; - Provide basis develop guideline disease management ; - Evaluate treatment affect course disease ; - Provide high-quality data analysis help continuously develop good treatment . Patients age biochemical genetic evidence Fabry disease ( i.e. , individual deficiency enzyme a-galactosidase A mutation gene encodes enzyme , ) eligible study . This worldwide study include 100 patient participate Fabry disease study NIH . These patient come NIH Clinical Center require participation Fabry disease study . No additional procedure require current registry study . NIH patient take part registry study lifetime , long follow NIH Fabry disease . At regularly schedule NIH clinic visit , participant routine medical procedure examination deem necessary doctor . The result blood urine test take visit enter registry database . Blood test include information genotype ( determination gene mutation responsible disease ) , a-galactosidase A level , Gb3 level , creatinine . Urine test result include creatinine clearance ( measure kidney function ) protein evaluation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL TITLE : Registry Fabry Disease : A Multicenter , Longitudinal Observational Study PROTOCOL IDENTIFIER : FOS ( Fabry Outcome Survey ) PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT : Post Marketing Outcome Survey ( Outcome Survey ) SURVEY OBJECTIVES/ENDPOINTS : The primary objective outcome survey : - enhance understanding natural history Fabry disease , include intra- inter-familial variation - provide basis development management guideline Fabry disease - evaluate impact therapeutic intervention clinical course Fabry disease - generate data analysis enable continuous improvement Fabry disease treatment - collect long term safety efficacy data patient treat Replagal enzyme replacement therapy INCLUSION CRITERIA : This registry/outcome survey open patient age , male female , confirm diagnosis Fabry disease . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : - Patients unwilling give inform consent . - Patients receive enzyme replacement therapy Replagal Fabry Disease - Patients currently enrol ongoing blind clinical trial product consider investigational . NUMBER OF SUBJECTS PLANNED AND DURATION OF SUBJECT PARTICIPATION : There predetermined number patient must enrol outcome survey . Patients diagnose ( biochemically genetically ) Fabry disease consent participate follow undetermined amount time ( i.e. , sponsor close outcome survey patient withdraws consent ) . TREATMENTS ADMINISTERED AND TREATMENT SCHEDULE : Patients consent participate outcome survey either untreated treat Replagal ERT . It recommend patient follow increment determine necessary treating physician . It also recommend data patient enter outcome survey bi-annual basis ( every six ( 6 ) month ) . Patients supply Replagal charge result participate Fabry Outcome Survey ( FOS ) . Patients receive Replagal participation ongoing open label clinical trial compassionate program . Additionally , patient may receive commercially available product . SURVEY ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE : It recommend patient follow clinically relevant interval determine treat physician . Data collect entered FOS database soon possible physician assessment . SURVEY METHODOLOGY : Observational data record FOS database base routine clinical evaluation perform treat physician . STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY : The statistical analysis FOS data perform bio-statistician designated Shire HGT accordance document company guideline standard operating procedure .</detailed_description>
