	<detailed_description>High-generalized anxiety concomitant many anxiety disorder often regard vulnerability marker disorder . One characteristic patient anxiety disorder high trait-anxious individual inappropriate expectancy aversive event . The overall aim present protocol investigate mechanism may promote development aversive expectancy use expectancy-based , associative-learning model . During aversive conditioning phasic explicit-cue ( e.g. , light ) repeatedly associate aversive unconditioned-stimulus ( e.g. , shock ) , organism develops fear explicit cue well environmental context experiment take place . We obtain preliminary evidence suggest contextual fear represent aspect aversive state central anxiety disorder . In protocol , seek evidence relevance contextual fear mood anxiety disorder . One important determinant contextual fear human animal predictability : contextual fear increase aversive event ( e.g. , electric shock ) unpredictable , opposed predictable . The present protocol examine role predictability aversive state condition threat appraisal individual mood anxiety disorders.. A second aim examine interaction experimentally-induced anxiety cognitive process , specifically work memory , mood anxiety disorder . A final aim investigate whether relationship heighten emotional reactivity threat impair cognitive function threat patient anxiety disorder susceptible treatment cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) .</detailed_description>
