	<brief_summary>This study compare side effect two laser treatment diabetic macular edema , common condition patient diabetes . In macular edema , blood vessel retina-a thin layer tissue line back eye-become leaky retina swell . The macula-the center part retina responsible fine vision-may also swell cause vision loss . Traditional laser treatment ( argon blue green , yellow ) macular swell , edema , cause scar expand possibly lead loss vision . A different type laser ( diode ) may less damaging effect eye few long-term adverse effect , know . The result study side effect treatment use design large study effectiveness . The study also examine whether vitamin E reduce damage cause laser treatment . Patients elevate cholesterol level invite participate cholesterol reduction part study compare normal-pace cholesterol reduction accelerate reduction . Patients 18 year age old type 1 type 2 diabetes macular edema may eligible study . Candidates screen follow test procedure : - Medical history physical examination . - Eye examination assess visual acuity ( eye chart test ) eye pressure , examine pupil , lens , retina eye movement . The pupil dilate drops examination . - Blood test measure cholesterol vitamin E blood level , blood clotting time , hemoglobin A1C ( measure diabetes control ) , evaluate liver kidney function . - Eye photography help evaluate status retina change may occur future . Special photographs inside eye take use camera flash bright light eye . - Fluorescein angiography evaluate eye 's blood vessel . A yellow dye inject arm vein travel blood vessel eye . Pictures retina take use camera flash blue light eye . The picture show dye leak vessel retina , indicate possible blood vessel abnormality . - Multifocal electroretinogram measure electrical response generate within retina . The test , take 1-1/2 hour , painless . Participants randomly assign take 1600 IU vitamin E placebo ( inactive , look-alike pill ) daily . After take pill 3 month , patient require laser treatment randomly assign one two laser therapy . ( Patients macular edema eye receive treatment , one eye . ) For procedure , eye drop put eye numb surface contact lens place eye laser beam application . Several visit may require additional laser treatment . The maximum number treatment depend well working . Patients return follow-up visit 1 , 3 , 6 month first treatment , every 6 month either patient return 3-year visit ; last enrolled patient return 1-year visit ; patient request leave study . During follow-up visit , patient ' response treatment evaluate repeat test several screen exam .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize pilot study important first step plan large multi-center clinical trial evaluate medical laser approach could improve visual outcome patient diabetic retinopathy . This study provide preliminary safety efficacy data therapy well allow assessment performance ocular outcome study design use subsequent trial . If safety concern , result pilot helpful design large multicenter clinical trial provide data estimate expect treatment effect . Using factorial design , study compare ( 1 ) photocoagulation use diode ( micropulse ) laser mild Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Studt ( ETDRS ) style ( continuous wave laser use green yellow wavelength ) focal photocoagulation , ( 2 ) effect treat antioxidant ( high dose Vitamin E ) placebo prior follow laser photocoagulation . The primary outcome visual acuity drop increase 15 letter baseline three year enrollment . The secondary outcome 50 % reduction retinal thickening measure Optical Cohenrence Tomography ( OT ) , two-step reduction macular thickness compare standard stereoscopic fundus photograph , 50 % reduction area leakage measure fluorescein angiography 1 year amd 3 year initial laser compare baseline . Additional outcome include time ( baseline ) first laser treatment number retreatments require course study . These outcome assess potential use future trial . We concern follow specific question regard safety efficacy : Safety Is risk visual loss patient clinically significant diabetic macular edema potentially different across treatment group ? Efficacy Is evidence treatment combination could effective reduce retinal thickening ? Is evidence Vitamin E may affect ability either photocoagulation method reduce retinal thickening , vice versa ? What estimate treatment effect vision ? Is number laser treatment require achieve reduction retinal thickening similar across treatment group ? A tertiary objective study examine effect dramatically reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol patient diabetic macular edema elevate serum lipid . Change vision change retinal thickness compare across three group ; ( 1 ) patient elevate serum lipid baseline , ( 2 ) patient elevated lipid baseline receive standard care treatment , ( 3 ) patient elevated lipid baseline aggressively treat pharmacologically . This tertiary objective assess feasibility randomization .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patients type 1 2 diabetes . 2 . Patients clinically significant macular edema least one eye . 3 . Best correct visual acuity 20/400 good measure ETDRS chart eye ( ) clinically significant macular edema . 4 . May proliferative diabetic retinopathy scatter photocoagulation must perform six month ago . 5 . Ocular medium sufficiently clear allow quality fundus photography . 6 . If aphakic pseudophakic , lens removal must occur least 6 month prior enrollment . 7 . Patient 's medical status must include likelihood survival 5 year . 8 . Willingness accept randomization diet drug therapy lower elevate lipid level . 9 . Understand sign inform consent . 10 . Patients 18 year age since population interest primarily old 18 . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Retinopathy require scatter photocoagulation immediately . 2 . Ocular disease diabetic retinopathy may confound outcome study ( e.g . agerelated macular degeneration , drug toxicity , uveitis , etc. ) . 3 . Poor likelihood survival ( one year ) due systemic disease ( separate diabetes ) . 4 . Poor glycemic control hemoglobin A1C great 12 % within one month baseline . 5 . Past current liver disease , precludes use lipidlowering drug . 6 . Vitamine E supplementation amount myltivitamin ( 60 IU/day ) one month prior entry study . 7 .
