	<brief_summary>This study examine effect certain investigational anti-cancer drug genetic protein makeup cell . The finding enter database may use : 1 ) determine optimal dose drug provide benefit least harmful side effect ; 2 ) predict patient great chance develop side effect great chance benefit drug . Patients 18 year age old receive anti-cancer drug flavopiridol perifosine NIH clinical trial may eligible study . Participants undergo follow procedure start treatment first treatment cycle look genetic chemical change produce response study drug : - Blood draw . - Buccal cell brushing : Collection buccal cell ( cell line inside cheek ) inside cheek use soft bristle brush second several time . The patient rinse mouth salt water 1 minute spit cup . - Buccal cell biopsy ( side mouth ) : For procedure , local anesthetic give numb biopsy area . Then , small piece tissue inner line mouth remove small sharp cookie-cutter instrument . The biopsy finding compare cheek brushing see information similar . - Tumor biopsy : In patient whose tumor easily accessible , skin abdominal fluid , tissue biopsy request . Depending type location tumor , biopsy may do forceps , large needle ( needle biopsy ) , cookie-cutter instrument ( punch biopsy ) , small knife ( excisional biopsy ) . All procedure do local anesthetic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A significant problem drug development novel small molecule lack available tissue ( surrogate tissue ) allow assessment molecular biochemical effect ( targeted-therapies ) drug action . The information obtain surrogate tissue might help u validate previous preclinical study agent also dose rational way . Oral keratinocytes , accessible non-invasive mean , might useful assess drug action . The propose study seek investigate genetic , molecular , biochemical effect novel agent oral buccal mucosal cell . Patients already enrol Phase I II clinical trial neoplastic disease Clinical Center undergo oral cytobrushing therapy determine molecular biochemical effect novel agent oral mucosa cell . Similar study perform peripheral blood mononuclear cell . In order validate compare compare oral cytobrush methodology , subject undergo oral punch biopsy study . Some subject also undergo tumor biopsy , accessible available .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients ( male , female , great equal age 18 year ) enrol clinical trial Clinical Center receive novel small molecule modulate cell cycle progression prevention treatment neoplastic disease . Able sign inform consent . Patient 's primary NIH physician agree appropriateness patient 's participation study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients unable undergo cytobrushing ( significant mucositis ) . Noncompliant patient . Patients unable provide baseline sample ( patient already receive therapy ) . Exclusion biopsy : patient significant bleeding diathesis , receive active anticoagulation platelet le 10K . Cognitively impaired subject exclude trial .</criteria>
