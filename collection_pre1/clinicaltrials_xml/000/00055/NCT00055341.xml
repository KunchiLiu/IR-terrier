	<brief_summary>Pegylated interferon ( PEG-interferon ) ribavirin accept treatment hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection . However , HCV infection progress differently patient coinfected HIV hemophiliac . This study evaluate effectiveness PEG-interferon ribavirin treat HCV HIV infect hemophiliac .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hemophiliacs symptomatic disease often receive blood product correct clot factor deficiency . Prior routine use heat inactivation screen donor blood specific viral pathogen , hemophiliac routinely expose , infect , viruses hepatitis B ( HBV ) , HCV , HIV . Studies hemophiliacs suggest several important finding warrant investigation , include : 1 ) hemophiliac infect HCV may rapid progression liver failure death ; 2 ) pool blood concentrate multiple donor lead high risk mixed infection ; 3 ) different clinical outcome alter immune response HIV coinfected hemophiliac may enhance understand mutant virus selection associate clinical outcome . The purpose trial determine response rate PEG-interferon ribavirin hemophiliac HCV alone HCV/HIV coinfection . Participants study follow 48 week treatment 36 month treatment . Participants study admitted Clinical Research Center 2 day begin study . Participants 3 additional study visit first week study . After , study visit occur Weeks 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 24 , 32 , 40 , 48 . The follow-up visit 4 , 12 , 24 week follow end treatment . Study visit include physical exam blood test . Patients respond treatment follow prospective cohort study 3 additional year evolution virus associate immune response evaluate .</detailed_description>
