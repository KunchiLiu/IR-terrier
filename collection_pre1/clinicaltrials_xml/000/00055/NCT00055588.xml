	<brief_summary>This study identify change occur nervous system healthy normal volunteer learn cycle task . Healthy subject 18 year age old cycle 16 minute may eligible study . Candidates screen brief medical history physical examination . Participants assign one three group : - Complex training : Cycling 16 minute constant speed 60 rpm frequent change pedal resistance . - Simple training : Cycling 16 minute constant speed 60 rpm change pedal resistance . - No training : Remaining seat bike 16 minute perform exercise . Participants cycle 16 minute train task , plus 4 minute train . Reflexes measure nerve conduction study somatosensory evoke potential ( SSEP ) record training . Nerve conduction study measure speed nerve conduct electrical impulse strength connection nerve muscle . For study , probe place skin calf muscle knee deliver small electrical stimulus , wire tap skin record impulses . SSEP recording , measure excitability brain sensory stimulus , collect electrode place scalp . After train period , multiple train stimulation ( MTS ) apply 10 minute . For MTS , weak electrical current deliver 10 second every 10 second . These stimulus produce buzz sensation without pain , discomfort , muscle twitching . The MTS follow another 4 minute cycle . Participants also undergo transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . For procedure , insulated wire coil hold scalp . A brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse travel scalp skull cause small electrical current brain cortex ( out part brain ) . The stimulation may cause twitch muscle face , arm , leg . The electrical activity muscle record computer record device , use electrode attach skin tape .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In previous study , show locomotor train frequent change pedal resistance ( complex training ) elicit significant improvement locomotor performance compare train consist constant pedal resistance ( simple training ) . Behavior gain associate complex training correlate down-regulation excitability alpha-motoneurone pool control muscle involve train task , measure change soleus H-reflex , raise hypothesis cause-effect link performance improvement modulation spinal cord function . The purpose protocol determine down-regulation excitability alpha-motoneuron pool require improvement locomotor performance . To address issue , hypothesize up-regulation alpha-motoneuron excitability cancel improvement locomotor performance elicit complex training subject undergoing period simple training . The result study would provide novel information spinal substrates underlie learn locomotor task intact human could relevant design rehabilitative strategy patient locomotor disorder .</detailed_description>
