	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Chemoprevention therapy use certain drug try prevent development recurrence cancer . Celecoxib may effective preventing development recurrence lung cancer former heavy smoker . PURPOSE : Randomized phase II trial study effectiveness celecoxib prevent development recurrence lung cancer former heavy smoker risk develop cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Celecoxib Preventing Lung Cancer Former Heavy Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine feasibility chemoprevention lung cancer celecoxib former heavy smoker risk develop primary second primary lung cancer . - Determine safety side effect drug patient . - Determine quality life patient treated drug . - Determine role COX-2-specific inhibitor ( e.g. , celecoxib ) antitumor immunity within lung microenvironment patient . - Determine effect COX-2 inhibition angiogenesis patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study . Patients stratify accord presence preinvasive lesion ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral placebo twice daily 6 month . - Arm II : Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily 6 month . Treatment arm continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess every 6 month treatment annually 4 year . Patients follow annually 4 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 180 patient ( 90 per treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
