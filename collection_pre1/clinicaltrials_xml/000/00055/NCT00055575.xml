	<detailed_description>1 . Objective The goal research project evaluate role cholinergic system behavioral cognitive symptom observe mood disorder human , use functional brain neuroimaging technique . Specific aspect behavior cognition impair mood disorder , include selective attention , set-shifting memory ; also evidence depressed subject exhibit mood congruent processing bias whereby readily process negatively tone information compare positively tone information . This cognitive pattern lend evaluation functional brain imaging , term identify anatomical correlate specific behavioral cognitive deficit well characterize effect pharmacological manipulation . Attention memory function closely tie cholinergic neurotransmitter system . The cholinergic system one neurotransmitter system implicate pathophysiology mood disorder . Evidence suggest major depressive episode , cholinergic system hypersensitive acetylcholine . Agents enhance muscarinic cholinergic receptor function increase depressive symptom depressed subject , produce symptom depression healthy subject . The preclinical literature specifically implicate muscarinic receptor indicate use muscarinic antagonist , context animal model depression , result improvement behavioral analog depression . 2 . Study Population The accrual ceiling protocol 388 participant . 143 currently depress patient major depressive disorder , 100 currently depress patient bipolar disorder , 145 healthy control participate study . 3 . Design The antimuscarinic agent , scopolamine , administer double-blind , placebo control manner across study . Clinical rating , cognitive task neuroimaging conduct various timepoints evaluate clinical effect scopolamine depression , assess acute mood response scopolamine ; study neurobiological correlate clinical behavioral drug effect . 4 . Outcome Measures The propose inpatient outpatient project investigate role cholinergic neurotransmission behavioral cognitive symptom observe depressed phase major depressive disorder ( MDD ) bipolar disorder ( BD ) . The study propose identify anatomical correlate mood congruent processing bias , work memory , attention set-shifting deficit observe depressed subject . Further , study evaluate effect cholinergic antagonist , scopolamine , performance deficit neural activity brain region recruit subject perform task . Dose escalation study conduct determine high dos scopolamine increase antidepressant response rate patient major depressive disorder . Based early work show predictive value baseline neuroimaging data predict treatment outcome , stratify participant baseline group base expect response scopolamine treatment . This approach expect reveal neuromodulators influence processing brain structure recruit perform task , healthy subject major depressive disorder . The combined use functional brain image pharmacological manipulation evaluate role neurotransmitter dysfunction depression may direct u potential therapeutic approach .</detailed_description>
