	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial see combine bevacizumab PEG-interferon alfa-2b work treat patient metastatic unresectable carcinoid tumor . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill deliver cancer-killing substance . PEG-interferon alfa-2b may stop growth cancer stop blood flow tumor . Combining bevacizumab PEG-interferon alfa-2b may kill cancer cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab PEG-Interferon Alfa-2b Treating Patients With Metastatic Unresectable Carcinoid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine progression-free survival rate patient metastatic unresectable carcinoid tumor treat bevacizumab PEG-interferon alfa-2b . II . Determine tumor response rate ( complete partial ) patient treat regimen . III . Determine biochemical response rate patient treat regimen . IV . Determine qualitative quantitative toxicity reversibility toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This randomize study . Patients treat 2 stage . Stage I : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive bevacizumab IV day 1 . Arm II : Patients receive PEG-interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 , 8 , 15 . In arm , course repeat every 3 week . Patients progressive disease 9 week proceed stage II . All patient proceed stage II 18 week stage I . Stage II : Patients receive bevacizumab IV day 1 PEG-interferon alfa-2b SC weekly . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) remain CR 2 additional course come study . Patients follow survival .</detailed_description>
