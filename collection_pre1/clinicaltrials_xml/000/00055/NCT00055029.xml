	<brief_summary>This study explore cause eye problem X-linked juvenile retinoschisis ( XLRS ) , inherited disease cause vision loss primarily young male . The vision loss , worsens time , result schisis , splitting , layer retina ( tissue line back eye ) . A good understanding XLRS develops might lead improved treatment . Patients 9 month age old XLRS female suspect carrier gene responsible disease ( mother patient ) may eligible study . Other family member patient also may enrol . Patients undergo follow test procedure : - Personal family medical history review past current medical condition treatment , particularly regard eye disease , construct family tree . - Eye examination assess visual acuity ( eye chart test ) examine pupil , lens , retina , eye movement . The pupil dilate drops examination . - Photography retina help evaluate status retina . - Specialized eye test evaluate color vision , field vision , ability see dark . - Electroretinogram ( ERG ) examine happen eye flash bright light . For test , patient sits dark room 30 minute eyes patch . Then , small silver disk electrode tap forehead , eye patch remove , surface eye numb eye drop contact lens place eye . The patient look inside large empty bowl light flash , first dark light turn inside bowl . The contact lenses sense small electrical signal generate retina light flash . - Blood test examine DNA genetic study XLRS . Family member provide blood sample genetic study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : The overall goal protocol well understand etiology XLRS disease facilitate research identify potential treatment disease . The specific primary objective study : 1 . Investigate relationship genotype phenotype X-Linked Retinoschisis correlate four phenotype severity class two class genotype ( refer Section 7. definition ) . This first step develop comprehensive genotype-phenotype correlation . 2 . Characterize anatomical functional characteristic retinoschisis refine phenotype scale investigate characterize specific XLRS1 mutation generate well-documented genotype-phenotype correlation map . With opportunity study genotype phenotypes many affected male genotype family member , secondary objective study develop detailed pedigree affect family . This information may use develop preliminary risk estimate potential carrier female . Study Population : Up 500 participant may enroll study . A minimum 150 participant expect male diagnose X-Linked Retinoschisis . Participants may recruit NIH also participate off-site location . The quality genetic observation directly proportional number affected individual genetically-different family enrol . Design : This natural history , multi-center , registry study enroll male diagnose X-Linked Retinoschisis family member affected individual . Onsite affect male undergo clinical examination blood drawn genotyping . Onsite unaffected participant undergo eye examination . Blood may also draw onsite unaffected participant require . Sites outside NIH participate referral center accumulate cohort . Offsite affect male participant forward blood sample record previous eye examination NEI review analysis . Offsite unaffected participant forward record previous eye examination may provide blood sample although require . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome categorization proband genotype phenotype determination relationship two .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Eligible participant must satisfy one criterion : Male diagnose XLinked Juvenile Retinoschisis ( proband ) . A proband define first XLinked Juvenile Retinoschisis diagnose male give family contact NIH participation study ; Female suspect carrier ( i.e. , mother proband ) ; Other relative proband include affect unaffected male female . The participant ( participant legal guardian ) understand sign protocol inform consent document minor participant age 7 17 must provide assent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Affected male ineligible participation : The participant significant medium opacity obstruction preclude complete fundus examination include retinal photography . The participant unwilling unable contribute blood sample genotyping exist genetic analysis data document family member . Both affect unaffected individual ineligible participation : The participant young two year ( see NIH ) young nine month ( participate offsite medical record review blood submission ) . The participant unable cooperate study procedure without anesthesia .</criteria>
