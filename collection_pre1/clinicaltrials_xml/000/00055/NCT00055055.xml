	<brief_summary>This study examine family one sibling sibling pair , twin pair , develop systemic rheumatic disease one , see two differ follow : - Blood cell metabolism ; - Types cell blood ; - Environmental exposure genetic factor might explain one developed disease . Families one sibling develop systemic rheumatic disease , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus , scleroderma , dermatomyositis , myositis , , eligible study . The sibling may may twin , must gender within 5-year age difference . Biological parent , , case , child , also include study . Normal , healthy volunteer serve control subject . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Medical history physical examination . Participants also ask permission obtain medical record review . - Questionnaires environmental exposure work , home , elsewhere . Probands ( participant rheumatic disease ) healthy sibling also answer question infection , vaccination , medication dietary supplement , sun exposure , stressful event year disease diagnosis affect sibling . - Blood urine collection follow test : - Routine blood chemistry study rule certain disease medical problem ; - Evidence past toxic exposure certain infection ; - Presence cell mother child blood vice versa . ( Recent study suggest pregnancy delivery , cell mother baby may exchange circulate body many year , possibly cause problem ) ; - In twin sibling pair , presence certain gene may common patient systematic rheumatic disease compare unaffected sibling normal volunteer ; - In identical twin , comparison blood cell metabolism see metabolism differs people rheumatic disease . Participants may ask permission blood urine sample store obtain previously collect blood tissue biopsy specimens longer need clinical care , research purpose . They may also ask give additional blood urine sample . Participants follow every year 5 year ( either person questionnaire ) evaluate change condition . The final 5-year evaluation repeat questionnaire procedures describe .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Families With Twins Siblings Discordant Rheumatic Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most autoimmune disease think develop result chronic immune activation dysregulation select environmental exposure genetically susceptible individual . Current evidence suggest adult juvenile form systemic rheumatic disorder -- define rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) , idiopathic inflammatory myopathy ( IIM ) -- share many common clinical manifestation , immune response , genetic , hormonal environmental risk factor , possible pathogeneses . Conversely , study imply rheumatic disease , currently define , may compose homogeneous subgroup , know elemental disorder , different pathogeneses . This protocol explore pathogenic mechanism systemic rheumatic disorder possible elemental disorder evaluation family monozygotic dizygotic twin sibling discordant systemic rheumatic disorder ( twin-sib pair ) . Parents , normal volunteer offspring microchimeric female twin-sibs also evaluate need experimental design portion protocol . A clinical evaluation , use standardized physician patient clinical environmental exposure questionnaire , specimen collection 400 twin-sib pair discordant systemic rheumatic disorder perform confirm diagnosis , document medical history assess possible risk factor implicate development autoimmunity . This study evaluate child , make 25-50 % twin-sib pair , adult similar way attempt understand possible similarity difference pathogeneses systemic rheumatic disorder base upon age onset . Hypothesis-testing study assess difference peripheral blood cell gene activation/suppression , level type microchimerism affect unaffected individual , select genetic risk factor disorder occupational hormonal exposure hypothesize potential risk factor disease . Exploratory study conduct begin ass environmental risk factor systemic rheumatic disorder well understand association among phenotype genotype . Biologic specimen -- include blood , urine , clinical specimen biopsy longer necessary clinical care -- collect directed biomarker assay development repositories future research .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : The minimum inclusion criterion need enrollment twin pair sibling pair , define eligible proband his/her eligible twin sibling , willing able give inform consent , enroll study , complete questionnaire donate blood urine sample ( case child , parent/legal guardian must also willing able provide inform consent ) . Proband inclusion criterion : Children ( &lt; 18 year age ) adult ( 18 year age ) require diagnosis systemic rheumatic disorder ( American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) criterion adult juvenile form RA , SLE , SSc , IIM ( per ( 92 ; 93 ) ) . Regarding childhoodonset disease : JRA define age onset &lt; 17 year age ; diseases age onset &lt; 18 year . Probands diagnose within 5 year enrollment study , least one twin sibling gender within 5 year age without recognize systemic rheumatic disorder autoimmune disease available study . Twinsibling inclusion criterion : Children adult twin sibling proband share biological parent , without recognize systemic rheumatic autoimmune disorder , gender within 5 year age proband . If monozygotic twin enrol family , another unaffected nontwin sibling share biological parent enrol proband available allow loglinear genetic analysis . All probands unaffected sibling need least one year age time autoimmune disease diagnosis . In case triplet great multiple , sibling eligible enrollment . Parent inclusion criterion : Individuals genetic father mother proband twinsib . Both parent enrol whenever possible . Normal volunteer inclusion criterion : Healthy control , recruit part via NIH Normal Volunteers program , age ( within 5 year ) , gender racematched ( feasible ) subset probands control need specific study . Normal volunteer good health , without recognize systemic rheumatic disorder autoimmune disease , take antiinflammatory medicine , include nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) corticosteroid . Offspring microchimeric woman criterion : Biological offspring woman probands found microchimeric . These offspring enrol normal volunteer attempt confirm source mother microchimerism . For subject : ability subject parents/legal guardian provide inform consent aspect study full protocol information provide . Should participant enroll time his/her twin/sibling willing able give inform consent , his/her twin/sibling never enrolls ( eg . Due longer willing able give inform consent ) , enrol participant remain study his/her data use analysis pertinent his/her twin/sibling . Data analysis also occur manner enrol participant sibling enroll , never send blood sample and/or questionnaire . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Exclusion criterion protocol subject : 1. severe trauma vaccination within 8 week enrollment ; 2 . Still disease/systemiconset pauciarticular JRA ; 3. medical illness judgment investigator allow safe blood draw clinical evaluation need study participation ; 4. cognitive impairment ; 5. inability give inform assent consent . Exclusion criterion twinsibs : Not share biological parent ( halfbrothers halfsisters ) . Known criterion systemic rheumatic disease autoimmune disease ( example : RA/JRA , SLE/JSLE , SSc/JSSc , IIM/JIIM , Type 1 diabetes , Psoriasis , Still disease/systemiconset pauciarticular JRA , Celiac sprue , Autoimmune thyroid disease , Idiopathic Thrombocytopenia Purpura , Multiple sclerosis , Myasthenia gravis , Systemic vasculitis Vitiligo ) . Exclusion criterion normal volunteer : Recognized systemic rheumatic disorder autoimmune disease , history cancer take antiinflammatory medicine , include nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) corticosteroid , severe trauma vaccination within 8 week .</criteria>
