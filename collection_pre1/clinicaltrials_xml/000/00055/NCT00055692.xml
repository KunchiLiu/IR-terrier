	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Unresectable Nonmetastatic Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine efficacy bevacizumab , term progression-free survival disease stability response , patient unresectable nonmetastatic hepatocellular cancer ( HCC ) without main portal vein invasion . II . Determine safety drug patient . III . Assess tumor vascular perfusion kinetics , dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MRI , patient treatment regimen . IV . Determine effect vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) -inhibition drug circulating level VEGF relate cytokine also contribute HCC pathogenesis ( include bFGF , TGF-alpha , IGF-II ) potential alteration level prognostic variable patient . V. Determine effect VEGF-inhibition drug hepatic function hepatitis viral activity cirrhosis patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter , pilot study . Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment continue every 2 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 18-46 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
