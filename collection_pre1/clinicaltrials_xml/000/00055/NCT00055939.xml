	<brief_title>Exatecan Mesylate Treating Children With Relapsed Refractory Rhabdomyosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine objective response rate ( complete partial response ) pediatric patient relapse refractory rhabdomyosarcoma treat exatecan mesylate . - Determine time tumor progression patient treat drug . - Determine median survival survival 6 12 month patient treated drug . - Assess pain patient treat drug . - Evaluate quantitative qualitative toxic effect drug patient . - Evaluate pharmacokinetics drug patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , nonrandomized , multicenter study . Patients receive exatecan mesylate IV 30 minute day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 6 additional course beyond CR . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 13-27 patient accrue study within 1 year .</detailed_description>
