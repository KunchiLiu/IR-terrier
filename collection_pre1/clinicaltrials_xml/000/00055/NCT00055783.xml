	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine response rate patient recurrent Hodgkin 's lymphoma treat monoclonal antibody Hu1D10 . - Determine duration response progression-free survival patient treated drug . - Determine toxicity drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive monoclonal antibody Hu1D10 IV 2 hour . Treatment repeat weekly total 4 dos absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow week 5 8 every 3 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 9-24 patient accrue study within approximately 12 month .</detailed_description>
