	<brief_summary>While people HIV experience significant destruction immune system , people appear preserve immune function control virus without drug . Early treatment anti-HIV drug may help preserve immune system , allow control virus drug stop . This study evaluate immune system response HIV infect people treat anti-HIV drug soon infect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Studies identify potent CD4 T helper ( Th ) cell response infected people , show correlation virus-specific Th cell low level viremia . Early institution potent antiviral therapy early stage acute HIV infection lead strong Th cell response , analogous see people able control viremia absence antiviral therapy . This may potent antiviral therapy able protect virus-specific Th cell become activate , thus cell lose early stage infection . This study characterize immune response patient acute HIV infection receive antiretroviral therapy determine effect interruption therapy people immune response HIV similar patient long-term non-progressing infection . Participants study follow June 2004 . Study visit vary every month schedule discretion study official . Study visit include interview blood test .</detailed_description>
