	<brief_summary>This phase II trial see combine bevacizumab docetaxel work treat woman locally advance metastatic breast cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill deliver cancer-killing substance . Combining chemotherapy monoclonal antibody therapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Docetaxel Treating Women With Locally Advanced Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response rate woman locally advance metastatic breast cancer treat bevacizumab docetaxel . II . Determine side effect regimen patient . III . Correlate soluble activate endothelial cell marker adhesion molecule , quantitation tumor and/or endothelial cell apoptosis , quantitation microvessel density clinical outcome patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute week 1 3 docetaxel IV 60 minute week 1 , 2 , 3 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 12 course absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . After completion 6 course combine treatment , patient ongoing response may receive bevacizumab alone absence disease progression . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 16-27 patient accrue study within 14-27 month .</detailed_description>
