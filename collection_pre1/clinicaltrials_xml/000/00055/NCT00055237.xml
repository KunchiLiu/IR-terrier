	<brief_summary>This study examine safety effectiveness experimental drug bevacizumab treat non-acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) AIDS-associated Kaposi 's sarcoma ( KS ) . KS tumor depend formation new blood vessel growth . Bevacizumab antibody protein call vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) produce body involve blood vessel growth . Bevacizumab may block action VEGF , thus help shrink KS lesion . Patients 18 year age old Kaposi 's sarcoma restrict skin life threatening may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood urine test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , chest x-ray , , need , image study evaluate internal tumor . Participants receive bevacizumab intravenously ( vein ) week 2 week every 3 week National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Clinical Center . The first infusion take 90 minute , second take 60 minute , subsequent infusion take 30 minute . Infusions may take long , however , drug well tolerate slow infusion rate . Patients evaluate follow test procedure : - Physical examination , assessment drug side effect , measurement KS lesion , photograph lesion week first 6 week therapy , every 3 week . - cluster differentiation 4 ( CD4 ) cell count human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) viral load HIV-positive patient every 12 week . - Biopsies lesion : upon enter study , week 12 , time response tumor therapy end treatment , treatment end week 18 later . - Additional biopsy , request . ( Additional biopsy require . ) - Other procedure , compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan , medically indicate . Patients may continue bevacizumab therapy indefinitely benefit , long substantial toxicity condition would cause stop receive protocol remain open .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : This phase II study determine activity bevacizumab , putative antiangiogenic agent , Kaposi 's sarcoma ( KS ) . Bevacizumab humanize recombinant antibody vascular endothelial cell growth factor ( VEGF ) , important cytokine pathogenesis KS . OBJECTIVES : To assess antitumor effect bevacizumab 15 mg/kg administer intravenously every three week patient human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -associated Kaposi 's sarcoma ( KS ) . Other objective include assessment antitumor effect bevacizumab 15 mg/kg administer intravenously every three week patient classical KS ; assessment toxicity profile bevacizumab HIV-infected HIV-negative patient KS ; exploration preliminary fashion effect bevacizumab KS progression free survival ; study number biochemical parameter , include stromal cell-derived factor-1 ( SDF-1 ) expression KS lesion ; human herpes virus-8 ( HHV-8 ) viral load peripheral blood mononuclear cell ; serum vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) level course treatment ; change viral interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) level course treatment . ELIGIBILITY : Key eligibility parameter include HIV-associated classical Kaposi 's sarcoma , age great equal 18 year , life expectancy great 6 month . Patients HIV infection must either KS progression regimen highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) least one month , KS regression optimize regimen HAART 4 month longer . DESIGN : Patients sequentially enrol , administer load dose 15 mg/kg bevacizumab intravenously day 1 , administer 15 mg/kg bevacizumab intravenously every 3 week begin one week load dose . The drug temporarily discontinue toxicity , intercurrent major surgical procedure , factor would pose safety concern . Patients undergo biopsy KS lesion entry , cycle 4 , day 21 , time formal response patient stop treatment . Patients undergo number test well , include blood test non-invasive image study KS lesion .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Age great equal 18 year . Kaposi 's sarcoma pathologically confirm Center Cancer Research ( CCR ) pathology . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status less equal 2 . Life expectancy great 6 month . The following hematologic parameter : Hemoglobin great 9 g/dl ; White blood cell ( WBC ) great 1000/mm^3 ; Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great 750/mm^3 ; Platelets great 75,000/mm^3 ; Prothrombin time ( PT ) partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) less equal 120 % control , unless patient presence lupus anticoagulant . The following hepatic parameter : Bilirubin le equal 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) unless patient receive protease inhibitor therapy know associate increased bilirubin : case total bilirubin less equal 7.5 mg/dl direct fraction less equal 0.7 mg/dl . Examples protease inhibitor know increase bilirubin level include indinavir , ritonavir , nelfinavir , atazanavir . Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) /glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( GOT ) less equal 2.5 time upper limit normal . Either Serum creatinine less equal 1.5 mg/dL measure creatinine clearance great equal 60 mL/min . Either Urine protein le 1+ measure 24 hour urine protein le 500 milligram . Blood pressure : systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) less 160 mm/Hg ; diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) less 95 mm/Hg . At least 5 assessable cutaneous lesion previously untreated local therapy . Patients human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection must willing comply regimen highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) select best potential efficacy least 1 month evidence Kaposi sarcoma ( KS ) progression HAART regimen optimize regimen HAART 4 month long evidence KS regression . Patients must willing use effective birth control . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Symptomatic , extensive pulmonary involvement . Symptomatic visceral KS exclude oral cavity . Inability provide inform consent . Chemotherapy within 3 week . Prior therapy SU5416 . Supraphysiologic dose corticosteroid within 3 week . Major surgical procedure ( include periodontal ) within 4 week . Surgical nonhealing wound unrelated KS . Pregnancy . Breast feeding . Past present history malignant tumor KS unless : ) complete remission great equal 1 year time response first document ; b ) completely resect basal cell carcinoma ; c ) situ squamous cell carcinoma cervix anus . Evidence severe lifethreatening infection within 2 week entry onto study . A condition would require patient receive intravenous antibiotic day bevacizumab infusion . Need chronic daily aspirin great equal 325 mg/daily nonsteroidal medication interfere platelet function . Therapeutic anticoagulation international normalize ratio ( INR ) great 1.5 , unless patient full dose warfarin . If patient fulldose anticoagulant , follow criterion meet enrollment : The subject must inrange INR ( usually 2 3 ) stable dose warfarin stable dose low molecular weight ( LMW ) heparin ; The subject must active bleed pathological condition carry high risk bleeding ( e.g . tumor involve major vessel ) .
