	<brief_summary>This randomized phase I/II trial see combine erlotinib bevacizumab work well treat patient recurrent metastatic head neck cancer . Erlotinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzyme need tumor cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill deliver cancer-killing substance . Combining erlotinib bevacizumab may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Erlotinib Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose dose-limiting toxicity bevacizumab administer erlotinib patient recurrent metastatic head neck cancer . II . Determine objective response rate stable disease/absence early progression patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study bevacizumab follow randomize , multicenter study . Phase I : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 oral erlotinib day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos bevacizumab maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Phase II : Course 1 28 day length . All subsequent course 21 day . Course 1 : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 15 oral erlotinib day 1-28 . Arm II : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 oral erlotinib day 1-28 . All subsequent course : All patient receive bevacizumab arm II oral erlotinib day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
