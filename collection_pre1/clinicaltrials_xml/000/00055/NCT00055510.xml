	<brief_summary>This research study intend evaluate safety effectiveness 3 different dos BO-653 , investigational inhibitor LDL cholesterol oxidation , give orally twice day compare placebo ( inactive substance ) prevent restenosis ( closure vessel ) within six month stent implantation . Patients must enrol study within 24 hour stenting procedure . Additionally , 1- 9-month post-stent period , study compare safety effectiveness BO-653 versus placebo measure coronary artery vessel size quantitative coronary angiography , major adverse cardiac event , effect oxidative status plasma lipid plasma component .</brief_summary>
