	<brief_title>CP-724,714 Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety tolerability CP-724,714 patient metastatic HER2-overexpressing breast cancer . - Determine maximum tolerate dose drug patient . - Determine , preliminarily , antitumor activity drug patient . - Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . - Determine relationship drug-related adverse event pharmacokinetic exposure parameter patient . - Determine relationship change serum HER2 extracellular domain HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation pharmacokinetic exposure parameter clinical outcome patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This open-label , dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients receive oral CP-724,714 day 1 3-21 course 1 daily subsequent course . Courses repeat every 3 week 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos CP-724,714 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Patients follow least 30 day . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 3-20 patient accrue study within 6 month .</detailed_description>
