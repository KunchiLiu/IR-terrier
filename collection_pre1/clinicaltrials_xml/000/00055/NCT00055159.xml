	<brief_summary>This study test effectiveness low-dose recombinant tissue plasminogen activator ( rtPA , alteplase ) dissolve blood clot major arm neck vein . rtPA give patient heart attack dissolve blood clot block coronary artery . Blood clot develop major arm neck vein usually develop venous access device ( VAD ) catheter place vein . The clot often cause arm , shoulder neck swell pressure discomfort . Current treatment include remove VAD , use blood thinner heparin warfarin , use rtPA dissolve clot . All option disadvantage , however , include risk abnormal bleeding . This study evaluate whether low dos rtPA effectively dissolve clot without require extend hospital stay , need current higher-dose regimen . Patients 18 year age old enrol evaluated Clinical Center study block jugular , axillary , subclavian , brachiocephalic vein may eligible study . The blockage may may associate use VAD . Participants one two treatment low dose rtPA , follow blood thinner take mouth injection 5 7 week . On first treatment day , patient venogram , catheter place arm vein pass blood clot block blood flow vein . This do x-ray machine radiologist see exactly tube go . Then , rtPA inject clot every 30 second 15 30 minute . The catheter keep place maintain access vein additional treatment next day , need . The patient begin treatment heparin , either outpatient inpatient . A second venogram do next day . If venogram show vein open , anti-clotting treatment heparin warfarin continue . If venogram show vein still block , rtPA treatment repeat blood thinner treatment continue . The patient third venogram follow day . If vein open , heparin warfarin treatment continue . If vein still block , patient 's participation study end . Although patient long formally study , may choose receive additional treatment rtPA high dos NIH continue use blood thinner direction primary physician . Blood test do blood thin therapy monitor adjust dosage . Additional blood sample take timed interval rtPA treatment measure response therapy . Patients benefit rtPA treatment remain blood thinner 5 7 week return NIH follow-up venogram see vein still open . During warfarin therapy , blood test do every day first week two every 2 week thereafter ensure optimal drug dose administer . If repeat venogram 5 7 week show vein close , blood thinner ( warfarin heparin ) stop patient 's participation study end . If vein remain open , patient 's doctor decide whether continue anti-clotting therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low-Dose rtPA Treat Blood Clots Major Arm Neck Veins</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Deep vein thrombosis central vein upper extremity neck commonly see Clinical Center consequence use central venous access device ( VADs ) require intravenous medication treatment program NIH . In order relieve discomfort associate condition restore patency central vein , successfully developed treatment program employ intraclot pulse-sprayed injection recombinant tissue plasminogen activator ( rtPA ) anticoagulation heparin plus warfarin ( Protocol 95-CC-0053 ) . Recent laboratory kinetic study thrombolysis rtPA suggest rapid thrombolysis achieve rtPA dos 10 time low dos use earlier protocol . The purpose protocol evaluate whether low dos translate effective thrombolysis clinical setting , may modify thrombolysis treatment make effective , potentially safe , less costly previous protocol . This propose protocol still utilizes pulse spray injection rtPA directly thrombus , evaluate efficacy safety use total 4 mg less rtPA day thrombolytic therapy . As low dose rtPA find safe catheter clearance application , hospitalization require part protocol . Patients elect procedure perform outpatient also receive anticoagulation standard regimens use subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) alone , gradual conversion oral warfarin .</detailed_description>
