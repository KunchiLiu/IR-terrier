	<brief_summary>Because people infected HIV strain resistant anti-HIV drug fewer effective treatment option , select effective anti-HIV drug combination difficult . A combination protease inhibitor ( PIs ) , add patient 's current anti-HIV therapy , may decrease viral load increase drug activity . Tests measure drug level blood test evaluate drug resistance HIV may also helpful choose best anti-HIV drug combination patient . This study determine whether use test choose drug combination add PIs combination improve patient 's response anti-HIV therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treatment option limit HIV infected individual extensive treatment experience harbor resistance antiretrovirals ( ARVs ) multiple drug class . Increasing concentration PIs regimen may one way provide substantial ARV activity . It uncertain combine specific PIs RTV affect viral susceptibility ARV effect . The relationship PI concentration ( e.g. , Cmin ) virus susceptibility ( IC50 ) may better predictor treatment outcome susceptibility alone . This study evaluate predictive value pharmacokinetic-adjusted phenotypic susceptibility ( C12h/IC50 ) ARV response ritonavir ( RTV ) -boosted regimens patient fail current PI-containing regimen . Participants blood drawn screen visit phenotypic assay determine viral load . At study entry , participant discontinue PIs continue take ARVs . Each participant doctor choose add one three RTV-boosted regimen : 1 ) indinavir ( IDV ) RTV ; 2 ) fosamprenavir ( FPV ) RTV ; 3 ) lopinavir ( LPV ) /RTV plus additional RTV . Participants take regimen 14 day . On Day 14 , patient 12-hour pharmacokinetic evaluation . On Day 15 , patient add tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) regimens may choose modify ARVs continue RTV-boosted therapy . Participants additional study visit Weeks 4 , 8 , 16 , 24 . Study visit include physical exam blood urine test . Participants complete adherence questionnaire four time course study .</detailed_description>
