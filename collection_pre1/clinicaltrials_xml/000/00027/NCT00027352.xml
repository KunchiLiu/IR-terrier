	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare two way use anti-HIV drug help health care provider patient decide best use anti-HIV treatment many year . Many health care provider treat patient daily drug keep viral load low possible . This approach help patient CD4 count less 200-250 cells/mm3 live longer without serious disease . But known best way treat patient higher CD4 count . There information suggest patient may able wait use anti-HIV drug CD4 count 250 cells/mm3 . Because study carry several year , provide information long-term advantage disadvantage two treatment strategy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Two Ways Manage Anti-HIV Treatment ( The SMART Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Implementation antiretroviral treatment ( ART ) guideline , emphasize maximal durable suppression viral load majority individual infect HIV , result substantial decline morbidity mortality . However , many asymptomatic patient immediate risk serious opportunistic disease , effectiveness ART wane time due HIV drug resistance , short- long-term toxicity treatment . This motivate comparison two strategy : one conserve treatment defer use risk opportunistic disease low one aim sustain virologic suppression , irrespective disease risk . In large , long-term trial , patient randomly assign either drug conservation ( DC ) viral suppression ( VS ) group . Patients enrol 3-year period follow average 7.5 year . The DC group stop defer ART CD4 cell count decline 250 cells/mm3 ; receive treatment increase CD4 count great 350 cells/mm3 follow episodic ART base CD4 cell count . The VS group use ART maintain viral load low possible , irrespective CD4 cell count . Patients see Months 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , every 4 month data collection visit . All available ARTs , include immunomodulators , resistance testing may use patient treatment group . Selected subsamples patient enrol study follow intensive data collection secondary outcome relate cost health care utilization , quality life , HIV transmission risk behavior , metabolic complication treatment .</detailed_description>
