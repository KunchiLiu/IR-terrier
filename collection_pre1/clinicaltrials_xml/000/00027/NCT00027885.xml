	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill deliver cancer-killing substance . Combining chemotherapy monoclonal antibody therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial see docetaxel without bevacizumab follow surgery , radiation therapy , combination chemotherapy work well treat patient stage III stage IV breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Bevacizumab + Tax In Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine effect bevacizumab docetaxel reduction microvessel density induction apoptosis endothelial tumor cell patient locally advance breast cancer . - Determine safety profile regimen patient . - Compare effect docetaxel bevacizumab , term objective response , stabilization disease , progression-free survival , patient . OUTLINE : This randomize study . Patients stratify accord disease stage . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive docetaxel IV 1 hour weekly week 1-6 bevacizumab IV 60 minute every 2 week week 1-8 . - Arm II : Patients receive docetaxel arm I . Treatment arm repeat every 8 week 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After second course , patient stable responsive disease undergo modify radical mastectomy breast-conserving surgery . Three six week surgery , patient undergo radiotherapy 5 day week 7 week . Approximately 4 week completion radiotherapy , patient receive doxorubicin IV 5 minute cyclophosphamide IV 30-60 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients estrogen and/or progesterone receptor-positive disease also receive oral tamoxifen daily 5 year begin completion chemotherapy . Post-menopausal patient may receive oral anastrozole daily 5 year instead tamoxifen . Patients follow 3 , 6 , 12 month , every 6 month 4 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 60 patient ( 30 per treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
