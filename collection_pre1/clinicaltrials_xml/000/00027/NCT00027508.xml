	<brief_title>Ecteinascidin 743 Treating Patients With Malignant Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine partial complete response rate patient unresectable malignant mesothelioma treat ecteinascidin 743 . II . Determine toxicity profile drug patient . III . Determine pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship drug patient . IV . Determine duration response , time disease progression , 6-month progression-free survival , time treatment failure , overall survival patient treated drug . V. Assess quality life patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive ecteinascidin 743 IV 3 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week least 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients complete response ( CR ) receive 2 additional course achieve CR . Quality life assess baseline begin course therapy . Patients follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-36 patient accrue study within 12-24 month .</detailed_description>
