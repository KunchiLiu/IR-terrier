	<brief_summary>This study determine whether nitrite nitrate diet affect level nitric oxide gas breathe air . Nitric oxide involve many bodily process , immune function , nerve signal transmission , inflammation , dilation blood vessel bronchial tube ( tubes branch trachea lung ) . Healthy male volunteer age 18 year old smoke least 5 year may eligible study . Candidates undergo blood urine test , breathe test , electrocardiogram . Participants follow two special diet 3 day . One low-nitrate nitrite diet , high-nitrate nitrite diet . Both diet must complete within month 's time . Participants admit NIH Clinical Center two 3-night hospital stay two diet period , may go pass time . While diet , may consume food prepared NIH Nutrition Department ; eat food seriously affect study result . Meals may eat NIH Clinical Center , package meal prepared Nutrition Department take . Participants may engage heavy exercise diet period , exercise affect nitric oxide level . Blood sample 4 milliliter , 1 teaspoon , collect start diet end diet measure blood level nitrate nitrite . Additional blood sample , total 2 tablespoon , collect research . Each day , participant test measure exhale nitric oxide level . This involve blow air mouthpiece attach machine measure level gas breath .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Nitric oxide ( NO ) recognize multifaceted role many physiological process ( e.g. , vasodilatation , host defense , neurotransmission , bronchodilatation , inflammation . ) NO produce family nitric oxide synthase ( NOS ) isoforms reaction convert L-arginine L-citrulline . NO metabolites vivo include nitrite ( NO2 ) nitrate ( NO3 ) . Plasma NO2/NO3 concentration use extensively marker NOS activity NO radical production . Studies show dietary intake nitrate , estrogen , atmospheric pollution , heavy exercise influence NO2/NO3 level blood . NO also detect exhaled air . NO level vary disease , case ( e.g. , asthma ) respond treatment ( e.g. , steroid ) . This pilot study design determine whether dietary intake influence exhale NO level . To use plasma metabolite measurement monitor NOS activity , subject must adhere strict low NO2/NO3 diet study measurement exhale NO perform quickly easily inpatient set . Subjects study inpatient consume standardized high low nitrite/nitrate ( NO2/NO3 ) diet period three day . Since L-arginine NOS substrate affect generation NO , diet also monitor protein intake . Blood sample collect four time study , pre- post-diet diet , quantification NO2/NO3 concentration . Exhaled NO measured daily . In addition , blood pressure , pulmonary function testing , blood plasma level L-arginine , cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( cGMP ) , S-thiolation may monitor . Results study allow u determine effective method monitor NOS activity , potentially identify activity responsible maintain nitric oxide level .</detailed_description>
