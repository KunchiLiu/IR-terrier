	<brief_title>MEN-10755 Treating Patients With Progressive Prostate Cancer That Has Not Responded Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Assess activity MEN-10755 patient progressive hormone-refractory adenocarcinoma prostate . - Determine rate duration objective PSA response patient treated drug . - Determine clinical response rate patient measurable disease treat drug . - Determine acute side effect drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Beginning within 2 week last PSA measurement , patient receive MEN-10755 IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week least 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete partial response continue receive additional course . Patients achieve stable disease may receive 4 course discretion investigator . Patients follow every 6 week disease progression initiation new therapy . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 18-32 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
