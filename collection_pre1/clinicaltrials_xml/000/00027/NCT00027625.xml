	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Biological therapy gefitinib may interfere growth cancer cell slow growth tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining gefitinib chemotherapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase I trial study effectiveness combine gefitinib temozolomide treat patient malignant primary glioma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gefitinib Plus Temozolomide Treating Patients With Malignant Primary Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine maximum tolerate dose gefitinib give combination temozolomide patient malignant primary glioma . - Determine toxic effect regimen patient . - Determine pharmacokinetics regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study gefitinib . Patients stratify accord use concurrent enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drug ( yes v ) . Patients receive oral gefitinib daily day 1-35 oral temozolomide daily day 8-12 first course . For second subsequent course , patient receive oral gefitinib daily day 1-28 oral temozolomide daily day 1-5 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos gefitinib maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Patients follow every 2 month 1 year every 3-6 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 3-42 patient accrue study within 1-14 month .</detailed_description>
