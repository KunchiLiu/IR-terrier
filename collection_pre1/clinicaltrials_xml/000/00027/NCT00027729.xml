	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody Therapy Treating Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine recommend phase II dose monoclonal antibody anti-anb3 integrin patient irinotecan-refractory advanced colorectal cancer . - Determine safety tolerance drug patient . - Determine antitumor activity drug patient . - Determine objective response rate , response duration , time progression patient treat drug . - Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive monoclonal antibody anti-anb3 integrin IV 30 minute weekly week 1-52 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients respond disease may continue therapy . Cohort 4-6 patient receive escalate dos monoclonal antibody anti-anb3 integrin maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 4 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Once MTD determine , additional patient treat dose phase II portion study . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 4-24 patient accrued phase I study total 40 patient accrue phase II study .</detailed_description>
