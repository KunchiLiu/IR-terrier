	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Chemoprevention therapy use certain drug try prevent development recurrence cancer . The use celecoxib may effective way prevent actinic keratoses . PURPOSE : Randomized phase II/III trial determine effectiveness celecoxib prevent skin cancer patient actinic keratoses .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Celecoxib Preventing Skin Cancer Patients With Actinic Keratoses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare celecoxib vs placebo term prevent development new actinic keratoses patient actinic keratoses . - Compare treatment regimens term induce regression actinic keratoses patient . - Determine safety drug patient . - Compare effect treatment regimens potential surrogate end-point biomarkers area actinic keratosis , sun-exposed skin , non-sun-exposed skin correlate biomarkers clinical outcome patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily 9 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive oral placebo arm I . Patients follow 2 month complete treatment . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 240 patient ( 120 per treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
