	<brief_title>Bortezomib Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) bortezomib , carboplatin , etoposide patient advance solid tumor refractory standard therapy . II . Evaluate biologic effect bortezomib relevant target tumor tissue patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study bortezomib , etoposide , carboplatin . Patients receive bortezomib IV day 1 8 , carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 , etoposide IV 60 minute day 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 21 day least 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos bortezomib maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Once MTD determine , 6 additional patient newly diagnose , chemotherapy-naive extensive stage small cell lung cancer , 6 patient tumor type , treat dose . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 12-27 patient accrue study within 6-14 month .</detailed_description>
