	<detailed_description>This retrospective ( case-control ) outcome study investigate frequency severity morbidity population approximately 160 patient diagnose breast cancer medical surgical treatment . Subjects follow one-year quarterly examination ( baseline [ pre-medical treatment ] 1 , 3 month , 6 month , 9 month 12 month treatment ) . In order cancer survivor understand risk impairment functional limitation , disability ; health care provider determine risk physical impairment , functional limitation , loss independence ( morbidity ) patient breast cancer ; necessary study patient point diagnosis ( surgery ) reasonable period follow completion primary treatment program ( 1 year medical treatment ) . Although pain , numbness , fatigue , lymphedema diminish physical function describe prevalent debilitating condition , remarkably clinical study publish describe associated physical impairment , functional limitation method control measure prior medical intervention long-term follow-up . While several past report identify impact medical surgical intervention symptom distress functional capacity patient , study provide sufficient evidence identify : 1 ) level physical impairment predicts morbidity patient , 2 ) individual factor specific predictor morbidity patient , 3 ) time period morbidity occur . The majority previous study investigate morbidity patient breast cancer follow medical surgical intervention cross-sectional , case series , retrospective analysis without comparison/control group without baseline measure prior intervention . The propose outcome study include : 1 ) retrospective review specific medical record information stag conference information standard clinical quarterly examination one year period , 2 ) administration follow-up outcome questionnaire , physical activity questionnaire quality life questionnaire 6 12 month time point . The outcome survey upper limb disability questionnaire develop outcome measure project . Data available measurement domain allow researcher determine : 1 ) frequency severity : ) symptom distress ( fatigue , pain include chronic pain , ache , weakness , burning , tingle , numbness , anxiety , depression ) pathological condition ( adhesive capsulitis , weakness atrophy , neuropathy , scar/skin adhesion , lymphedema ) , b ) physical impairment ( diminish upper extremity trunk range motion/flexibility , strength , coordination increase girth ) , c ) functional imitation disability course medical treatment ( loss independence ability perform routine activity daily live i.e. , grooming , bathing , dress , drive automobile , case , return regular work , recreational social activity ) . 2 ) level impairment patient lose independence function identity patient high risk loss independence function ( e.g. , ADL 's ) .</detailed_description>
