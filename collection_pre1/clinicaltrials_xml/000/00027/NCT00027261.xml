	<brief_summary>The purpose study see experimental vaccine , ALVAC-HIV ( vCP1452 ) safe study immune system respond vaccine . This trial design determine whether high vaccine dose ( 6 time usual dose ) elicit high immune response . As May 2001 , 200 people receive ALVAC-HIV ( vCP1452 ) vaccine low dose . The high dose vaccine use study give human previously . High dos similar vaccine give people without serious side effect . In recent study do mouse , high dos ALVAC-HIV produce strong immune response . It possible dose ALVAC-HIV give human amount need maximum immune response . Because exact relationship increase immune response effectiveness prevent HIV infection uncertain , HVTN use high dose manufacture .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Immune Response Study High-Dose Canarypox ALVAC-HIV Vaccine Healthy , HIV Uninfected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To date , adverse reaction immunization various ALVAC-HIV candidate vaccine , include ALVAC-HIV ( vCP1452 ) , similar observe healthy adult receive licensed vaccine similar type . In previous trial , even high dos recombinant ALVAC vaccine well tolerate group participant significantly immunocompromised . In recent study do mouse concern dose escalation use ALVAC-HIV vector , data demonstrate robust immune responses high dos ALVAC-HIV ( vCP1452 ) mouse . It certainly possible dos ALVAC-HIV give human well amount need maximal cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) response . As predictive value CTL response present unknown respect efficacy prevent ameliorate HIV acquisition infection , HVTN utilize high dose currently manufacture . All study product administer intramuscularly . Participants receive 1 3 injection . Group A receive high dose vaccine , group B receive low dose vaccine , group C receive placebo . Participants inoculate 4 time point . Assessment product safety include clinical observation , monitor hematological , chemical , immunologic parameter , social harm questionnaire . Safety evaluate monitor participant local systemic adverse reaction course trial . Participants monitor longitudinally HIV-specific serologic cellular immune response .</detailed_description>
