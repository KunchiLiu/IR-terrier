	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial see combination chemotherapy work well without bevacizumab treat patient malignant mesothelioma . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill deliver cancer-killing substance . It yet know combination chemotherapy work well without bevacizumab treat malignant mesothelioma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy With Without Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Malignant Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare time progression patient malignant mesothelioma treat gemcitabine cisplatin without bevacizumab . II . Compare objective response rate patient treat regimen . III . Compare toxicity regimen administer patient . IV . Compare median overall survival patient treat regimen . V. Assess plasma vascular endothelial growth factor serum vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 level , , study therapy predictor outcome patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord histology ( epithelial v ) ECOG performance status ( 0 vs 1 ) . Patients randomize one two treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive gemcitabine IV 30 minute day 1 8 cisplatin IV 30-60 minute ( begin gemcitabine infusion ) bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute ( begin cisplatin infusion ) day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve stable disease ( SD ) , complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) sixth course may receive bevacizumab single agent every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive gemcitabine cisplatin arm I placebo IV 30-90 minute ( begin cisplatin infusion ) day 1 . Treatment repeat arm I . Patients achieve SD , CR , PR sixth course may receive placebo single agent every 3 week absence disease progression .</detailed_description>
