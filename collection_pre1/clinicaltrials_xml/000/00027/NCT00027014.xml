	<brief_summary>This series study healthy volunteer assess potential adverse interaction St. John 's wort ( SJW ) extract two narcotic ( opioid ) pain medication : oxycodone fentanyl . In case oxycodone , interested whether SJW treatment promote metabolism oxycodone , lower effectiveness standard dos oxycodone treat pain problem . For fentanyl study , investigate whether SJW treatment interfere delivery fentanyl brain diminish 's effectiveness relieve pain . There evidence suggest SJW treatment may increase activity transporter protein , name P-glycoprotein ( Pgp ) , blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) protect brain exposure drug dietary environmental toxin .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Extract St. John 's wort ( SJW : Hypericum perforatum ) gain widespread popularity over-the-counter , natural antidepressant . Until recently , SJW think well tolerate relatively safe . Within past year , adverse metabolic interaction report SJW several narrow therapeutic index drug , notably cyclosporine , indinavir digoxin . The interaction recognize involve induction two drug disposition mechanism : cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme active efflux pump , P-glycoprotein , lead profound reduction blood plasma drug concentration compromise therapeutic efficacy affect drug . Natural synthetic opioids first-line agent palliative treatment severe pain result cancer cancer treatment . It well recognize depression co-morbid condition severe poorly control cancer-related pain . Given widespread recognition St. Johns wort mood enhancer natural antidepressant , cancer pain patient receive opioid analgesic may well turn herbal preparation relief depressive symptom . The overall objective research proposal investigate significant interaction occur two widely use opioid analgesic -- oxycodone fentanyl St. John wort extract laboratory-based study healthy volunteer . The study assess potential clinical significance interaction respect opioid analgesia efficacy side effect , provide scientific insight pharmacokinetic mechanism underlie observed interaction . The oxycodone arm study design 1 ) investigate induction CYP3A4-mediated N-demethylation major detoxification pathway oxycodone , 2 ) resolve inductive effect SJW intestinal hepatic CYP3A4 intravenous oral administration CYP3A-specific , vivo catalytic probe -midazolam . The fentanyl arm study design 1 ) ass effect SJW brain uptake efflux kinetics fentanyl pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic ( PK-PD ) model miotic response time follow intravenous infusion opioid , 2 ) To evaluate change analgesia side effect fentanyl upon pretreatment SJW may result induction Pgp BBB . Overall , propose research provide definitive assessment potential clinical significance adverse interaction SJW opioids context cancer pain therapy .</detailed_description>
