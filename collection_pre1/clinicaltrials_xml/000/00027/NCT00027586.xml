	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine clinical activity imatinib mesylate ( STI571 ) patient metastatic melanoma . - Determine side effect drug patient . - Correlate molecular study responsiveness drug patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate ( STI571 ) twice daily . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 21-78 patient accrue study within 6-15 month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patient must biopsy proven diagnosis metastatic melanoma . Patients enrol least 20 % tumor cell stain immunohistochemistry ( see Appendix E methodology ) : 1 . PDGF receptor alpha beta , 2 . KIT ( CD 117 ) expression tumor document DAKO antibody staining , 3. cabl , ARG . 2 . Patients must measurable indicator metastasis , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral CT scan case obviously visible cutaneous tumor . Besides indicator lesion ( ) , patient must least one biopsiable metastasis subcutaneous site lymph node . 3 . Radiographic study use assess disease must perform within 28 day prior registration . If target lesion previously embolized , perfuse irradiated , must objective evidence progression start therapy consider response assessment . 4 . Patient symptomatic central nervous metastasis . However , patient small asymptomatic metastasis exclude provided steroid lesion associate significant edema . Patients brain metastases site disease eligible . 5 . Patient may receive prior interferon and/or one systemic treatment regimen ( chemotherapy , biotherapy , biochemotherapy ) . Active immunotherapy ( cancer vaccine ) include tally prior treatment . 6 . Patient must receive chemotherapy , biologic therapy investigational drug reason within 28 day prior registration , extend 42 day patient receive nitrosourea . Patients must major surgery within 14 day prior registration . 7 . Patient must ECOG performance status &lt; 2 Karnofsky performance status &gt; 60 % ( see Appendix C ) . 8 . Patient must resolution transient toxicity prior therapy Grade 1 ( NCICTC version 2.0 , see Appendix B ) . 9 . Patients must normal organ marrow function assess within 14 day prior registration define : leukocyte &gt; 3,000/mL absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mL platelet &gt; 100,000/mL total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine &lt; 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal 10 . Patient must hemoglobin &gt; 9 gm/dl ( may achieve transfusion need ) obtain within 14 day prior registration . 11 . Patient must uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within 2 month study , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 12 . Patient must severe and/or uncontrolled concurrent medical disease ( e.g. , uncontrolled diabetes , uncontrolled chronic renal liver disease , active uncontrolled infection ) . 13 . Patient must pregnant nursing Gleevec may harmful develop fetus newborn ( see Section 3.0 detail ) . Women/men reproductive potential must agree use effective contraceptive method . Because potential interaction oral contraceptive male female patient reproductive potential must agree employ barrier method contraception ( condom , diaphragm ) throughout study 3 month follow discontinuation Gleevec.Women reproductive potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior registration . Postmenopausal woman must amenorrheic least 12 month consider nonchildbearing potential . 14 . Patient medical psychological condition , opinion investigator , make patient unable tolerate complete treatment , grant reliable inform consent eligible study . 15 . Patient must take therapeutic dos coumadin ( warfarin ) anticoagulation time registration . Patients require therapeutic anticoagulation may use lowmolecular weight heparin ( e.g. , Lovenox ) agent , minidose coumadin ( 1 mg po QD ) prophylaxis allow . 16 . No prior malignancy allow except follow : adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , adequately treated Stage I II cancer patient currently complete remission , cancer patient diseasefree 5 year .</criteria>
