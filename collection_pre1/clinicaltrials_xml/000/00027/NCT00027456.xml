	<brief_summary>This pilot study evaluate safety effectiveness leptin therapy two child severe insulin resistance syndrome . Patients condition often high blood sugar level may hormone imbalance , constant feeling warmth , fertility problem , large appetite , enlarge liver due fat accumulation . Leptin hormone produce fat cell . It influence appetite , affect level reproductive hormone , possibly manage body reacts insufficient food . Certain people severe insulin resistance syndrome decrease amount fat tissue make little leptin . A 13-year-old male 11-year-old female severe insulin resistance participate study . They follow test procedure begin 4 month leptin therapy : - Insulin tolerance test - measure blood sugar level intravenous ( IV ) administration insulin . Blood sample collect IV tube various interval 1-hour test . - Ultrasound liver , abnormality find , possibly liver biopsy . - Fasting blood test - measure blood count , blood lipid , various hormone assess liver function . - Resting metabolic rate - measure amount oxygen breathe rest order calculate many calorie require maintain rest body function . - Magnetic resonance image liver organ , muscle fat . - Pelvic ultrasound female patient - detect ovarian cyst . - Estimation body fat - measurement height , weight , waist , hip size , skin fold arm abdomen estimate body fat content . - Oral glucose tolerance test - measure blood sugar insulin level . The patient drink sweet drink contain glucose ( sugar ) , blood sample collect IV tube arm vein various interval 3-hour test . - Intravenous glucose tolerance test - measure tissue response insulin glucose glucose injection insulin infusion . Blood collect 3 hour measure insulin glucose level . - Appetite level food intake - measure hunger level caloric intake . Patients question hunger level , give variety food may choose eat question various interval hunger level . On another day , patient give breakfast ( usually milkshake ) want eat , appetite level caloric intake study repeat . - Hormone function test - function three hormone influence leptin ( corticotropin-releasing hormone , thyrotropin-releasing hormone luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ) assess . The hormone inject intravenously blood sample draw . - Questionnaire - patient complete questionnaire activity feel . - 24-hour urine collection - measure specific hormone , proteins sugar excrete urine . When test complete , leptin therapy start . The drug inject skin twice day 4 month . Patients record symptoms weekly throughout study . Those diabetes measure blood glucose level daily meal bedtime . Follow-up visit 1 , 2 4 month therapy include physical examination , blood test meet dietitian . At 4-month visit , test do begin study repeat .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Leptin Treat Severe Insulin Resistance - Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over course year , observe recombinant leptin potential act insulin-sensitizer subject lipoatrophy leptin deficiency . The exact mechanisms effect know . We would like test whether leptin work insulin-sensitizer situation mechanism insulin resistance know , namely situation know defect insulin receptor . This allow u learn leptin overcome receptor defect activate down-stream molecule insulin signal cascade . We would like begin explore question two patient mutation insulin receptor , need improve treatment . In fact , two patient , conventional therapeutic option provide adequate control blood sugar level . Furthermore , circulate leptin concentration two patient low 15th percentile normal population . Therefore , strategy achieve physiological concentration leptin hormone use recombinant leptin ( A100 , recombinant methionyl-human leptin ) justify . We also plan keep initial observation period short . Since observe insulin-sensitizing effect leptin lipoatrophy within 4 month , limit initial treatment period 4 month . The regime similar regimen use lipoatrophic patient . The start dose 50 % replacement dose incrementally increase 200 % replacement dose within course two month . The medication administer subcutaneously two divided dos . Plasma glucose concentration HbA1c designate primary outcome measure . Data effect leptin hormone appetite , insulin secretion sensitivity pituitary hormone also collect pilot data . At end 4 month , make decision continue therapy broaden study open recruitment similar patient .</detailed_description>
