	<brief_summary>This study explore response immune system infection HIV pathogens change response time . Healthy normal volunteer HIV-infected patient 18 year age old may eligible study . Prior enrollment yearly thereafter , vital sign , height weight record . A medical history obtain relevant laboratory research sample use . A extensive history physical exam require may perform deemed necessary VRC clinician . A complete blood count perform day enrollment yearly thereafter . Samples collect follow manner : Blood drawn needle arm vein one time course study . From 20 150 cc ( 4 30 teaspoonful ) blood collected time . No 450 cc ( le 1 pint ) blood draw 6-week period . Urine saliva sample collect volunteer private . Swab sample collect nurse doctor , use cotton swab brush inside mouth . Samples may use follow test : - Hepatitis viral screening-This may include screen different type viral liver infection , hepatitis A , B , C , D , E , G ; cytomegalovirus ( related herpes virus ) ; varicella zoster virus ( responsible chicken pox child shingle adult ) . - Genetic testing-DNA blood cell may examine genetic mutation ( physical chemical change ) deletion ( miss piece ) affect substance involve body 's ability mount inflammatory immune response . Alterations gene substance show influence HIV infection . - HLA testing-HLA type genetic marker immune system . Determining HLA type necessary order certain research study . Some HLA type associate increase risk disease like arthritis rheumatologic problem . HLA test may use try identify factor associate rate progression HIV disease related condition . - Other laboratory test clinically indicate require research need . Some sample collect study may store future research.They label without identify information . Those interesting strongly positive immune response may ask return VRC Clinic provide sample urine oral secretion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Vaccine Research Center ( VRC ) study specific immune response HIV infection pathogen order characterize protective response prevent new infection uninfected individual , well define response lead successful control viral replication person already infect pathogen . We wish define specific human immune response HIV infection , pathogens vaccine use human peripheral blood mononuclear cell , plasma , serum , urine , oral secretion model .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Willing tested HIV . Note : Subjects know HIVinfected routinely result plasma HIV RNA obtain within 90 day enrollment visit record ; volunteer believe HIV uninfected usually HIV ELISA ( Western blot need ) and/or HIV RNA within 28 day enrollment visit record . Test result available proceeding enrollment . Consent test require , test complete need research lab subject eligible regardless HIV status . 2 . Age : 18 year age old . 3 . Ability provide inform consent EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Refusal consent follow study site policy partner notification ( newly diagnose HIVpositive participate study ) . 2 . Refusal permit research specimen store ( frozen ) potential future study . 3 . Any medical condition , opinion Principal Investigator , would make subject inappropriate protocol participation ( coagulopathy inadequate venous access ) . 4 . Women know pregnant</criteria>
