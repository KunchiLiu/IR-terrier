	<brief_summary>Genetically inherit heart disease ( familial cardiopathy ) condition affect heart pass family member abnormalities genetic information . These condition responsible many heart related death illness . Researchers interested learn specific genetic abnormality cause heart disease . In addition , would like find abnormal gene contribute development medical problem . In order , researcher plan study patient family member patient diagnose genetically inherit heart disease . Those people participate study undergo variety test include blood test , echocardiogram , magnetic resonance imaging study ( MRI ) . These test use help researcher find genetic problem cause familial cardiopathy . Researchers hope information gather study use develop well medical care early diagnosis , management , treatment plan .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Signs Symptoms Associated With Molecular Defects Genetically Inherited Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Familial cardiomyopathy ( FC ) important cardiovascular cause morbidity mortality demonstrate allelic non-allelic genetic heterogeneity . We propose perform genetic study determine novel molecular cause FC describe clinical correlate . This permit : ( 1 ) pre-symptomatic diagnosis ; ( 2 ) definition cardiac phenotype , disease penetrance ; ( 3 ) natural history ; ( 4 ) study abnormal physiology consequence molecular defect ; ( 5 ) elucidation specific mechanism arrythmias sudden death ; ( 6 ) demonstration characterization skeletal muscle involvement .</detailed_description>
