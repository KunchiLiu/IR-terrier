	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines may make body build immune response kill tumor cell . Colony-stimulating factor sargramostim increase number immune cell find bone marrow peripheral blood . Combining vaccine therapy sargramostim may effective treat soft tissue sarcoma . PURPOSE : Phase I trial study effectiveness combine vaccine therapy sargramostim treat patient stage II , stage III , stage IV soft tissue sarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Sargramostim Treating Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety tolerability NY-ESO-1 peptide vaccine sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) patient stage II , III , IV soft tissue sarcoma express NY-ESO-1 LAGE antigen . - Determine immunologic profile ( NY-ESO-1 antibody , CD8+ cell , delayed-type hypersensitivity ) patient treat regimen . - Determine tumor response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : Patients receive NY-ESO-1 peptide vaccine intradermally every 2 week total 6 vaccination . Patients also receive sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) subcutaneously daily begin 2 day every vaccination continue 5 day . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 15 patient accrue study within 12 month .</detailed_description>
