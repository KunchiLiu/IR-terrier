	<brief_title>Tipifarnib Treating Older Patients With Previously Untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine complete response rate R115777 ( tipifarnib ) previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) ( ) elderly patient ( age &gt; = 75 ) ( b ) patient ( age &gt; = 65 ) AML precede myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , use chronic dosing schedule . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine progression-free overall survival patient previously untreated AML treat R115777 , use chronic dosing schedule . II . To determine duration response patient previously untreated AML treat R115777 , use chronic dosing schedule . III . To determine effect R115777 phosphorylation mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase , catalytic subunit alpha ( PI3K ) leukemic cell . IV . To determine effect R115777 processing farnesylated protein HDJ-2 . V. To determine toxicity R115777 give chronic dosing schedule . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily day 1-21 . Patients complete partial response , hematologic improvement , stable disease continue treatment every 29-63 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients complete response second course therapy receive 2 additional course therapy . Patients follow survival . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 125 patient accrue study within 11-17 month .</detailed_description>
