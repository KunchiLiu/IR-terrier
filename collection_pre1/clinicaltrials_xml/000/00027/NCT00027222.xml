	<brief_title>The Early Treatment Retinopathy Prematurity Study ( ETROP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At age 5 1/2 year , old age follow-up data available , child threshold ROP enrol Cryotherapy Retinopathy Prematurity ( CRYO-ROP ) -- Outcome Study show few treat eye ( 31.5 percent ) control eye ( 48 percent ) blind ( P &lt; 0.001 ) . Of eye favorable structural outcome , without retinal ablation ( cryotherapy destroy fringe retina freezing ) , small percentage best correct visual acuity well equal 20/40 age 5 1/2 year ( 13 percent treat group ; 17 percent untreated control group ( P=0.19 ) ) . Among 1398 follow 5 large natural history center CRYO-ROP follow-up study , child retinal residuum ROP ( structural change ) measurable visual acuity severly affect tended worsen age . The CRYO-ROP Study prove conclusively peripheral retinal ablation improve chance avoid blindness , least 80 percent eye leave acuity le 20/40 . Two concern emerge CRYO-ROP extensive study natural history ROP treatment threshold ROP . The first failure peripheral retinal ablation eliminate , nearly case , retinal detachment due ROP . In CRYO-ROP Study , 26 percent eye threshold disease zone II 78 percent eye zone I threshold disease unfavorable structural outcome despite treatment . The second concern child develop threshold ROP disease visual acuity worse 20/40 even eye favorable structural outcome . Since treatment yet show effective preventing blindness ROP , retinal ablation remain treatment choice . The ETROP Study test whether earlier treatment effective treatment threshold improve functional ( visual acuity ) outcome follow ROP , well determine whether early treatment decrease probability unfavorable structural outcome . Earlier treatment define retinal ablation administer avascular retina eye reach high risk prethreshold retinopathy prematurity ( ROP ) . Prethreshold indicate Zone I ROP ; Zone II stage 2 plus disease , stage 3 ; Zone II le 5 contiguous 8 cumulative clock hour stage 3 ROP plus disease . Recognizing substantial number eye undergo spontaneous resolution ROP , eye randomize early treatment high risk unfavorable visual acuity outcome identify . High risk determine use risk model analysis program base longitudinal natural history data obtain CRYO-ROP study . This model integrate risk factor assign risk progression blindness without treatment . These factor include birth weight , gestational age , ethnicity , singleton/multiple status , outborn status , Zone first exam , severity ROP rate progression ROP . When infant develops prethreshold ROP great equal 15 percent risk unfavorable outcome , randomization early treatment one eye occur . Visual acuity outcome measure masked observer wear best correction use Teller Acuity Card Procedure 9 month correct age .</detailed_description>
