	<brief_title>Gefitinib Treating Patients With Persistent Recurrent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine 6-month progression-free survival patient persistent recurrent endometrial carcinoma receive gefitinib . II . Determine nature degree toxicity drug patient . III . Determine progression-free overall survival patient treated drug . IV . Determine effect drug level epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , c-ErbB2 ( HER-2/neu ) receptor , estrogen receptor ( ER ) , progesterone receptor ( PR ) ( PR PRB ) tumor specimens patient . V. Determine association exist level EGFR , ER , PR , PRB , HER-2/neu serum concentration gefitinib , gefitinib activity , soluble EGFR clinical outcome patient treat drug . VI . Determine frequency clinical response ( partial complete response ) patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral gefitinib daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 22-60 patient accrue study within 2.5-6 year .</detailed_description>
