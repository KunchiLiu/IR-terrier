	<brief_summary>Description : The trial design determine response immune system patient breast cancer vaccine make tumor . Researchers believe particular vaccine , make purify heat shock proteins take patient 's tumor , might alert body 's immune system recognize attack invade cancer . To consider potentially eligible study must high risk breast cancer patient tumor remove surgically . Length/Duration : Vaccinations administer weekly six week . Follow visit clinic every three month two year , every six month thereafter .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccination Against High Risk Breast Cancer Using Tumor Derived Heat Shock Protein 70</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heat-shock protein ( HSP ) present within normal cancerous cell . They among ancient molecule evolution , know protein chaperone ability bind polypeptide chain assist protein folding , transport turnover . Works pioneer Srivastava 's group ( Srivastava et al . 1998 ) show HSPs associate non-covalently antigenic peptide . Injection HSP-peptide complex isolate tumor cell induce tumor protection pre-established tumor subsequent tumor challenge elicit specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) response variety tumor animal sarcoma , lymphoma , melanoma , hepatoma , prostate cancer lung cancer ( Tamura et al ) . A previous trial role HSP70 breast cancer treatment target specifically patient widespread metastasis fail conventional therapy include intensive multi-agent chemotherapy DTEC ( decadron , taxol , etoposide cyclophosphamide ) . This pilot study show , ( 1 ) HSP70 purify successfully breast cancer cell . ( 2 ) The yield HSP70 extremely variable predict accurately base size tumor significant heterogeneity histology patient 's prior history chemotherapy . ( 3 ) HSP70 vaccination safe well tolerate . Hypothesis current protocol The big challenge cancer management control metastasis . It perhaps obvious breast cancer tumor . Breast cancer patient rarely die primary cancer . The tendency deadly relapse distal site , year `` remission '' common cause mortality . Even newly diagnose patient present stage IV breast cancer , complete response achieve 40 % patient current multi-modality approach . However , patient stage IV breast cancer `` never '' cure risk late relapse . There several reason unsatisfactory result immunotherapy advanced widespread cancer . First , tumor burden overwhelming . Host defenses simply power . Second , patient stage usually significant co-morbidities , prevent optimal immune response . Third , advance cancer patient often compromise functional state immune system either quantitatively qualitatively due prior cytotoxic therapy , radiation therapy , result active secretion immunosuppressive agent tumor cell TGF-beta . Finally , simply enough time mount effective adaptive immune response patient . Therefore , hypothesize immunotherapy HSP70 effective `` consolidation '' therapy high-risk patient render minimal residue disease . To test hypothesis , tumor patient high-risk breast cancer resect HSP70 purification . This follow conventional therapy hormonal therapy , chemotherapy , radiation therapy , combine modality treatment . A total 15 patient either complete remission stable partial remission standard therapy , enrol test hypothesis HSP70 vaccine lead improve tumor-specific T cell response 40 % patient . As secondary endpoint , determine whether immunological response correlate disease-free survival progression-free survival .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>ELIGIBILITY Preregistration inclusion : Must least 18 year age capable give informed consent . High risk breast cancer define follow : stage IV breast cancer inflammatory breast carcinoma Stage II breast cancer 10 positive axillary lymph node Stage IIIA breast cancer ( tumor great equal 5 cm least one positive axillary lymph note ) A minimum 3 gram nonnecrotic , resectable breast cancer . ECOG Performance Score ( PS ) less ( &lt; 3.0 ) . Preregistration exclusion : ECOG Performance Score ( PS ) great equal 3.0 . Congenital acquire immunodeficiency include infection human immunodeficiency virus . Significant behavioral psychological problem preclude adequate informed consent followup . Registration inclusion : Major clinical response define either Complete response ( CR ) conventional stag workup CT scan bone scan . Or Stable partial response ( PR ) define 50 % tumor reduction remain stable serial CT scan bone scan 3month span . More 60 microgram HSP70 purify . ECOG Performance Score ( PS ) less 3.0 . Greater equal 4 week post cytotoxic therapy . Registration exclusion : ECOG Performance Score ( PS ) great equal 3.0 . Purification HSP70 unsuccessful qualitatively quantitatively . On investigational therapy breast cancer . Positive serum urine pregnancy test . Impaired renal function ( serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 ) hepatic function ( bilirubin 2.0 x transaminase 4.0 x upper normal limit ) . Significant active infection require hospitalization ; Acquired immunodeficiency active autoimmune disease . Significant behavioral psychological problem prevent adequate followup .</criteria>
