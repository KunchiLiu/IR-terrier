	<brief_summary>The goal study improve overall physical health quality life patient attached mechanical heart device await heart transplantation . Qigong , ancient Chinese exercise involve active participation individual form meditation , breathe exercise simple physical movement , use combination structured exercise program . We test hypothesis Qigong , combination structure exercise program combine aerobic resistance training improve cardiovascular health improve quality life patient mechanical heart device . To test hypothesis , measure cardiovascular function quality life parameter patient attached mechanical heart device participate exercise program practice Qigong , compare measure patient participate exercise program , practice Qigong . Information gain research serve basis application exercise training Qigong apply treatment chronic disease physical conditioning and/or quality life individual compromise .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal study improve overall physical health quality life patient attached mechanical heart assist device await heart transplantation . Qigong , ancient Chinese exercise involve active participation individual form meditation , breathe exercise simple physical movement , use adjunct therapy , include structured exercise program , currently provide patient University Arizona Health Sciences Center . Based result study demonstrate physiological psychosocial benefit structure exercise program practice qigong , follow hypothesis propose : 1 ) structure exercise program combine aerobic resistance training improve cardiovascular health patient mechanical heart assist device ; condition effect amplify practice Qigong ; 2 ) structure exercise program combine aerobic resistance training improve quality life patient mechanical heart assist device ; condition effect amplify practice Qigong ; 3 ) improve quality life physical conditioning effect structured exercise program Qigong enhance quality life physical conditioning cardiac transplantation . To test hypothesis , follow specific aim accomplish : 1 ) obtain pilot data evaluate alteration specific measure cardiovascular function health patient attach mechanical heart assist device participate structured aerobic/resistance exercise program , without Qigong ; 2 ) obtain pilot data evaluate alteration specific quality life measure patient attach mechanical heart assist device participate structured aerobic/resistance exercise program , without Qigong ; 3 ) part clinical follow-up patient follow heart transplantation , obtain pilot data evaluate specific parameter cardiovascular health quality life individual attach mechanical heart assist device prior receive transplant . Information gain research serve basis application exercise training Qigong apply treatment chronic disease state physical conditioning and/or quality life individual compromise .</detailed_description>
