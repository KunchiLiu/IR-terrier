	<brief_summary>This study use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) picture kidney renal artery ( artery supply blood kidney ) patient schedule kidney artery angiogram angioplasty/stenting procedure . An angiogram way take picture artery show area narrow cause atherosclerosis-a buildup plaque vessel wall . Angioplasty/stent treatment procedure balloon-tipped catheter insert artery advanced area blockage open vessel , increase blood flow kidney . A permanent metal tube ( stent ) may may put place maintain opening . During either invasive procedure , small piece plaque break travel blood lodge elsewhere body . This call embolization . Lodged kidney , embolus impair kidney function . Currently , emboli detect . A new way visualize kidney allow detection embolus may reveal whether material move kidney predict kidney damage . Patients 21 year age older suspect kidney artery disease schedule invasive angiographic evaluation NIH protocol 95-H-0047 may eligible study . Participants assign one two study group , base angiogram finding decision angioplasty/stent procedure . Participants group baseline MRI scan 2 week invasive procedure ( angiogram without angioplasty/stent ) within day procedure . Patients undergo angioplasty/stent another MRI study within month follow procedure . MRI use magnetic field radio wave produce image body tissue . The patient lie table slide large hollow tube ( scanner ) . During part scan , material call gadolinium contrast may inject vein . This substance brighten image well show kidney , blood vessel blood flow . The procedure last 1 2 hour . During MRI , heart monitor electrocardiogram ( EKG ) breathing monitor flexible belt . Blood pressure measure intermittently . The patient communicate staff member time . Blood sample draw arm vein initial clinic visit , within day procedure 1 week procedure . For patient angioplasty/stent procedure , third blood sample take within another 6 six week . The blood sample use check change kidney function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis ( ARAS ) common associate uncontrolled hypertension renal excretory dysfunction . Percutaneous stenting ARAS effectively relieve arterial obstruction , approximately one-quarter patient derive apparent clinical benefit actually suffer deterioration renal excretory function . There reason suspect percutaneous renal intervention associate embolization aorto-ostial atheromatous debris , may lead adverse clinical outcome . There known clinical , image , biochemical marker renal embolism ischemic necrosis . Investigational clinical detection event might guide future modification mechanical interventional technique , example , introduction procedural embolic protection device . This pilot study patient undergo percutaneous transluminal renal artery stenting ( PTRAS ) attempt image embolization use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) .</detailed_description>
