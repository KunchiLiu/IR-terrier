	<brief_summary>This study compare side effect two laser treatment diabetic macular edema , common condition patient diabetes . In macular edema , blood vessel retina-a thin layer tissue line back eye-become leaky retina swell . The macula-the center part retina responsible fine vision-may also swell cause vision loss . Traditional laser treatment ( argon blue green yellow ) macular swell , edema , cause scar expand possibly lead loss vision . Studies different type laser ( diode ) show adverse effect retina , long-term effect treatment know . The result study side effect treatment use design large study effectiveness . This study also examine whether vitamin E reduce damage cause laser treatment . Patients diabetic eye disease take vitamin E increase blood flow vessel retina , well improve kidney function . Patients elevate cholesterol level invite participate cholesterol reduction part study compare normal-pace cholesterol reduction accelerate reduction . Patients 18 year age old type 1 type 2 diabetes macular edema may eligible study . Candidates screen follow test procedure : - Medical history - review past medical condition treatment . - Physical examination - measure vital sign ( pulse , blood pressure , temperature , breathe rate ) examine head neck , heart , lung , abdomen , arm legs . - Eye examination - assess visual acuity ( eye chart test ) examine pupil , lens , retina , eye movement . The pupil dilate drops examination . - Blood test - measure cholesterol vitamin E blood level , blood clotting time , hemoglobin A1C ( measure diabetes control ) , evaluate liver kidney function . - Photography - help evaluate status retina change may occur future . Special photographs inside eye take use camera flash bright light eye . From 2 20 picture may take , depend eye condition . - Fluorescein angiography - evaluate eye 's blood vessel . A yellow dye inject arm vein travel blood vessel eye . Pictures retina take use camera flash blue light eye . The picture show dye leak vessel retina , indicate possible blood vessel abnormality . Participants randomly assign receive one two laser treatment . They also randomly assign take 1600 IU vitamin E placebo ( inactive , look-alike pill ) daily . For laser treatment , eye drop put eye numb surface contact lens place eye laser beam application . Several visit may require additional laser treatment . The maximum number treatment depend well treatment work . On first visit , patient give vitamin C. After take vitamin 1 month , return clinic first laser treatment . They follow 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month first treatment , every 6 month either 1 ) patient return 3-year visit ; 2 ) last enrolled patient return 1-year visit , patient request leave study . During visit , several exam describe repeated evaluate response treatment check side effect vitamin E .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize pilot study important first step plan large multi-center clinical trial evaluate medical laser approach could improve visual outcome patient diabetic retinopathy . This study provide preliminary safety data therapy well allow assessment performance ocular outcome study design use subsequent trial . If safety concern , result pilot helpful design large multicenter clinical trial provide data estimate expect treatment effect . A large trial proceed regardless whether study identifies statistically significant main effect . Using partial factorial design , study compare ( 1 ) diode ( micropulse ) laser photocoagulation mild ETDRS style focal photocoagulation , ( 2 ) treatment Vitamin E , COX-2 inhibitor ( celecoxib ) , placebo prior follow laser photocoagulation . The primary safety outcome visual acuity drop 15 letter baseline one year follow initial laser treatment . The primary efficacy outcome reduction retinal thickening define improvement least two step ( standard fundus photo ) combine 50 % reduction area fluorescein leakage one year initial laser compare baseline . A secondary outcome change macular height measure ( OCT ) . These outcome assess potential use future trial . Concerns regard safety efficacy follow : Safety Is risk visual loss patient clinically significant diabetic macular edema potentially different across treatment group ? Preliminary Assessment Potential Outcomes Is evidence treatment combination could effective reduce retinal thickening ? Is evidence Vitamin E may affect ability either photocoagulation method reduce retinal thickening , vice versa ? Is evidence celecoxib may inhibit retinal thickening ? What estimate treatment effect vision ? Is number laser treatment require achieve reduction retinal thickening similar across treatment group ? A tertiary objective study examine effect dramatically reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol patient diabetic macular edema elevate serum lipid . Change vision retinal thickness compare across three group ; ( 1 ) patient without elevated serum lipid baseline , ( 2 ) patient elevated lipid baseline receive standard care treatment , ( 3 ) patient elevated lipid baseline aggressively treat pharmacologically .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients type 1 2 diabetes . Patients clinically significant macular edema least one eye . Best correct visual acuity 20/400 good measure ETDRS chart eye clinically significant macular edema ; eye consider study eye . If eye clinically significant macular edema best correct visual acuity great equal 20/400 , right eye consider study eye . May proliferative diabetic retinopathy scatter photocoagulation must perform six month ago . Ocular medium sufficiently clear allow quality fundus photography . If Aphakic pseudophakic , lens removal must occur least 6 month prior enrollment . Clinical diagnosis diabetes base one criterion ( determine medical physician ) : Documented history plasma glucose value great 210 mg/dl 3 different occasion . Fasting blood sugar great 150 mg/dl 3 different occasion . Documented history ketoacidosis . Insulin dependency . Documented history abnormal glucose tolerance test . Patient 's medical status must include likelihood survival 5 year . Hemoglobin A1C 12 percent less . Willingness accept randomization diet drug therapy lower elevate lipid level . Understand sign inform consent . Patients 18 year age since population interest primarily old 18 . A negative urine pregnancy test woman childbearing potential . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Retinopathy require scatter photocoagulation immediately . Ocular disease diabetic retinopathy may confound outcome study ( e.g . agerelated macular degeneration , drug toxicity , uveitis , etc. ) . Had previous focal laser photocoagulation diabetic macular edema . Poor survival due systemic disease ( separate diabetes ) Poor glycemic control hemoglobin A1C great 12 percent . Past current liver disease , precludes use lipidlowering drug . Vitamin E supplementation amount multivitamin ( 30 IU/day ) one month prior entry study . History hypersensitivity fluorescein . History intracranial bleeds . Evidence ocular disease may confound assessment treatment diabetic macular edema . Prior current macular detachment affect eye ( ) . Concurrent celebrex COX2 inhibitor within 7 day prior baseline . Concurrent coumadin therapy know bleeding diathesis . Concurrent treatment new investigational drug . Concurrent lithium therapy Malabsorption syndrome . Concurrent administration anticholesterol resin medication ( e.g . cholestyramine ) Concurrent administration antiobesity drug orlistat ( Xenical ) . Concurrent administration NSAIDs . Allergy sulphonomides , NSAIDs , exhibit aspirin triad . Pregnant lactating woman . Chronic requirement ocular medication disease glacoma . Current history malignancy ( except patient basal cell carcinoma treat successfully , malignancy operate remission 5 year prior inclusion trial ) .</criteria>
