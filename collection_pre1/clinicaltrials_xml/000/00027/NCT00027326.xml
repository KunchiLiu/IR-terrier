	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Evolving research initiatives Radiation Oncology Branch ( ROB ) NCI , depend upon availability blood urine sample patient receive radiotherapy . Examples plan study include exploration effect radiotherapy peripheral leukocyte phenotype , peripheral blood protein metabolism change well measurement matrix metalloproteinases ( MMP ) urine . OBJECTIVES : This protocol provide mean acquire blood urine sample patient receive radiation therapy variety condition . ELIGIBILITY : Patients see radiation oncology clinic ask donate blood and/or urine , treatment . DESIGN : This pilot , exploratory study evaluate effect ionize radiation blood and/ urine . On occasion , blood sample obtain component routine patient monitoring necessitate additional venipuncture . Blood urine sample process stored Radiation Oncology Branch Basic Research Laboratory , CCR , NCI , use research effort branch .</detailed_description>
