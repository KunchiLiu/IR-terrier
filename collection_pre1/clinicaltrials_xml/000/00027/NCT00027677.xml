	<brief_title>Halofuginone Hydrobromide Treating Patients With Progressive Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine toxicity profile , maximum tolerate dose , dose-limiting toxic effect halofuginone hydrobromide patient progressive advance solid tumor . - Establish recommend dose drug phase II study . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients receive oral halofuginone hydrobromide daily day 1 4-14 course 1 day 1-14 subsequent course . Treatment repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 1-3 patient receive escalate dos halofuginone hydrobromide maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose 20 % patient experience acute dose-limiting toxicity . After MTD reach , 6-12 additional patient treat dose level precede MTD recommend dose phase II study determine . The recommend dose phase II study define dose precede MTD allow 90 % dose intensity 2 month great grade 2 toxicity 80 % patient . Patients follow every 8 week disease progression initiation another treatment . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 7-40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
