	<brief_summary>The purpose study see full daily dose Combivir ( zidovudine [ ZDV ] /lamivudine [ 3TC ] ) take day effective usual recommend twice-a-day dose . Studies show antiviral activity ZDV continue body even appear ZDV leave blood . This occur body break drug substance remain active HIV . The body also break 3TC , drug combine ZDV Combivir product , similar way . Since antiviral activity may continue Combivir remove body , may necessary take drug often think . This study carefully measure level active substance order find whether amount antiviral activity occur less-frequent dosing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zidovudine Lamivudine Given Once Versus Twice Daily</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Initial dose regimen ZDV base plasma half-life drug . However , recent study intracellular metabolism ZDV demonstrate active anabolite , ZDV-TP , present within cell extended period time relative drug plasma . This suggest antiviral activity may present sufficient time frame less-frequent dose drug . Careful comparison rate extent intracellular phosphorylated ZDV metabolite function schedule determine whether less-frequent dose sound pharmacological basis . Also , intracellular metabolism 3TC via different enzyme ZDV quantitative difference amount triphosphate form drug . This study provide information intracellular metabolite ZDV 3TC concurrently administer . This study 2 schedule Combivir therapy . At study entry Part I , patient take Combivir twice daily 7-day adherence assessment . Patients demonstrate 70 percent great adherence [ AS PER AMENDMENT 7/20/01 : 70 percent compliance study regimen Combivir . This correspond take least 10 prescribed 14 Combivir tablet 7 day prior adherence assessment , include schedule dos 24-hour period prior assessment . ] , take schedule Combivir dose previous 24 hour , pharmacokinetic sample obtain randomize Group A Group B Part II . Group A patient take 2 Combivir tablet daily ; Group B patient take 1 Combivir tablet twice daily . After patient complete targeted duration Part II ( 7 day Group A 7-14 day Group B ) , assess adherence . Patients demonstrate 70 percent great adherence , take schedule Combivir dose previous 24 hour , pharmacokinetic sample obtain change alternate dosing schedule . Group A patient take 1 Combivir tablet twice daily ; Group B patient take 2 Combivir tablet daily . After patient complete targeted duration Part III ( 7-14 day Group A 7 day Group B ) , assess adherence . All patient meet adherence criterion pharmacokinetic sample obtain . After completion Part III pharmacokinetic study , patient complete study . ( Note : Combivir provide study . )</detailed_description>
