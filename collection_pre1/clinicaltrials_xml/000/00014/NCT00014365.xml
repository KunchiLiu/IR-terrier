	<brief_title>Ro 31-7453 Treating Patients With Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I. Assess impact food bioavailability Ro 31-7453 patient locally advance metastatic solid tumor . OUTLINE : This randomize , crossover study . Patients randomize one two treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive oral Ro 31-7453 fasting condition day 1 . After 1-week washout period , patient receive oral Ro 31-7453 fed condition . Arm II : Patients receive feed treatment arm I day 1 . After 1-week washout period , patient receive fast treatment arm I . Both arm : At start week 3 , patient may continue receive oral Ro 31-7453 every 12 hour day 1-4 . Treatment repeat every 3 week least 24 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 7 day . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 10 patient ( 5 per arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
