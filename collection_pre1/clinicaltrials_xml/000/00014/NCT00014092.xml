	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Biological therapy interleukin-2 interferon alfa stimulate person 's white blood cell kill cancer cell may interfere growth cancer cell . Combining chemotherapy biological therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness temozolomide follow sargramostim , interleukin-2 , interferon alfa treat patient stage IV melanoma treat surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Followed Biological Therapy Treating Patients With Stage IV Melanoma That Can Treated With Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine response rate , time progression , survival patient unresectable stage IV melanoma treat temozolomide follow sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) , interleukin-2 , interferon alfa . - Determine safety tolerability regimen patient population . - Determine change quality life time patient treated regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral temozolomide day 1-5 , sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) , interleukin-2 , interferon alfa subcutaneously day 6-17 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4-8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients least stable responsive disease 8 course therapy may receive additional therapy investigator discretion . Quality life assess baseline , every 8 week study , 1 month study . Patients follow 1 month , every 3 month 2 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 14-30 patient accrue study within 2 year .</detailed_description>
