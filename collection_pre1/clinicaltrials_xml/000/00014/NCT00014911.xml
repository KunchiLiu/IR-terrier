	<detailed_description>This Phase I/II study ( study examines effectiveness look side effect ) . The transplant islet cell study Type 1 diabetic patient whose blood sugar level stay normal , despite intensive insulin therapy . A recent study conduct Edmonton , Canada , able demonstrate islet transplantation lead insulin independence majority patient treat . This study extend result obtain Edmonton study , use islet transplantation Type 1 diabetic patient steroid-free immunosuppression . Eligible patient randomly select total pool people apply Immune Tolerance Network . Patients receive least 10,000 `` islet equivalent '' per kilogram ( 2.2 pound ) body weight . This likely require 2 separate islet infusion 2 separate donor . Immediately first transplant , patient give anti-rejection ( immune suppressing ) drug , include tacrolimus sirolimus ( orally ) daclizumab ( intravenously ) . The islet infuse liver tube place portal vein . Heparin ( medication prevent blood clot ) administer islet infusion . A longer-acting form heparin also give daily injection next week transplant . After surgery , patient receive insulin intravenously 24 hour . Patients abdominal ultrasound blood test determine liver function . If few 10,000 islet transplant , patient continue insulin treatment , dosage adjust necessary account transplant islet . They take daclizumab every 2 week 8 week tacrolimus sirolimus daily . Patients give antibiotic prevent infection . Blood test determine much immunosuppressant drug blood perform drug stable level . Periodically test see islet cell function . Blood drawn check drug level test routinely . Daily insulin requirement check , record monthly . Patients follow least 1 year post last islet transplantation . Additional follow-up may provide least annually 9 year post first transplantation .</detailed_description>
