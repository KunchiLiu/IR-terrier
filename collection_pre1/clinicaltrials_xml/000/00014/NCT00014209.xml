	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining one drug may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combination chemotherapy treat patient Hodgkin 's disease non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma respond previous treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Hodgkin 's Disease Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma That Has Not Responded Previous Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine efficacy gemcitabine , dexamethasone , cisplatin patient relapse refractory Hodgkin 's disease aggressive non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . - Determine qualitative quantitative toxicity regimen two patient population . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord disease ( Hodgkin 's disease vs non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ) . Patients receive oral dexamethasone day 1-4 , cisplatin IV 1 hour day 1 , gemcitabine IV 30 minute day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 4 week , 3 month , every 3 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 44-88 patient ( 22-44 per stratum ) accrue study within 4-10 month .</detailed_description>
