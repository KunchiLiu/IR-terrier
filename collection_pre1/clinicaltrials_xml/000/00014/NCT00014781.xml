	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine amount hepatic glucose production derive gluconeogenesis glycogenolysis post-absorptive state patient cystic fibrosis . II . Determine de novo lipogenesis relationship rest energy expenditure patient population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Hepatic Glucose Production De Novo Lipogenesis Patients With Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE : Patients undergo oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) blood drawn IV arm 6 time 3 hour . After first blood draw , patient receive beverage containing sugar write everything ate drink 24 hour study entry . Patients also undergo dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan 15 minute . Within 2 week OGTT , patient keep journal everything ate drink 3 day . Patients feed select meal follow even receive saline fluid IV overnight . During night , patient receive 2 dos oral doubly labeled water . The next morning , patient receive [ 1,2-13C ] acetate IV . A liquid mixed meal ( Ensure Plus ) ingest hourly throughout day . Patients also undergo hood indirect calorimetry 30 minute twice measure rest energy expenditure . All urine collect .</detailed_description>
