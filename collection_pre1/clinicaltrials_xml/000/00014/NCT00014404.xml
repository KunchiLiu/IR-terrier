	<brief_title>Celecoxib Treating Patients With Precancerous Lesions Mouth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine efficacy celecoxib , term clinical response histological response , patient oral premalignant lesion . II . Evaluate safety chronic multiple dose celecoxib patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord premalignant risk ( early v advance ) . Patients stratum randomize 1 3 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive lower-dose oral celecoxib twice daily . Arm II : Patients receive higher-dose oral celecoxib twice daily . Arm III : Patients receive oral placebo twice daily . Treatment continue 3 arm 12 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 18 , 24 , 26 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 84 patient ( 42 per stratum , 14 per arm ) accrue study within 6 month .</detailed_description>
