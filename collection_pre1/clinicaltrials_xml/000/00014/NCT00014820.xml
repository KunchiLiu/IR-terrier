	<brief_title>Occupation Asthma Urban Low Income Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Work-related asthma asthma attributable , make worse , environmental exposure workplace . Published estimate proportion adult asthma attributable occupational factor vary widely , depend population , methodology , definition , 2 percent 33 percent . Occupational asthma great public health importance potentially preventable , cause substantial disability , case completely curable . Among adult United States , asthma become major public health problem , rate elevate among low income , urban , African American Latino sector population , substantial evidence suggest potential occupational contribution excess rate . These important sector U.S. population , however , inadequately represent occupational asthma research literature . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This case control study physician-diagnosed asthma , occupation , industry , workplace environmental exposure design evaluate hypothesis substantial component asthma burden low income , urban , largely minority population due occupational factor . The study design address variety methodologic challenge include healthy worker effect , difficulty contact recruit potentially high risk population , large number potential etiologic agent , mixed exposure , small workplace , low absolute incidence occupational asthma . The study population catchment population Bellevue Hospital , general hospital lower Manhattan , New York City , busy ambulatory care service serve low income work community . Cases control recruit among outpatient inpatient Bellevue Hospital interview face-to-face telephone . Occupation , industry , occupational exposure determine questionnaire supplement Job Exposure Matrix . Odds ratio ( ORs ) association asthma specific industrial , occupational , exposure category , control major confounders , estimate . The ORs use calculate occupation- industry-specific Attributable Fractions , overall Population Attributable Fraction asthma attributable occupational factor . New onset occupational asthma work-aggravated asthma investigate separately .</detailed_description>
