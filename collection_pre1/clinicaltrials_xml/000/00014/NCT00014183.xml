	<brief_title>ZD 1839 Treating Patients With Stage IV Recurrent Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine response rate patient progressive stage IV recurrent renal cell cancer treat ZD 1839 . - Determine median time objective progression patient receive drug . - Determine toxic effect drug patient population . - Determine epidermal growth factor receptor expression tumor tissue correlate response survival patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral ZD 1839 daily . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 8 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 21-45 patient accrue study within 11-23 month .</detailed_description>
