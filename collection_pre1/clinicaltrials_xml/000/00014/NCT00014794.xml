	<brief_summary>This study test whether positron emission tomography ( PET ) imaging use measure blood flow joint patient rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . It also compare blood flow measurement use PET measurement obtain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) determine useful MRI measuring blood flow joint . Much joint damage RA cause synovium-the lining joint . In RA , synovium increase size destroy bone cartilage . The synovium maintain growth form many new small blood vessel nourish . New drug treatment develop stop growth new blood vessel . The effect treatment synovium usually measure perform biopsy-removing small piece synovium examination microscope . The biopsy require insert needle joint withdraw synovial tissue . This study see change blood flow assess accurately use noninvasive imaging procedure , PET scan , instead biopsy . Patients 18 year age old rheumatoid arthritis least one tender swollen knee due synovitis may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination . Participants mold make knee studied routine blood test . Women able become pregnant pregnancy test . All participant undergo PET MRI scan describe : PET - A needle use insert catheter ( small plastic tube ) arm vein injection radioactive substance H215O . The patient lie doughnut-shaped machine ( PET scanner ) quick scan do measure body thickness . Then , separate scan take follow six few injection H215O . Each scan last 13 minute . MRI - The patient lie stretcher move cylinder contain magnetic field ( MRI scanner ) . A special coil place knee improve quality image . Earplugs worn muffle loud thump sound produce electrical switching magnetic field image . A contrast agent call gadolinium inject catheter vein improve quality image . An intercom system permit patient communicate technician time procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Positron Emission Tomography Magnetic Resonance Imaging Evaluate Synovial Blood Flow Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because proliferative nature rheumatoid synovial tissue , many new pharmaceutical target angiogenesis inhibition mean halt synovial growth . Although clinical marker rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) activity may function surrogate endpoint trials new agent , non-invasive technique assess synovial blood flow would ideal outcome measure . PET image use quantify blood flow variety tissue , significant experience institution area tumor blood flow analysis . The objective study evaluate feasibility H2 ( 15 ) O PET measurement synovial blood flow patient RA . In 10 RA patient active knee synovitis , clinical radiological ( H2 ( 15 ) O PET dynamic MRI ) evaluation perform . The feasibility H2 ( 15 ) O PET evaluate reproducibility . We also evaluate correlation dynamic MRI synovial blood flow measurement H2 ( 15 ) O PET .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 18 year age great . Must meet American College Rheumatology 's diagnostic criterion RA ( 21 ) . Must synovitis least one knee characterize tenderness , swell , effusion within 30 day prior screen . Women must test negative pregnancy test unless postmenopausal surgically sterile . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients concurrent know bacterial , septic , crystalinduced arthritis , rheumatic disease may confound analysis include limited Lyme disease , psoriatic arthritis , spondylarthropathy , systemic lupus erythematosus , reactive arthritis . Patients would beyond guideline radiation exposure research study within past year . Patients exceed size weight limitation PET MRI scanner . Patients suffer claustrophobia following : cardiac pacemaker , auto defibrillator , neural stimulators , aneurysm clip , metallic prosthesis , cochlear ( ear ) implant , implant device ( pump , infusion device , etc ) , metal fragment eye , shrapnel injury . Any musculoskeletal , neurological , vascular condition may alter normal function structure knee joint interest interfere patient 's ability undergo studyrelated intervention image . Any clinically significant medical condition , opinion investigator , would pose added risk study participant . History allergic nonallergic serious reaction gadolinium , H2 15O PET . Pregnant woman nurse mother .</criteria>
