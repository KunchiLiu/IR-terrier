	<brief_summary>This research study design find increase dietary intake polyunsaturated fat improve concentration , motor skill cardiovascular response stress . These polyunsaturated fat may also change chemical brain control responses . Specifically , polyunsaturated fat may raise brain level neurotransmitter call dopamine serotonin . Polyunsaturated fat important improve function brain heart . People make polyunsaturated fat obtain oil eat . For three month subject take 8 capsule day contain either corn oil flavor fish oil fish oil taste little like corn oil . Subjects tell oil expect work well . An initial evaluation determine subject fit criterion necessary enter study . A battery test conduct twice , start capsule three month take capsule . These battery test include MRI head , paper pencil test evaluate change mood , test concentration motor skill cardiovascular response stress . Two lumbar puncture perform collect cerebrospinal fluid change neurotransmitter evaluate . Subjects seafood diet equalize dietary intake polyunsaturated fatty acid . Subjects expect complete part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The central aim protocol determine omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) docosahexaenoic ( DHA ) reduce aggressive behavior among alcoholic randomize , double blind , placebo control trial . Aggression measure well-established behavioral test , Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm . Secondary tertiary aim determine supplementation improve neurochemical mechanism cardiovascular abnormality link pathophysiology aggression . A test battery do supplementation ( baseline ) compare battery repeat three month supplementation . This battery include 1 ) psychometric measure ( aggression , depression impulsivity ) , 2 ) neurochemical measure ( lumbar puncture assessment cerebrospinal fluid 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid [ CSF 5-HIAA ] , metabolite serotonin ) , 3 ) measure cardiovascular physiology ( heart rate variability ) . The research participant randomize consume four 1-gram capsules/ contain either 1.88 gram DHA plus EPA ( active ) reference oil contain corn oil 1 % fish oil flavor blinding ( placebo ) . Research participant aggressive recover alcoholic define score 20 Coccaro Lifetime History Aggression Scale eat seafood per week . If inexpensive nutrient reduce aggression relate neurochemical cardiovascular measure , finding readily applicable many aggressive population .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : A primary diagnosis alcohol dependence within last three month . Male female research participant Coccaro Lifetime History Aggression score 20 .
