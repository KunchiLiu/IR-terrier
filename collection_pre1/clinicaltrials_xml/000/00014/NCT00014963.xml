	<brief_summary>This study compare air pollution exposures resident South Baltimore community next major industry comparison community much less industry nearby . Parents child well adult alone include . Air level 3 chemical find increased amount community well two urinary breakdown product benzene measure . Participants limit amount sorbate preserve food eat preservative interferes one benzene breakdown product . Benzene air urine exposure measurement compare community well community . By include child parent gather exposure information child may sensitive adult type pollution . Lastly , restrict amount food preserve sorbate , decide improves use ttMA people expose benzene air pollution .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The current study focus environmental exposure assessment South Baltimore community reside near heavily industrialized area . Exposure difference community reference community demographically similar South Baltimore limit industrial impact assess . Participants include parent child study pair adult . Outdoor , indoor personal 72 hour badge monitoring benzene , 1,3-butadiene carbon tetrachloride perform . Two urinary biomarkers benzene exposure , trans , trans-muconic acid ( ttMA ) s-phenylmercapturic acid ( S-PMA ) measure 3 daily time point 3 day period . Past work indicate ingestion sorbate preserve food cause substantial interference benzene biomarker , ttMA . Therefore , participant restrict intake sorbate preserve food study . On day great dietary restriction , 24 hour benzene personal air measurement obtain . Data analysis include correlation benzene badge exposure measurement urinary biomarkers . Air biomarker benzene exposure data compare community . Linear regression modeling use determine important explanatory factor biomarkers . The inclusion parent child study pair also allow correlation benzene air level urinary biomarkers parent child . This provide exposure information potentially susceptible subpopulation , e.g . child , allow assessment potential age-related difference benzene metabolism . Finally , able determine dietary restriction practical result great specificity ttMA benzene biomarker .</detailed_description>
