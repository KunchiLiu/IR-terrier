	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : It well known cardiovascular disease inversely associate SES . However , SES may change time socially mobile individual clear whether association cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) differs early life SES vs. mid-life SES . Another issue individual may relatively high income and/or wealth , may live low SES neighborhood . It would desirable separate effect individual level vs. aggregate level SES . Finally , limit evidence association SES CVD may vary accord ethnic group . The bi-ethnic character ARIC population make fertile environment test hypothesis . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Mechanisms identify explain strong inverse association socioeconomic status ( SES ) life course cardiovascular disease morbidity mortality Atherosclerosis Risk Communities ( ARIC ) , bi-ethnic population-based sample four U.S. community . Health outcome include non-invasively measured subclinical cardiovascular disease , well fatal non-fatal clinical disease manifestation ascertain course 10 year follow-up . Earlier life course socioeconomic status measurement current socioeconomic status biomedical cardiovascular risk factor integrate geocoded contemporary social environmental exposure assess impact cardiovascular function , metabolic impairment , allostatic load , subclinical clinical disease . Multilevel analyse perform goal identify pathway socioeconomic status relate cardiovascular disease , consider relevant health behavior , life style , psychosocial stressors/support mechanism , chronic infection/chronic inflammatory burden , autonomic nervous system dysfunction , sustain metabolic impairment . The potential modification association social environment address analysis , well putative difference gender ethnicity . These stag analytic goal make possible linking Census-based indicator social environment rich data resource ARIC Study , bi-ethnic , community-based sample men woman age 45-64 year time baseline examination 1987-1989 . This cohort re-examined every three year January , 1999 ascertainment SES childhood , early adulthood mid-life , health-relevant behavior , numerous measurement risk factor , measure subclinical cardiovascular disease carotid artery wall thickness , arterial distensibility , retinopathy , low extremity arterial disease . These data , well validate information hospital discharge diagnose cause-specific mortality accrue 10 year follow-up available . Additional life course information member ARIC cohort collect Year 1 study .</detailed_description>
