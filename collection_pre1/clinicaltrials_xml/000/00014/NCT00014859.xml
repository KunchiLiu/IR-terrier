	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Respiratory distress syndrome frequent respiratory cause death morbidity infant less 1 year age United States . Of approximately 28,500 infant death 2006 , 5,421 ( 19.7 % ) diagnose respiratory distress either primary ( 1,011 - 3.7 % ) secondary ( 4,410 - 16 % ) cause death . Despite improvement infant mortality rate last 20 year , survivor respiratory distress syndrome chronic respiratory disease consume twenty time annualized dollar unaffected child 5.9 % dollar spent child 0-18 year age . More recent estimate include data California New York , Institute Medicine , 2001 Nationwide Inpatient Sample Healthcare Cost Utilization Project suggest average cost hospitalization 49,900 infant diagnosis respiratory distress syndrome $ 56,800 vs. $ 10,700 premature infant without respiratory distress syndrome . The recent increase late preterm birth contribute frequency respiratory distress syndrome economic impact . These medical cost include economic consequence infant respiratory morbidity family , e.g. , absence work , early intervention cost optimize outcome . In addition , despite 2-3 fold great risk infant mortality African American infant European American infant cause , European American infant great risk death respiratory distress African American infant , increase risk attributable difference surfactant phospholipid composition , birth weight , gestational age , confound socioeconomic factor . Understanding genetic mechanism cause respiratory distress syndrome critical improving outcome child United States , reduce cost health care , reduce racial disparity infant mortality . Since original description deficiency pulmonary surfactant premature newborn infant Avery Mead 1959 , respiratory distress syndrome commonly attribute developmental immaturity pulmonary surfactant production . Despite improvement neonatal survival associate availability surfactant replacement therapy premature infant , gender race base disparity disease frequency , morbidity mortality persist , observation suggest genetic factor play important role disease pathogenesis . In addition , twin study indicate high heritability ( h2 ) neonatal respiratory distress syndrome ( 0.2 0.8 ) . Recent clinical report monogenic cause neonatal respiratory distress syndrome , statistical association candidate gene variant increase disease risk , study target gene ablation murine lineage also strongly suggest genetic mechanism contribute risk respiratory distress syndrome newborn infant . When examined genetic variant large population-based case-control cohort , find population-based frequency individual , disruptive mutation 3 candidate gene ( SFTPB , SFTPC , ABCA3 ) ( &lt; 2 % ) account &lt; 0.1 % population attributable risk term near term infant , individual , rare , disruptive mutation associate disease case-control cohort . In addition , attempt establish association intermediate biochemical phenotype ( surfactant protein-B peptide mobility western blot ) SFTPB variant ( assessed complete resequencing ) term near term infant without respiratory distress , fail identify SFTPB variant combination variant associated respiratory distress alter surfactant protein-B structure . Finally , recently find tagSNPs gene gene network express lung part pulmonary surfactant network ( ion channel , lung remodeling , unfold protein response gene ) confer race-specific risk neonatal respiratory distress syndrome . These study suggest variation SFTPB , SFTPC , ABCA3 significant purify selection pressure genetic contribution neonatal respiratory distress syndrome base contribution rare , independent risk allele multiple gene gene network . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Rare mutation surfactant protein-B gene ( SFTPB ) gene pulmonary surfactant metabolic network cause lethal neonatal respiratory distress syndrome human newborn infant disrupt metabolism function pulmonary surfactant . Mutation frequency ( &lt; 1-2 % ) SFTPB 2 candidate gene pulmonary surfactant network ( SFTPC ABCA3 ) account heritability neonatal respiratory distress syndrome ( h2~0.2-0.8 ) suggest twin study . To develop comprehensive catalogue gene gene network account heritability complex disease , propose test hypothesis excess , rare , functionally disruptive single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) characterize gene gene network associate increase risk neonatal respiratory distress syndrome . Specifically , use agnostic candidate gene identification algorithm Kyoto Encyclopedia Genes Genomes ( KEGG ) Pathway Database , select comprehensive list gene ( ~2,000 ) cognate gene network express human lung . Next , identify subgroup gene ( N=250 ) gene network excess , rare , disruptive exonic SNPs associate neonatal respiratory distress syndrome , use hybridization selection/exon capture , next-generation sequencing technology , new statistical strategy ( e.g. , Combined Multivariate Collapsing ( CMC ) method ) case-control cohort ( N=250 case , 250 control ) size provide adequate statistical power ( &gt; 0.8 ) . Finally , validate high risk gene optimize statistical power search epistatic network x network interaction confer disease risk , use CMC , Bayesian , logic tree method analyze exonic SNPs second case-control cohort ( N=100 case , 100 control ) also size provide adequate statistical power ( &gt; 0.8 ) . Using next-generation sequence technology state art statistical method elucidate genetic complexity neonatal respiratory distress syndrome permit development personalize diagnostic tool preventive therapeutic strategy target whole gene network rather individual gene .</detailed_description>
