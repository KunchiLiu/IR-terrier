	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine toxicity total-body irradiation , anti-thymocyte globulin , cyclophosphamide follow syngeneic autologous peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) transplantation patient multiple sclerosis . II . Determine disease response patient treat regimen . III . Determine safety efficacy filgrastim ( G-CSF ) PBSC mobilization patient population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Pilot Study Total-Body Irradiation , Anti-Thymocyte Globulin Cyclophosphamide Followed By Syngeneic Autologous Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation Patients With Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral prednisone day 0-10 . Beginning day 1 , patient undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) transplantation receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously daily leukapheresis complete . Leukapheresis begin approximately day 4 continue adequate CD34+ PBSC collect . PBSC collect syngeneic donor similar manner . Patients undergo total-body irradiation twice daily day -5 -4 . Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV day -3 -2 anti-thymocyte globulin IV day -5 , -3 , -1 , 1 , 3 , 5 . Patients undergo autologous syngeneic PBSC transplantation day 0 . Following PBSC transplantation , patient receive oral prednisone day 7-30 G-CSF IV daily begin day 0 continue blood count recover . Patients follow 30 , 80 , 90 day , monthly 6 month , 1 2 year .</detailed_description>
