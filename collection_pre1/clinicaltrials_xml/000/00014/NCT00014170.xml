	<brief_title>Gefitinib Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine treatment effectiveness gefitinib , term response rate , time progression , survival 52 week , progression-free survival 6 month , overall survival , patient newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme . II . Determine toxic effect drug patient . III . Assess fatigue , depression , excessive daytime somnolence , quality life patient treated drug . IV . Assess individual variation response , pharmacokinetic parameter , and/or biological correlate due genetic difference enzymes involved transport , metabolism , and/or mechanism action drug patient . V. Determine type epidermal growth factor receptor affect tumor response outcome patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral gefitinib daily . Courses repeat every 8 week 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline , treatment course , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 4 year , annually 5 year . Patients follow every 8 week tumor progression every 3 month 5 year annually 10 year . Patients remove study treatment reason disease progression follow every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 4 year , annually 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 92 patient accrue study within 14 month .</detailed_description>
