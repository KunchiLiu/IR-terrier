	<brief_title>BBR 3464 Treating Patients With Metastatic Small Cell Lung Cancer That Has Not Responded Previous Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine efficacy BBR 3464 term response rate patient sensitive refractory metastatic small cell lung cancer . II . Determine duration response time progression patient treat drug . III . Determine overall survival patient treated drug . IV . Determine incidence severity toxic effect drug patient population . V. Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient population . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord disease ( refractory vs sensitive ) . Patients receive BBR 3464 IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day least 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients complete partial response stable disease may receive 6 course therapy . Patients without progressive disease 6 course may continue treatment investigator 's discretion . Patients follow every 9 week 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 24-74 patient ( 12-37 per stratum ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
