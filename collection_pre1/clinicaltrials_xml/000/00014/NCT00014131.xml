	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety immunization vitro-treated autologous tumor cell dendritic cell sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) patient stage III IV recurrent renal cell cancer . - Determine frequency conversion delay tumor hypersensitivity test patient treated regimen . - Determine progression-free overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine objective tumor response rate patient still measurable disease time treat regimen . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord measurable disease time vaccine therapy initiate ( yes v ) . Patients undergo tumor cell harvest . Patients multiple persistent site metastatic disease follow harvest receive systemic therapy ( biologic therapy and/or chemotherapy ) tumor cell line expansion . Over 2-4 month , tumor cell line expand , treat interferon gamma , irradiate . Patients undergo leukapheresis obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) . The PBMC incubate 7 day sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) interleukin-4 produce dendritic cell ( DC ) . The DC incubate 2-3 day irradiate tumor cell autologous tumor cell line antigen load DC . Patients undergo delayed tumor hypersensitivity test 1 week prior vaccination week 4 . Patients receive vaccine therapy comprise autologous treated tumor cell DC suspend GM-CSF subcutaneously weekly 3 week . Vaccine therapy continue monthly 5 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 2 month 1 year every 3 month 4 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 80 patient ( 40 per stratum ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
