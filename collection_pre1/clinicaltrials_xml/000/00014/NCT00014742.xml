	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare safety efficacy clostridial collagenase v placebo term improve degree flexion deformity , range finger motion , grip strength patient residual stage Dupuytren 's disease . II . Compare overall clinical success rate , time return normal finger contracture within 0-5 degree normal ( zero degree ) , frequency cord rupture joint patient treat regimen . III . Compare baseline change degree finger flexion deformity , range motion treat finger , strength hand grip ( pound ) patient treat regimen . IV . Compare frequency distribution number patient reduction finger contracture within 0-5 degree normal ( zero degree ) number require re-treatment open-label collagenase treatment regimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase III Randomized Study Collagenase Patients With Residual Stage Dupuytren 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE : This randomize , investigator-blinded , placebo-controlled , multicenter study . Patients randomize one two treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive single collagenase injection target finger cord day 0 . Arm II : Patients receive single placebo injection arm I . Both arm : After 1 month evaluation , patient unresponsive treatment may receive monthly injection collagenase maximum 5 injection . Beginning 1 day completion treatment , patient use joint nighttime extension splint 4 month perform finger flexion/extension exercise . Patients follow 1 , 7 , 14 day , monthly 3 month , every 3 month 9 month , annually 4 year . Completion date provide represent completion date grant per OOPD record</detailed_description>
