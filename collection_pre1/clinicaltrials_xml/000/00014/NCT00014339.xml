	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Enzyme product Wobe-Mugos E may help reduce side effect multiple myeloma therapy . It yet know chemotherapy effective without Wobe-Mugos E treat multiple myeloma . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness chemotherapy without Wobe-Mugos E treat patient stage II stage III multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy With Without Wobe-Mugos E Treating Patients With Stage II Stage III Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare long-term survival patient chemotherapy-naive stage II III multiple myeloma treat standard melphalan prednisone without adjuvant Wobe-Mugos E. II . Compare effect two regimen reduction side effect chemotherapy patient , use 2 quality life questionnaire . III . Compare effect two regimen tumor response rate new metastasis development patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive oral melphalan oral prednisone day 1-4 . Patients also receive adjuvant enzyme therapy oral Wobe-Mugos E 3 time daily begin prior day 1 first course chemotherapy . Arm II : Patients receive melphalan prednisone arm I . Patients also receive oral placebo 3 time daily arm I . Treatment continue minimum 12 month 4 year absence unacceptable toxicity . Patients continue melphalan prednisone 4-week course achieve maximum response plateau phase receive 2 additional course therapy . Quality life assess baseline ; 1 , 3 , 6 month every 6 month 4 year study ; end study . Patients follow survival 1 month complete study patient receive enzyme product . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 250 patient ( 125 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 1.5 year .</detailed_description>
