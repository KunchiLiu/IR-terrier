	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The high prevalence obesity African-American ( AA ) woman public health importance since AA woman suffer high mortality cardiovascular renal disease white woman . The reason mark susceptibility obesity remain poorly understood though known AA woman manifest low rest energy expenditure white woman . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This multi-pronged metabolic genetic epidemiologic study examine two candidate gene ( UCP3 b3AR ) implicate energy metabolism . A total 600 African American girl , age 12-15 year , screen use buccal swabs non-invasive method obtain DNA , determine UCP3 genotypes well b3AR genotype . An estimated 211 girl recruit , select base UCP3 genotype , measurement rest energy expenditure body composition ( use dual energy X-ray absorptiometry [ DEXA ] ) control set Clinical Research Center Cincinnati Children 's Hospital . Variation rest energy expenditure examine across genotype UCP3 large sample . The 2x3 design allow investigator examine whether effect associate UCP3 variation due UCP3 locus alone due additive effect interaction UCP3 b3AR . The study help elucidate relationship variation two important candidate gene energy metabolism , UCP3 b3AR , inter-individual variation level rest energy expenditure high risk ( obesity ) population .</detailed_description>
