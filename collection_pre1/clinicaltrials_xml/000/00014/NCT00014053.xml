	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare immune system activity young people older people HIV . This information compare HIV patient another study . Aging affect immune system activity . This study look factor involve . HIV also affect immune system activity . The result study , use healthy volunteer , compare another study HIV-infected patient . This may provide information immune system activity age HIV .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Immune System Activity Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aging associate decline cellular humoral immunity . A consistent observation age immune system change T cell . Another possible mechanism diminish cellular immunity associate age include accelerate lymphocyte apoptosis . Enhanced lymphocyte apoptosis may play important role pathogenesis HIV disease . This study use healthy volunteer confirm expand upon observation . Samples volunteer serve control HIV-infected participant A5015 ( comparison study 2 age-differentiated cohort determine potential mechanism might contribute accelerated HIV-disease progression associate age ) . This non-treatment study ; however , volunteer receive hepatitis A tetanus vaccination . Numbers phenotypically naive CD4+ cell ( CD45RA+/CD62L+ ) compare healthy , HIV-seronegative volunteer HIV-seropositive patient A5015 . An array assay assess baseline difference immune function study population perform . Expression marker activation compare measuring coexpression HLA-DR+/CD38+ CD28+ CD4+ CD8+ lymphocytes population . To investigate possible age-associated difference apoptosis , Fas ( CD95+ ) expression measure CD4+ CD8+ T cell flow cytometry , spontaneous apoptosis assess use propidium iodide method . DTH hypersensitivity skin test antigen , lymphocyte proliferation mitogen , soluble antigen , recall antigen , neoantigens compare 2 population . Antibody responses vaccination tetanus hepatitis A assess . Finally , thymic size measure CT scan frequency T cell contain TRECs compare 2 population .</detailed_description>
