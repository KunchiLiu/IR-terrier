	<brief_summary>This study test whether inhale nitric oxide gas improve blood flow heart , ventricular function , exercise tolerance patient coronary artery disease chest pain improve medical surgical therapy . Patients coronary artery disease chest pain despite treatment medicine angioplasty surgery may eligible study . Those enrolled receive monetary compensation participation study . The duration study 5 day , 2 test period last 2 day . During one period , study participant breathe nitric oxide mixed room air face mask test . During period , participant breathe room air alone face mask test . At least 1 day separate treatment period . During 2 treatment period ( nitric oxide room air ) , participant undergo 4 test determine whether treatment improve heart 's response stress increase heart rate contraction . Approximately one hour test , participant breathe either nitric oxide mixed room air room air alone face mask , continue inhalation treatment test perform . The face mask remove end test . On morning first day treatment period , participant special echocardiogram imaging heart . The echocardiogram perform infusion dobutamine , medicine increase heart rate contraction , serve stress heart . This manner stress test commonly use hospital around country determine wall heart receive sufficient blood supply . That afternoon , participant undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) study heart . The MRI determine heart 's blood flow contraction receive dosage dobutamine use earlier day . On morning second day treatment period , participant exercise treadmill moderately uncomfortable chest pain report . Later morning , participant undergo cardiac catheterization . For cardiac catheterization , long tube ( catheter ) place vein neck skin numb xylocaine . This tube position within right atrium heart tube-like structure call coronary sinus , venous blood exit heart muscle . A small catheter also place artery upper forearm skin numb xylocaine . Blood sample take allow u measure amount nitric oxide transport blood . The blood sample draw ( tube heart small tube artery ) begin study infusion dobutamine stress heart . The dose dobutamine infusion dose use previous day 's stress study . After completion first treatment period , stop test least one day . Participants begin second treatment period inhalation treatment receive first treatment period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nitric Oxide Inhalation Therapy Relieve Chest Pain Patients With Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although medical therapy revascularization procedure effective relief chest pain symptom many patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , others either respond tolerate medical therapy , fail attempt revascularization . For grow number patient , need novel therapeutic approach . The purpose protocol test effectiveness nitric oxide ( NO ) inhalation therapy relief inducible myocardial ischemia patient CAD fail conventional attempt medical revascularization management . Our hypothesis enrich NO transport blood lung delivery coronary vasculature NO inhalation improve blood flow myocardium stress dilate coronary artery arteriole . The primary end-point study improvement treadmill exercise duration NO inhalation compare exercise duration room air breathing , secondary end-points select provide mechanistic insight relief inducible ischemia NO , include effect : 1 ) arterial delivery myocardial extraction NO transport molecule , 2 ) myocardial perfusion , 3 ) global regional myocardial contractility . This clinical trial randomize , double-blind , placebo ( room air ) -controlled design , CAD patient treat NO ( room air ) breathe approximately 1 hour stress test , follow crossover alternate therapy two day test . Demonstration benefit NO inhalation could result important therapeutic option CAD patient alternative relief myocardial ischemia .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Presence angiographically determine CAD . At least 1 attempt revascularization catheterbased technique surgery . Myocardial ischemia determine stress echocardiography . Canadian Cardiovascular Society functional class II III angina pectoris despite conventional medical management . Left ventricular ejection fraction great 30 % ( assessed radionuclide angiography echocardiography ) . Subject understands protocol provide write , informed consent addition willingness comply specify followup evaluation . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Left ventricular ejection fraction le 30 % . Active cigarette smoker . History congestive heart failure . History bronchospasm require treatment . Cardiac disease addition CAD ( e.g . hypertrophic dilate cardiomyopathy , valvular heart disease ) determine echocardiography . Angina pectoris rest , prolong duration ( great 20 minute ) , respond nitroglycerin ( 2 tablet ) 2 month prior study . Evidence extracardiac disease diabetes mellitus determined physical examination screen lab work ( e.g. , creatinine great 1.5x upper limit reference , liver enzymes great 2x upper limit reference , hemoglobin le 10 g/dL ) . Patients HIV positive , chronic inflammatory disease , chronic immunosuppressive medication . Women childbearing age unless recent pregnancy test negative . Lactating woman .
