	<brief_summary>This phase II , multicenter , target enrollment 250 evaluable patient , open-label study cetuximab patient refractory , metastatic colorectal carcinoma . Based prior study , predict 70 75 % patient EGFR-positive . Patients must document failure receive either least two chemotherapy regimens metastatic disease adjuvant therapy plus one chemotherapy regimen metastatic disease provide patient progress within 6 month complete adjuvant therapy . Prior chemotherapy must include irinotecan , oxaliplatin , fluoropyrimidine . Patients receive initial dose cetuximab , 400 mg/m2 , intravenously ( i.v . ) 120 minute , follow weekly treatment cetuximab , 250 mg/m2 i.v . 60 minute . Patients experience unacceptable toxicity progressive disease receive cetuximab therapy . Patients evaluate tumor response minimum every 6 week cetuximab therapy . Patients stable disease partial complete response may continue receive weekly cetuximab therapy , unless dose-delayed discontinued toxicity . Patients partial complete response must confirmatory tumor assessment le 4 week initial evaluation demonstrate response . In addition , pharmacokinetic companion protocol determine trough peak level cetuximab 25 patient enrol study four eight center . A pharmacologic serum sample determination level cetuximab obtain prior initial , fourth sixth cetuximab infusion 1 hour follow completion initial , fourth sixth cetuximab infusion first course ; prior 1 hour post completion first cetuximab infusion subsequent course therapy . A course therapy define six weekly infusion cetuximab monotherapy . ImClone perform pharmacokinetic analysis .</brief_summary>
