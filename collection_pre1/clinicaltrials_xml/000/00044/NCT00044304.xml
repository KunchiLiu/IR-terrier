	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy tyrosine kinase inhibitor , imatinib mesylate ( Gleevec ) reduce peripheral blood eosinophilia patient myeloid form hypereosinophilic syndrome ( HES ) . Patients hypereosinophilic syndrome meet set criterion design select patient myeloid form disease , well patient without myeloid disease refractory standard therapy HES , admit protocol . A thorough clinical evaluation perform emphasis potential sequela eosinophil-mediated tissue damage . A baseline bone marrow obtain exclude leukemia lymphoma ass degree nature eosinophilopoiesis . Bone marrow , blood cell and/or serum also collect test presence recently describe mutation associate imatinib-responsiveness HES , provide reagent ( DNA , RNA , specific antibody ) use laboratory address issue relate mechanism action imatinib mesylate HES . Imatinib mesylate initiate dose 400 mg daily , FDA-approved dose treatment chronic myelogenous leukemia . In patient demonstrate complete clinical hematologic response imatinib therapy life-threatening disease , dose decrease gradually 100mg daily discontinue . In order minimize bone marrow suppression , myelosuppressive agent taper discontinue first week therapy imatinib mesylate . Complete blood count perform weekly first month biweekly thereafter . Clinical assessment perform every three month ass progression end organ damage . In patient demonstrate complete clinical hematologic response imatinib therapy life-threatening disease , dose decrease gradually 100 mg daily discontinue . In event clinical , hematologic molecular relapse taper , imatinib dose increase maximum 600 mg daily achieve second remission . Laboratory monitoring perform except molecular monitoring monitor monthly drug discontinue molecular relapse occur . Once stable dose regimen achieve great equal 6 month subject undergone dose descalation great equal 2 year subject receive 300-400 mg imatinib daily qualify dose de-escalation , frequency NIH visit end organ assessment decrease 6 month , molecular monitoring every 3 month monthly routine laboratory assessment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study evaluate safety effectiveness imatinib mesylate reduce number eosinophil ( type white blood cell ) patient hypereosinophilic syndrome ( HES ) . Patients HES elevate count eosinophils blood body tissue , cause damage tissue . Although HES involve tissue , heart , nerve , skin often affect . Several drug , include steroid , interferon , hydroxyurea low eosinophil count ; however , drug drawback work patient HES , may work temporarily , patient may develop side effect require stop drug . Imatinib mesylate new drug approve treat gastrointestinal tumor chronic myelogenous leukemia . Some data suggest imatinib mesylate may useful treat subgroup patient HES . Patients HES 18 year age old may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , echocardiogram ( ultrasound examination heart ) , pulmonary ( lung ) function test , eye exam bone marrow examination determine fall subgroup patient likely respond therapy . For bone marrow procedure , area skin bone numb sharp needle insert bone draw sample bone marrow evaluation microscope . Patients enrol study take imatinib mesylate daily . Any drug may take HES , well drug take may interact imatinib mesylate , taper stop . If possible stop take certain drug condition , dosage may adjust . Patients monitor weekly laboratory test first month treatment whenever neutrophil count drop 1500/mm3 platelet fall 100,000/mm3 . If blood count remain high enough , monitor reduce every 2 week 3 month month . Patients clinic visit NIH 1 month begin drug clinical laboratory evaluation , include repeat bone marrow examination . Patients whose eosinophil count lower 4 week treatment leave study . Those respond therapy return NIH every 3 month history physical examination , laboratory test , EKG , echocardiogram , pulmonary function test determine treatment affect disease progression . In participant stable disease optimal dose imatinib mesylate identify , visit may extend every six month . In addition , follow procedure do solely research purpose : - Blood test determine effect imatinib mesylate immune cell , include eosinophil . - Leukapheresis study effect imatinib mesylate eosinophil : For procedure , whole blood collect needle arm vein , similar donate blood . The blood circulates machine separate component , white cell remove . The rest blood return body , either needle another needle arm . - Bone marrow examination do screen test 1 month start treatment look newly develop cell bone marrow . - Genetic test determine imatinib mesylate able low eosinophil count patient HES .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All subject must meet establish diagnostic criterion hypereosinophilic syndrome : eosinophilia great 1,500/mm ( 3 ) two occasion , secondary etiology eosinophilia despite careful clinical evaluation , evidence end organ damage ( histologic evidence tissue infiltration eosinophils and/or objective evidence clinical pathology organ system temporally associate eosinophilia clearly attributable another cause ) . All subject must fit one follow three category : 1. refractory intolerant steroid 2. presence FIP1L1/PDGFRA RTPCR 3. presence great equal 4 follow laboratory criterion suggestive myeloproliferative disorder : i. dysplastic eosinophil peripheral smear ii . serum B12 level great equal 1000 pg/ml iii . serum tryptase level great equal 12 iv . anemia and/or thrombocytopenia v. bone marrow cellularity great 80 % leave shift maturation vi . dysplastic ( spindleshaped ) mast cell bone marrow biopsy vii . evidence fibrosis bone marrow biopsy viii . dysplastic megakaryocyte bone marrow biopsy 3 . All subject must least 2 year age . 4 . Negative serum betahCG within 24 hour prior drug administration woman childbearing potential exclude early pregnancy . 5 . All subject ( men woman ) must agree practice abstinence effective contraception administration imatinib mesylate ruxolitinib 6 month discontinuation drug . Of note , failure standard chemotherapeutic agent ( steroid , hydroxyurea , interferon alpha ) prerequisite participation protocol follow reason . 1 ) There approve therapy HES . 2 ) steroid therapy myeloid subset HES patient generally ineffective . 3 ) Although hydroxyurea interferon alpha initially effective case , majority patient become refractory intolerant agent within relatively short period time ( less 1 year ) . 4 ) Data myeloid neoplasm disorder , include CML , suggest interferon , imatinib mesylate , ruxolitinib , hydroxyurea , associate cytogenetic remission . 5 ) The report incidence severity side effect imatinib mesylate patient CML ruxolitinib myelofibrosis polycythemia vera appear comparable ( less ) associate interferon alpha . Subjects meet inclusion criterion , already receive imatinib , may enrol dose deescalation portion study investigator discretion . Although private physician require inclusion study , strongly recommended subject physician outside NIH routine medical care emergency . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Pregnancy nurse woman 2 . HIV positivity know immunodeficiency 3 . D816V KITpositive systemic mastocytosis 4 . Absolute neutrophil count le 1000/mm ( 3 ) platelet count le 10,000/mm ( 3 ) less 50,000/m ( 3 ) clinical evidence bleeding . 5 . Elevated transaminase ( great 5 time upper limit normal ) elevate bilirubin ( great 3 time upper limit normal ) 6 . Any condition , investigator opinion , place patient undue risk participate study</criteria>
