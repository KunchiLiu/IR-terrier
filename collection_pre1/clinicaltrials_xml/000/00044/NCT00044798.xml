	<detailed_description>Vascular depression condition typically affect elderly associate small vascular lesion . It resistant treatment poorer outcome nonvascular depression . By alter excitability cortical area brain , rTMS may effective treatment neuropsychiatric condition , particularly depression . Participants study randomly assign 15 treatment either rTMS sham rTMS 3 week . Following treatment , participant receive citalopram 9 week . Response rate treatment ; relapse rate ; size , number , location vascular lesion ; amount regional brain atrophy measure . Improvements activity daily live , quality life , cognitive function also also measure .</detailed_description>
