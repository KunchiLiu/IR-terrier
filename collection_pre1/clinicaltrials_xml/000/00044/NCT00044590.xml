	<detailed_description>While many pathophysiologic pathway may involve neurodegeneration responsible PD , genetic factor likely determine general susceptibility neurodegeneration . There number genetic polymorphism gene cod cytochrome p450 super-family gene refer 'susceptibility gene ' . However , generally sufficient cause disease unless person encounter exposure environmental toxin : disease cause gene-environment interaction . Thus , imperative ass genetic susceptibility individual expose toxin . We test gene-environment interaction hypothesis conduct epidemiologic population-based case-control study newly diagnose PD patient three rural California county : Kern , Fresno , Tulare . Over four year period , expect collect 400 case refer u local neurologist , farm worker clinic , Parkinson 's foundation . For case , one population control select random residential parcel map Medicare database , addition , one unaffected sibling control - possible - affected sibling avoid potential bias inefficiency inherent use type control . For study subject , environmental occupational pesticide exposure estimate derive use California pesticide-use reporting ( PUR ) data information pesticide application crop combination crop pattern show satellite image aerial photograph ; addition , extensive exposure interview conduct study subject . In three-tiered approach examine effect gene-environment interaction : 1 ) test association ( linkage ) PD select locus associate PD early study use multiallelic repeat marker genotyping ; 2 ) test association use intragenic single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) 50 candidate gene array create `` PD array '' ; 3 ) use future technical possibility screen genome wide association use array technology scan 5,000-10,000 SNPs throughout genome . Data analysis employ hierarchical modeling procedure take account multiple comparison issue incorporate prior knowledge increase neurotoxicity due interaction gene product chemical .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Newly diagnose patient idiopathic PD ( first PD diagnosis January 1998 currently live one three target county ( Kern , Tulare , Fresno ) live California least 5 year eligible participation . For patient , one unaffected sibling control one population control recruit . The population control select randomly Medicare record ( 95 % control ) residential parcel listing ( patient younger 65 year age ; inclusion criterion apply case . The control marginally match case accord 5year age category ( e.g . 5054 , 5559 , 6064 , etc . ) , race ( white , AfricanAmerican , Asian , Hispanic , ) , sex . All study case definition patient elicit care health care provider . We aim enroll every newly diagnose PD patient study expect patient population participate study diverse rural population .</criteria>
