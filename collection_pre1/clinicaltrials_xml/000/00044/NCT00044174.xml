	<detailed_description>Maternal depression concurrent longitudinal risk factor child development . Maternal depression exerts direct effect indirect effect proximal process mother-child dyadic interaction . Both depressed mother infant inattentive , unresponsive , affectively flat , disengage naturalistic interaction , dyadic interaction describe less synchronous . Our primary objective investigate difference depress non-depressed dyad maternal behavior , child behavior , dyadic behavior term latency , synchrony , contingency . In present study , propose examine determinant effect dyadic interaction depress nondepressed mother infant across several domain child development . We plan replicate extend previous work observe dyad naturalistic well experimental face-to-face setting 5 , 12 , 24 month . Groups depress nondepressed mother select basis self-reports depressive symptom clinical diagnostic interview . These assessment repeat 12 24 month assess course maternal depression . The study consist home visit , lab visit , administration questionnaire mother spouse partner three time point . All maternal child behavior dyadic interaction cod continuous stream data analysis reciprocal influence within dyad . By cod range behavior facial affect , vocalization , physical activity , visual attention mother infant , hope capture variation mother-child interaction , within depress nondepressed dyad . Differences style dyadic interaction show important consequence subsequent child development several domain . In addition , experimental simulation consist instruct 'depressed ' 'happy ' simulation mother infant . Specific simulation allow observation change infant behavior spontaneous episode comparison depress nondepressed dyad . Understanding context child development , normative atypical , important mean elucidate process maternal depression operate risk factor child cognitive socioemotional development . Several socio-demographic psychosocial factor assess maternal paternal self-reports examine factor exacerbate buffer effect maternal depression .
