	<brief_title>A Study Effectiness Safety Levofloxacin Treating Children With Rapid Severe Onset Infection Inflammation Middle Ear That Difficult Treat</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rapid severe onset middle ear infection common bacterial infection child . These infection , particularly occur early life recurrent , associate considerable disease lead increasingly serious infection . This multicenter study determine effectiveness levofloxacin eliminate bacteria middle ear fluid child 6 month 5 year age rapid severe onset infection inflammation middle ear ( high risk infection difficult treat ) . The study consist 1-day screening period patient test eligibility study ; 4 6-day treatment , blood collection , possible collection fluid middle ear , assessment period ; post-treatment period ass status middle ear infection . All patient receive levofloxacin 2 time daily ( maximum daily dose 500 mg ) mix liquid take mouth 10 day . Safety evaluation include laboratory test , physical examination , vital sign measurement , record adverse event , include report joint pain sign symptom joint disease . Effectiveness assess rate elimination bacteria identify start study sign symptom , well microscopic evidence patient cure middle ear infection . The study hypothesis levofloxacin effective eliminate bacteria middle ear fluid child rapid severe onset infection inflammation middle ear high risk infection difficult treat . Levofloxacin 10 milligrams/kilogram ( mg/kg ) 2 time daily ( maximum daily dose 500 mg ) mix liquid take mouth 10 day</detailed_description>
