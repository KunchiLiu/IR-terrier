Although effect HRT ARV drug level likely small , important evaluate safety administer HRT concurrently ARVs . The information obtain study help shape recommendation postmenopausal HRT HIV-infected woman . Patients enrol 1 4 study arm base current oral ARV regimen . Arm A take NFV plus nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) . Arm B take LPV/r plus NRTIs . Arm C take EFV plus NRTIs . Arm D enroll HIV-infected patient current ARVs , take NRTIs ( protease inhibitor [ PIs ] nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [ NNRTIs ] ) . All arm receive HRT oral estradiol medroxyprogesterone acetate 12 week . Arms A , B , C intensive PI NNRTI pharmacokinetic ( PK ) sample entry Week 4 . All arm estradiol PK sample Week 4 . Clinical laboratory evaluation do entry , Week 4 , Week 12 . ARVs provide study . Only HRT provide .</detailed_description>
