	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel carboplatin , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Giving one drug may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give paclitaxel together carboplatin work treat patient locally advance metastatic collect duct renal cell cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Carboplatin Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine response rate patient locally advance metastatic collect duct renal cell cancer treat paclitaxel carboplatin . Secondary - Determine tolerability regimen patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 14-22 patient accrue study within 4.5 year .</detailed_description>
