	<brief_summary>This study examine different type proteins present lung patient pneumonia explore cause different type disease . Pneumonia condition cause lung inflammation AND often cause infection . It usually diagnose lung x-rays listening chest stethoscope . This method diagnose pneumonia , provide information cause inflammation - information might helpful guide treatment . This study measure proteins lungs patient see certain protein associate specific form pneumonia , thus serve biomarkers disease . Patients undergoing diagnostic bronchoscopy NIH Clinical Center may participate study . Patients undergo bronchoscopy bronchoalveolar lavage schedule medical care . For procedure , patient 's mouth throat numbed lidocaine ; sedative may give comfort . A thin flexible tube call bronchoscope advance nose mouth lung airways examine airway carefully . Saline ( salt water ) inject bronchoscope air passage , act rinse . A sample fluid withdrawn microscopic examination . Researchers current study use fluid obtain lavage examine protein content . In addition bronchoscopy bronchoalveolar lavage , participant 2 tablespoon blood drawn compare blood test result result lung washing . Patients ' medical record review obtain information past medical history , current medical treatment , vital sign , result x-ray test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : The objective study analyze bronchoalveolar lavage fluid patient lung infiltrates order discover new biomarkers protein expression pattern associate specific type pulmonary disease . Bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) standard method obtain low airway sample evaluate pulmonary infiltrates order diagnose infection , malignancy non-infectious inflammation . After collect lavage , clinical microbiology laboratory concentrate form element ( i.e . pathogen cell ) stain culture discard BAL supernatant . The supernatant however rich source protein molecule . We hypothesize BAL fluid supernatant important source biomarkers reflect host-pathogen interaction . The analysis protein mass profile biomarker identification BAL fluid supernatant may help develop new diagnostic method extend understand mechanism lung inflammation due infectious cause . POPULATION : The study population include patient undergoing bronchoscopy clinical indication Clinical Center provide inform consent chart review proteomic analysis BAL supernatant , describe protocol . We hope acquire BAL sample reflect spectrum community-acquired opportunistic pathogen associate pulmonary disease . In addition analysis range non-infectious pulmonary process ( e.g . acute lung injury , acute respiratory distress syndrome engraftment syndrome ) important develop measure sensitivity specificity . DESIGN : This prospective observational study . OUTCOME : The expected outcome develop database protein mass profile BAL fluid link specific microbiologic diagnosis . Our expectation acquire 1,000 specimen Clinical Center range clinical diagnosis include bacterial , viral , parasitic fungal infection sterile inflammation . When sufficient number sample individual category collect ( approximately 20-30 ) , sample analyze current proteomic technique .</detailed_description>
