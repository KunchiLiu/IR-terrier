	<brief_title>Fenretinide In Treating Patients With Advanced Metastatic Hormone-Refractory Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine activity fenretinide , term prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) response rate , patient advance metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer . Secondary - Determine objective response rate patient identifiable soft tissue disease treat drug . - Determine duration PSA response patient treated drug . - Determine PSA progression-free survival patient treated drug . - Determine overall survival patient treated drug . - Determine toxicity drug patient . - Determine self-rated symptom , function , attitude oral therapy , quality life patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter , open-label study . Patients receive oral fenretinide twice daily day 1-7 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 12 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline , course , end therapy . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 21-50 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
