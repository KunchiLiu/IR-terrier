	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose erlotinib give temozolomide treat young patient recurrent refractory solid tumor . Erlotinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Giving erlotinib temozolomide may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib Temozolomide Treating Young Patients With Recurrent Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose erlotinib child recurrent refractory solid tumor . II . Determine dose-limiting toxic effect drug alone temozolomide patient . III . Determine tolerability regimen patient . IV . Determine pharmacokinetics regimen patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine , preliminarily , antitumor activity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This 2-part , multicenter , dose-escalation study erlotinib . Patients stratify accord pretreatment ( heavily pretreated [ receive 2 prior multiagent myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens OR receive prior craniospinal pelvic radiotherapy bone marrow transplantation OR bone marrow involvement ] v less heavily pretreated ) .Part 1 : Patients receive oral erlotinib daily day 1-28 . Beginning course 2 , patient also receive oral temozolomide daily day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 23 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos erlotinib course 1 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Part 2 : Patients receive erlotinib ( MTD ) temozolomide part 1 . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 9-45 patient ( 9-24 part 1 21 part 2 ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
