	<brief_title>TAC-101 Treating Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( Liver Cancer )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Phase I - Primary - Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) TAC-101 patient advance hepatocellular carcinoma . - Determine safety 2 consecutive course drug patient . - Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . - Determine toxic adverse effect profile drug patient . Phase II - Primary - Determine objective antitumor response rate patient treat drug MTD . - Secondary - Determine overall survival time patient treat drug . - Determine time disease progression patient treat drug . - Determine duration observe objective response , use WHO criteria measurement serum alpha-fetoprotein concentration , patient treat drug . - Determine time treatment failure patient treat drug . - Determine safety tolerability intermittent treatment drug patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , dose-escalation study . - Phase I : Patients receive oral TAC-101 daily day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 6 patient receive escalate dos TAC-101 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . - Phase II : Patients receive oral TAC-101 MTD ( determined phase I ) daily day 1-14 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 35-60 day . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 6-18 patient phase I portion 21-41 patient phase II portion accrue study .</detailed_description>
