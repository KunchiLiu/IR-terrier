	<brief_summary>The primary objective study ass safety tolerance transurethral photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) QLT0074 . Secondary objective : 1 . To determine transurethral PDT QLT0074 therapeutic effect benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) , evaluated American Urological Association Symptom Index ( AUA SI ) , urinary flow rate ( Qmax ) , post-void residual volume ( PVR ) . 2 . To determine extent systemic exposure QLT0074 follow transurethral intraprostatic injection . 3 . To select two transurethral PDT drug-light regimen clinical development .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Study With QLT0074 Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , uncontrolled , dose escalation , exploratory study subject symptomatic BPH . Six study center plan . Each subject receive fix dose QLT0074 ( 0.4 mg ) inject transurethrally prostate follow transurethral light application activate drug . Five light dose cohort investigate sequentially ( 25 , 50 , 80 , 120 , 150 J/cm2 ) , 3 subject first cohort 6 subject cohorts 2-5 total 27 subject . The follow-up period subject 180 day . There minimum 30-day interval treatment last subject one cohort ( Day 0 ) treatment first subject next cohort monitor predefined toxicity ensure safety tolerance subject previous cohort . A Safety Monitoring Committee evaluate toxicity relate PDT effect , approve escalation light dose cohort . The light dose escalate follow predefined toxicity criterion occur judge related PDT effect Safety Monitoring Committee : 1 . 1 subject cohort experience macroscopic urinary bleeding resolve Day 14 , 2 . 2 subject cohort experience intolerable urinary pain control over-the-counter medication Day 14 , 3 . 1 subject cohort experience clinically significant urological adverse event , judge Investigator confirm Safety Monitoring Committee . In addition event , Safety Monitoring Committee evaluate incidence , timing , severity , frequency adverse event serious adverse event assess safety transurethral PDT treatment procedure ( use cystoscope , InjectTx device , treatment balloon-catheter , etc ) . To prevent treat subject light dose great already provide substantial clinical benefit , Safety Monitoring Committee review preliminary efficacy data ( AUA SI score Qmax value ) subject cohort ( first 4 cohort ) complete Day 90 visit . Further enrollment curtail 75 % subject cohort experience follow efficacy stop criterion Day 90 : 1. great equal 75 % reduction AUA SI score , 2. great equal 100 % increase Qmax .</detailed_description>
