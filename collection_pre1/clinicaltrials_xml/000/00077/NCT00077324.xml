	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Evaluating specific protein blood may effective noninvasive procedure help doctor determine patient early non-small cell lung cancer . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study proteomic profiling see well work diagnose non-small cell lung cancer patient undergo resection suspicious ( abnormal ) stage I lung lesion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proteomic Profiling Diagnosing Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients Who Are Undergoing Lung Resection Suspicious Stage I Lung Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine , prospectively , whether serum proteomic profiling predict presence primary non-small cell lung cancer patient clinically suspicious stage I lung lesion undergo lung resection . Secondary - Correlate serum proteomic profile pathologic nodal status histopathologic feature primary lung cancer patient . - Correlate initial follow-up serum proteomic profile overall cancer-specific survival patient . - Correlate change proteomic profile ( preoperative postoperative ) overall cancer-specific survival patient . Tertiary - Determine whether novel molecular strategy predict presence lung cancer and/or biologic behavior individual cancer patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patient must â‰¥18 year age . 2 . Patient must clinically suspicious stage I ( cT12 N0 M0 ) lung lesion . 3 . Patient must preoperative imaging procedure within 60 day prior date lung resection : Helical CT scan chest CT scan upper abdomen , include liver adrenal gland ( without IV contrast ) , clinically indicate . The helical CT must rule metastatic disease liver adrenal gland . 4 . Patient , patient 's legally acceptable representative , must provide sign dated write informed consent PRIOR registration studyrelated procedure perform . 5 . Patient must provide write authorization allow use disclosure protect health information . NOTE : This may obtain either studyspecific informed consent separate authorization form must obtain patient PRIOR registration studyrelated procedure perform . 6 . If patient survivor prior cancer , follow criterion meet : 1 . Patient undergone potentially curative therapy prior malignancy , 2 . No evidence prior malignancy least 5 year evidence recurrence ( except effectively treat basal cell squamous carcinoma skin , carcinoma insitu cervix effectively treat surgery alone , lobular carcinoma insitu ipsilateral contralateral breast treat surgery alone ) , 3 . Patient deem treat physician low risk recurrence prior malignancy . 1 . Patient undergone previous lung resection within precede 30 day . 2 . Patient receive prior chemotherapy radiotherapy . 3 . Patient blood product transfusion kind within past 60 day operative procedure .</criteria>
