	<brief_title>FOLFIRI FOLFOX With Without Cetuximab Patients With Metastatic Adenocarcinoma Colon Rectum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CALGB 80203 activate December 15 , 2003 . In February 2004 , base result randomize trial IFL +/- cetuximab show significant improvement overall survival cetuximab , cetuximab approve FDA use front-line therapy patient metastatic colon cancer . In response action , Data Safety Monitoring Board recommend closure CALGB 80203 . CALGB 80203 subsequently close accrual January 2005 238 originally targeted 2200 patient enrol . A final decision `` replace '' CALGB 80203 three-treatment arm randomize trial chemotherapy ( FOLFOX FOLFIRI ) without cetuximab and/or bevacizumab . The protocol amend allow analysis data CALGB 80203 randomize phase II trial reporting result . Patients stratify accord prior adjuvant chemotherapy ( yes v ) prior pelvic radiation ( yes v ) . Patients must complete major surgery radiotherapy ( eg , chest bone palliative RT pelvic RT ) ≥ 4 week registration complete minor surgery ≥ 2 week registration . Patients must fully recover procedure and/or radiotherapy . Patients must initiate treatment within 7 day registration . Patients randomize 1 4 treatment arm , please see description treatment regimens `` Arms '' section . In addition , patient receive concomitant supportive therapy appropriate per protocol . OBJECTIVES : Primary 1 . To determine addition C225 FOLFIRI FOLFOX chemotherapy prolongs survival patient untreated , advanced metastatic colorectal cancer . Secondary 1 . To determine FOLFIRI FOLFOX regimens equivalent term survival front-line therapy advance colorectal patient . 2 . To determine level EGFR expression patient metastatic colorectal cancer . Patients follow 3 year post-treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Locally Advanced Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Eligible patient must histologically cytologically document locally advanced metastatic colorectal cancer . The site primary lesion must confirm endoscopically , surgically radiologically large bowel . Patients history colorectal cancer treatment surgical resection develop radiological clinical evidence metastatic cancer require separate histological cytological confirmation metastatic disease unless : Either interval great five year elapse primary surgery development metastatic disease OR The primary cancer stage I. Clinicians consider biopsy lesion establish diagnosis metastatic colorectal cancer case substantial clinical ambiguity regard nature source apparent metastasis . 2 . No prior treatment advance metastatic colorectal cancer Patients may receive prior adjuvant chemotherapy ( 6 month 4 cycle ) radiation radiosensitizing chemotherapy . The last course chemotherapy must conclude &gt; 12 month prior registration . Patients may previously receive irinotecan ≤ oxaliplatin therapy either adjuvant metastatic setting . No concurrent use additional investigational agent allow participate study . 3 . Patients may prior radiotherapy great 25 % bone marrow . Standard adjuvant rectal cancer chemoradiation exclude patient protocol entry . Radiation must conclude ≥ 4 week registration . 4 . Patients complete major surgery ≥ 4 week registration . Patients must complete minor surgery ≥ 2 week registration . Patients must fully recovered procedure . Insertion vascular access device consider major minor surgery . 5 . No previous concurrent malignancy allow except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , cancer patient diseasefree five year . 6 . Age ≥ 18 year 7 . CTC ( ECOG ) performance status 01 . 8 . No evidence Gilbert 's syndrome Patients Gilbert 's Syndrome may great risk irinotecan toxicity due abnormal glucuronidation SN38 . Evidence Gilbert 's Syndrome would include prior find isolated elevation indirect bilirubin . 9 . Patients must least one paraffin block available appropriate number unstained slide analysis EGFR status . 10 . No symptomatic sensory peripheral neuropathy ≥ grade II baseline . 11 . Nonpregnant nonlactating Women child bear potential ( WOCBP ) must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG within 72 hour prior initiation treatment . This DNA alkylating agent know teratogenic , effect irinotecan , OXAL , 5FU C225 develop fetus recommend therapeutic dos unknown . Women child bear potential include : female experience menarche undergone surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal [ define amenorrhea ≥ 12 consecutive month ] woman hormone replacement therapy [ HRT ] document serum follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) level &gt; 35 mIU/mL woman use oral , implanted injectable contraceptive hormone mechanical product intrauterine device barrier method ( diaphragm , condom , spermicide ) prevent pregnancy practice abstinence partner sterile ( eg , vasectomy ) , consider child bear potential . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform physician immediately . Because risk toxicity agent nurse infant also unknown , breastfeed discontinue . 12 . No known central nervous system metastases carcinomatous meningitis . 13 . No interstitial pneumonia extensive symptomatic interstitial fibrosis lung . 14 . No pleural effusion ascites cause ≥ grade 2 dyspnea . 15 . No predispose colonic small bowel disorder symptom uncontrolled indicated baseline pattern &gt; 3 watery soft stool daily patient without colostomy ileostomy . Patients colostomy ileostomy may enter investigator discretion . 16 . No prior exposure know sensitivity chimerized murine antibody , C225 ( EGFR inhibitor ) tyrosine kinase inhibitor 17 . No significant history cardiac disease , unstable angina , CHF , MI , stroke LVEF institutional range normal baseline multiple gated acquisition ( MUGA ) echocardiogram . 18 . Patients must uncontrolled seizure disorder , active neurological disease . 19 . Patients may receive itraconazole ketoconazole le 4 week prior registration . 20 . Required Initial Laboratory Values : Granulocytes ≥ 1500/ µl Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 gram/dL ( patient may transfuse meet criterion ) Platelet count ≥ 100,000/ µl Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x Upper limit normal ( ULN ) Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL AST ≤ 5.0 x ULN Albumin ≥ 2.5 gram/dL</criteria>
