	<brief_summary>Drugs use chemotherapy , 3-AP gemcitabine , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Giving 3-AP together gemcitabine may kill tumor cell . This phase II trial study well give 3-AP together gemcitabine work second-line therapy treat patient progressive recurrent non-small cell lung cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial Triapine ( NSC # 663249 ) Combination With Gemcitabine Second Line Treatment Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate antitumor response rate ( tumor measurement per RECIST criterion ) patient take combination set second line treatment NSCLC . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate rate stable disease , time treatment progression , duration response , survival patient take combination treatment . II . To estimate safety tolerability combination phase II trial patient relapse NSCLC . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate potential effect MDR polymorphism patient take Triapine® combination . II . To evaluate effect Triapine® gemcitabine RRM1 , RRM2 , p53R2 protein expression per IHC gene expression per RT-PCR baseline diagnostic paraffin embed block . III . To evaluate germline ( peripheral blood ) tumor DNA presence p53 mutation . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive 3-AP ( Triapine^® ) IV 2 hour gemcitabine IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 1.5 year .</detailed_description>
