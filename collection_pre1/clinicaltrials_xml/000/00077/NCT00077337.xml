	<brief_title>FR901228 Treating Patients With Previously Treated Unresectable Locally Advanced Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine confirm response ( complete partial ) patient previously treat unresectable locally advanced metastatic colorectal cancer treat FR901228 ( depsipeptide ) . - Determine time treatment failure overall survival patient treated drug . - Determine qualitative quantitative toxic effect drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive FR901228 ( depsipeptide ) IV 4 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 8 week disease progression every 3 month 1 year study entry every 6 month 3 year study entry . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-40 patient accrue study within 4-10 month .</detailed_description>
