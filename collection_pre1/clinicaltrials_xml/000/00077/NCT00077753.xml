	<brief_summary>Primary objective : - To demonstrate superiority extend VTE prophylaxis enoxaparin 40mg sc qd 28 ± 4 day , compare placebo , follow 10 ± 4 day initial treatment enoxaparin 40mg sc qd Secondary objective : - To assess reduction mortality rate end double-blind treatment period , 3 ( 90 ± 10 day ) 6 ( 180 ± 10 day ) month time entry study , patient extend prophylaxis - To assess incidence VTE 3 month ( 90 ± 10 day ) time randomization study - To evaluate safety extend enoxaparin VTE prophylaxis acutely ill medical patient prolonged immobilization . Safety evaluation include : - Major minor hemorrhage - Heparin induce thrombocytopenia - Serious adverse event - To assess difference level health-care utilization cost patient receive extended VTE prophylaxis versus receive placebo .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Recent immobilization ≤ 3 day Level 1 mobility patient ≥ 40 year age acute medical illness acute exacerbation chronic medical illness Level 2 mobility patient &gt; 75 yrs age ≥ 40 year age history VTE ( deep venous thrombosis pulmonary embolism ) ≥ 40 year age baseline diagnosis cancer ( active cancer history cancer ) Anticipated decreased level mobility 5 ± 2 day level activity 1 2 time study entry likely continue low premorbid activity level initial 5 ± 2 day period . PATIENTS DO NOT HAVE TO BE HOSPITALIZED IN ORDER TO BE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY . ( Definition decrease level mobility : _Level 1 : bed rest sedentary patient _Level 2 : level 1 bathroom privilege ) Presence least one follow medical condition : Heart Failure , NYHA class III IV Class III : Patients cardiac disease result marked limitation physical activity . They comfortable rest . Less ordinary physical activity cause fatigue , palpitationdyspnea , anginal pain . Class IV : Patients cardiac disease result inability carry physical activity without discomfort . Symptoms cardiac insufficiency anginal syndrome may present even rest . If physical activity undertaken , discomfort increase . Acute respiratory insufficiency Other acute medical condition : Acute ischemic stroke , territory , appropriate neuroradiologic ( head CT scan brain MRI scan ) provide result consistent non hemorrhagic stroke acute infection without septic shock acute rheumatic disorder active episode inflammatory bowel disease active cancer define history histologically cytologically confirmed cancer patient candidate debulking curative intent surgery study entry Any acute medical illness exacerbation chronic medical illness result clinically significant reduction mobility compare premorbid level . Exclusion criterion : Women breastfeed , pregnant childbearing age use medically acceptable effective contraception Patients evidence active bleeding disorder Contraindication anticoagulation Major surgery within previous 3 month Patients spinal epidural analgesia lumbar puncture within precede 24 hour Known hypersensitivity heparin , LMWH , pork derive product A document previous episode heparininduced LMWH induce thrombocytopenia and/or thrombosis ( HIT , HAT , HITTS ) Patients take part another clinical trial within previous thirty day Patients persistent renal failure . The patient 's creatinine level must less creatinine level per gender/age/weight . This replace calculated creatinine clearance Known suspect severe anemia unexplained cause consider clinically relevant investigator Patients prosthetic heart valves Patients know cerebral metastasis</criteria>
