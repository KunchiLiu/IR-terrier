	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study give bevacizumab cetuximab together irinotecan see well work compare give bevacizumab cetuximab alone treat patient irinotecan-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer . Monoclonal antibody cetuximab bevacizumab block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill deliver tumor -killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , irinotecan , also work different way kill tumor cell stop grow . Giving cetuximab bevacizumab together irinotecan may improve ability block tumor growth .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Cetuximab With Without Irinotecan Treating Patients With Irinotecan-Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate time tumor progression patient irinotecan-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer treat bevacizumab cetuximab without irinotecan . II . Evaluate objective response rate patient treat regimen . III . Evaluate overall survival patient treat regimen . IV . Evaluate safety , tolerability , adverse event profile regimens patient . V. Correlate panel molecular marker ( e.g. , involve epidermal growth factor receptor signal pathway , angiogenic pathway , irinotecan metabolism ) clinical outcome patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord participate center , ECOG performance status ( 0 vs 1 ) , albumin ( &gt; 3.0 g/dL v ≤ 3.0 g/dL ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive cetuximab IV 1-2 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 ; bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1* , 15 , 29 OR day 1 22 ; irinotecan IV 30-90 minute ( dose schedule patient previously receive ) begin day 1 . ARM B : Patients receive cetuximab Arm A bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1* , 15 , 29 . NOTE : *Bevacizumab give day 2 ( instead day 1 ) course 1 , give day 1 subsequent course . In arm , course repeat every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 3 year .</detailed_description>
