	<brief_summary>Pompe disease ( also know glycogen storage disease type II , `` GSD-II '' ) cause deficiency critical enzyme body call acid alpha-glucosidase ( GAA ) . Normally , GAA use body 's cell break glycogen ( stored form sugar ) within specialized structure call lysosome . In patient Pompe disease , excessive amount glycogen accumulates store various tissue , especially heart skeletal muscle , prevents normal function . This study conduct collect prospective , observational data patient late-onset Pompe disease . Approximately 60 subject late-onset Pompe disease enrol .</brief_summary>
