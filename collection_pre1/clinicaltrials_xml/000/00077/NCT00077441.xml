	<brief_title>Bortezomib Treating Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( Liver Cancer )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Proportion confirm tumor response . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate confirmed objective response rate . II . To assess patient outcome estimate duration response , time disease progression , survival . III . To evaluate adverse event rate associate PS-341 population . IV . To explore relationship laboratory correlate ( eg . IHC ) patient outcome ( eg p53 disease progression ) . V. To evaluate alteration laboratory correlate pre-treatment measurement ( ie , pre post treatment ) . The following immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) assay perform : IHC p53 , IHC p21 , IHC p27 , IHC NFkB , IHC Ki67 . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive bortezomib IV 3-5 second day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month disease progression every 6 month 3 year study entry .</detailed_description>
