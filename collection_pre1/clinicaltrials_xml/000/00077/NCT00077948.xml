	<brief_summary>Beta-blocker medication show improve heart function prolong live patient chronic heart failure ( CHF ) . Some people advance CHF difficulty take beta-blocker medication due troublesome side effect , low blood pressure and/or low heart rate , severe tiredness , dizziness , shortness breath . In word , difficulty tolerate beta-blocker medication . The purpose study determine enoximone improve patient 's ability tolerate beta-blocker medication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enoximone Plus Extended-Release Metoprolol Succinate Subjects With Advanced Chronic Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over last decade , become evident certain beta-blocking agent ( beta-blockers ) exert favorable effect natural history mild moderate chronic heart failure ( CHF ) , include reduce mortality hospitalization rate . However , heart failure become severe , beta-blockers become difficult administer myocardial depression lead hemodynamic intolerance . A recent clinical study demonstrate subject could tolerate beta-blocker metoprolol experience improved tolerability low-dose , oral enoximone administer prior introduction metoprolol ongoing treatment . This study investigate hypothesis stabilize subject enoximone first , advance CHF subject intolerant beta-blockade able 1 ) tolerate effect beta-blocker therapy , 2 ) clinical benefit due combination enoximone extended-release metoprolol succinate ( ER metoprolol ) . Support hypotheses seek demonstrating , compare placebo , low-dose , oral enoximone plus ER metoprolol increase leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) , improve symptom heart failure , improve submaximal exercise tolerance subject CHF .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion In order consider eligible subject , follow entry criterion must meet : Subjects must competent provide inform write consent . Subjects must sign IRB/IEC approve informed consent form prior initiation study procedure . Subjects must 18 year age old . Subjects must ischemic nonischemic cardiomyopathy symptom NYHA Class III IV chronic heart failure . Subjects must LVEF less equal 35 % , measure within 60 day Screening Visit . LVEF must assess radionuclide ventriculography ( MUGA ) . If subject experience cardiovascular event , undergone intervention , receive change treatment may affect LV function since recent EF measurement , LVEF measurement must complete prior subject randomize . Subjects must leave ventricular end diastolic dimension ( LVEDD ) &gt; 2.7 cm/m2 measure 2D ECHO within 12 month Screening Visit . Subjects must optimal conventional heart failure therapy ( exception betablocker ) , include ACEI least 30 day prior Screening Visit , subject must trial ACEI proven intolerant , subject must take ARB least 30 day prior Screening Visit prove intolerant . Optimal conventional therapy may also include spironolactone , digitalis glycoside , diuretic , vasodilator . Subjects must fail initiation , uptitration , betablocker drug due hemodynamic intolerance within 12 month prior Screening Visit . Failure tolerate betablockade hemodynamic reason define worsen sign symptom chronic heart failure , hypotension accompany symptom , evidence organ hypoperfusion , judgment treat physician preclude treatment betablocker . This betablocker intolerance must document prior Screening , narrative description intolerance must approve Myogen prior Randomization . Exclusion criterion Subjects meet one follow criterion deem ineligible participation study : Subjects CHF due associate uncorrected primary valvular disease , uncorrected thyroid disease , obstructive/hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , pericardial disease , amyloidosis , active myocarditis , malfunction artificial heart valve , uncorrected congenital heart disease , isolate rightsided heart failure , primary pulmonary hypertension . Subjects undergone cardiac revascularization , valvular surgery , biventricular resynchronization procedure within 60 day prior Screening Visit . Subjects list heart transplantation expect transplant within 6 month randomization . Subjects myocardial infarction within 90 day prior Screening Visit . Subjects ECG record Screening Visit show follow : 1 ) evidence transmural ischemia ( dynamic ST elevation ST elevation associate ischemic symptom ) , 2 ) ventricular tachycardia ( VT ) premature ventricular complex ( PVCs ) associate symptom , 3 ) VT great equal 6 beat Subjects sustain ( &gt; 15 second ) VT , unless precipitate event acute myocardial infarction , induction catheter placement , electrophysiology procedure , address AICD placement . Subjects AICD fire ventricular arrhythmia within 90 day Randomization Visit . Subjects document diagnosis angina meet either follow criterion : 1 ) angina diagnose unstable time within 60 day prior Screening Visit 2 ) angina primary symptom limit daily physical activity Subjects ventricular reduction surgery cardiac myoplasty . Subjects mechanical assist device . Subjects evidence concomitant disease may interfere natural course subject 's underlying heart failure duration trial . Subjects concomitant lifethreatening disease life expectancy estimate less one year . Subjects uncontrolled insulindependent diabetes mellitus history frequent hypoglycemic episode frequent hospitalization hyperglycemia . Subjects follow concomitant medication time Screening exclude participate study : 1 ) Calcium antagonists amlodipine felodipine ; 2 ) Flecainide , encainide , propafenone , sotalol , dofetilide disopyramide ; 3 ) Subjects receive i.v . positive inotropic agent within seven day Screening Visit Randomization Visit ; 4 ) Subjects receive human BNP , include nesiritide , within seven day Screening Visit Randomization Visit ; 5 ) Subjects receive oral i.v . typeIII PDE inhibitor within seven day Screening Visit Randomization Visit . Subjects contraindication treatment positive inotropic agent ( define serious adverse event attribute previous treatment positive inotrope ) . Subjects know contraindication betablocker therapy . This may include betaagonistdependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease asthma , heart rate &lt; 55 BPM , presence second thirddegree heart block without implant pacemaker , firstdegree heart block PR interval &gt; 220 millisecond . Subjects active hepatic ( screen serum total bilirubin great equal 3.0 mg/dL ) , renal ( screen serum creatinine great equal 2.0 mg/dL ) , hematologic , gastrointestinal , immunologic , endocrine , metabolic , central nervous system disease , opinion Investigator , may adversely affect safety efficacy study drug life span subject . Subjects know abuse actively abuse alcohol illicit drug . Abuse alcohol define usual daily intake 100 gram ethanol per day , approximately 6 twelveounce bottle beer , one 750 mL bottle wine 250 mL 80 proof spirit . Subjects serum potassium &lt; 4.0 mEq/L &gt; 5.5 mEq/L Screening . Subjects serum digoxin &gt; 1.2 ng/mL Screening exclude . Pregnant woman woman risk become pregnant ( i.e. , use effective method birth control ) . Subjects participate clinical trial involve another investigational drug device within 30 day Screening Visit time study . Subjects demonstrate noncompliance previous medical regimen . Subjects hospitalize time Randomization Visit hemodynamically stable , acute cardiac noncardiac illness require hospitalization .</criteria>
