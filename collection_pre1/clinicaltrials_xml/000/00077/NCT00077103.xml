	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , doxorubicin cisplatin , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Combretastatin A4 phosphate may stop growth cancer stop blood flow tumor . Combining doxorubicin cisplatin radiation therapy combretastatin A4 phosphate may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give induction chemotherapy use doxorubicin cisplatin together radiation therapy combretastatin A4 phosphate work treat patient newly diagnose regionally advanced anaplastic thyroid cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Induction Chemotherapy Using Doxorubicin Cisplatin Followed Combretastatin A4 Phosphate Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Regionally Advanced Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine objective response rate patient newly diagnose regionally advanced anaplastic thyroid cancer treat induction chemotherapy comprise doxorubicin cisplatin follow combretastatin A4 phosphate ( CA4P ) radiotherapy . - Determine whether regimen alters natural history anaplastic thyroid cancer virtue double median survival patient 10 20 month . Secondary - Determine tolerable dose CA4P administer radiotherapy patient . ( Phase I portion study close 5/6/04 ; patient receive fix dose CA4P ) - Determine safety profile regimen patient . - Determine clinical predictor response ( e.g. , pretreatment tumor microvessel density immature vessel staining , change sICAM-1 level tumor blood flow , pharmacokinetic parameter ) patient treat regimen . - Correlate diminution blood flow tumor pain response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study combretastatin A4 phosphate ( CA4P ) . ( Phase I portion study close 5/6/04 ; patient receive fix dose CA4P ) - Induction phase : Patients receive doxorubicin IV 5-10 minute cisplatin IV 30-60 minute day 1 . Patients also receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously ( SC ) day 3-21 pegfilgrastim SC day 2 . - Combined modality phase : Beginning day 22 , patient undergo radiotherapy twice daily , 5 day week , 3-4 week . Patients also receive CA4P IV 10 minute weekly fifth day radiotherapy . Cohorts 6 patient receive 1 2 escalating dos CA4P determine tolerable dose . The tolerable dose define dose less 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . ( Phase I portion study close 5/6/04 ; patient receive fix dose CA4P ) - Consolidation phase : Beginning 4-6 week completion combine modality phase , patient receive CA4P IV 10 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 2 course . Treatment phase continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 2 month 1 year every 3 month 2 year study entry . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 33 patient accrue study within 18 month .</detailed_description>
