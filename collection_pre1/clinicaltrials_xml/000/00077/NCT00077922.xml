	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effectiveness experimental drug call LMB-2 treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) patient protein call cluster differentiation 25 ( CD25 ) cancer cell . LMB-2 recombinant immunotoxin . It make two part : genetically engineer monoclonal antibody bind cancer cell CD25 surface , toxin produce bacteria kill cancer cell bind . LMB-2 kill CD 25-containing cell laboratory experiment cause tumor mice shrink . Preliminary study human show effectiveness shrink tumor patient various type lymph blood cancer . Patients 18 year age old CLL CD25 receptor proteins cancer cell whose disease progress within 2 year treatment fludarabine may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood urine test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , echocardiogram , chest x-ray , compute tomography ( CT ) scan chest , abdomen pelvis , bone marrow biopsy . Participants receive six cycle LMB-2 therapy . Each 28-day cycle consist 30-minute infusion LMB-2 cycle day 1 , 3 , 5 . The drug infuse intravenous ( IV ) catheter ( plastic tube place vein ) central venous line-an IV tube place large vein neck chest lead heart . Patients admit National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Clinical Center first treatment cycle . If infusion well tolerate , subsequent cycle may give outpatient basis . In addition drug therapy , patient undergo follow procedure : - Blood draw : Blood drawn , , LMB-2 infusion measure blood level drug , evaluate effect cancer cell , monitor side effect . Blood test also do cycle determine immune system interact drug . - Disease evaluation : Patients undergo physical examination , blood test , chest x-ray , EKG treatment cycle follow-up visit . With patient 's permission , CT scan , echocardiogram , bone marrow biopsy may repeat treatment cycle test prove useful evaluate disease response LMB-2 . Patients may receive six cycle LMB-2 long cancer worsen develop serious side effect . At end treatment cycle , patient blood test do weekly local physician , result send NCI study investigator .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anti-Tac ( Fv ) -PE38 ( LMB-2 ) Treat Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : It estimate 30-50 % patient CLL tumor express cluster differentiation 25 ( CD25 ) ( Tac IL2R ) . Normal rest T-cells sensitive LMB-2 due insufficient CD25 expression . LMB-2 anti-CD25 recombinant immunotoxin contain variable domain MAb anti-Tac truncate Pseudomonas exotoxin . A phase I trial National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) find maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) LMB-2 40 microg/Kg IV give every day 3 dos ( every day ( QOD ) x3 ) prophylactic IV fluid . The common adverse event transient fever , hypoalbuminemia transaminase elevation . In trial , one eight patient chronic lymphocytic leukemia partial remission . The seven CLL patient stable disease . In addition , four four patient hairy cell leukemia response ( 1 complete response ( CR ) , 3 partial response ( PRs ) ) 3 patient PRs ( 1 cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) , 1 healthy donor ( HD ) , 1 acute T-cell leukemia/lymphoma ( ATL ) ) . Because LMB-2 cytotoxic cell express CD25 , CD25+ CLL patient good candidate test LMB-2 . Objectives : The purpose study determine activity anti-Tac ( Fv ) -PE38 ( LMB- 2 ) patient Tac-expressing Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) . The primary endpoint trial response rate . We also evaluate response duration , LMB-2 immunogenicity , pharmacokinetics , toxicity , monitor soluble Tac level serum . Eligibility : CD25 positive CLL prolymphocytic leukemia ( PLL ) confirm flow cytometry blood , either lymphadenopathy , splenomegaly , hepatomegaly , hemoglobin le 11 g/dl , platelets less 100,000/ul . Patients must progression follow purine analog alkylating agent . Labs require : alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) less equal 2.5- time upper limit , albumin great equal 3 , bilirubin le equal 2.2 ( unless unconjugated great equal 80 % ) creatinine less equal 1.4 ( unless creatinine clearance great equal 50 ml/min ) . Design : Patients receive LMB-2 40 ug/Kg QOD x3 every 4 week absence neutralize antibody progressive disease . 1st stage 16 patient , expand 25 great 1 16 patient respond .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must histopathological evidence CD25+ CLL prolymphocytic leukemia ( PLL ) confirm NIH pathology department . This require least 50 % peripheral malignant lymphocyte CD25 positive fluorescence activate cell sorting ( FACS ) antiCD25 antibody . Positive expression FACS assay define 2 time mean fluorescence intensity ( MFI ) control antibody FACS , great 400 CD25 sites/cell FACS radiolabeled bind assay . In three stage modify Rai system , patient must intermediate high risk . This mean must circulate CLL cell least one following : lymphadenopathy , splenomegaly , hepatomegaly , anemia ( Hgb less 11g/dL ) , thrombocytopenia ( Plt less 100,000/ul ) . Patients must progressive disease prior standard therapy contain either purine analog alkylating agent . Patients must receive systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy within 4 week enrollment systemic steroid ( except stable dos Prednisone less equal 20 mg/day ) within 4 week enrollment . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 2 . At least 18 year old . Patients must able understand give informed consent . Female patient childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test patient must use effective contraception ( barrier form contraception ) . The transaminase alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) must less equal 2.5times upper limit normal . Albumin must great equal 3.0 gm/dL . Total bilirubin must less equal 2.2 mg/dL except patient Gilbert 's syndrome ( define great 80 % unconjugated bilirubin ) must less 5 mg/dl . The creatinine must less equal 1.4 mg/dL creatinine clearance must great equal 50 ml/min measure 24hour urine collection . Patients uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients whose serum neutralizes LMB2 tissue culture , due either antitoxin antimouselgG antibody . No patient whose serum neutralize great 75 % activity 1 micro g/mL LMB2 treat . Patients receive LMB2 another trial . Monoclonal antibody therapy within 12 week enrollment . Patients pregnant breastfeeding . Patients human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive . Patients hepatitis C chronic liver disease . Patients would exclude hepatitis B surface antigen positivity Lamivudine . Patients receive warfarin anticoagulation . Patients leave ventricular ejection fraction less institutional low limit normal . Patients carbon monoxide diffuse capacity ( DLCO ) less 55 % normal forced expiratory volume 1 ( FEV1 ) less 60 % normal . Patients active cancer require treatment .</criteria>
