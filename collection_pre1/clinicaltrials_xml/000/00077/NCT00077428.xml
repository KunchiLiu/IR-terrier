	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well bortezomib follow doxorubicin time disease progression work treat patient locally advance , recurrent , metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma ( cancer ) head neck . Bortezomib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , doxorubicin , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining bortezomib doxorubicin may kill tumor cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib Followed Addition Doxorubicin Disease Progression Treating Patients With Locally Advanced , Recurrent , Metastatic Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma ( Cancer ) Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary I . Determine objective tumor response patient locally advance , recurrent , metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma head neck treat bortezomib . Secondary I . Determine time progression patient treat drug . II . Determine overall survival patient treated drug . III . Determine toxic effect drug patient . IV . Determine objective tumor response , time progression , overall survival patient progress single-agent bortezomib treat doxorubicin bortezomib . V. Determine toxic effect regimen patient . VI . Determine profile concentration inflammatory angiogenic cytokine serum patient response regimen . VII . Correlate expression biomarkers may affect ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway ( NF-kB , p53 , p27 , cyclin D1 , cyclin E , vascular endothelial growth factor [ VEGF ] , MVD , V-CAM , N-CAM ) tumor tissue clinical activity bortezomib patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive bortezomib IV 3-5 second day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients disease progression continue receive bortezomib doxorubicin IV 2-5 minute day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 14 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 8 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 23-37 patient accrue study within 2.3 year .</detailed_description>
