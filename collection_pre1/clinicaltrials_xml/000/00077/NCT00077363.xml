	<brief_title>Capecitabine Tipifarnib Treating Women With Taxane-Resistant Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . The primary objective study determine response rate patient taxane-resistant metastatic breast cancer treat capecitabine plus tipifarnib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate toxicity patient taxane-resistant metastatic breast cancer treat capecitabine plus tipifarnib . II . To evaluate progression free survival , time treatment failure , overall survival patient taxane-resistant metastatic breast cancer treat capecitabine plus tipifarnib . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-14 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 4 additional course beyond documentation CR . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
