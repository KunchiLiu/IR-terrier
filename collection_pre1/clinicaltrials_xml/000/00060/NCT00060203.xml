	<brief_title>Brostallicin Treating Patients With Recurrent Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine objective tumor response rate ( confirm complete response confirm partial response ) brostallicin patient recurrent refractory multiple myeloma . - Determine maximum tolerate dose drug patient . - Determine time duration response , time treatment failure , time tumor progression , survival patient treat drug . - Determine safety tolerability drug patient . - Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . - Correlate baseline whole blood level activity glutathione clinical outcome patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter , dose-escalation study . - Phase I : Patients receive brostallicin IV 10-30 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos brostallicin maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede least 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . - Phase II : Additional patient accrue treated MTD brostallicin phase I . Patients follow every 2 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 23-52 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
