	<brief_title>Oblimersen Gemcitabine Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose dose-limiting toxicity oblimersen gemcitabine patient advanced solid tumor lymphoma . II . Determine effect oblimersen pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics gemcitabine patient . III . Determine toxic effect regimen patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously day 1-5 gemcitabine IV 2-3 hour day 5 . Courses repeat every 2 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos oblimersen gemcitabine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Up 10 additional patient receive treatment MTD . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 15 patient accrue study within 6-8 month .</detailed_description>
