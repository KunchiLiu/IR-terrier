	<brief_summary>This study use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) examine loss balance elderly . Falls due balance problem major health issue old people , often result bone fracture bodily injury , functional decline . Risk factor fall elderly include stand position old people usually experience balance problem , lean forward backwards . Functional MRI record brain function subject performs task , move limb speaking , detects change brain region involve task . This study look different brain area see area might control people see around stand . Healthy normal volunteer 20 90 year age may eligible study . Candidates must good health , difficulty perform activity daily live , able walk least 400 meter ( 1/4 mile ) . They screen medical history physical examination . Participants undergo functional MRI perform visual recognition task two experiment , describe . For MRI procedure , subject lie MRI scanner , narrow metal cylinder contain strong magnet , 20 minute 3 hour , scan last 45 90 minute . The experiment follow : Experiment 1 During MRI scanning , subject watch computer-generated movie person lean forward backwards . When subject recognize unstable body position movement , press computer mouse . Experiment 2 During MRI scanning , subject watch still picture people lean stable unstable posture press button soon recognize posture unstable .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI Study Self-Perception Postural Stability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A number study explore role visual , vestibular somatosensory system control upright posture . However , cortical control postural stability , general , role higher cognitive function assessment postural stability , specific , studied extensively . It well establish certain feature postural control change advance year life stability posture problem elderly . However , neural mechanism postural stability decline age make old adult prone fall identify specifically . To characterize specific cause fall elderly problematic , human posture product extremely complex dynamical system like physical activity undergo dramatic change organization throughout life-span . In previous research show neural activation pattern embody electroencephalogram ( EEG ) associate recognition unstable posture young healthy subject . In another protocol , propose pattern systematically change age , result difficulty discriminate relevant irrelevant information control upright posture . The present study focus evaluation neural activation pattern underlie recognition unstable posture 15 young control 15 elderly subject use block event-related functional MRI ( fMRI ) design . We first analyze frontal-parieto-occipital circuit play role perception postural stability young subject perform similar study use elderly subject . After fMRI measurement detail evaluation haemodynamic response ( BOLD ) signal perform . Further analysis look functional connectivity motion-selective cortical area ( V5 ) , posterior parietal cortex ( PP ) frontal cortex ( FC ) , use correlation method . It expect study uncover important insight neural mechanism relate self-perception postural stability deterioration result age .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : There 20 subject aforementioned age group . Subjects enrolled study within range 2050 ( young group ) 7090 ( old group ) year old , good health , report difficulty need help perform selfcare instrumental activity daily live , able walk least 400 meter . All subject patient participate study valid Clinical Center Medical Record Number . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : We unable study people substantial cognitive impairment base mental status screening test , history cardiovascular disease ( include angina , myocardial infarction , congestive heart failure , cerebrovascular disease ) , cancer , neurological disease , birth defect , kidney liver disease , gastrointestinal ( G.I . ) disease , musculoskeletal disorder ( cause pathological weakness and/or chronic pain ) , important sensory deficit condition precludes test standard neuropsychological test . MRI experiment perform subject patient pacemaker , brain stimulators , dental implant metallic brace , aneurysm clip ( metal clip wall large artery ) , metallic prosthesis ( include metal pin rod , heart valve , cochlear implant ) , permanent eyeliner , insulin pump , shrapnel fragment . We scan pregnant woman safety high magnetic field fetus establish .</criteria>
