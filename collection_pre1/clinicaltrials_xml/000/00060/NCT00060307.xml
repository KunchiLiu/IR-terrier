	<brief_title>Erlotinib Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Papillary Renal Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess response ( confirmed complete partial response ) patient locally advance metastatic papillary histology renal cell cancer treat OSI-774 . II . To assess overall survival 6-month probability treatment failure group patient . III . To evaluate qualitative quantitative toxicity regimen . IV . To investigate preliminary manner association tumor response tumor expression epidermal growth factor receptor status von Hippel Lindau gene mutation . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral erlotinib daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-40 patient accrue study within 5-20 month .</detailed_description>
