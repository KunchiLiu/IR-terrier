	<brief_title>Perifosine Treating Patients With Metastatic , Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine 4-month progression-free survival rate , measure prostate-specific antigen clinical criterion , patient metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer treat perifosine . - Determine side-effect profile drug patient . - Determine pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics drug patient . OUTLINE : - Course 1 : Patients receive oral perifosine twice day 1 daily day 2-21 . - All subsequent course : Patients receive oral perifosine daily day 1-21 . In course , treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 22-46 patient accrue study within approximately 1.5 year .</detailed_description>
