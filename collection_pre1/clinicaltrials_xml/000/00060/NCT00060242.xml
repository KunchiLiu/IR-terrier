	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Combretastatin A4 phosphate may stop growth anaplastic thyroid cancer stop blood flow tumor . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well combretastatin A4 phosphate work treat patient advanced recurrent metastatic anaplastic thyroid cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combretastatin A4 Phosphate Treating Patients With Advanced Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine objective response rate patient advance anaplastic thyroid cancer treat combretastatin A4 phosphate . - Determine whether drug alters natural history anaplastic thyroid cancer , term double median survival 4-6 month 12 month , patient . - Determine safety profile drug patient . - Correlate clinical response pretreatment tumor microvessel density immature vessel staining , change sICAM-1 level course treatment , pharmacokinetic parameter patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive combretastatin A4 phosphate IV 10 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 2 course beyond documentation CR . Patients follow monthly . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 32 patient accrue study within 18-24 month .</detailed_description>
