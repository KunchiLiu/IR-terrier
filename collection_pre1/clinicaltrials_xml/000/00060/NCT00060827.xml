	<detailed_description>Each year , 50 70 million people United States participate helmeted unhelmeted sport potential head impact . Such sport include football , soccer , hockey , basketball , box . Participating sport carry risk mild traumatic brain injury ( MTBI ) . The biomechanics head impact result concussion MTBIs well understood ; however , think impact correlate head acceleration . Currently , system allow researcher measure head acceleration large number individual actual play . This major obstacle understand mechanism MTBI prevention . This study evaluate newly design miniature device use Head Impact Recording Technology ( HIRT ) quantify head acceleration impact actual sport play . One hundred college football player enrol study . Data HIRT-instrumented helmet collect normal team practice game throughout 5-month football season . Data collect assessed determine incidence , magnitude , duration head acceleration impact sport field .</detailed_description>
