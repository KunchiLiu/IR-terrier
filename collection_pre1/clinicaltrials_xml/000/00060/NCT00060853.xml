	<brief_summary>This study use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) identify brain region involve social emotional reasoning . It identify difference brain activity task performance people nervous system illness . MRI diagnostic tool use strong magnetic field radio wave produce image structural chemical change brain . Healthy normal volunteer 21 55 year age right-handed native English speaker may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , include psychiatric neurological information . Participants ask perform social emotional reasoning task , sort judging rule rule violation , undergo MRI scanning . Some task may simply involve view item screen . Others may involve solve complex problem respond press button . During scan , subject lie table narrow cylinder ( scanner ) contain magnetic field . The scan last 2 hour , subject ask lie still 10 minute time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol localize neural region system mediate form knowledge representation hypothesize principal investigator store human prefrontal cortex . Utilizing variety experimental neuropsychological task functional MRI , investigate hypothesis regard role dorsolateral prefrontal cortex planning , problem solving , economic exchange reasoning ; role ventromedial prefrontal cortex social cognition emotional processing . We ascertain relationship so-called [ cold ] cognitive process plan [ hot ] social process mate choice specific brain region within prefrontal cortex . We also attempt determine relationship non-frontal neural structure involve emotional expression , amygdala , frontal neural structure involve executive function may modulate emotion . In addition , attempt determine requirement frontal-parietal versus frontal-temporal network involvement spatial landmark task . The data collect protocol value identify set neural region distribute network mediate form knowledge representation store prefrontal cortex . These question address seven separate study healthy , normal adult volunteer . The study employ within- between-subject , event-related fMRI design . The data collect consist behavioral measure cognitive emotional performance/judgment correspond fMRI image .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : In study , subject consist healthy , native Englishspeaking , righthanded volunteer , measure Edinburgh Handedness Inventory . Subjects range age 21 55 year old include regardless race . In study 4 5 , equal number male female recruit owe previous finding significant sex difference test . In study subject recruit indiscriminately basis sex . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Nonnative English speaker nonright handers exclude mention , nonneurologically normal volunteer . Subjects young 21 old 55 exclude . A pregnancy test employ woman childbearing age . The result must negative order proceed MRI . Subjects follow : aneurysm clip ; implant neural stimulator ; implant cardiac pacemaker autodefibrillator ; cochlear implant ; ocular foreign body , e.g . metal shaving ; insulin pump ; irremovable body pierce exclude study due possible dangerous effect magnet upon metal object body .</criteria>
