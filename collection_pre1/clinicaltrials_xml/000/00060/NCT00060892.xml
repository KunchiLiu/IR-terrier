	<detailed_description>The primary goal study assess safety AMG0001 , detect potential angiogenesis response AMG0001 treatment correlate change clinical endpoint dependent upon improvement tissue perfusion relief CLI complication . The objective study : - Assess overall safety different exposure regimens AMG0001 CLI subject population . - Evaluate potential effect angiogenesis associate different dos dose regimen AMG0001 measure improvement tissue perfusion . - Evaluate activity different exposure regimens AMG0001 benefit clinical outcome reduction amputation mortality , wound healing , rest-pain reduction improvement subject 's ability function without adverse consequence quality life .</detailed_description>
