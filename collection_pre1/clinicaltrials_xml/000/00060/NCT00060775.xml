	<brief_summary>The purpose study use brain image technology examine brain change occur child expose various kind emotional task determine change relate child 's temperament . Studies suggest risk develop mood anxiety disorder preschool child may link difference temperament . The relationship temperament risk resilience may reflect influence brain activity behavior different stage childhood development . Behavioral inhibition mood anxiety disorder link disturbance circuitry several area brain . However , involvement circuitry temperament remain unclear . This study use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) examine function different part brain child previously undergone temperament study temperament classify . Two set study perform current protocol . A small set pilot study perform infant , staff University Maryland . In term study among infant , subject initially contact staff Maryland see NIH three visit last 4- 5- hour first year life . These subject also undergo visit University Maryland throughout first year life . This study comprise four clinic visit . At Visit 1 , child parent meet study staff individually together psychiatric interview . Children undergo physical examination , medical history , urine drug test , practice fMRI simulator . Saliva sample collect child test give assess stage puberty , temperament , intelligence , feeling , experience , behavior . Other visit include fMRI scan brain task .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : The goal proposal study temperament risk-taking vulnerability factor anxiety . Studies document behaviorally inhibit ( BI ) child risk anxiety disorder . This vulnerability may associate neural circuit underlie behavioral tendency , component prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) , striatum , amygdala . Regarding risk-taking behavior , certain high risk-taking adolescent also carry enhanced vulnerability anxiety . We use fMRI examine local activity PFC , cingulate , amygdala , striatum , functional connectivity rest state methodology two cohort , one probe temperament one risk-taking . Study Population : A total 1010 individuals/ infant ( 0-25 yo ) study . This sample comprise 2 set study group . First , BI group include individual ( 1 ) high motor arousal/high negative affect early infancy novelty sustain BI ( BI ) , ( 2 ) high motor arousal/high positive affect novelty sustain temperamental exuberance ( exuberant ) , ( 3 ) average level reactivity/affect infancy childhood ( control ) . Second , risk-taking group include 4 subgroup represent interaction two level anxiety ( low , high ) two level risk-taking ( low , high ) . Finally , group healthy individual recruit control . Design : Assessments include psychiatric , behavioral , neuropsychological battery . The protocol use fMRI paradigm target different emotional , social , cognitive , motivational , learning process activation study , well intrinsic function brain measure rest state . Outcome Measures Predictions : The main outcome measure fMRI BOLD signal change , physiological , neuropsychological behavioral variable . The propose fMRI study test 2 set hypothesis . The first refers BI cohort . BI subject exhibit ( 1 ) enhance amygdala activation mild threat ( e.g. , angry facial ) , ( 2 ) PFC perturbation associative learning , ( 3 ) abnormal fronto-amygdala connectivity , ( 4 ) heighten striatal inferior PFC activation reward stimulus , ( 5 ) unique neural pattern attention bias social challenge , ( 6 ) differential change age function BI status ( 7 ) infant differ temperament exhibit structural functional difference brain region associate salience ventral attention network . The second set hypothesis pertain risk-taking cohort . ( 1 ) anxious adolescent activate striatal region response reward strongly non-anxious adolescent ; ( 2 ) risk-takers also activate striatal region response reward strongly non-risk taker ; ( 3 ) expect interaction risk-taking anxiety-related factor , potentiation striatal activation anxious risk-takers , blunt striatal activation non-anxious risk-takers . These effect uniquely alter social stress . Finally , repeat study conduct BI cohort examine stability/developmental change time .</detailed_description>
