	<brief_title>Tipifarnib Treating Patients With Metastatic Malignant Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate clinical response rate patient metastatic malignant melanoma treat R115777 ( tipifarnib ) . II . To evaluate safety R115777 patient metastatic melanoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess RhoC expression tumor sample pre- post- therapy R115777 . II . To evaluate Ftase level peripheral blood tumor sample pre- post-therapy R115777 . III . To assess effect R115777 treatment T lymphocyte cytokine production , pre- post- therapy R115777 . IV . Estimate time treatment failure ( TTF ) . Time treatment failure define time withdrawal unacceptable toxicity progressive disease . OUTLINE Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day least 2 course maximum 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 2 additional course beyond CR . Patients discontinue therapy due toxicity complete response follow every 3 month 2 year study entry . Patients discontinue therapy due disease progression follow every 6 month 2 year study entry . Patients stable partially respond disease complete treatment follow 2 year study entry .</detailed_description>
