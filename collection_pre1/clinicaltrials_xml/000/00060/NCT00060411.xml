	<brief_summary>Erlotinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary growth . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth colorectal cancer block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining erlotinib bevacizumab combination chemotherapy may kill tumor cell . This phase I trial study side effect best dose erlotinib give together bevacizumab , fluorouracil , leucovorin , oxaliplatin treat patient metastatic locally advanced colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I , Pharmacological , Biological Study OSI-774 Combination With FOLFOX 4 ( 5-FU , Leucovorin , Oxaliplatin ) Bevacizumab ( Avastin ) Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) OSI-774 give combination FOLFOX 4 Bevacizumab , patient advance colorectal cancer . II . To characterize toxicity profile regimen . III . To explore antitumor activity combination . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize pharmacokinetics OSI-774 give FOLFOX 4 , Bevacizumab . II . To determine relationship CYP3A4 activity OSI-774 clearance . III . To correlate Cytochrome P450 activity OSI-774 PK use midazolam clearance . IV . To determine relationship expression activation EGFR relate signal pathway outcome patient colorectal cancer patient treat OSI-774 combination FOLFOX 4 Bevacizumab . V. To explore biological effect OSI-774 patient advanced colorectal cancer relationship dose plasma concentration . VI . To explore use fluorodeoxy-glucose ( FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan predict biological effect outcome patient colorectal cancer treat OSI-774 FOLFOX 4 Bevacizumab . VII . To assess 5FU PK give manner , correlate several previously characterize genetic polymorphism drug response VIII . To evaluate association allelic variant AAG OSI-774 disposition . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study erlotinib . Patients receive oral elotinib alone daily 1 week begin course 1 . Patients receive oral erlotinib daily day 1-28 ; oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 ; leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour fluorouracil IV 22 hour day 1 2 . Patients also receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 15 course 1 day 1 15 subsequent course . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos erlotinib maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 38 patient accrue study within 19-38 month .</detailed_description>
