	<brief_summary>Patients force rest reduce activity result illness , injury , surgery often experience result muscle weakness . This study evaluate muscle feature muscle strength patient recover surgery broken ankle . The goal study improve recovery muscle function overall ability prolong period ankle inactivity due surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Muscle Function After Ankle Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many physiological condition associate muscle weakness affect movement . This study investigate metabolic morphological feature skeletal muscle uniquely alter course rehabilitation affect muscle function performance daily ambulatory activity . This study also examine well commonly use assessment measure reflect actual muscle capacity . Finally , evidence activity affect fiber type uniformly , fiber-type specific metabolic morphological measure perform . Participants study ankle injury treat surgically ( Open Reduction Internal Fixation , ORIF ) follow 5 10 week cast immobilization . Following initial baseline measurement make 1 week re-ambulation , participant enrol 10-week rehabilitation program focus restoration muscle strength endurance . Assessments make Weeks 5 10 include 31P-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( MRS ) , Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) , muscle biopsy , muscle function functional performance test . 31P-measurements monitor change vivo metabolic characteristic skeletal muscle . 3D-MRI procedure use quantify maximal muscle cross-sectional area total muscle volume . Muscle endurance strength measure use isokinetic dynamometer . Functional performance test consist self-selected walking pace , power ascend descend stair , toe raise stand one foot . Nine participant ( six patient three control volunteer ) study year . Control volunteer submit measurement similar time interval order ass variability time .</detailed_description>
