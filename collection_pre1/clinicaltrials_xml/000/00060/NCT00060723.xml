	<detailed_description>While adenotonsillectomy ( AT ) remain one common surgical procedure perform child , indication AT change recent year . Surgeons perform AT suspect obstructive SDB daytime behavior may consequence SDB , inattention hyperactivity . However , whether SDB cause disruptive behavior well know . Further , precise nature behavior type level SDB may concern poorly understood . Consequently , pediatrician otolaryngologist able use objective preoperative test assess SDB abnormal behavior . This research project seek good define relationship childhood SDB daytime behavioral problem determine whether SDB actually cause behavior . The study well define whether inattention hyperactivity frequent among child undergo AT , identify measure level SDB indicative behavior , test whether improvement SDB AT associate improvement behavior . Five- twelve-year-old child schedule AT control group procedure ( minimally invasive , non-airway-related surgery herniorraphies ) undergo behavioral assessment , cognitive test , structure psychiatric interview . A secondary control group include healthy child schedule type surgery . Preoperative assessment use define behavior prominent child schedule AT child schedule hernia repair . All child undergo preoperative polysomnography detect subtle form SDB may particularly prevalent child . Children also undergo assessment surgery . Children schedule two three study visit , depend whether participant agree optional 3-month interim assessment . Children follow approximately 1 year date surgery .</detailed_description>
