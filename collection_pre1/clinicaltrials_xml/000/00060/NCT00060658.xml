	<brief_summary>This study use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) identify brain region involve solve algebraic math problem . It examine brain activation accord level difficulty number step require solve problem . This information help identify possible correlation problem-solving strategy pattern brain activation . Undergraduate graduate student 19 36 year age complete least 2 year college , least one college course integral calculus , history neurological disease may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , include psychiatric neurological information . Participants ask mentally solve variety integral calculus problem undergo MRI scanning , procedure use strong magnetic field radio wave produce image structural chemical change brain . During scan , subject lie table narrow cylinder ( scanner ) contain magnetic field . A problem possible solution present subject , press button verify answer correct . At end test , participant complete follow-up questionnaire determine problem-solving strategy use .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol localize neural region system mediate form knowledge representation hypothesize principal investigator store human prefontal cortex . Utilizing experimental neuropsychological task functional MRI healthy , adult volunteer , investigate hypothesis regard role dorsolateral prefrontal cortex mathematical cognition population normal control recruit among college graduate student . We also attempt determine relationship mathematical cognition non-frontal neural structure , leave parietal lobe , frontal neural structure involve mechanistic plan , action mental set . The data collect consist behavioral measure cognitive performance correspond fMRI image . The data collect protocol value identify set neural region distribute network mediate form knowledge representation store prefrontal cortex . We also use data obtain study constrain theory frontal lobe function provide evidence role specific frontal cortex sector specific cognitive function .</detailed_description>
