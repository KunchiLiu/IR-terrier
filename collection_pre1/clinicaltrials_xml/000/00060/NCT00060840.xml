	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess utility nitric oxide inhalation leave ventricular assist device ( LVAD ) implantation follow cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) . This assessed number patient treatment group meeting failure criterion within 24 hour study drug , define two following : - Left ventricular flow rate index ( LVFRI ) ≤ 2.0 L/min/m^2 - Administration ≥ 20 inotropic equivalent ( IE ) - 10 µg/kg/min dopamine , dobutamine , enoximone amrinone equivalent 10 IE - 0.1 µg/kg/min epinephrine norepinephrine equivalent 10 IE - 1 µg/kg/min milrinone equivalent 15 IE - 0.1 U/min vasopressin equivalent 10 IE - Mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) ≤ 55 mmHg - Central venous pressure ( CVP ) ≥ 16 mmHg - Percent mixed venous oxygen saturation ( SvO2 ) ≤ 55 % Or least one follow criterion : - Failure wean cardiopulmonary bypass least due hemodynamic failure . Re-initiation cardiopulmonary bypass correct bleed technical issue considere 'failure wean ' - Death</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>40 ppm either nitric oxide inhalation N2 ( placebo ) continuously administer patient start least 5 minute prior initiate first wean attempt CPB continue patient either extubated , reach failure criterion , treat study drug 48 hour follow discontinuation CPB , whichever come first . All patient monitor peri-operatively pulmonary arterial line , central venous line , systemic arterial line . Baseline data collection designate clinical staff member begin follow induction anesthesia prior skin incision . Following successful wean cardiopulmonary bypass , post-op data collect within 1 hour follow end time surgery . Data collect 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 48 hour post-op extubation , case wean study drug begin . Open label investigational nitric oxide inhalation may administer patient meet minimum two failure criterion fail wean least due hemodynamic failure cardiopulmonary bypass .</detailed_description>

Exclusion criterion : Patients congestive heart failure due giant cell myocarditis restrictive cardiomyopathy . Elective Biventricular Assist Device ( BiVAD ) surgery , current support temporary BiVad . LVAD procedure expect do without cardiopulmonary bypass . Pregnancy ( negative pregnancy test must document prior enrollment ) . Received nitric oxide inhalation therapy within past 24 hour . Investigational drug expect change systemic pulmonary vascular resistance allow .</criteria>
