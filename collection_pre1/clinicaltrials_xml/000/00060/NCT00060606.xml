	<brief_summary>Spina bifida ( myelomeningocele ) complex birth defect portion spinal cord fully develop . The overlie bone skin incompletely form underdeveloped area spinal cord expose surface back . Spina bifida defect close soon birth prevent damage spinal cord nerve . The Management Myelomeningocele Study ( MOMS ) research study compare two approach treatment baby spina bifida : surgery birth ( prenatal surgery ) standard closure , surgery birth ( postnatal surgery ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Management Myelomeningocele Study ( MOMS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since 1997 , 200 fetus utero closure myelomeningocele open maternal-fetal surgery . Preliminary clinical evidence suggest procedure reduces incidence shunt-dependent hydrocephalus restores cerebellum brainstem normal configuration . However , clinical result prenatal surgery myelomeningocele base comparison historical control examine efficacy , safety . MOMS determine intrauterine repair fetal myelomeningocele 19 25 week gestation improve outcomes compare standard postnatal repair . Outcomes assessed include death , need ventricular decompressive shunt one year life neurologic function 30 month age . Two hundred woman , whose fetus spina bifida , enrol study randomize either prenatal surgery postnatal surgery . After central screen process include medical record review , woman extensive baseline evaluation include ultrasound , MRI , physical exam , social work evaluation , psychological screening , education spina bifida prenatal surgery . For woman eligible following central screen process , screening , surgery follow-up visit perform one three MOMS Centers . The mother , eligible , support person travel ( expense study ) MOMS Center screen randomization . Women assign prenatal surgery schedule surgery within 1 3 day randomize . They stay near MOMS Center deliver . Women postnatal group travel back assign MOMS Center deliver . Both group deliver baby C-section around 37th week pregnancy . Babies bear woman postnatal surgery group spina bifida defect close medically stable , usually within 48 hour birth . Children parent return assign MOMS Center 1 year 2 Â½ year age follow-up evaluation . Motor function , developmental progress , bladder , kidney , brain development assess . The child ask return additional follow-up visit ( MOMS2 ) age 5 8 . This follow-up determine whether child receive surgery birth well health mental outcomes live independently function safely appropriately daily life receive surgery birth .</detailed_description>
