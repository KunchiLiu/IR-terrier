	<brief_title>GW786034 Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety tolerability GW786034 patient advance solid tumor . - Determine maximum tolerate dose drug patient . - Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . - Determine clinical response patient treated drug . - Evaluate effect drug biomarkers angiogenesis activity order estimate activity determine minimum biologically active dose patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , nonrandomized , dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients receive oral GW786034 twice daily . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 2-6 patient receive escalate dos GW786034 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Patients follow 21 day . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 30-50 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
