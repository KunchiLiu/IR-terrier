	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Chemoprevention therapy use certain drug try prevent development treat early cancer . SGN-00101 may effective preventing development cervical cancer patient cervical intraepithelial neoplasia . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study well SGN-00101 work prevent cervical cancer patient cervical intraepithelial neoplasia human papillomavirus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SGN-00101 Treating Patients With Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare efficacy SGN-00101 v placebo patient grade II III cervical intraepithelial neoplasia . - Correlate clinical response , define histologic demonstration lesion regression , potential surrogate marker vaccine efficacy ( e.g. , spectroscopic change epithelium , development human papilloma virus ( HPV ) -specific mucosal systemic T-cell response , level HPV-specific antibody cervical secretion ) , patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive SGN-00101 subcutaneously ( SC ) month 3 consecutive month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive placebo SC arm I . Patients follow monthly 3 month last injection undergo large loop excision transformation zone colposcopy fourth month . Patients disease progression undergo immediate large loop excision . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A maximum 80 patient ( 40 per treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
