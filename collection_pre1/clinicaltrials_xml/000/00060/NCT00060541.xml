	<brief_summary>This study offer evaluation treatment patient variety neurological disorder may require surgery . The protocol design test new treatment ; rather , patient receive standard care . The study design : 1 ) allow NINDS Surgical Neurology Branch staff learn change cause nervous system disorder , 2 ) train physician evaluation treatment disorder ; 3 ) establish pool patient may eligible NINDS protocol . ( Participants protocol require join another study ; decision voluntary . ) Patients age disorder central nervous system ( brain spinal cord ) pituitary gland may require surgery diagnosis treatment may eligible study . In case surgery need . Candidates screen medical history physical examination . Participants may undergo test , medial treatment , surgical treatment help diagnose treat condition . In case , care provide NIH limited evaluation surgery . Procedures may include laboratory test , image test , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , compute tomography ( CT ) scan , angiogram , procedure confirm patient diagnosis help guide treatment . Patients require surgery offer standard surgical care NIH . Those whose procedure include removal tissue fluid diagnostic study ask allow portion tissue use research purpose , include analysis gene protein abnormality may involve cause disorder influence patient response treatment . Blood sample also draw research .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : This protocol design allow evaluation patient variety neurosurgical disorder purpose provide standard expert care physician training . Study Population : Patients 4 year age old neurosurgical-related condition eligible protocol . The investigator select patient base appropriate need purpose SNB NINDS training . Study Design : This observational study training . Patients receive standard evaluation treatment condition . A physician , physician assistant , nurse practitioner obtain medical history perform physical neurological examination . Clinical evaluation may include laboratory radiological study design aid diagnosis differential diagnosis patient condition facilitate treatment . The evaluation may take place outpatient clinic area inpatient unit . Some patient receive standard-of-care medical surgical treatment disorder . Tissue blood sample remove standard treatment , need care patient , may use research . Genetic testing may perform subject blood relatives genetic mechanism underlie neurological disorder suspect . Outcome Measures : No additional research outcome measure track study . All outcomes standard clinical evaluation treatment .</detailed_description>
