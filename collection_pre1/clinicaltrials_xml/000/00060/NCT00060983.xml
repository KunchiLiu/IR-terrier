	<brief_summary>This study part large clinical trial examines potential 12-week treadmill-training program improve walk patient spinal cord injury ( SCIs ) . Patients trial least 1 year past injury . This substudy test combination two strategy enhance treadmill train program : electrically stimulate muscle withdrawal reflex provide body weight support partially suspend patient walk treadmill .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients spastic paresis due incomplete SCI inadequate motor control low extremity result number abnormality movement . Among unregulated spinal reflex , inadequate delay motor recruitment , balance deficit . If patient walk , abnormalities manifest gait pattern poorly coordinate time different muscle group , decrease weight bearing capacity , inappropriate muscle activity , scissor . Research patient SCIs demonstrate , despite damage spinal cord , many nervous system pathway control walk remain intact activate proper sensory stimulation . Two technology may enhance benefit treadmill walk body weight support ( BWS ) functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) . Preliminary study indicate combine two intervention , gait performance improve efficient functional movement emerge . This study evaluate benefit add BWS FES treadmill-training program patient SCIs . During treadmill training , patient suspend apparatus provide partial body weight support ( BWS ) . The training effect BWS locomotion FES course multi-session training program examine . Study visit schedule 3 day week 12 week . Participants follow-up visit Months 3 12 . Gait parameter modify train identified nature change characterize . Specifically , walk speed , kinematics , electromyography ( EMG ) , muscle strength assess .</detailed_description>
