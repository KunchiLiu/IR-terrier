	<brief_title>Study Safety Efficacy NC-503 Secondary ( AA ) Amyloidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AA amyloidosis associate chronic inflammatory condition ( rheumatoid arthritis , ankylose spondylitis , inflammatory bowel disease ) , chronic infection ( tuberculosis , osteomyelitis ) , Familial Mediterranean Fever . Rheumatoid arthritis major cause AA amyloidosis Western Europe North America . The common clinical feature AA amyloidosis renal dysfunction manifest nephrotic-range proteinuria renal insufficiency time diagnosis . End-stage renal failure cause death 40-60 % case . Gastrointestinal involvement also frequent usually manifest chronic diarrhea , body weight loss malabsorption . Enlargement liver spleen may also occur patient . The median survival time diagnosis vary 2 8 year depend stage disease time diagnosis . The goal current therapy AA amyloidosis control associate disease . However , current approach treatment AA amyloidosis unspecific , toxic , invasive , sufficiently effective many case . NC-503 specifically design compete naturally occur sulfate GAGs bind amyloidogenic precursor protein , inhibit amyloid deposition tissue . The proposed therapy NC-503 base prevention amyloid fibril formation . The objective clinical phase II/III study determine efficacy safety NC-503 compare placebo patient suffer secondary ( AA ) amyloidosis assessment clinical improvement/ worsen renal gastrointestinal function .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>PROTOCOL INCLUSION CRITERIA Patients must 18 year age old . Males female . If woman childbearing potential ( i.e. , surgically sterilize postmenopausal great one year ) patient must use effective birth control . Diagnosis AA amyloidosis demonstrate positive biopsy ( Congo red stain ) immunohistochemistry immunoelectron microscopy screen visit . Tissue previous biopsy use confirmation diagnosis , available . Persistent proteinuria define urinary protein excretion ? 1g/24h two distinct 24h urine collection least 1 week apart within 3 month prior study entry ( baseline , Month 0 visit ) without evidence urinary tract infection overt heart failure ( NYHA class III ) ; OR creatinine clearance ? 60 mL/min two distinct measure least 1 week apart within 3 month prior study entry ( baseline , Month 0 visit ) . Creatinine clearance ? 20 mL/min AND serum creatinine ? 3 mg/dl within 3 month prior study entry ( baseline , Month 0 visit ) . Written informed consent . PROTOCOL EXCLUSION CRITERIA Evidence suspicion renal renovascular disease renal AA amyloidosis . Presence diabetes mellitus ( Type I II ) . Evidence cause potentially reversible reduced renal function , accelerated hypertension drug nephrotoxicity . AST , ALT , ALP &gt; 5 time upper limit normal , total bilirubin 50 % upper limit normal . Presence clinically significant disease could interfere interpretation study result compromise patient safety condition could reduce life expectancy less two year . Use investigational drug within thirty day prior screen visit . Active alcohol and/or drug abuse . Initiation change ACE inhibitor therapy within 3 month prior screen visit . Initiation change cytotoxic agents/colchicine therapy within 3 month prior screen visit . Inability provide legal consent .</criteria>
