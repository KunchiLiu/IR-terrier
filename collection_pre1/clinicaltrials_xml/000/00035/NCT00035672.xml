	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : During 1980s 1990s , genetic research cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , well common chronic disease , dominate single gene linkage association study focus understand genetics prevalent disease . Rarely study longitudinal predictive value genetic variation . Furthermore , study attempt address complex high-dimensional genetic reality underlies individual 's risk disease . A crucial next step CVD genetic research evaluation contribution variation many gene simultaneously , interaction traditional risk factor , longitudinal prediction CVD individual family . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study use participant Rochester Family Heart Study ( RFHS ) provide one richest genetic epidemiological resource type study . The RFHS represent 3941 individual distribute among 552 three- generation pedigree ascertain without regard health status two phase collection . Phase I 1984 - 1988 Phase II 1988 - 1991 . These participant extensive demographic , physiological , genetic , clinical information measure baseline . This study build upon already establish resource conduct longitudinal follow-up RFHS participant address two central question : 1 ) Do measure genetic variation know susceptibility gene provide additional predictive information risk future CVD outcomes beyond information provide traditional risk factor ? 2 ) Do measure genetic variation explain pattern disease aggregation family pattern use predict disease future generation ?</detailed_description>
