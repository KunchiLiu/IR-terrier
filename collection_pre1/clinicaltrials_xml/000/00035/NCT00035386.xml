	<brief_summary>This study test feasibility modify procedure treat obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( OHC ) . Patients OHC thicken heart muscle obstructs blood flow heart , cause breathlessness , chest pain , palpitation , tiredness , lightheadedness , fainting . The current treatment OHC procedure call alcohol septal ablation ( also percutaneous transluminal septal ablation , PTSA ) , involve inject small amount alcohol tiny artery supply part muscle cause blood flow obstruction . The success PTSA limit , however , problem heart anatomy ability find appropriate artery inject . Modifying procedure inject alcohol wall low right chamber heart may improve safety effectiveness . The new technique require position catheter ( flexible tube ) appropriate area heart . This study test ability accurately guide catheter area . Patients OHC 18 year age old schedule cardiac catheterization may eligible study . At end catheterization procedure , participant undergo intra-cardiac echocardiographic imaging . For test , one catheter place femoral artery ( top leg ) cardiac catheterization substitute large one . Through catheter , special catheter introduce advanced heart provide image . This pilot feasibility study involve injection alcohol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alcohol Septal Ablation Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) drug-refractory symptom traditionally refer cardiac surgery widen leave ventricular ( LV ) outflow tract . More recently , percutaneous transluminal septal ablation ( PTSA ) also show thin subvalvular septum thereby reduce LV outflow pressure gradient improve symptom obstructive HCM . However , procedure infrequently limit septal coronary artery anatomy inability identify cannulate appropriate artery supply septal region interest . Some attempt also associate coronary artery dissection , particularly , associate coronary artery disease . A trans-right ventricular ( RV ) alcohol septal ablation ( TRVASA ) would significantly simplify procedure , increase safety . The purpose study initially test ability visualize guide delivery catheter target part anterior interventricular septum involve generation LV outflow obstruction use intracardiac echocardiography ( ICE ) . No therapy intend : alcohol inject septum initial study .</detailed_description>
