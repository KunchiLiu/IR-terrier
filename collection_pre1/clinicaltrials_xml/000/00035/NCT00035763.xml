	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Pain sickle cell disease poorly recognize , measure , treat . Although painful episode common reason sickle cell patient seek care , study seldom directly measure pain detail . In study date , biological demographic variable alone partly explain observed variance painful episode frequency . Further , little known difference pain response include home management versus health care utilization . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This cohort study measure variability pain response pain sickle cell disease , build multivariate model explain patient ' pain response pain , especially , utilization health care . The model ' outcome variable include mean pain , painful episode , various type utilization episode , include non-narcotic analgesic use , narcotic use , office visit , emergency department ( ED visit , hospitalization . An additional outcome percentage patient 's painful episode result various type utilization . Outcomes operationalized use daily pain diary collect six month . Reflecting prior 24 hour , patient recall ordinal ( 0-9 ) scale maximum pain , distress , disability , judge whether `` crisis , '' note pain location various type utilization . Daily pain intensity rating transform pain episode count use formulaic threshold painful episode . The formula calculate patient 's threshold individually , base his/her pain rating . The model measure effect several class explanatory variable ( demographic , disease-related , psycho social , readiness utilize care ) , operationalized use primary data validate instrument . Patients recruited central Tidewater region Virginia , undergo initial survey battery , chart review , brief final survey , venipuncture urine sampling , complete pain diary daily six month . This study advance knowledge etiology influence pain pain response sickle cell disease . By reveal potentially mutable explanatory variable , study 's result suggest target biobehavioral treatment intervention .</detailed_description>
