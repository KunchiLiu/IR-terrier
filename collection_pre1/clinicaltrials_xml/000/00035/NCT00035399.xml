	<brief_title>Efficacy Acupuncture With Physical Therapy Knee Osteo-Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acupuncture ancient Chinese technique use fine needle stimulate point along theoretical meridian energy correct imbalance think responsible specific disease state . In United States , acupuncture often use treatment painful condition . The 1997 NIH Consensus Conference conclude adequate evidence efficacy acute dental pain model nausea . In chronic pain , study small , poorly design , poorly execute , improperly control adequately demonstrate needle acupuncture work well sham acupuncture , placebo , standard medical therapy , even treatment . Osteoarthritis ( OA ) knee propose good model test efficacy acupuncture chronic pain condition extremely common , well define , disable condition well establish outcome measure symptoms functional status . There clinical trial evidence efficacy standard treatment acetaminophen NSAIDs , exercise physical therapy ( EPT ) , usually add patient develops functional limitation . One high quality study acupuncture knee OA , demonstrate moderate benefit unblinded comparison usual care control group . As , major question remain whether acupuncture , use addition exercise therapy , provide clinically meaningful improvement pain function . Since pain primary limiting factor improve exercise capacity , acupuncture efficacy reduce pain knee OA , combination EPT program substantially effective EPT alone . Another major concern effect acupuncture may predominantly mediate non- specific placebo effect rather specific effect placement needle . Another important component proposal use validate blinded placebo needle instead sham acupuncture point . Therefore , primary goal proposal use properly design randomize blind clinical trial , use American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) criteria Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) recommend outcome measure , determine whether addition acupuncture standard EPT provide overall clinically important benefit patient symptomatic knee OA compare placebo acupuncture . As secondary goal , use clinical trial data develop prognostic etiologic model patient likely respond acupuncture . If clinically important benefit acupuncture find , broad application technique would justify . However , result negative , addition acupuncture EPT generally curtail .</detailed_description>
