	<brief_summary>The objective study evaluate patient tumor central nervous system ( CNS ) eligibility National Cancer Institute research study . These patient undergo series procedure , usually include complete medical history physical examination ; laboratory test blood , CSF , urine , bone marrow , sample ; evaluation tumor location size x-ray , CT ( compute tomography ) MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) scan , nuclear medicine scan ; lumbar puncture ; electrocardiogram echocardiogram ; procedure evaluate function specific organ . A bone marrow biopsy occasionally perform . Research sample may also collect store avoid painful test . Tissue specimen collect process may store use future study . Patients gender , age , racial ethnic group tumor CNS history CNS tumor eligible . Up 100 people expect participate . The physician discus result procedures patient family . On basis eligibility screen patient wish , patient may enrol primary research protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : -Adult patient ( great equal 18 yrs age ) tumor central nervous system evaluate Neuro-Oncology Branch ( NOB ) National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) primary research protocol enter onto screen protocol eligibility screening . OBJECTIVE : - Evaluate patient tumor Central Nervous System ( CNS ) eligibility National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) research protocol . ELIGIBILITY : - Patients tumor CNS history CNS tumor evaluate protocol within National Cancer Institute . DESIGN : - The screening test procedure require primary research protocol conduct order establish eligibility protocol . - These procedure may include , limited , laboratory test blood , CSF , urine , specimen , radiographic nuclear medicine study , may require administration contrast radioisotopic tracer . - This protocol also allow evaluation exist tumor specimen determine target present , applicable . - In case , specific research sample require primary research protocol may collect screen process order prevent u subject patient painful procedure multiple occasion ( e.g. , bone marrow aspiration ) . - Research specimens discard , patient eligible elect enroll primary research protocol . A total 3000 patient enrol .</detailed_description>
