	<brief_title>A Study Effects Sleep , Attention , Gastrointestinal Tolerance Galantamine Donepezil Patients With Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This design pilot ( preliminary ) study evaluate difference effect attention , sleep problem gastrointestinal tolerance associate Alzheimer 's Disease two different drug two different dos . Patients must mild moderate Alzheimer 's Disease base National Institute Neurological Communicative Disorders Stroke-Alzheimer 's Disease Related Disorders Association ( NINCDS-ADRDA ) criteria Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) score 10 24 . The trial consist 2-week run-in phase , 8-week assessment phase , extension phase variable length ( 6 week 54 week ) . During study , patient randomize ( assigned chance ) receive either galantamine donepezil . Galantamine give mouth 4mg twice daily Weeks 1-4 8mg twice daily Weeks 5-8 beyond ( participant extension ) . The patient donezepil receive 5mg mouth bedtime Weeks 1-4 10mg bedtime Weeks 5-8 beyond . Placebo tablet give patient take two capsule per dose order conceal identity drug . Neither patient physician know drug patient receiving . Drug effectiveness measure change overall functioning patient show Clinician 's Interview-Based Impression Change Plus Family Input ( CIBIC-Plus ) . Other test evaluate whether drug effective include change result attention test ( Simple Reaction Time [ SRT ] , Choice Reaction Time [ CRT ] , Verbal Series Attention Test [ VSAT ] , Stroop Test ) , sleep pattern test ( test measure movement sleep [ Actiwatch ] pattern sleep caregiver-completed Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [ PSQI ] Circadian Sleep Inventory Normal Pathological States [ CSINAPS ] ) . Measures quality life include Alzheimer 's Disease Related Quality Life Scale ( ADRQL ) caregiver-completed Allocation Caregiver Time Survey ( ACTS ) SF-12 Quality Life Survey . Safety assessment gastrointestinal tolerability base record number severity unexpected undesirable event well physical examination vital sign . The exploratory study hypotheses galantamine superior donezepil improve attention , sleep pattern , quality life patient mild-to-moderate Alzheimer 's disease well tolerated patient . Patients receive either galantamine 4mg twice daily mouth donepezil 5mg bedtime . Then , either galantamine 8mg twice daily mouth donezepil 10 mg bedtime mouth ( placebo dose ) ; dose continue double-blind extension phase ( 6 54 week ) .</detailed_description>
