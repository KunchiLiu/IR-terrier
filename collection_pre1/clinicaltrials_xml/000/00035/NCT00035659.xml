	<brief_title>Longitudinal Study Menopause Fat Patterning</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Menopause alters risk variety chronic disease , include cardiovascular disease , number one cause mortality old woman . While association menopause , increase total intra-abdominal fat ( IAF ) , risk coronary disease well establish , prospective study describe accumulation IAF , association risk factor , potential mechanistic aspect , still lack . This study potential provide important information trajectory IAF accumulation across menopausal transition minority non-minority woman . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The prospective study conduct intact biracial cohort 868 woman ( 419 African Americans ; 449 Caucasians ) participate large study ( Women Southside Health [ WISH ] Project ) woman undergo menopausal transition . This population-based cohort randomly select exist census 72 percent participation rate , approximately equal distribution socioeconomic status within African American Caucasian subgroup , dropout rate 1 percent/year . As part large study , cohort undergoes annual exam variety cardiovascular , hormonal , lifestyle factor track . These annual measurement consist large number relevant covariates , include demographic , anthropometrics , serum lipid , blood pressure , insulin , glucose , hormone , lifestyle , health psychosocial status available parent study . For study , two additional clinical test add battery fourth fifth annual exam 536 woman expect eligible virtue hysterectomy begin take hormone therapy . The two test compute tomography scan assessment intra-abdominal fat , dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan assessment total body fat . These test repeat annual basis next three year . By end study , project 462 transition menopausal status take place . Random effect model use estimate longitudinal change level rate intra-abdominal fat one move one menopausal status another .</detailed_description>
