	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Increased level body mass index ( BMI ) associate increased mortality morbidity cardiovascular disease , hypertension , diabetes disorder . The frequency obesity associate health-related problem increase American population . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study build upon two-stage genome scan BMI perform NHLBI Family Heart Study ( FHS ) . In first , 101 pedigree examine 1027 person genotyped LOD 2.2 find chromosome 7 . In stage 2 , 135 sibships 380 person examine , LOD 3.2 find locus . Compelling linkage find combine study ( LOD = 4.9 , chr 7q31.3 , 137cM ) . The LOD logarithm odds statistical estimate whether two locus ( sit gene ) likely lie near chromosome therefore likely inherit together package . A novel strategy use combine three cut edge method : ( 1 ) Regression Tree analyse identify homogenous subset family evidence BMI linkage 7q31.3 ; ( 2 ) DNA pool sample link versus unlinked family ; ( 3 ) quantitative PCR DNA pool high-density single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) mapping . The combination method permit cost effective approach identification genetic polymorphism linkage disequilibrium BMI , potential become widely adopt method gene localization complex trait . The study extend January , 2008 show compel evidence haplotype 5 ' region Leptin gene ( p &lt; 0.00005 ) influence BMI among men sample . The study demonstrate responsible gene region Leptin . SNP haplotype association study implicate three strong candidate locus locus also warrant additional study . The study confirm SNP association independent study 200 family show linkage position ( Dr. R. Arlen Price 's group ) . Those loci confirm association characterize sequencing , genotyping new polymorphism , gene expression study identify responsible gene .</detailed_description>
