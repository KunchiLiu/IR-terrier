	<brief_summary>Juvenile dermatomyositis ( JDMS ) one serious childhood rheumatic disease . The theory behind trial early introduction etanercept methotrexate prove effective treatment JDMS . Pretreatment muscle biopsy , believe abnormality blood vessel correlate bad physical strength daily functional ability . The long-term goal improve treatment serious childhood onset rheumatic disease well understand pathogenic mechanism development vasculopathy ( disorder blood vessel ) JDMS . Identification specific mechanism vasculopathy may allow rational introduction biologic treatment focus vascular growth .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The mortality JDMS 3-39 % 40 % patient demonstrate long-term disability . Current first line therapy high-dose corticosteroid attendant significant drug-related toxicity . Over 30 % JDMS patient fail respond adequately steroids require additional immunosuppression , none test prospective , randomize , control trial . The unique occlusive vasculopathy JDMS critical pathogenesis predictive prognosis poorly understood . Elevated level tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) alpha show present JDMS associate severe chronic course . Seventy-five child definite JDMS enrol 24-month prospective , randomize , multicentered trial compare 3 treatment : oral prednisone ( P ) , combination oral prednisone methotrexate ( P/MTX ) , combination oral prednisone etanercept ( P/E ) . Primary response measure muscle strength mean duration steroid therapy . Secondary response variable disability daily function height weight growth velocity ( steroid toxicity measure ) . The combination P/E test compare P alone combination P/MTX 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month treatment . In addition , combination P/MTX compare P alone 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month treatment . In pretreatment muscle biopsy , proangiogenic factor ( vascular endothelial cell growth factor basic fibroblast growth factor ) , angiostatic factor ( angiostatin endostatin ) , vascular morphology ( vessel number , width , length area ) quantify test ability predict muscle strength functional ability 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month later .</detailed_description>
