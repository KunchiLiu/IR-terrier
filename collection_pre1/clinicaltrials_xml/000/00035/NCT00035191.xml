	<brief_title>A Placebo-controlled Trial Evaluate Safety Efficacy Galantamine Treatment Vascular Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In previous 6-month study patient vascular dementia Alzheimer 's dementia , galantamine demonstrate positive result think , function , behavior , speech overall well patient , prevent behavior symptom dementia appear . This combined study consist two almost identical 26-week study examine criterion previous study , large patient population ( dementia identify cause blood vessel disease without Alzheimer 's disease ) . The study start 4-week period current medication dementia withdrawn follow 26-week double-blind treatment period patient receive either placebo galantamine 8 milligram 12 milligram twice day . Effectiveness measure change score Alzheimer 's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale , Alzheimer 's Disease Cooperative Study Scale , Clinician 's Interview-Based Impression Change Plus , neuropsychiatric inventory , well ( English-speaking country ) 10-minute interview patient ( EXIT-25 scale ) . Safety evaluate throughout study base incidence severity unexpected event , laboratory physical test , vital sign . The hypothesis study galantamine improve thinking , function , behavior , speech , overall well , good placebo . A voluntary pharmacogenomic study incorporate study plan evaluate whether specific gene related dementia drug response . 8 milligram ( mg ) 2 time day 8 week , increase to12 mg , tolerate .
