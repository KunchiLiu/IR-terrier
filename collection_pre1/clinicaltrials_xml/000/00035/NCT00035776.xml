	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The pathophysiology functional impairment patient low extremity peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) well understood . Although low ankle brachial index ( ABI ) level associate great functional impairment , one study suggest ABI improve great degree functional impairment low extremity revascularization . A meta-analysis exercise study intermittent claudication demonstrate significant association improve walking ability exercise change calf blood flow ABI . Thus , characteristic addition ABI appear influence walk ability PAD . It hypothesize chronic inflammation biological mechanism underlie decline physical function occur age . It recently report high level D-dimer ( fibrin degradation product ) high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) associate great objectively assessed functional limitation person PAD , functional limitation refer specific ability , objectively measure walk speed balance , distinct disability . Furthermore , functional limitation may fully explain disability . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The prospective study assess association hemostatic inflammatory blood factor progression low extremity arterial ischemia cardiovascular event 346 men woman low extremity peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) 203 men woman without PAD.The study ancillary NHLBI fund prospective study functional cardiovascular outcome men woman PAD , Walking Leg Circulation Study ( WALCS ) . The blood factor study include fibrinogen , PAI-1 , TPA antigen , d-dimer , prothrombin 1.2 , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , associate progression coronary atherosclerosis propose model pathogenesis coronary atherosclerosis , well study PAD . There two specific aim . The first determine whether high baseline blood factor level associate ) progression low extremity arterial ischemia ( decline ankle brachial index &gt; = 0.15 , low extremity gangrene , ulcer , revascularization , amputation ) ; b ) functional decline 48 month follow-up . The second aim determine whether high baseline blood factor level associate new cardiovascular event 48 month follow-up . The hypothesis high blood factor level baseline would associate PAD progression , functional decline , high rate cardiovascular morbidity mortality Pilot data Cardiovascular Health Study ( CHS ) show relative risk fibrinogen , D-dimer CRP level cardiovascular event high event occur proximate baseline blood factor measurement . Therefore , study also seek determine whether blood factor level measure recent examination prior cardiovascular event PAD progression high level immediately precede cardiovascular event PAD progression . The hypothesis test blood factor level recent examination prior cardiovascular event PAD progression would higher blood factor level immediately precede cardiovascular event . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
