	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Heart failure estimate contribute nearly 1 million hospitalization approximately 250,000 death annually U.S . The number new case heart failure U.S. estimate exceed 400,000 annually . Though reliable estimate magnitude , incidence , mortality heart failure remain sorely lacking , heart failure associate grim prognosis . However , little recent data exist , particularly community-wide perspective , determine whether incidence survival associate heart failure , management clinical syndrome , change time . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study use resident Worcester ( MA ) metropolitan area ( 1990 census 437,000 ) examines change time additional outcome patient validate heart failure 1995 2000 . Complimenting hospital surveillance heart failure , newly diagnose case heart failure occur member large HMO Central Massachusetts 1995 2000 identify monitored time . To accomplish study objective , medical record resident Worcester metropolitan area hospitalize discharge diagnosis heart failure relate diagnostic rubric individually review validated accord pre-established diagnostic criterion . The use traditional criterion heart failure well development new criterion epidemiological study heart failure important focus observational study . Records additional hospitalization death certificate review examine trend long-term survival discharge hospital patient year 2005 .</detailed_description>
