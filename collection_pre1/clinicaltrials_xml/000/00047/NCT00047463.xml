	<brief_title>Effects Treating Obstructive Sleep Apnea Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite appropriate treatment medication , individual epilepsy often continue seizure , many suffer excessive daytime sleepiness poor quality life . Evidence case study suggest treatment coexist obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) -stoppage breathe sleep-can reduce frequency seizure people epilepsy resistant antiepileptic medication . In study , individual symptoms OSA 2 seizure month meet study criterion undergo polysomnography , test continuously monitor normal abnormal physiological activity sleep . Those individual test positive OSA randomize either therapeutic placebo continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) -a mask treatment sleep apnea-for 10 week , time seizure frequency , daytime sleepiness , health-related quality life , CPAP compliance assess .</detailed_description>
