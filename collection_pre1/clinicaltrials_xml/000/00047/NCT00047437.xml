	<brief_title>Exercise Training Program Improve Clinical Outcomes Individuals With Congestive Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : CHF affect approximately five million Americans number one cause hospital admission individual age 65 . Although exercise training improve several clinical measure individual CHF ( e.g. , peak VO2 , heart rate variability , plasma norepinephrine level ) , know whether exercise training reduces mortality individual CHF . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This multicenter randomize study determine exercise training reduces mortality hospitalization rate individual moderate severe CHF . The secondary objective evaluate whether exercise program design individual CHF improve quality life functioning , economically advantageous , prevent medical complication . Three thousand individual moderate severe CHF randomly assign either standard medical therapy education , standard medical therapy education plus supervised exercise training program . The exercise training include 36 supervised clinic-based training session follow home-based exercise periodic supervise session reinforcement . Participants assign supervised exercise training program use either treadmill stationary bicycle , provide . Recruitment Status : As November 9 , 2006 , HF-ACTION enrol 2180 subject conclude enrollment end February , 2007 , anticipate enrollment approximately 2300 subject .</detailed_description>
