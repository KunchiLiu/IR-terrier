	<brief_summary>This study investigate safety effectiveness modify donor stem cell transplantation procedure treat advanced mycosis fungoides ( MF ) , lymphoma primarily affect skin , Sezary syndrome ( SS ) , leukemic form disease . Donated stem cell ( cell produce bone marrow mature different blood component white cell , red cell platelet ) cure patient certain leukemias lymphoma multiple myeloma . These cell generate completely new , function bone marrow . In addition , immune cell donor grow generate new immune system help fight infection . The new immune cell also attack residual tumor cell leave body intensive chemotherapy . However , stem cell transplantation carry significant risk death , require completely suppress immune system high-dose chemotherapy radiation . In addition , lymphocytes donor may cause call graft vs. host disease ( GvHD ) , cell see patient cell foreign mount immune response destroy . To try reduce risk , patient study give low-dose chemotherapy radiation , regimen easy body tolerate involve short period complete immune suppression . In addition , monoclonal antibody call Campath-1H give target lymphocyte , include become cancerous . Patients advance MF SS 18 70 year age match family donor 18 year age old may eligible study . Candidates medical history , physical examination blood test , lung heart function test , X-rays chest , eye examination , bone marrow sampling ( withdrawal needle tablespoon marrow hip bone ) , small skin biopsy ( surgical removal piece tissue microscopic examination ) needle biopsy tumor . Stem cell collect patient donor . To , hormone G-CSF injected skin several day push stem cell bone marrow bloodstream . Then , stem cell collect apheresis . In procedure blood drawn needle place one arm pump machine require cell separate remove . The rest blood return needle arm . Before transplant , central venous line ( large plastic tube ) place major vein . This tube stay body used entire treatment period deliver donate stem cell , give medication , transfuse blood , need , withdraw blood sample . Several day transplant procedure , patient start condition regimen low-dose chemotherapy Campath 1H , fludarabine , , necessary , cyclophosphamide . When condition therapy complete , stem cell infused period 4 hour . To help prevent rejection donor cell GvHD , cyclosporine mycophenolate mofetil give mouth vein 3 month start 4 day transplantation . The anticipated hospital stay 3 4 day , first 3 dos Campath monitor drug side effect . The rest procedure , include transplant , do outpatient basis . Follow-up visit first 3 month transplant schedule twice week physical examination , blood test symptoms check . Then , visit schedule 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 , 36 , 48 month post-transplant . Visits first 3 year include blood test , skin biopsy , bone marrow biopsy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stem Cell Transplant Therapy With Campath-1H Treating Advanced Mycosis Fungoides Sezary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) group lymphoproliferative disorder characterize localization neoplastic T cell skin presentation . Mycosis fungoides ( MF ) leukemic variant Sezary syndrome ( SS ) prevalent form CTCL . While early stage MF restrict patch plaque involve skin , patient eventually develop cutaneous tumor , generalize erythroderma , dissemination peripheral blood , lymph node visceral organ . Currently exist therapy tumor-stage disseminate CTCL palliative , patient die within 1-5 year . The presence CD8+ cell close proximity dermal neoplastic infiltrates early stage disease , clinical response see immunomodulatory agent suggest CTCL may potential target immunotherapy-based intervention . Allogeneic stem cell transplantation curative treatment modality successfully employ number hematologic malignancy . The curative effect approach part mediate donor-derived T lymphocytes reactivity patient leukemic cell . The power graft versus leukemia effect ( GVL ) best illustrated patient relapse Chronic Myeloid Luekema ( CML ) allogeneic bone marrow transplant , single donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) induce remission . We hypothesize neoplastic T cell MF/SS may similarly susceptible graft vs. tumor ( GVT ) effect . Unfortunately , advance patient age 25 % 35 % risk transplant relate mortality ( TRM ) preclude use conventional 'dose- intensive ' allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation ( PBSCT ) patient advance CTCL might otherwise benefit approach . The risk TRM relate condition circumvent least partially use reduced-intensity condition regimen prepare patient transplantation . In study , treat male non-pregnant female subject age 18 70 year ( inclusive ) suffer advanced MF/SS allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) transplant HLA-matched family donor HLA match ( 10/10 allele level match ) unrelated donor . A low intensity , nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen employ anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody Campath-1H ( alemtuzumab ) fludarabine use induce host immunosuppression facilitate donor hematopoietic lymphoid engraftment . We anticipate minimal host myelosuppression consequently reduce early transplant toxicity condition regimen . Immune hematopoietic reconstitution achieve infusion unmanipulated donor-derived granulocyte colony stimulation factor ( G-CSF ) mobilize peripheral blood stem cell . Infusion donor lymphocytes incremental dos use promote engraftment diease regression indicate . Cyclosporine A ( CSA ) use prophylaxis graft v host disease ( GVHD ) , dose adjustment make necessary favor complete donor chimerism disease regression . A total 25 subject ( transplant recipient ) treat protocol . The primary end point study efficacy ( proportion subject achieve complete response ) . Other end point include assessment donor-host chimerism various hematopoietic lymphoid cell , overall response , incidence acute chronic GVHD , graft failure , assessment lymphoid subset reconstitution , transplant relate morbidity mortality disease-free overall survival outcome transplantation donor type ( related vs. unrelated ) .</detailed_description>
