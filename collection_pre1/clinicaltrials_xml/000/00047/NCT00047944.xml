	<brief_summary>Anxiety child parent major depressive disorder ( MDD ) pose particularly high risk later-life MDD . In adult , MDD involve dysfunction prefrontal brain region regulate attention emotional stimulus . These abnormality : ) find primarily adult specific familial form MDD ; ii ) persist recovery MDD , iii ) relate anxiety . These finding raise possibility risk MDD tie dysfunction prefrontal region involve regulation emotion , possibly manifest early-life anxiety . If possibility confirm never-depressed adolescent high risk MDD , finding would provide key insight developmental neurobiology MDD . The goal protocol study neural substrate risk MDD young people . This protocol test hypothesis adolescent high risk MDD virtue childhood anxiety parental history MDD exhibit dysfunction prefrontal cortex amygdala , region involve emotion regulation . This goal accomplish fMRI study emotion regulation high low-risk adolescent . For research , at-risk adolescent recruit participant NIMH-funded extramural study New York University ( NYU ) examine biology risk anxiety depressive disorder . Over three-year period , 45 high-risk probands 60 low-risk comparison study , include 20 comparison NYU sample 40 Washington DC metropolitan area . In present protocol , conduct NIH , subject undergo volumetric MRI scan assess structural abnormality prefrontal cortex medial temporal lobe . They complete series four out-of-scanner cognitive task two fMRI-based cognitive task measure modulation attention emotional stimulus . The fMRI task hypothesize differentially engage prefrontal cortex amygdala low vs. high risk subject . These task use test hypothesis at-risk individual exhibit enhance amygdala reduce prefrontal activation fMRI emotion/attention task .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Parental history major depressive disorder pose particularly high risk later-life MDD . In adult , MDD involve dysfunction subcortical brain region related emotional responsiveness , amygdala , cortical brain region interface cognitive emotional process . These abnormality : ) find primarily adult specific familial form MDD ; ii ) persist recovery MDD , iii ) relate anxiety . These finding raise possibility risk MDD tie dysfunction emotional circuit prefrontal region involve regulation emotion . If possibility confirm never-depressed adolescent high risk MDD , finding would provide key insight developmental neurobiology MDD . The goal protocol study neural substrate risk MDD young people . This protocol test hypothesis adolescent high risk MDD virtue parental history MDD exhibit dysfunction prefrontal cortex , amygdala , subcortical region involve emotion emotion regulation . This goal accomplish fMRI study edmotion provocation high low-risk adolescent . For research , at-risk adolescent recruit participant NIMH-funded extramural study New York University , Brown University , Columbia University examine biology risk anxiety depressive disorder . Over three-year period , data measure interest obtain 100 high-risk probands 100 low-risk comparison . In addition , sub-set parent adolescent ( n=100 ) also study use identical procedure . In present protocol , conduct NIH , subject undergo volumetric MRI scan assess structural abnormality prefrontal cortex medial temporal lobe . They complete series out-of-scanner cognitive task fMRI-based cognitive task . Two task measure modulation attention emotional stimulus ; third task measure engagement temporal prefrontal region social interaction . For type task , prior study adolescent ongoing mood anxiety disorder demonstrate hypothesize abnormality brain engagement . The current study design examine degree comparable finding emerge unaffected adolescent risk mood anxiety disorder .</detailed_description>
