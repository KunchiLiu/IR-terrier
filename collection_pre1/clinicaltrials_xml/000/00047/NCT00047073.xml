	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Chemotherapy drug sirolimus use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Giving chemotherapy drug surgery may shrink tumor remove surgery . PURPOSE : Phase I/II trial study effectiveness sirolimus treat patient glioblastoma multiforme respond previous radiation therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sirolimus Treating Patients With Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine maximum tolerate dose sirolimus patient glioblastoma multiforme . - Determine safety profile drug patient . - Determine efficacy drug , term 6-month progression-free survival objective response , patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . - Phase I : Patients receive oral sirolimus 5-7 day surgery . Patients undergo surgical resection . Patients resume oral sirolimus daily full recovery surgery . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos sirolimus maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede least 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . - Phase II : Patients receive oral sirolimus phase I dose determined phase . Patients follow survival . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 3-12 patient accrued phase I study within 3-12 month . A total 32 patient accrue phase II study .</detailed_description>
