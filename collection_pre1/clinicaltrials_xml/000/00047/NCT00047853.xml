	<brief_summary>The purpose study use brain image technology investigate brain change people expose predictable versus unpredictable unpleasant stimulus . Unpleasant event predict evoke response fear , whereas unpredictable , unpleasant stimulus cause chronic anxiety associate specific event . Information gain study may help development effective treatment anxiety disorder . When confronted fearful event , people eventually develop fear specific cue associate event well environmental context fearful event occur . Evidence suggest cue fear contextual fear model different aspect anxiety . However , study examine way brain affect expression contextual fear conduct . This study use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) Magneto-encephalography ( MEG ) compare brain activity underlie fear bring predictable unpredictable aversive stimulus .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This protocol examine neurobiology fear anxiety use various approach . During fear condition phasic explicit cue ( e.g. , light ) repeatedly associate aversive unconditioned stimulus ( e.g. , shock ) , organism develops fear explicit cue well environmental context experiment take place . Experimental evidence suggest cue fear contextual fear model different aspect anxiety . Studies patient indicate contextual fear may model aspect especially relevant anxiety disorder . However , neural basis expression contextual fear previously elucidate human image study . One important determinant contextual fear predictability : contextual fear increase threat ( e.g. , electric shock ) unpredictable , opposed threat predictable . The aim study compare neural substrate underlie fear evoke predictable versus unpredictable shock . Animal study indicate conditioned response predictably cue threat less explicit threat separate process mediate distinct brain structure . Psychophysiological data suggest propose procedure differentiate two response . Hence , anticipate procedure allow u compare brain correlate response human . Another objective study effect threat shock processing learn threat cue amygdala , visual auditory system , motivation/reward system . This investigated mean event-related magneto-encephalography ( MEG ) fMRI measurement use various paradigm . Finally , last project examine pharmacologic manipulation gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) level benzodiazepine alprazolam affect relationship GABA concentration ( quantified magnetic resonance spectroscopy , MRS ) , visual-and auditory-induced gamma oscillation ( measure MEG ) , fMRI BOLD response .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All screening procedure describe section conduct screen protocol 01M0254 . Subjects must meet follow inclusion criterion order participate study : 1 . Male female volunteer age 1850 year old . 2 . Judged good physical health basis medical history , clinical MRI scan , physical examination . Physical exam conduct NIMH credentialed physician nurse . Clinical laboratory test order base his/her discretion . 3 . Healthy subject judge good psychiatric health basis Structured Clinical Interview DSMIVTR . The SCID administer credentialed NIMH clinician . 4 . Able understand procedure agree participate study give write informed consent . 5 . This protocol ( 02M0321 ) include patient primary diagnosis ( clinical responsibility Dr. Daniel Pine ) generalize anxiety disorder , panic disorder , SAD , PTSD , specific phobia , major depression accord DSMIV . 6 . Subjects ask completely stop smoking drinking coffee study may experience withdrawal symptom , could affect study result . However , ask abstain drinking caffeinated beverage include coffee , tea caffeinated soft drink smoke least 1 hour prior test . They also instruct drink alcohol night prior test day test . 7 . Speaks English Spanish fluently ( subject Major Depressive Disorder , healthy volunteer ) 8 . Speaks English fluently ( subject Anxiety Disorder ) EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects exclude study meet follow exclusion criterion : 1 . Clinically significant organic disease , e.g. , cardiovascular disease . 2 . Clinically significant abnormality physical examination . 3 . Any medical condition increase risk fMRI ( e.g . pacemaker , metallic foreign body eye ) . 4 . History disease , investigator opinion may confound result study , include , limited , history organic mental disorder , seizure , mental retardation . 5 . Have current diagnosis alcohol substance abuse ACCORDING TO DSM IV CRITERIA 6 . Have lifetime diagnosis alcohol substance dependence ACCORDING TO DSM IV CRITERIA . 7 . Unless subject enrol patient , subject current Axis I psychiatric disorder identify Structured Clinical Interview DSMIV , nonpatient edition ( SCID/NP ) . 8 . If healthy volunteer , past bipolar depression history psychosis delusional disorder . 9 . If healthy volunteer , first degree relative history psychotic disorder schizophrenia bipolar disorder 10 . If healthy volunteer , psychotropic medication within 4 week scan 11 . Medications act central nervous system ( e.g. , Lorazepam , Codeine ) thus may interfere interpretation study result . Specific exclusionary drug class include limit : ( opioid analgesic , DA receptor agonist , anticholinergic , MAO inhibitor , COMT inhibitor , well illicit substance ) . In addition , healthy participant may psychotropic medication . 12 . Pregnancy , i.e. , positive BetaHCG urine test conduct prior experiment session . 13 . Current past history cubital tunnel syndrome carpal tunnel syndrome . 14 . Reynauds syndrome cold pressor test experiment ADDITIONAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS : Patients would unable comply study procedure assessment Specific phobia patient carry diagnosis generalize anxiety disorder Patients currently psychotropic medication exception PTSD patient currently take SSRI , benzodiazepine , tricyclic antidepressant include . ( Patients require free psychotropics must medication 2 week , 6 week fluoxetine . Additionally , PTSD patient psychotropics SSRI , benzodiazepine , tricyclic antidepressant must medication 2 week prior test . Patients take medication purpose study ) Patients exclude current past history psychotic disorder , bipolar disorder , delirium , dementia , amnestic disorder , cognitive disorder otherwise specify , pervasive developmental disorder , mental retardation ADDITIONAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR THE STUDY INVOLVING ALPRAZOLAM : Adverse reaction benzodiazepine History angioedema High low blood pressure History faint A first degree relative history mania , schizophrenia , psychosis</criteria>
