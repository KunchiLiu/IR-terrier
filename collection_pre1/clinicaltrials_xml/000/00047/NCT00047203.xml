	<brief_title>Flavopiridol Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response rate patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma treat flavopiridol . II . Determine disease-free survival overall survival patient treated drug . III . Correlate disease response ( 11 ; 14 ) ( q13 ; q32 ) rearrangement , p16 methylation status , BCRP expression patient treat drug . IV . Correlate disease response drug treatment cell cycle status effect apoptosis apoptosis regulatory proteins patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive flavopiridol IV 1 hour day 1-3 . Courses repeat every 21 day 12 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After 12 month , patient achieve least partial response may continue treatment absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 6 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
