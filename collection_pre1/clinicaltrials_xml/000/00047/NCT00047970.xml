	<detailed_description>The Sister Study prospectively examine environmental familial risk factor breast cancer disease cohort 50,884 sister woman breast cancer . Such sister twice risk develop breast cancer woman . The frequency relevant gene share risk factor also high . Studying sister enhances ability understand interplay gene environment breast cancer risk identify potentially preventable risk factor . We assess exposure onset disease , thus avoid bias common retrospective study . The assembled cohort create framework test new hypothesis emerge . Cancer-free sister age 35-74 recruit nationally . Enrollment complete July 2009 50,884 woman fully enrol . Participants enrol 50 state Puerto Rico . The cohort follow actively . Cohort member occasionally invited participate add-on study , sometimes include ask participant invite family member provide information . Data potential risk factor current health status collect telephone interview self-completed questionnaire . Blood , urine , environmental sample collect banked future use nested study woman develop breast cancer ( disease ) sample n't . The cohort follow prospectively 10 year . Annual questionnaire update medical history change exposure . About 300 new case breast cancer expect occur cohort year . Analyses ongoing assess independent combine effect environmental exposure genetic polymorphism affect estrogen metabolism , DNA repair , response specific environmental exposure . Future analyse focus know potential risk factor ( e.g . smoking , occupational exposure , alcohol , diet , obesity ) include measurement phthalates , phytoestrogens , insulin , growth factor , micro-nutrients , gene . Women develop breast cancer study follow assess role environment gene healthy survival follow diagnosis treatment . The cohort also use explore risk disease ( e.g . heart disease , osteoporosis , hormonal cancer , autoimmune disease ) important woman .</detailed_description>
