	<brief_title>Erlotinib Treating Patients With Liver Cancer That Can Surgically Removed</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess progression-free survival ( PFS ) measure 16 week follow initiation daily continuous oral therapy OSI-774 patient unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess objective response rate , rate duration stable disease , time progression , median overall survival patient population , change tumor perfusion base functional CT imaging . II . To correlate response patient characteristic include : age , disease stage ( TNM , Okuda [ 6 ] ) , viral hepatitis status , pathologic grade cirrhosis , Childs-Pugh status , Performance Status , serum value : alpha feto-protein , bilirubin , transaminase , albumin ; EGFR expression score IHC ; development skin rash therapy . III . To determine pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic profile OSI-774 patient population . IV . To determine safety tolerability OSI-774 patient population . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord epidermal growth factor receptor expression ( low , 0-1+ v high , 2-3+ ) . Patients receive oral erlotinib daily . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
