	<brief_title>Flavopiridol Plus Radiation Therapy Followed By Gemcitabine Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Locally Advanced , Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose flavopiridol combination radiotherapy follow gemcitabine patient locally advance , unresectable pancreatic cancer . II . Determine toxicity regimen patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine pharmacokinetics flavopiridol patient . II . Determine , preliminarily , therapeutic activity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study flavopiridol . Patients receive flavopiridol IV 1 hour twice weekly ( day 1 4 day 2 5 ) 6 week . Concurrently , patient undergo radiotherapy daily 5 day week 5.5 week . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Four week completion radiotherapy , patient re-evaluated* . Beginning within 4-7 week completion chemotherapy radiotherapy , patient receive gemcitabine hydrochloride alone combination another cytotoxic agent gemcitabine hydrochloride combine target drug ( e.g. , erlotinib bevacizumab ) discretion oncologist . NOTE : *Patients whose image study suggest potential curative resection refer surgical evaluation initiate gemcitabine hydrochloride therapy . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos flavopiridol maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Once MTD determine , 10 additional patient treat recommended phase II dose . Patients follow 4 week every 8 week thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 3-46 patient accrue study within 2 year .</detailed_description>
