	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate use pulsatile lavage enhance heal pressure ulcer individual spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . It investigate hypothesis treatment non-necrotic pressure ulcer pulsatile lavage enhance rate healing . These goal achieve use repeated-measures double-blinded randomize control study individual SCI pelvic region pressure ulcer . A total 60 subject recruit study . Participants randomly assign treatment control group . Pulsatile lavage treatment administer treatment group daily 3 week period . The control group subject receive daily sham pulsatile lavage treatment 3 week . All subject monitor 3 week period continue receive routine pressure ulcer care , i.e . dressing bedrest regular turning regime participation study . All study participant monitor follow study period complete closure pressure ulcer achieve order determine total interval final closure , include surgical procedure require . In addition , economic effect pulsatile lavage treatment evaluate monitoring data collect CPRS , include duration admission , duration total bedrest order duration treatment pressure ulcer . This data give initial measure cost benefit may achieve use pulsatile lavage treatment pressure ulcer . Methodology Eligible individual SCI admit CVAMC pelvic region pressure ulcer assign pulsatile lavage treatment group second non-intervention control group . A comprehensive assessment methodology employ characterize pressure ulcer heal . All study participant assess routine interval use objective measurement technique . Statistical analysis inter-group difference allow efficacy pulsatile lavage pressure ulcer heal establish . Forty subject enrol study . Patient Selection Criteria : Subjects recruit Louis Stokes Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center ( CVAMC ) . All individual spinal cord injury admit SCI Unit pelvic region pressure ulcer consider eligible study . Further selection criterion employ screen potential participant describe . On recruitment subject randomly assign 2 group 20 subject . The assessment method employ volunteer . One group participate pulsatile lavage intervention , second group act control .</detailed_description>
