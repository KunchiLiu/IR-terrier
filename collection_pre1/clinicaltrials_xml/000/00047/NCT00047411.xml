	<brief_title>Home Use Automatic External Defibrillators Treat Sudden Cardiac Arrest</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Sudden cardiac arrest ( SCA ) occur every two minute throughout United States , 70 percent occur home . Because survival fall 10 percent per minute first ten minute , imperative defibrillate soon possible . Public effort provide defibrillation fast enough case . Physicians believe initial shock best do use readily available AEDs family member second loved one . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This study test central hypothesis provide AED home use improve survival beyond achieved typical response sudden cardiac arrest . An estimated 7,000 people anterior myocardial infarction randomly assign one two group : 1 ) standard response sudden cardiac arrest , entail call emergency medical service ( EMS ) system perform CPR , 2 ) addition home AED standard response . The standard response augment standardized provision video respond sudden cardiac arrest perform CPR . The goal standard response immediate notification EMS prompt CPR . The goal AED group shock cardiac arrest victim three time immediately , indicate AED , call EMS perform CPR soon possible preferably within two minute collapse . Participants enrol two year follow additional two year . The study perform 200 cardiology clinic .</detailed_description>
