	<brief_summary>This study seek information biology substance dependency explore brain area involve feel positive negative emotion . Specifically , determine whether brain chemical call dopamine affect activity certain brain region performance game involve win lose money . Brain activity examine use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , test us magnetic field radio wave produce image brain structure function . Young middle-aged healthy adult may participate study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , psychiatric interview , blood urine test . Participants assign one two study procedure , follow : Tyrosine/Phenylalanine This study require two overnight stay NIH Clinical Center . For stay , subject admit hospital afternoon MRI scan . From time admission scan , diet restrict food relatively low amino acid , prepare NIH dietitian . The next day , participant undergo MRI scanning . For procedure , subject lie table move scanner , metal cylindrical machine . Earplugs worn muffle loud noise occur electrical switching radio frequency circuit . Imaging brain structure take 10 15 minute . Additional scan take measure brain activity subject play simple computer game money . These scan take another 20 45 minute . Five hour MRI , subject drink one two beverage contain amino acid . A different beverage give two visit : one drink lack essential amino acid tyrosine phenylalanine , body make dopamine ; contains balance amount two amino acid . Finally , subject fill mood-rating questionnaire drink beverage . Dextroamphetamine This study require two outpatient visit NIH Clinical Center . For one visit , participant give injection 0.2 mg/kg body weight drug dextroamphetamine ; , give injection saline ( salt water ) . After injection , undergo MRI scan play computer game money , describe . They fill mood-rating questionnaire brain scan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol advance understanding behavioral neurobiology underlie substance dependency explore regional brain activity response appetitive aversive stimulus human subject . In protocol , brain activation dependent measure , measure blood oxygenation level dependent ( BOLD ) signal acquire functional magnetic resonance ( fMRI ) imaging . Previous work laboratory find cue anticipate monetary reward versus threat negative reinforcement cause increase BOLD signal nucleus accumbens ( NAcc ) part ventral striatum . This protocol intend extend finding explore whether recently report BOLD activation ( hemodynamic response ) certain brain region response motivational cue perturb dopaminergic pharmacological manipulation . In series two , repeated-measures , within-subject experiment , propose temporarily alter subject ' brain monoamine neurotransmitter system pharmacological intervention prior present subject appetitive aversive visual stimulus well cue signal potential punishment reward . In first experiment , brain catecholamine system deactivate dietary restriction amino acid precursor Tyrosine ( Tyr ) Phenylalanine ( Phe ) , respectively . In second experiment , brain dopamine ( DA ) release transiently increase administration dextroamphetamine ( Amph ) . Based wealth existent finding , predict acutely enhance synaptic DA Amph augment reward-elicited activation ventral striatum . Conversely , acute dietary restriction DA precursor Tyr , ( along Tyr precursor Phe ) blunt activation . Since substance use disorder ( SUD ) alcoholism may result disordered neural system regulate approach avoidance behavior ( respect substance ) , experiment yield useful knowledge relevant SUD .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects physically healthy determine medical evaluation NIAAA outpatient clinic . In particular , subject must demonstrate cardiovascular blood pressure abnormality , rest blood pressure 140/90 great . All value laboratory test must within NIH define normal range radiological cardiac evaluation must consider normal NIH radiologist cardiologist read scan record . As usual clinical practice , case minor abnormality lab test may repeat ensure validity initial report . Are 1865 year age . Have 20/20 vision wear corrective contact lens . Plastic glass popin lenses different strength available NMR center use nearsighted subject wear contact . Have ferromagnetic object body might adversely affect MRI ( e.g . surgical clip ; metal fragment near brain ; eye blood vessel ; cardiac neurological pacemaker ; cochlear eye implant doubt absence object result exclusion study ) . Test HIV negative . Have indication organic brain syndrome . Do meet criteria present past Axis I psychiatric disorder , include nicotine dependence . Smokers exclude . Have active homicidal suicidal ideation , active symptom posttraumatic stress disorder . Are currently receive psychotropic medication medication likely affect brain neurotransmitter system . Have indication recent drug use evidence urine drug screen selfreport . Are pregnant lactating .</criteria>
