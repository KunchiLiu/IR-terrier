	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Effective screening test help doctor detect lung cancer early plan curative treatment . It yet know whether low-dose helical compute tomography ( LDCT ) screen effective chest radiography ( CXR ) screen reduce death lung cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized clinical trial compare effectiveness LDCT scan CXR screening individual high risk develop lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>National Lung Screening Trial ( NLST ) Screening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare whether screen low-dose helical CT scan v chest x-ray reduces lung cancer-specific mortality participant high risk develop lung cancer . OUTLINE : NLST participant randomize either low-dose helical CT chest x-ray equal proportion . A total 53,454 participant enrol ( 26,722 low-dose CT 26,732 chest radiography ) 33 screen center across United States . Screening offer three time ( baseline two annual follow-up examination ) . The primary endpoint study lung cancer mortality . The study arm compare regard overall mortality , lung cancer incidence , screening-related complication . All low-dose scanner chest x-ray machine certify use meet NLST protocol requirement American College Radiology guideline . Low-dose CT acquisition chest radiograph interpret trained radiologist . Participants health care provider inform study examination result . Participants abnormalities suspicious lung cancer contact information regard diagnostic evaluation . Medical record collect diagnostic evaluation , medical complication , initial treatment . Participants contact least annually mail telephone . The National Lung Screening Trial ( NLST ) represent union two NCI-sponsored effort , NCI Lung Screening Study American College Radiology Imaging Network ( ACRIN ) .</detailed_description>
