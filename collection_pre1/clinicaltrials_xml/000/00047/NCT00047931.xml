	<brief_summary>This study test safety experimental vaccine HIV examine whether induces immune response HIV . A vaccine substance give try create resistance immunity disease infection . The vaccine study make DNA ( genetic material ) four HIV protein call 'gag ' , 'pol ' , 'Nef ' , 'Env ' . Injected human , viral DNA instruct body make small amount HIV proteins . This study see body create immune response protein . Study participant catch HIV AIDS DNA vaccine protein make . Healthy normal volunteer 18 40 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination blood urine test . Women also pregnancy test . Women enrol study must either infertile ( e.g. , due menopause hysterectomy ) must agree either abstain heterosexual sex practice birth control least 21 day begin study throughout duration . Participants randomly assign receive either experimental vaccine placebo ( salt solution contain active substance ) divide three group , base entry study . Of first seven people enrolled ( Group 1 ) , five receive 2-mg dose vaccine two receive placebo . If vaccine safe dose , Group 2 , five people receive 4-mg dose vaccine two receive placebo . If dose safe , Group 3 , thirty people receive 8-mg dose vaccine six receive placebo . All participant receive three injection upper arm muscle-one injection month three months-with needle-less device call Biojector 2000Â® ( Registered Trademark ) . At time injection , participant observe least 1 hour immunization . At home , record temperature symptom may experience , include effect injection site , least 7 day , long symptom remain . If symptom occur , participant report immediately clinic staff , necessary , come clinic examination . Participants 10 clinic visit study .
