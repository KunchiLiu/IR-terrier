	<brief_summary>This study 1 ) identify characteristic bone marrow mast cell patient unexplained anaphylaxis flush mastocytosis 2 ) determine whether mastocytosis might underlie cause unexplained anaphylaxis patient condition . Anaphylaxis hypersensitivity reaction patient may flush , hive , stuffy nose , red itchy eye , difficulty breathing , swell tongue , throat , palm sol , abdominal cramping , lightheadedness , decrease blood pressure , loss consciousness . Although allergens common cause anaphylactic episode , cause identify 50 percent patient recurrent event . Mastocytosis disease excessive mast cell tissue skin bone marrow . These cell release chemical result itch , blister , flushing , bone pain , abdominal pain . Patients 18 year age old episode anaphylaxis flush apparent cause mastocytosis may eligible study . Participants medical history physical examination ; blood test identify genetic change important growth , development , function human mast cell ; bone marrow aspiration biopsy . For bone marrow procedure , skin hipbone outer surface bone numb local anesthesia . Then , special needle insert hipbone 1 tablespoon bone marrow drawn syringe . Another needle insert area collect small piece bone marrow . Additional procedure may include allergen test , urinalysis , 24-hour urine collection . Participants return NIH reassessment disease status 12 18 month . The follow-up evaluation include history physical examination , blood test , possible repeat bone marrow aspiration patient whose clinical sign symptom change significantly , test clinically indicate . First-degree relative ( parent , child , sibling ) may enrol limited instance provide blood sample genetic analysis relate mast cell development function comparison patient similar symptom .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Anaphylaxis severe systemic hypersensitivity reaction cause release mediator mast cell basophil . Signs symptom anaphylaxis may include generalized flushing , hive , stuffy nose , red itchy eye , difficulty breathing , swell tongue , throat , palm sol , gastrointestinal cramping , lightheadedness loss consciousness . Although common cause anaphylaxis include food , drug sting insect , causative factor identify 50 % patient recurrent anaphylactic episode . Mast cell important mediator anaphylaxis . This study examine hypothesis patient unexplained anaphylaxis may systemic mastocytosis , disorder pathologic mast cell proliferation , underlie cause . In addition , investigate hematopoietic cell , result tissue mast cell susceptible degranulation . The study enroll patient mastocytosis without flush anaphylaxis , patient unexplained flush anaphylaxis . Patients receive clinical evaluation , blood test bone marrow biopsy aspirate . Research study plan include flow cytometric analysis blood bone marrow cell , investigation mutation polymorphisms gene involve mast cell growth differentiation , determination surrogate disease marker examination mast cell growth function . The study improve understand mechanism involve anaphylactic reaction , could turn lead development strategy well prevent treat episode .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS WITH MASTOCYTOSIS : Age equal great 18 year . Diagnosis mastocytosis establish presence typical urticaria pigmentosa skin lesion bone marrow biopsy . Letter referral prospective study participant 's local doctor . Ability give inform consent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS WITH MASTOCYTOSIS : Age le 18 year . Lack referral physician . Presence comorbid condition , judgment investigator refer physician , may put patient undue risk travel ( acute infection , severe thrombocytopenia ) . Inability provide inform consent . Inability refusal undergo bone marrow biopsy aspirate . Known allergy latex Lidocaine . INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS WITH UNEXPLAINED FLUSHING OR ANAPHYLAXIS : Age equal great 18 year . Presence flush anaphylaxis negative workup know cause carcinoid syndrome , pheochromocytoma , food allergy . Ability give inform consent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS WITH UNEXPLAINED FLUSHING OR ANAPHYLAXIS : Same patient mastocytosis . Known cause anaphylaxis flushing . Frequent lifethreatening anaphylactic episode : History 6 separate attack result ER visit 6 month precede referral . INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR RELATIVE : To firstdegree relative accept protocol patient unexplained anaphylaxis , flush mastocytosis . Ability give inform consent . For minor , ability parent give inform consent . There age restriction .</criteria>
