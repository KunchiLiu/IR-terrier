	<brief_summary>This study examine safety effectiveness peginterferon alpha-2b ( PEG-Intron ) alone together thalidomide patient glioma ( type brain tumor ) . Gliomas nourish blood deliver blood vessel whose formation stimulate substance produce tumor . Stopping growth new vessel slow prevent tumor growth . The Food Drug Administration approve various interferon treat several disease , include melanoma leukemia . These drug block new vessel growth patient recurrent tumor , high dos produce serious side effect . Therefore , study use low dose PEG-Intron give weekly instead high dos give several time week . Thalidomide , currently approve treat leprosy , also block development new blood vessel formation . In recent study thalidomide give 36 patient gliomas , 4 patient tumor shrinkage , 12 stable disease least 2 month , least 3 response treatment last 6 14 month . Patients 18 year age old primary glioma whose tumor recur grow follow standard treatment respond radiation therapy may eligible study . Candidates screen physical examination , blood urine test ( include pregnancy test woman childbearing potential ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) compute tomography ( CT ) head . Patients continue treatment cycle long drug tolerate without serious side effect tumor grow . While study , patient undergo various test procedure follow : Physical neurologic examination every 6 week MRI CT brain scan every 6 week assess tumor status . MRI diagnostic test use strong magnetic field radio wave show structural chemical change tissue . During scan , patient lie table narrow cylinder contain magnetic field . He speak staff member intercom system time procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Peginterferon Alpha-2b Thalidomide Adults With Recurrent Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : There grow belief angiogenesis inhibition represent potentially promising , novel therapeutic approach highly vascular solid tumor like malignant glioma . Thalidomide Peg-Intron ( IFN - Interferon ) attractive drug use combination test hypothesis combination anti-angiogenesis therapy inhibition give proven activity single agent patient malignant gliomas spectrum largely non-overlapping toxicity . Given recent preclinical data describe potent antiangiogenic anti-tumor effect low dose , continuous IFN administration , interested evaluating use pegylated IFN combination thalidomide . Thus , propose phase II trial pegylated IFN thalidomide patient recurrent glioma . Objectives : To obtain preliminary evidence anti-tumor efficacy PEG-Intron combination thalidomide patient recurrent high grade glioma assess prolongation progression-free survival compare historical control . A secondary endpoint trial determine response rate associate combination therapy two stratum evaluate document toxicity PEG-Intron combination thalidomide dose prescribe protocol patient population . Eligibility : Patients histologically prove supratentorial malignant primary glioma eligible protocol . These include glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) , anaplastic astrocytoma ( AA ) , anaplastic oligodendroglioma ( AO ) , anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma ( AMO ) , malignant astrocytoma NOS ( otherwise specify ) . Patients must receive prior therapy Peg-Intron Thalidomide . Design : Patients treat weekly PEG-Intron plus daily oral thalidomide . All patient treat 6 week follow patient repeat MRI scan ass disease response .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients histologically prove supratentorial malignant primary glioma eligible protocol . These include glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) , anaplastic astrocytoma ( AA ) , anaplastic oligodendroglioma ( AO ) , anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma ( AMO ) , malignant astrocytoma NOS ( otherwise specify ) . Patients must evaluable measurable disease show unequivocal evidence tumor recurrence progression MRI CT scan . This scan perform within 14 day prior registration steroid dosage stable least 5 day . If steroid dose increase date imaging initiation treatment , new 20 baseline MR/CT scan require . The type scan , i.e. , MRI CT must use throughout period treatment tumor measurement . Patients undergone recent resection recurrent progressive tumor eligible long follow condition apply : They recover effect surgery Measurable disease follow resection recurrent tumor mandate eligibility study . Patients must evaluable disease . To best assess extent residual disease postoperatively , CT/MRI do later 96 hour immediate postoperative period 46 week postoperatively . If 96 hour scan 2 week registration , scan need repeat . The baseline onstudy MR/CT perform within 14 day registration steroid dosage stable . If steroid dose increase date imaging initiation PegIntron without Thalidomide , new baseline MR/CT require stable steroid 5 day . Patient must fail prior radiation therapy must interval great equal 4 week completion radiation therapy study entry . Patients prior therapy include interstitial brachytherapy stereotactic radiosurgery must confirmation true progressive disease rather radiation necrosis base upon either PET Thallium scanning , MR spectroscopy surgical documentation disease . Prior therapy . There limitation number prior therapy . All patient must sign informed consent indicate aware investigational nature study . Patients must &gt; 18 year old , life expectancy &gt; 8 week . Patients must Karnofsky performance status &gt; 60 . Patients must recover toxic effect prior therapy ( include resolution effect laboratory value ) : 2 week investigational agent , 4 week prior cytotoxic therapy , 2 week vincristine , 6 week nitrosoureas , 3 week procarbazine administration , 1 week noncytotoxic agent e.g . tamoxifen , ci retinoic acid , etc . ( radiosensitizer count ) . Any question relate definition noncytotoxic agent direct PI . Patients must adequate bone marrow function ( WBC &gt; 3,000/l , ANC &gt; 1,500 mm3 , platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3 , hemoglobin &gt; 10 gm % ) , adequate liver function ( SGOT bilirubin &lt; 2 time upper limit normal ) , adequate renal function ( creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL creatinine clearance &gt; 60 cc/min ) start therapy . These test must perform within 14 day prior registration . Eligibility level hemoglobin may reach transfusion . Patients history cancer ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma insitu cervix ) , unless complete remission therapy disease minimum 3 year ineligible . This study design include woman minority , design measure difference intervention effect . Males female recruit preference gender . No exclusion study base race . Minorities actively recruit participate . Patients must pregnant nursing , patient ( men woman ) must willing practice birth control 1 month prior , 4 month treatment thalidomide . It propose thalidomide may interfere hormonalbased contraception , therefore , barrier method contraception ( i.e . diaphragm , condom ) MUST use rather , addition birth control pill . No peripheral neuropathy &gt; grade 1 . No concurrent use investigational agent . Patients must : Serious active infection Disease obscure toxicity dangerously alter drug metabolism Serious intercurrent medical illness . Significant illness investigator 's opinion adequately control appropriate therapy would compromise patient ability tolerate therapy . Patients must receive prior therapy PegIntron Thalidomide . Concurrent chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy permit .</criteria>
