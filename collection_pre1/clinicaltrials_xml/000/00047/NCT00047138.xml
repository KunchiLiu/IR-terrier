	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Giving combination chemotherapy surgery may shrink tumor remove surgery . Giving chemotherapy surgery may kill remain tumor cell . It yet know chemotherapy regimen surgery effective treating Wilm 's tumor . PURPOSE : Phase III trial study effectiveness chemotherapy surgery treat child Wilm 's tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine response rate child Wilms ' tumor treat pre-operative chemotherapy . - Compare response rate child intermediate-risk stage II III Wilms ' tumor treat without doxorubicin surgery . - Determine prognostic significance histological subtypes patient pre-operative chemotherapy . - Determine whether reduced treatment minimizes acute late toxicity without jeopardize event-free overall survival patient focal anaplasia intermediate-risk stage I Wilms ' tumor . - Determine prognostic significance tumor volume specimen weight pre-operative chemotherapy relation histological subtype patient . - Determine effect single-dose dactinomycin pre-operative chemotherapy patient . - Correlate allele loss 16q , 1p , chromosomal region relapse-free overall survival patient treat regimen . - Correlate allele loss clinical risk factor ( e.g. , histological appearance tumor volume ) pre-operative chemotherapy patient . - Determine laboratory indicator myocardial damage patient treat regimen . - Determine prognostic significance percentage necrosis pre-operative chemotherapy , term type amount residual viable tumor , patient . OUTLINE : This partially randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord country participate center . Patients intermediate-risk stage II III disease stratify accord histology ( blastemal v epithelial v stromal v mixed ) . Patients localized disease receive neoadjuvant therapy comprise vincristine IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 dactinomycin IV day 1 15 . Patients undergo surgery week 5 6 . Patients low-risk stage I disease receive therapy . Adjuvant chemotherapy begin surgery within 21 day last dose neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Patients intermediate-risk stage I disease receive vincristine IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 dactinomycin IV day 7 . Patients intermediate-risk stage II III disease randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive vincristine IV weekly 8 week day 1 7 week 11 , 14 , 17 , 20 , 23 , 26 . Patients also receive dactinomycin IV weekly week 2 , 5 , 8 , 11 , 14 , 17 , 20 , 23 , 26 doxorubicin IV 4-6 hour weekly week 2 , 8 , 14 , 20 , 26 . - Arm II : Patients receive vincristine dactinomycin arm I . Patients high-risk stage I disease receive chemotherapy arm I . Patients low-risk stage II disease receive chemotherapy arm II . Patients high-risk stage II III disease receive cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour day 1-3 doxorubicin IV 4-6 hour day 1 week 1 , 7 , 13 , 19 , 25 , 31 . Patients also receive etoposide IV 4 hour carboplatin IV 1 hour day 1-3 week 4 , 10 , 16 , 22 , 28 , 34 . Patients intermediate-risk stage III high-risk stage II III disease also undergo radiotherapy approximately 3 week chemotherapy . Patients metastatic disease receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy comprise vincristine IV day 1 week 1-6 , dactinomycin IV day 1 week 1 , 3 , 5 , doxorubicin IV 4-6 hour day 1 week 1 5 . Patients undergo surgery week 7 . Within 2 week surgery patient receive 1 follow adjuvant chemotherapy regimen : - Regimen A ( metastases completely resect ) : Patients receive vincristine IV weekly 8 week week 11 , 12 , 14 , 15 , 17 , 18 , 20 , 21 , 23 , 24 , 26 , 27 . Patients also receive dactinomycin IV day 1 week 2 , 5 , 8 , 11 , 14 , 17 , 20 , 23 , 26 doxorubicin IV 4-6 hour week 2 , 8 , 14 , 20 . Some patient also undergo radiotherapy concurrently chemotherapy approximately 3 week . - Regimen B ( multiple inoperable metastasis , incomplete resection , high-risk primary disease ) : Patients receive etoposide IV 4 hour carboplatin IV 1 hour day 1-3 week 4 , 10 , 13 , 16 , 22 , 25 , 28 , 34 . Patients also receive cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour day 1-3 doxorubicin IV 4-6 hour day 1 week 1 , 7 , 19 , 31 . Some patient also undergo radiotherapy concurrently chemotherapy approximately 3 week . Patients follow every 2-3 month 2 year , every 3-6 month 1-2 year , every 6-12 month thereafter . Peer Reviewed Funded Endorsed Cancer Research UK PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 350 patient ( 174 per treatment arm ) accrue randomize portion study within 7 year .</detailed_description>
