	<brief_summary>This study use transcranial magnetic stimulation , TMS ( describe ) , examine brain control muscle movement prevent unwanted movement surround muscle . For example , person move finger , part brain call cortex prevents unwanted movement finger process call cortical inhibition . In people muscle disorder dystonia , cortical inhibition work properly patient suffer uncontrolled sometimes painful movement . A good understanding process work normal people may shed light go wrong dystonia condition treat . Healthy normal volunteer 19 year age old may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical neurological examination . People current medical surgical condition neurological psychiatric illness may participate , may individual take medication may influence nervous system function . Participants undergo TMS record electrical activity muscle hand arm activate magnetic stimulation . For procedure , subject seat chair hand place pillow lap . A wire coil place scalp . A brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . Subjects ask move second finger response loud beep visual cue . In trial , brief , mild electrical shock also apply end either second fifth finger . The shock painful . TMS may cause muscle , hand arm twitching coil near part brain control movement , may induce twitch temporary tingle forearm , head , face muscle . The twitching may cause mild discomfort , procedure rarely consider painful .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate effect homotopic heterotopic sensory afferent input surround inhibition motor cortex . Surround inhibition cortical phenomenon , function may suppress unwanted movement surround muscle voluntary action . In support , recent study show motor output little finger reduce self-paced , voluntary movement index finger , despite increase spinal excitability . Work also show relaxed muscle , homotopic heterotopic peripheral stimulation result time dependent modulation motor cortical excitability . However , study examine relationship volitional movement afferent sensory input cortical surround inhibition . Therefore , aim study examine change surround inhibition electrical stimulation apply either finger actively move ( homotopic stimulation ) separate finger involve movement ( heterotopic stimulation ) different time period prior initiation movement assess affect stimulus surround inhibition excitation motor cortex .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Twenty healthy volunteer older age 18 recruit study . Their gender , age , ethnic origin provide bias inclusion study . All subject sign inform consent prior participation trial . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Exclusion criterion trial include current medical surgical condition neurological psychiatric illness . Furthermore , individual medication potential influence nervous system function , pacemaker , implant medical pump , metal plate metal object skull eye ( example , brain surgery ) , history seizure disorder exclude trial .</criteria>
