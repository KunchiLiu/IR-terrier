	<brief_title>Stop Atherosclerosis Native Diabetics Study ( SANDS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Although protect cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , American Indians incidence rate higher general US population . The majority CVD case occur individual diabetes . It therefore imperative intervention strategy reduce CVD diabetic individual develop validated population . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The randomized three year trial examines effect cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) intensive LDL reduction ( goal less equal to75 mg/dL ) intensive blood pressure lower ( goal less equal 115/75 mmHg ) , compare usual target le equal 100 mg/dL less equal 130/85 mmHg . These cutpoints choose mean LDL blood pressure level low population , strong relation LDL , blood pressure , CVD level current target . The primary endpoint carotid intimal-medial thickness . Secondary endpoint include cardiac function measure echocardiography , lipoprotein , albuminuria , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) . The study enroll 488 diabetic American Indian men woman 40 year age conduct four field center involve Indian Health/Tribal primary care facility Phoenix/Sacaton , Arizona ; Chinle , Arizona ; Rapid City/Pine Ridge , South Dakota ; Lawton , Oklahoma , input American Indian physician community member . Study result provide evidence need develop community-based program treat prevent epidemic CVD among American Indians . The data also valuable understanding effect intensive risk-factor reduction atherosclerosis burden cardiac function diabetic individual US population provide evidence determine LDL blood pressure treatment goal diabetic patient .</detailed_description>
