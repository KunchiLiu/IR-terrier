	<brief_title>E7389 Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) E7389 administer IV bolus 1-2 minute weekly 3 week . II . To describe toxicity E7389 . III . To evaluate pharmacokinetics E7389 . IV . To determine vivo anti-mitotic activity E7389 cell cycle analysis immunohistochemistry pre- post-treatment tumor biopsy . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients receive E7389 IV 1-2 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 4 week least 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos E7389 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose 1 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity .</detailed_description>
