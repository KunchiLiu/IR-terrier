	<brief_title>Sorafenib Treating Patients With Recurrent Progressive Malignant Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) BAY 43-9006 administer adult recurrent malignant glioma , receive ( Group A ) receiving ( Group B ) anticonvulsant know metabolized P450 hepatic enzyme complex . II . To assess estimate dose-related toxicity . III . To describe pharmacokinetics route administration , measure BAY 43-9006 , assess pharmacokinetic difference patient take enzyme-inducing agent . IV . To estimate overall survival . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord concurrent use cytochrome P450-inducing anticonvulsant ( yes v ) . Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily day 1-28 ( daily day 1 course 1 ) . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient per stratum receive escalate dos sorafenib maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 3 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Patients follow every 2 month .</detailed_description>
