	<brief_summary>The purpose study - find effect treat patient two new chemotherapy drug ( bortezomib Revlimid™ ) , - study many patient ' myeloma respond treatment study , many patient survive treatment , - learn patient 's genetic makeup treatment predict patient respond bortezomib Revlimid™ , learn body responds ( gene array study ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Bortezomib Revlimid™ Patients Relapsing Progressing Total Therapy II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two new drug BORTEZOMIB ( Velcade® , PS-341 ) REVLIMID ( CC-5013 ) show recent study effective patient advance multiple myeloma . This study do learn best way administer drug , either alone combination . Since known time treatment best , participant place chance one three treatment group : - BORTEZOMIB alone - BORTEZOMIB + REVLIMID - BORTEZOMIB low dose + REVLIMID . This chance selection process call randomization often use research study .</detailed_description>
