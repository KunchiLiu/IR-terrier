	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Bortezomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes necessary growth . Monoclonal antibody rituximab locate cancer cell either kill deliver tumor-killing substance without harm normal cell . Giving bortezomib together rituximab may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study well give bortezomib together rituximab work treat patient relapsed refractory non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib Rituximab Treating Patients With Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine response rate ( complete response [ CR ] , CR-unconfirmed [ CRu ] , partial response [ PR ] ) patient relapse refractory indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma treat bortezomib rituximab . Secondary - Determine response rate ( CR , CRu , PR ) first disease response evaluation patient treat regimen . - Determine overall CR rate ( CR CRu ) patient treat regimen . - Determine time progression patient treat regimen . - Determine duration response patient treat regimen . - Determine time best response patient treat regimen . - Determine safety tolerability regimen patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord participate center , Karnofsky performance status ( &lt; 70 % v ≥ 70 % ) , lactic dehydrogenase level ( normal v &gt; upper limit normal ) , age ( 18 60 year vs &gt; 60 year ) , lymphoma subtype ( follicular v marginal zone ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive bortezomib IV 3-5 second day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Patients also receive rituximab IV day 1 , 8 , 15 course 1 day 1 course 2 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 5 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive bortezomib IV 3-5 second day 1 , 8 , 15 22 . Patients also receive rituximab IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 course 1 . Treatment repeat every 35 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients either arm may crossover arm treatment find ineffective . Patients follow 30 day every 12 week thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 24-66 patient ( 12-33 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 1 year .</detailed_description>
