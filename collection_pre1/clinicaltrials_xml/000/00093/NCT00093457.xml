	<brief_title>Sorafenib Treating Patients With Metastatic Recurrent Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine efficacy sorafenib , measure prostate-specific antigen response , patient metastatic recurrent hormone-refractory adenocarcinoma prostate . Secondary - Determine objective response rate duration response patient treated drug . - Determine tolerability toxicity drug patient . - Determine time treatment failure overall survival patient treated drug . - Explore relationship measure ras/raf pathway activation ( pERK ) response treatment patient . OUTLINE : This non-randomized , multicenter study . Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 4 week go study treatment periodically survival . Patients stable respond disease , go study treatment , follow every 3 month relapse progression . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 15-25 patient accrue study within 12-18 month .</detailed_description>
