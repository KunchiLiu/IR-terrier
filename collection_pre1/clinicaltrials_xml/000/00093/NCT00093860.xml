	<brief_summary>This study examine effectiveness drug propranolol prevent faint patient sympathoadrenal imbalance ( SAI ) . SAI particular pattern nervous system chemical response blood vessel skeletal muscle remain constricted appropriately stand long time . This low blood pressure cause fainting . Propranolol ( InderalÂ® ( Registered Trademark ) ) Food Drug Administration-approved drug belongs class drug call beta-blockers . These drug slow heart rate maintain blood pressure certain situation . Children 10 17 year age frequent faint near-fainting due SAI may eligible study . Children must experience severe dizzy episode least every 2 month faint episode least every 4 month . The condition must severe enough affect child 's quality life force child alter life routine accommodate illness . Screening include tilt table test , describe , determine child particular chemical pattern blood . Children enrol study take propranolol pill increase dos first week study determine proper dose individual . Then , drug stop experimental phase study begin . In phase , child randomly assign take either propranolol placebo ( look-alike pill active ingredient ) maximum 3 day . On fourth day , child undergoes tilt table test determine whether treatment affect ability tolerate tilt . For test , child lie pad table motorized tilt mechanism move child flat position upright position 10 second . The child remain upright 40 minute follow measurement take : - Blood sampling : Blood drawn catheter ( thin plastic tube ) place arm vein . This allow repeat sample without repeat needle stick . Samples collect start tilt test , every 4 minute test , immediately drop blood pressure detect symptom develop , 10 minute recovery lie flat . A maximum 12 sample collect tilt test . - Physiologic measurement : Blood pressure , heart rate , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) measure continuously tilt test session , blood flow skin electrical conduction measure intermittently . Blood flow measure use sensor apply skin blood pressure cuff around limb . For skin blood flow measurement , laser beam scan skin surface . The skin electrical conduction test measure well skin conduct electricity . This measured sensor place tip two finger . Respiration breathe rate monitor elastic cloth band around chest . - Self-report questionnaire : Patients parent complete questionnaire child 's symptoms treatment . The effect test drug allow wear 1 week , entire tilt test procedure repeat . Patients give propranolol first test session take placebo repeat session , give placebo take propranolol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Propranolol Treat Fainting Children With Sympathoadrenal Imbalance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : This protocol evaluate treatment oral propranolol particular form neurocardiogenic syncope ( NCS ) , characterize neuroendocrine pattern call `` sympathoadrenal imbalance '' ( SAI ) , child . In SAI , plasma adrenaline level increase progressively great extent norepinephrine level , syncope . The SAI pattern associate skeletal muscle vasodilation . We hypothesize increased occupation beta-2 adrenoceptors skeletal muscle high circulate adrenaline level precipitate neurocirculatory positive feedback loop lead NCS . Study Population : Patients 10-17 year old history NCS . Design : In randomize , crossover-design , placebo-controlled , double-blind trial , test hypothesis use non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocker , propranolol . We predict patient previously document SAI tilt-evoked NCS , propranolol treatment improve orthostatic tolerance follow-up tilt table testing . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome measure whether propranolol therapy prevent tilt induce syncope ; significant hypotension and/or bradycardia preceding development clinical symptom ( great equal 20 mm Hg decrease blood pressure heart rate le 40 beats/min ) . Secondary dependent measure assess occurrence duration tilt tolerance ( tilt induce symptom provoke ) , hemodynamic neurochemical index SAI , patient questionnaire report .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects patient referred evaluation chronic orthostatic intolerance . Patients enter therapeutic trial determine NCS SAI screen evaluation . Participation protocol offer individual 1017 year age , independently gender , race , ethnicity , religion , demographic sociopolitical classification . To eligible enter study , patient must minimum frequency presyncope least 1 event/2 month , syncope least once/4 month . The severity symptoms severity alter individual 's quality life routine life . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Age : Minors younger 10 year old pregnant female subject 10 17 year age exclude . Risk : A candidate subject exclude , judgment Principal Investigator , protocol participation would place subject substantially increase acute medical risk . This include risk associate air travel NIH . A candidate subject exclude , opinion Principal Investigator , medical risk outweigh potential scientific benefit . Disqualifying Conditions : A candidate subject exclude disqualify condition . Examples disqualify condition history asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease require bronchodilator , hepatic renal failure , atrioventricular block degree , bradycardia , symptomatic congestive heart failure , severe anemia , psychosis , refractory ventricular arrhythmia , insulindependent diabetes mellitus , psychiatric disorder require continuous drug treatment . Patients know allergy hypersensitivity propranolol exclude study . A positive HIV test result necessarily exclude patient participate . If female subject becomes pregnant study , exclude participation study . Medications : A candidate subject exclude clinical consideration require patient continue treatment drug likely interfere scientific result . Patients must take medication daily follow category exclude : anticoagulant , tricyclic antidepressant , barbiturate , aspirin , acetaminophen , insulin , bronchodilator . Patients discontinue medication patient patient 's doctor discuss Principal Investigator , Associated Investigator , Research Nurse . If decided discontinuing medication would unsafe , patient exclude study . Herbal Medicines Dietary Supplements : Certain herbal medicine dietary supplement know suspect interfere experimental result , herbal medicine dietary supplement must discontinue enrollment study . For many herbal medicine dietary supplement , mechanism action therefore possible effect experimental result unknown . In case subject wish continue herbal medicine dietary supplement study , search available medical literature fail identify effect know expect interfere experimental result , subject may participate . Practical Limitations : Patients feel would difficult technically carry test procedure exclude . Pregnancy : Pregnant lactating female childbearing potential exclude . A blood test pregnancy conduct female childbearing potential , intake evaluation also drug treatment phase . During course protocol , patient childbearing potential advised practice adequate contraception ( birth control pill , DepoProvera , implant intrauterine device ) , sexually active . If course study , minor patient find positive pregnancy test , ask confidentially whether recent sexual activity could result test positive . In agreement current legal statute , minor patient tell confidentially pregnant . She encourage share information parent . By current legal statute , directly divulge information parent . The pregnant minor subject also tell participation study protocol violation ( possible adverse risk unborn fetus ) , terminate continued participation protocol .</criteria>
