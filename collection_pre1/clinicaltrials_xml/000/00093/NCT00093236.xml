	<detailed_description>Epidemiological study indicate individual severe periodontal disease significantly increase risk cardiovascular disease . Periodontal disease , chronic bacterial infection gum , associate recurrent bacteremia state systemic inflammation may convert endothelial cell pro-atherogenic phenotype increase expression inflammatory factor loss anti-thrombotic , growth inhibitory , vasodilator property endothelium , include decrease biological activity nitric oxide . In human subject , endothelial dysfunction evolve well-accepted indicator early atherosclerosis predictor increase cardiovascular disease risk . We recently demonstrate strong association severe periodontal disease endothelial vasomotor dysfunction case control study otherwise healthy human subject . In study , periodontal disease also associate high plasma level acute phase reactant C-reactive protein ( CRP ) . These result support hypothesis severe periodontal disease induces state systemic inflammation impairs endothelial function , however , cross-sectional design leave open possibility confound factor explain result . We propose determine whether effective treatment periodontal disease improve endothelial function ( Aim 1 ) reduces inflammation ( Aim 2 ) randomize intervention study . Patients receive comprehensive periodontal treatment design produce state periodontal health ( scale root plan periodontal surgery re-treatment need ) routine oral hygiene follow 24 week . The study examine endothelium-dependent brachial artery flow-mediated dilation , systemic marker inflammation endothelial activation ( CRP , IL-6 , myeloperoxidase , ICAM-1 ) , oral marker periodontitis ( PGE2 , myeloperoxidase , pathogen DNA ) treatment . Compared oral hygiene ( stabilize , reverse periodontal disease ) , hypothesize comprehensive treatment periodontal disease improve endothelium-dependent dilation reduce local systemic inflammation . Further , suggest degree improvement endothelial function relate degree reduction specific marker inflammation . Such result would provide much strong evidence causal link periodontal disease , systemic inflammation , endothelial dysfunction , recognize surrogate cardiovascular risk . The proposed study provide new insight periodontal disease contribute cardiovascular disease risk human subject may lead new approach therapy .</detailed_description>
