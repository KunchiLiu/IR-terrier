	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide , paclitaxel , gemcitabine work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Giving combination chemotherapy surgery may kill remain tumor cell . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study three different combination chemotherapy regimens compare well work treat woman undergone surgery node-positive breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Treating Women Who Have Undergone Surgery Node-Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare disease-free survival woman node-positive breast cancer treat 3 different adjuvant chemotherapy regimens comprise dose-dense doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide , paclitaxel , gemcitabine v docetaxel , doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide v dose-dense doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide , paclitaxel . Secondary - Compare overall survival , recurrence-free interval , distant recurrence-free interval , patient treat regimen . - Compare toxic effect regimens patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord number positive lymph node ( 1-3 v 4-9 v ≥ 10 ) , hormone receptor status ( estrogen receptor [ ER ] - progesterone receptor [ PgR ] - negative vs ER- and/or PgR-positive ) , type prior surgery plan radiotherapy ( lumpectomy local radiotherapy [ RT ] without regional RT v lumpectomy local RT regional RT v mastectomy without RT v mastectomy local regional RT ) . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . - Group 1 : Patients receive doxorubicin IV 15 minute , cyclophosphamide IV 30 minute , docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course . - Group 2 : Patients receive AC chemotherapy comprise doxorubicin IV 15 minute cyclophosphamide IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 4 course . Beginning 14 day last dose AC , patient receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 4 course . - Group 3 : Patients receive AC chemotherapy Group 2 . Beginning 14 day last dose AC , patient receive paclitaxel Group 2 gemcitabine IV 30-60 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 4 course . In arm , treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning 3-12 week last dose chemotherapy , patient ER-positive and/or PgR-positive tumor receive hormonal therapy . Beginning sooner 3 week last dose chemotherapy , patient treat lumpectomy undergo whole-breast radiotherapy . Patients treat mastectomy may undergo chest wall and/or regional nodal radiotherapy . Patients follow every 6 month 5 year annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 4,800 patient accrue study within 4 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient must consent participate study must sign approve consent form conform federal institutional guideline . The patient must life expectancy least 10 year Zubrod performance status 0 1 . ( Comorbid condition diagnosis breast cancer take consideration determine life expectancy . ) The interval last surgery breast cancer stag treatment randomization must 84 day . The tumor must invasive carcinoma breast histologic examination . All follow stag criterion must meet : By clinical pathologic evaluation , primary tumor must T13 ; By clinical evaluation , ipsilateral node must cN0 , cN1 , cN2a ; By pathologic evaluation , ipsilateral node must pN1 ( pN1mi , pN1a , pN1b , pN1c ) , pN2a , pN3a , pN3b ( due microscopic involvement internal mammary node detect sentinel lymph node dissection 3 positive axillary lymph node ) . Patients must estrogen receptor ( ER ) analysis perform primary tumor prior randomization . If ER analysis negative , progesterone receptor ( PgR ) analysis must perform . If ER analysis positive , PgR analysis desire , mandatory . ( `` Marginal '' `` borderline '' result [ i.e. , definitely negative ] consider positive regardless methodology use . ) Patients must either lumpectomy total mastectomy . Patients must complete one follow procedure evaluation pathologic nodal status . Sentinel lymphadenectomy follow removal additional nonsentinel lymph node ( This approach strongly recommend . ) Sentinel lymphadenectomy alone one follow criterion meet : Pathologic nodal stag base sentinel lymphadenectomy pN1mi pN1b Surgeon elect remove additional nonsentinel node ( This approach strongly discourage , preclude participation B38 . ) Axillary lymphadenectomy without sentinel node isolation procedure . Patients must clinical radiologic evidence metastatic disease . Patients either skeletal pain alkaline phosphatase great ULN less equal 2.5 x ULN eligible inclusion study bone scan fail demonstrate metastatic disease . Suspicious finding bone scan must confirm benign xray , MRI , biopsy . Patients aspartate transaminase ( AST ) alkaline phosphatase great ULN eligible inclusion study liver image fails demonstrate metastatic disease follow requirement meet time randomization . Postoperative absolute granulocyte count ( AGC ) must great equal 1200/mm3 . Postoperative platelet count must great equal 100,000/mm3 . The following criterion postoperative evidence adequate hepatic function must meet : total bilirubin must less equal ULN lab unless patient grade 1 bilirubin elevation ( great ULN 1.5 x ULN ) due Gilbert 's disease similar syndrome due slow conjugation bilirubin ; alkaline phosphatase must less equal 2.5 x ULN lab ; AST must less equal 1.5 x ULN lab ; alkaline phosphatase AST great ULN . Postoperative serum creatinine must less equal ULN . At time randomization , patient must follow : history physical exam , EKG , image chest within past 3 month bilateral mammogram within past 6 month .

Nonmalignant systemic disease ( cardiovascular , renal , hepatic , etc . ) would preclude patient receive treatment option would prevent prolonged followup . History hepatitis B C. Pregnancy lactation time propose randomization . Women reproductive potential must agree use effective nonhormonal method contraception . Concurrent treatment investigational agent treatment breast cancer . Psychiatric addictive disorder condition , opinion investigator , would preclude patient meeting study requirement . Special condition ineligibility lumpectomy patient : radiation therapy surgery For patient treated lumpectomy , whole breast irradiation require .
