	<brief_title>S0432 Tipifarnib Treating Older Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To test whether four different regimen R115777 ( tipifarnib ) sufficiently effective therapy previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) patient age 70 old warrant Phase III investigation . Additionally , allow increased access patient agent appear promising patient population . II . To estimate frequency severity toxicity regimens group patient . III . To investigate preliminary manner relationship cytogenetics response R115777 ( tipifarnib ) ass whether karyotype represent potential prognostic factor among old AML patient candidate chemotherapy treat R1157777 . IV . To collect specimens future correlation ( e.g . RAS downstream target ) identify later date . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 4 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily day 1-21 . ARM II : Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily day 1-7 15-21 . ARM III : Patients receive tipifarnib arm I , low dose . ARM IV : Patients receive tipifarnib arm II , low dose . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Patients achieve complete remission ( CR ) receive 3 additional course beyond CR . Patients CR develop recurrent disease completion therapy eligible receive tipifarnib . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year , annually 3 year .</detailed_description>
