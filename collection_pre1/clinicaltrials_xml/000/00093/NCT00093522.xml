	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines make person 's tumor cell white blood cell may make body build immune response kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , fludarabine , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining vaccine therapy fludarabine may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study vaccine therapy fludarabine see well work compare vaccine therapy alone treat patient stage IV kidney cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy With Without Fludarabine Treating Patients With Stage IV Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare safety vaccination comprise autologous dendritic cell load autologous tumor lysate keyhole limpet hemocyanin v without non-myeloablative fludarabine patient stage IV renal cell carcinoma . - Compare , preliminarily , efficacy regimens patient . - Compare overall survival patient treat regimen . Secondary - Determine whether vaccine induces tumor-reactive peripheral T-cell response delayed-type hypersensitivity patient . OUTLINE : This pilot , randomize study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . All patient undergo surgery remove tumor metastatic site generate autologous tumor lysate . Patients undergo leukapheresis obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cell generation dendritic cell ( DC ) . The DC expose autologous tumor lysate keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( KLH ) . - Arm I : Three week leukapheresis , patient receive vaccination comprise DC load autologous tumor lysate KLH ( DC vaccine ) intradermally every 14 day total 4 injection absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Two week leukapheresis , patient receive fludarabine IV 15-30 minute daily 3 day . Beginning approximately 5 week leukapheresis , patient also receive DC vaccine arm I . Patients follow 1 , 3 , 7-9 week , 4 , 6 , 9 , 12 month , every 6 month 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 28 patient ( 14 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 2-3 year .</detailed_description>
