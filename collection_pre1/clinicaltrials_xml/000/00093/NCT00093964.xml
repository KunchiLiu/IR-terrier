	<brief_title>Cilengitide ( EMD 121974 ) Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme ( Brain Tumor )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Angiogenesis ( growth new blood vessel ) important tumor growth . Cilengitide ( EMD 121974 ) inhibits two receptor protein ( protein cell surface ) , call integrins αvβ3 αvβ5 , appear important process angiogenesis . Cilengitide show inhibit angiogenesis growth several different experimental tumor animal . Some tumor express integrin αvβ3 use survival factor ( e.g . glioblastoma multiforme ) , cilengitide might target endothelial cell ( cell blood vessel ) tumor trigger tumor cell apoptosis ( program cell death ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Written inform consent obtain undergoing studyrelated activity . Males females 18 year age older treat outpatient setting . Histologically proven GBM , recurrent progressive follow surgery biopsy , external beam radiation therapy , 1 previous regimen systemic chemotherapy ( Gliadel wafer therapy consider systemic chemotherapy ) . Malignancy document previous histopathological report . Subjects initially diagnose condition similar GBM ( anaplastic astrocytoma [ AA ] low grade glioma ) subsequently progress histologically proven GBM surgery biopsy , external beam radiation therapy , 1 previous regimen systemic chemotherapy original diagnosis eligible meet inclusion criterion . GBM recur contralateral hemisphere must histologically confirm biopsy . GBM recur bilaterally need histologically confirm biopsy ( i.e. , recurrence ipsilateral contralateral ) . Archived tumor tissue specimens GBM surgery biopsy must available central pathology review exploratory analysis angiogenic marker ( e.g . avb3 avb5 integrins ) . Measurable disease ( solid contrastenhancing lesion ~1 cm dimension ) evaluate Gd MRI within 2 week prior first dose EMD 121974 . At least 12 week elapse since last radiation treatment , least 4 week elapse since last chemotherapy dose ( least 6 week nitrosoureacontaining chemotherapy ) prior first dose EMD 121974 . If subject underwent recent surgery , status must ~2 week post surgery ~1 week post biopsy , stable condition , maintain stable corticosteroid regimen ~5 day prior first dose EMD 121974 . Karnofsky Performance Score ( KPS ) ≥ 70 % . Subjects potential pregnancy impregnate partner must agree follow acceptable method birth control avoid conception study least 6 month receive last dose study drug . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test screening . Laboratory value ( within 1 week prior first dose EMD 121974 , except blood count PT/PTT , within 72 hour first dose ) : * Absolute neutrophil count ≥1500/mm 3 . * Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm 3 . * Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min . * Hematocrit ≥ 30 % . * Prothrombin time ( PT ) partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) within normal limit . * Hemoglobin ≥ 10 mg/dL . * Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 time upper limit normal . * Aspartate aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase ≤ 2.5 time upper limit normal . No 8 week elapse since recurrence detect Prior radiation therapy &gt; 66 Gray . Subject anticipate undergo elective surgery , dental extraction , invasive dental procedure . History recent peptic ulcer disease ( endoscopically proven gastric ulcer , duodenal ulcer , esophageal ulcer ) within 6 month enrollment . History prior malignancy . Subjects curatively treated cervical carcinoma situ basal cell carcinoma skin , subject free malignancy ≥5 year eligible study . History coagulation disorder associate bleed recurrent thrombotic event . Concurrent illness , include severe infection , may jeopardize ability subject receive procedure outline protocol reasonable safety .
