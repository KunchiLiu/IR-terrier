	<brief_title>BMS-599626 Treating Patients With Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine maximum tolerate dose , biologically active dose , recommend phase II dose ( ) BMS-599626 patient metastatic HER2/neu-overexpressing primary solid tumor . Secondary - Determine safety tolerability drug patient . - Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . - Determine effect drug biomarkers predictive marker HER1 HER2 skin tumor patient . - Evaluate tumor metabolic activity response drug patient . - Determine , preliminarily , evidence anti-tumor activity drug patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients receive oral BMS-599626 daily day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos BMS-599626 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Once MTD determine , 20 patient treat dose level . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 3-60 patient accrue study within 1 year .</detailed_description>
