	<brief_title>Sorafenib Treating Patients With Persistent Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine efficacy sorafenib patient persistent recurrent ovarian epithelial primary peritoneal carcinoma . II . Determine 6-month progression-free survival patient treated drug . III . Determine toxicity drug , term frequency severity adverse event encounter , patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine clinical response rate ( partial complete response ) patient treat drug . II . Determine duration progression-free overall survival patient treated drug . III . Correlate prognostic variable ( platinum sensitivity , performance status , histology [ clear cell mucinous type ] ) response patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 22-60 patient accrue study within 6-13 month .</detailed_description>
