	<brief_summary>The purpose study establish efficacy clevidipine versus placebo treat postoperative hypertension . Approximately 100 patient postoperative hypertension undergo coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) , off-pump coronary artery bypass ( OPCAB ) minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass ( MIDCAB ) surgery and/or valve replacement/repair procedure anticipate randomly assign one two treatment group : clevidipine placebo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective determine efficacy clevidipine versus placebo treat postoperative hypertension compare incidence bailout clevidipine placebo treatment group 30-minute time period initiation study drug . Secondary objective include assessment efficacy measure time target blood pressure ( BP ) lower effect define 15 % reduction SBP , change mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) incidence bailout causality . Assessments safety include change heart rate ( HR ) baseline .</detailed_description>
