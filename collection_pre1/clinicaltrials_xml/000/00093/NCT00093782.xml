	<brief_title>Temsirolimus Treating Patients With Metastatic Neuroendocrine Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To assess objective tumor response rate ( i.e . partial complete response define RECIST criterion ) patient progressive metastatic neuroendocrine tumour give CCI-779 . II . To assess stable disease rate duration , time progression , median survival time , 1-year survival rate toxicity patient metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma give CCI-779 . As 19 July 2010 , overall survival follow-up discontinue four remain patient long term follow-up . At point time , patient off-treatment 3 5 year . Time progression median survival time base currently available data . III . To measure baseline level various element up- downstream mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) . Where post-treatment biopsy available , analyzed suppression element mTOR pathway well effect cell cycle progression , apoptosis anti-angiogenic effect . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive CCI-779 IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) receive 2 additional course beyond CR PR . Patients follow survival .</detailed_description>
