	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Hyperthermia therapy kill tumor cell heat several degree body temperature . Using MRI measure heat may help determine effectiveness hyperthermia therapy . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , ifosfamide doxorubicin , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining hyperthermia radiation therapy chemotherapy surgery may kill tumor cell shrink tumor remove . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect hyperthermia give together radiation therapy optional chemotherapy see well work treat patient undergo surgery soft tissue sarcoma limb .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine feasibility accuracy real time magnetic resonance-based non-invasive thermometry patient grade 2 3 soft tissue sarcoma extremity receive combination hyperthermia , radiotherapy , surgery , optional high-dose ifosfamide doxorubicin . Secondary - Determine local control , disease-free survival , overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine acute late toxic effect regimen patient . - Correlate measurement tumor physiology , define gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging , magnetic resonance spectroscopy , tumor oxygenation , clinical and/or pathological response and/or metastatic potential patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : Patients may receive high-dose ifosfamide IV continuously 6 day ( 144 hour ) . Beginning 3 week completion ifosfamide , patient undergo radiotherapy daily , 5 day week , 5 week . Beginning 1 hour radiotherapy , patient also undergo hyperthermia ( heat measure conventional magnetic resonance-based thermometry ) 1-2 hour weekly 5 week . Approximately 4 week completion radiotherapy hyperthermia , patient undergo surgery . Approximately 1 month surgery , patient may receive high-dose doxorubicin IV every 4 week 4 course . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 10-30 patient accrue study within 2-6 year .</detailed_description>
