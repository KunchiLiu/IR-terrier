	<brief_summary>An experimental treatment OvaRex® MAb-B43.13 ( oregovomab ) , call immunotherapy test ovarian cancer patient . Immunotherapy cause body 's defense react cancer cell . The purpose research study determine immunotherapy oregovomab create immune response enable body fight disease help ovarian cancer patient live longer . Patients possible diagnosis ovarian cancer screen study participation pre-surgery , eligible , receive oregovomab front-line chemotherapy treatment ovarian cancer quarterly year follow chemotherapy . Patients experience disease progression discontinue oregovomab therapy . Patients also urine , blood tissue sample collect assess immune response oregovomab .</brief_summary>
