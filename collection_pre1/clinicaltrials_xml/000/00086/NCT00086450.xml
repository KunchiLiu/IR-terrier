	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The study address critically important problem best revascularize diabetic individual multivessel CAD . CAD diabetes diagnosis increase alarm rate , much information regard optimal revascularization come Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation ( BARI ) study . After five year , data BARI study show 15 excess death every 100 diabetic participant revascularized percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) compare CABG , 7 year 20 death . These finding provide compel evidence physician conclude diabetic patient multivessel disease need revascularization best handle CABG . But consensus yet reach finding uniformly confirm registry study . With recent introduction coat stent significantly reduce eliminate restenosis , prevail belief adequate revascularization achieve PCI even diabetic individual . New development percutaneous technique translate improve prognosis offset advantage CABG see BARI study . Since new drug elute stent yet approve likely market several year , small window time exist gather evidence support strategy provide optimal revascularization diabetic individual . DESIGN NARRATIVE : FREEDOM ( Future Revascularization Evaluation Patients Diabetes Mellitus : Optimal Management Multivessel Disease ) multicenter , two-arm , open label , prospective , randomized superiority trial equal allocation , 5 year duration minimum 3 year follow-up . The main objective study evaluate whether PCI drug-eluting stenting ( PCI/DES ) less effective exist standard care , CABG . The study population consist 2,400 adult diabetes mellitus ( Type 1 Type 2 ) angiographically confirm multivessel CAD morphology amenable either PCI CABG , indication revascularization base upon symptom angina and/or objective evidence myocardial ischemia . Patients consent randomize 1:1 basis either CABG multivessel stenting use drug-eluting stent , follow 30 day , 1 year , annually least 3 year , 5 year . A registry 2000 patient also recruit concurrently , comprise eligible non-consenting patient randomize trial . Eligible patient randomize receive either CABG multivessel stenting use drug-eluting stent . Patients randomize PCI/DES arm receive , discretion primary physician interventionalists , either CYPHER Sirolimus elute stent ( Cordis Corporation , Warren , NJ , USA ) TAXUS paclitaxel-eluting stent ( Boston Scientific Corporation , Natick , MA , USA ) . However , intend one type drug-eluting stent use give patient course trial . The primary outcome study composite all-cause mortality , nonfatal myocardial infarction , stroke end 5-year patient accrual follow-up period ( minimum follow-up 3 year ) . The main secondary endpoint assess 1-year major adverse cardiac cerebrovascular event ( MACCE ) rate , include first one following : death , myocardial infarction , stroke , repeat revascularization . Additional secondary endpoint include : all-cause cardiovascular mortality 1 , 2 , 3 year ; rate individual MACCE endpoint 30 day post-procedure ; quality life 30 day , 6 month , annually post-procedure ; long term cost cost-effectiveness .</detailed_description>
