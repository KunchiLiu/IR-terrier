	<brief_summary>The primary objective study : 1 . To evaluate whether addition amifostine allow safe administration idarubicin dose 21 mg/m² combination standard-dose ara-C old patient newly diagnose , previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) ; 2 . To estimate complete remission rate induction therapy amifostine , idarubicin ( 21 mg/m² ) , plus ara-C induction therapy idarubicin ( 12 mg/m² ) plus ara-C patient population .</brief_summary>
