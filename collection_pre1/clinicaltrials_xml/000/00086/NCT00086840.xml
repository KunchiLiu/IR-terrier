	<brief_title>CCI-779 Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine activity CCI-779 patient relapse , refractory , transform chronic lymphocytic leukemia . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord disease ( relapsed refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia [ CLL ] v transform CLL ) . Patients receive CCI-779 IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve objective response may receive 3 consolidation course therapy .</detailed_description>
