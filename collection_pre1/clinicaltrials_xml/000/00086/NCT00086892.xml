	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody cetuximab locate tumor cell either kill deliver tumor-killing substance without harm normal cell . Drugs use chemotherapy carboplatin work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining cetuximab carboplatin may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give cetuximab together carboplatin work treat patient recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer primary peritoneal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine antitumor activity cetuximab carboplatin patient recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian epithelial primary peritoneal cancer . - Determine nature degree toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive cetuximab IV 1 hour ( 2 hour day 1 course 1 ) day 1 , 8 , 15 . Patients also receive carboplatin IV cetuximab administration day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-65 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
