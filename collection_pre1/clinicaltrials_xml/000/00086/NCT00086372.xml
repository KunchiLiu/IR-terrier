	<brief_title>Long-term Follow-up HIV Infected Patients Identified During Early Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AIEDRP establish develop evaluate data study patient acute recent HIV infection . Long-term effect antiretroviral therapy raise question regard value necessity therapeutic intervention acute early HIV infection . Conventional randomize clinical trial generally design finite endpoint ; patient reach endpoint complete protocol longer follow . As result , long-term virologic , immunologic , clinical outcome data available . This particularly true participant fail therapy , require change treatment , develop treatment-limiting toxicity time-limited study . This database study establish cohort HIV infected individual participate HIV study AIEDRP sit HIV infected individual choose defer therapy agree follow study . The study facilitate longitudinal prospectively plan meta-analyses cross-protocol analysis AIEDRP study develop data collection guideline , define common research goal , create data template . The primary aim determine long-term virologic , immunologic , clinical outcome complication patient diagnose acute early HIV infection . Participants study follow least 5 year . Study visit occur Weeks 2 , 4 , 12 , every 12 week thereafter , Week 96 . After 2 year , study visit occur every 24 week end study . Participants start antiretroviral therapy Week 2 restart study visit schedule . Study visit include medical interview , adherence questionnaire , blood test .
