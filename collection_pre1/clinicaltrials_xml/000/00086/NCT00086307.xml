	<brief_summary>This study compare effectiveness combination antidepressant : Lexapro Pramipexole , effectiveness antidepressant alone . Purpose : Patients 18 65 year age Major Depressive Disorder without psychotic feature may eligible 9-week study . Candidates must currently major depressive episode least 4 week ' duration , fail respond treatment SSRI ( Prozac , Zoloft , Paxil , Luvox , Celexa ) , fail respond four antidepressant current episode . Candidates screen physical examination , psychiatric evaluation , blood test , review vital sign , height weight measurement , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , urine test illegal drug , pregnancy test woman . Participants taper antidepressant medication prohibit study remain drug-free 1 week start treatment . They randomly assign take pramipexole escitalopram , pramipexole alone , escitalopram alone 6 week . During study , participant come clinic eight time health assessment symptoms assessment , include check vital sign rating scale depression anxiety , adverse event , sexual functioning .

	<detailed_description>Despite availability wide range antidepressant drug , 30 % 40 % patient major depression fail respond first-line antidepressant ( e.g. , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [ SSRIs ] ) treatment , despite adequate dosage , duration , compliance . Furthermore , medication may take week month achieve full effect , meantime , patient continue suffer symptom continue risk self-harm well harm personal professional life . Thus , clear need develop novel improve therapeutic treatment-resistant major depression effective rapid onset action . Preclinical clinical study suggest antidepressant combine mechanism action ( e.g. , combination selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor ) may effective either agent alone achieve remission ( Nelson et al 2004 ) . Thus , stand reason combination antidepressant mechanisms action combine may synergistic effect superior antidepressant single mechanism action . Preclinical clinical study suggest dopaminergic system may play major role pathophysiology depression . Preclinical study suggest synergistic antidepressant effect combination SSRI selective D3 receptor agonist animal model depression . Similarly , preliminary clinical study suggest synergism combination treatment affect serotonin dopamine system . Together , data suggest treatment affect serotonin dopamine system effective agent use single mechanism . We propose compare combination selective dopaminergic agonist SSRI patient treatment-resistant major depression . To knowledge , control double-blind study date examine efficacy serotonin dopamine combination give start treatment . Patients , age 18 year old , diagnosis major depression ( without psychotic feature ) , randomize combination selective dopaminergic receptor agonist SSRI either drug alone period 6 week . Acute efficacy determine demonstrate great remission rate use specify criterion . Approximately 115 patient acute major depression enrol study .</detailed_description>
