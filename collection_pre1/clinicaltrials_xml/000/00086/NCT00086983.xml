	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose XL119 give conjunction oxaliplatin . II.To determine dose limit toxicity combination . III . To determine pharmacokinetics 2 agent give combination . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive rebeccamycin analogue IV 1 hour day 1-5 oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 5 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos rebeccamycin analogue oxaliplatin maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . At least 6 patient treated MTD . Patients follow annually survival .</detailed_description>
