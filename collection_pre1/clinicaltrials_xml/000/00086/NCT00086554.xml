	<brief_summary>This study collect tissue specimen use research inflammatory bowel disease . The tissue use explore people get inflammatory bowel disease try develop new treatment base study result . Tissue patient IBD compare patient disease Patients undergo bowel surgery inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) another bowel disorder may eligible study . Patients IBD must least 4 year age ; another disorder must 18 year age old . Participants undergo bowel surgery disease . Some intestinal tissue remove surgery need medical care , pathological examination , provide researcher study protocol . In addition , patient IBD provide blood sample genetic testing . Several genetic variation , mutation , may increase risk develop IBD ; blood sample patient may help identify variation .</brief_summary>
