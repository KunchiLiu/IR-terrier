	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Tissue plasminogen activator captopril may help body generate angiostatin . Angiostatin may stop growth cancer stop blood flow tumor . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose tissue plasminogen activator captopril see well work treat patient progressive metastatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>In Vivo Angiostatin Generation Using Tissue Plasminogen Activator Captopril Treating Patients With Progressive Metastatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine maximum tolerate dose toxicity captopril tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) patient progressive metastatic cancer . - Determine vivo generation angiostatin western analysis patient treat regimen . Secondary - Determine antitumor effect regimen patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) IV 6 hour oral captopril twice daily day 1-5 . Courses repeat every 14 day 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 2 additional course beyond CR . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos tPA captopril maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Not specify .</detailed_description>
