	<brief_summary>Pain management technique may influence brain process pain may help patient fibromyalgia ( FM ) , chronic pain condition . This study train patient FM use pain management technique . Investigators use brain scanning ( functional magnetic resonance imaging , fMRI ) technology identify change patient 's brain process pain time . This study primarily interested examine cortical response different behavioral intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>FM chronic pain condition cure , drug partially successful manage symptom . Many people FM utilize nondrug management method , exercise , symptom relief . Nondrug method quite effective , patient find difficult use method consistently . This study determine nondrug method relieve FM symptom examine patient ' brain exercise relaxation technique . Preliminary data indicate belief one 's personal ability control pain result use differential neural mechanism process pain . This study use fMRI , tool visualize pain-processing pattern , gain insight exercise relaxation technique modify pain processing patient FM . There four arm study . All participant FM randomly assign one three study arm . Participants Arm 1 receive relaxation training supplement standard care FM . Arm 2 participant prescribe exercise regimen supplement standard care . Participants Arm 3 receive standard care . Arm 4 healthy control group , follow 8-week intervention period . At baseline , participant undergo blood collection physical examination complete questionnaire demographic , treatment history , symptom , functional status , affective status , beliefs pain . They also undergo baseline fMRI image study , combine evoked pressure pain testing , evaluate difference neural mechanism involve pain processing . Patients Arms 1 2 attend one face-to-face training session therapist , follow phone contact next 8 week . Participants ask record pain adherence treatment electronic diary . After 8 week , study participant undergo second fMRI scan , blood collection , physical examination , complete questionnaire similar complete baseline .</detailed_description>
