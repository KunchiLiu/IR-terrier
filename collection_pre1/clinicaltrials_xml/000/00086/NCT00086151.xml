	<brief_title>Identifying Low-Risk Patients With Pulmonary Embolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Pulmonary embolism ( PE ) common , costly , potentially lethal disease US . While patient PE almost universally treated inpatient length hospital stay ( LOS ) vary widely , evidence outpatient care low-molecular-weight heparin early discharge hospitalize patient effective safe option 50 % patient PE . However , physician may reluctant treat patient PE outpatient basis brief hospitalization perceive risk mortality experience short-term adverse outcome well quantified . The study develop clinical prediction rule identify patient acute pulmonary embolism low risk short-term adverse outcome . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The retrospective cohort study develop clinical prediction rule accurately identify low-risk patient PE potential candidate outpatient care early discharge . The specific aim 1 ) derive clinical prediction rule identifies patient PE low 30-day mortality risk ( &lt; = 2 % ) , 2 ) ass performance rule predict relevant outcome ( i.e. , major bleeding , respiratory failure [ RF ] , cardiogenic shock , cardiac arrest ) process care ( i.e. , thrombolysis , mechanical ventilation [ MV ] , intensive care unit ( ICU ) admission , length hospital stay , hospital readmission ) . The study use 3 large reliable database , PHC4 database , MediQual Atlas database , National Death Index ( NDI ) . These database contain rich set clinical information outcome data . The prediction rule prognosis derive 8,000 patient discharged diagnosis PE acute care hospital Pennsylvania calendar year 2000-2001 . Patients PE identify use primary ICD-9-CM discharge code PE secondary discharge code PE couple primary discharge code represent complication treatment PE . Baseline data include 35 potential clinical predictor short-term mortality PE abstract PHC4/Atlas database . The primary outcome 30-day mortality ascertain NDI ; secondary outcome major bleeding , respiratory failure , cardiogenic shock , cardiac arrest , thrombolysis , mechanical ventilation , ICU admission , length hospital stay , readmission . Classification tree analysis use construct simple clinical prediction rule identifies 20 % subgroup patient 30-day mortality rate 2 % less . The predictive accuracy rule externally validate independent cohort 4,000 patient PE calendar year 2002 use identical patient identification strategy derivation cohort . The safety rule test validation cohort compute proportion low-risk patient die within 30-days another adverse outcome . This innovative application derive clinical prediction rule prognosis potential improve cost-effectiveness management PE . The long-term goal project validate implement rule prospective study test safety effectiveness establish future admission/early hospital discharge recommendation patient PE .</detailed_description>
