	<brief_title>Romidepsin Treating Patients With Relapsed Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate response rate patient histologically cytologically proven small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) treat depsipeptide `` sensitive '' relapse set . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe overall survival failure-free survival patient histologically proven recurrent SCLC treat depsipeptide . II . To evaluate toxicity depsipeptide patient relapse SCLC . III . To evaluate surrogate biological marker peripheral blood mononuclear cell buccal epithelial cell : p53 acetylation , histone acetylation , p21CIP1 expression . OUTLINE : Patients receive FR901228 ( depsipeptide ) IV 4 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day least 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients continue tumor response stable disease 6 course receive 2 additional course beyond best response . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
