	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Insulin-like growth factor-I ( IGF-I ) main mediator effect growth hormone ( GH ) important regulator cell cycle/differentiation inhibitor apoptosis . Consistent laboratory study show potentially beneficial effect IGF-I cardiovascular cerebrovascular system , GH-deficient individual high cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) mortality evidence premature atherosclerotic disease reversible GH replacement . In addition , several epidemiological clinical study show association low serum IGF-I level myocardial infarction ( MI ) congestive heart failure ( CHF ) among person without frank abnormality GH/IGF-I axis . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study first prospective investigation ass whether serum level IGF-I two important binding protein , IGFBP-3 , IGFBP-1 , associate incidence confirm incident cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) event old male female adult . Specimens data study obtain Cardiovascular Health Study ( CHS ) , large , multi-center NHLBI-funded prospective cohort study 5,888 community-dwelling men woman 65 year old . The study use efficient case-cohort study design select specimens test , involve evaluation 750 incident myocardial infarction ( MI ) /fatal coronary heart disease ( CHD ) case , 500 incident stroke case , 750 incident congestive heart failure ( CHF ) case , comparison sub-cohort 750 individual select random study population . The study examine association baseline serum IGF-I , IGFBP-1 , IGFBP-3 level future occurrence first incident MI/fatal CHD , ischemic stroke , CHF . Multivariate regression model use control potential confounding factor include age , sex , race/ethnicity , anthropometry body composition , fast 2-hour post-load glucose insulin level , dietary intake , physical activity , hormone replacement therapy medication , CVD risk marker lipid , inflammatory factor , coagulation/fibrinolysis marker .</detailed_description>
