	<detailed_description>The long-term goal project study effect different exercise modality Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . PD disorder whose primary disability stem motor dysfunction include balance . Recent study show risk fall elderly reduce practice Chinese complementary alternative medicine ( CAM ) T'ai Chi Chuan ( TCC ) . This finding may highly significant PD . Although recent report Emory suggest PD patient well aerobic ( walk-run ) exercise training ( AET ) , still unclear whether potential anti-Parkinsonian effect modality secondary improved physical fitness ( CRF ) , motor control . CAM intervention TCC may offer unique opportunity examine fundamental question . In PD hypothesize exercise training reduce primary secondary disability change represent adaptive reprogramming central motor pathway . We conduct control double-blind , 16-week dose-response study exercise base caloric expenditure thus cardiorespiratory fitness effect exercise ( CRF ) . The treatment Qi Gong ( minimal caloric expenditure ) , TCC ( low expenditure ) , walk-cycle AET ( moderate expenditure ) . We examine exercise-induced change motor control use quantitative measure motor disability , include dynamic gait stability measure . We also examine exercise effect central peripheral index Parkinsonian motor disability . A caloric `` dose-response '' effect exercise would suggest CRF major determinant anti-Parkinsonian effect exercise . If Chinese modality effective superior AET however , would suggest mechanism change central motor programming may play role ( e.g . relaxation effect , reinforcement central motor program ? ) . A good understanding exercise-induced neural plasticity motor control would offer significant , heretofore unexploited rehabilitative potential PD .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ambulatory patient Parkinson 's Disease , define clinical state least two four cardinal feature present 1 ) slowness movement , 2 ) tremor rest , 3 ) muscular rigidity , 4 ) gait disturbance posture imbalance . Ambulatory patient Parkinson 's Disease exercise regularly 2x per week . Willing randomly assign 1 3 exercise modality : Tai Chi , Qi Gong Aerobic exercise . NOTE THAT PARTICIPATION IN THE STUDY REQUIRES BIWEEKLY PARTICIPATION IN A 16WEEK SUPERVISED EXERCISE PROGRAM PLUS RELATED EVALUATIONS AT EMORY . ACCORDINGLY , RECRUITMENT IS LIMITED TO LOCAL PATIENTS .</criteria>
