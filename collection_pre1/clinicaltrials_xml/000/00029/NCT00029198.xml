	<brief_summary>The specific aim study : 1 ) replicate data follow ten day massage therapy , preterm infant show great daily weight gain discharge hospital earlier control , thus demonstrate cost-effectiveness intervention ; 2 ) test model two potential underlie mechanism weight gain include ) enhance vagal activity lead great gastric motility , high level insulin , IGF-1 , oxytocin low cortisol level massage versus control infant end study ; and/or b ) increase physical activity associate increase heart rate oxygen consumption temperature lead great weight gain . These pathway ( vagal activity physical activity ) test path analysis . Determining underlying mechanisms massage therapy/weight gain relationship critical process require neonatology community massage therapy adopt standard neonatal intensive care unit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preterm Infants ' Weight Gain Following Massage Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A number study document average 47 % great weight gain preterm neonate follow massage therapy . Our currently fund study suggest massage therapy increase vagal activity , oxytocin , IGF-1 . In proposed continuation study preemie would provide daily massage three time day 10 day , previously successful protocol . To determine potential mechanism may underlie massage therapy/weight gain relationship continue assess vagal activity assay insulin , oxytocin , IGF-1 cortisol well gastric motility . We add alternative potential pathway massage therapy/weight gain relationship . In expanded model , activity level relate measure heart rate , oxygen consumption ( base formula calculated heart rate ) temperature mediate effect massage therapy weight gain . A large sample recruit power need test model potential mechanism underlie weight gain preterm infant massage . For current application , 120 preterm infant common medical complication prematurity , medically stable reside intermediate care ( `` grower '' ) nursery , assign group base random stratification follow variable : gender , gestational age , birthweight , day NICU , study entry weight . One hundred twenty infant randomly assign one two group : 1 ) ten day massage therapy ( n=60 ) , 2 ) standard treatment ( n=60 ) . Within-subjects between-groups analysis focus physiological ( heart rate , vagal tone , gastric motility , temperature ) , biochemical ( insulin , oxytocin , IGF-1 cortisol ) behavioral variable ( activity level ) .</detailed_description>
