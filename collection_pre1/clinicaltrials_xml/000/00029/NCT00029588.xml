	<brief_summary>This study examine compare brain change decision-making healthy adolescent adolescent anxious depress . The finding may provide good understand mechanisms lead depression anxiety . Adolescents 9 17 year age adults 20 40 year age follow category enrol study : - Healthy adult - Healthy adolescent - Adolescents major depression - Adolescents anxiety disorder ( generalize anxiety disorder , social phobia , or/and separation anxiety disorder ) The study involve three visit , follow : Visit 1 Visit 1 consist three part child adult participant : - Part 1 : Staff meet participant standard psychiatric interview , include question participant feeling , experience behavior past present . For adolescent participant , staff meet child alone , parent alone , child parent together . - Part 2 : Participants perform series simple task involve shape , letter , number . They medical history , physical examination blood draw . In addition , adolescent urine drug test . - Part 3 : Adults adolescent undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) Visit 3 receive training familiarize procedure . Visit 2 - Adolescents ask standardized question regard feeling , experience behavior , perform series simple decision-making task computer . - Adults undergo MRI scanning , describe Visit 3 adolescent . This conclude participation adult study . Visit 3 Adolescents one follow two procedure : - Decision-making task use computer . Small electrodes place child wrist , face finger monitor muscle tone skin humidity task . Or - MRI , test use strong magnetic field radio wave show change brain function . During scan , participant lie table space enclose metal cylinder ( MRI scanner ) . The procedure take 60-90 minute ; subject must lie still 10-15 minute time . During imaging , subject ask perform decision-making task computer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Impaired motivate behavior , include aspect decision-making reward-related process , lie root maladaptive behavior many psychiatric disorder , include major depression ( MD ) . Little known cognitive neural mechanism underlie MD adolescent . Adolescence key period many psychiatric disorder first emerge , study developmental stage may provide unique window address primary deficit associate disorder . In particular , major depression show mark increase prevalence adolescence . Data family-based longitudinal study suggest anxiety disorder ( AD ) , often precede MD , may index childhood vulnerability development MD . The concomitant examination MD AD help interpret finding . We propose examine , adolescent , manner various elemental emotional-cognitive process differentially affect MD AD compare healthy control . This investigation do two phase . In Phase I , use fMRI , test two task decision-making model gamble similarly test adult group healthy adolescent healthy adult . This phase serve test feasibility validity use task adolescent , provide normative developmental data compare healthy adult healthy adolescent . In addition show feasibility use task normal adolescent , also test task performance behaviorally healthy , anxious depress adolescent . Measures include psychophysiological eye track measure , behavioral variable . Once task performance well characterize behaviorally , conduct Phase II fMRI study independent group depress anxious adolescent compare finding obtain healthy adolescent .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Age : Subjects male female , 917 2040 year age . 2 . Psychiatric history : Subjects Group 3 , 4 diagnose current MD , current AD ( generalize anxiety disorder , social phobia , or/and separation anxiety disorder ) respectively , base kSADS interview parent adolescent minor ( &lt; 18 year old ) , SCID adult . History anxiety disorder individual MD acceptable , current symptom mild absent ( see exclusion criterion ) . Similarly , history depression individual AD acceptable , current symptom mild absent ( see exclusion criterion ) . AD MD patient CGAS &lt; 70 . 3 . Medication status : No history medication treatment use SSRI &gt; one month prior enter study fluoxetine &gt; six month prior enter study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Because factor psychiatric disease , CNS disease , influence functional brain activity , pregnancy precludes participation fMRI study , factor exclusionary . 1 . Psychiatric disease : Any current history axis I diagnosis adjustment disorder , simple phobia , Social Phobia , Separation Anxiety , dysthymia , GAD MD exclusionary . Subjects assess use DSMIV criterion via standardized psychiatric interview conduct trained examiner ( KSADS minor SCID adult ) . Any current suicidal ideation , severe ADHD require pharmacotherapy exclusionary . 2 . History Drug Abuse : Axis I diagnose substance use disorder exclusionary . 3 . Severe acute chronic medical illness 4 . CNS disease : History brain abnormality ( e.g. , neoplasms , subarachnoid cyst ) , cerebrovascular disease , infectious disease ( e.g. , abscess ) , neurological disease , history head trauma ( defined loss consciousness &gt; 3 min ) . 5 . IQ low 70 . 6 . Metal electronic object : Metal plate , certain type dental brace , cardiac pacemaker , etc. , sensitive electromagnetic field contraindicate MRI scan . 7 . Claustrophobia : Subjects question potential discomfort enclose space , MRI scanner . 8 . Pregnancy status : Because potential effect hormonal change brain function well unknown effect electromagnetic field fetus , pregnancy exclusion criterion . Sexually mature female participant must negative urine pregnancy test perform within 24 hour fMRI scan .</criteria>
