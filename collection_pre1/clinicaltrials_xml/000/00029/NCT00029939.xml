	<brief_summary>This study use electroencephalography ( EEG ) examine brain prepares movement . It look 1 ) change occur person 's brain voluntary movement , 2 ) change occur , 3 ) consistent change , 4 ) change vary person person . The information study apply study , explore brain change signal movement use control prostheses patient spinal cord injury stroke . Healthy normal volunteer 18 year age old may eligible study . People neurologic psychiatric disorder people take medicine may affect brain signal ( e.g. , Valium ) may participate . Participants come NIH Clinical Center two separate day test session 2 3 hour . At session , EEG cap place head record brain signal , electrode place arm record movement . Subjects perform simple movement EEG recording , flex arm clenching fist . Researchers use first record determine pattern brain prepares movement . During second recording , try predict subject ' movement , base pattern discern first record .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Human voluntary movement associate least two distinct type scalp electroencephalographic ( EEG ) change . Event-related potential slow , DC signal develop bifrontal region early 1.5 second prior movement . They detect average multiple event time domain generally require least 40-50 event allow detection signal within noise . Frequency change however , robust may see reliably individual trace . The frequency change occur alpha ( 8-13 Hz ) range well beta ( 13-30 Hz ) may occur 2 second movement . This lead notion real-time analysis EEG may allow one predict individual movement . If could do reliably , may provide insight brain prepares movement , well potential therapeutic option control cortically base prosthetic device . Our initial study , henceforth Phase 1 , exploratory study use real-time EEG identify factor allow one reliably predict normal human voluntary movement . Subjects normal volunteer , study EEG lab Human Motor Control Section . Subjects ask perform simple motor task involve sequence finger movement undergo routine EEG record surface electromyography . The EEG process use standard technique identify location time course EEG signal response movement . Once occur , subject return real-time study use individually identify factor predict movement . The effect train accuracy prediction also explore schedule multiple real-time prediction session per subject course several week . The rate successful movement prediction primary outcome measure . After able accurately predict movement intention healthy volunteer , i.e. , false positive rate 20 % false negative rate 50 % , study whether achieve prediction accuracy stroke patient patient primary lateral sclerosis ( PLS ) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) . The stroke patient ALS/PLS patient perform procedure subject Phase 1 part trial . Phase 2 investigation extend different type movement , reach , additional parameter , spatial field intend target movement . In addition , Phase 2 also include magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) well EEG method classify spatiotemporal feature movement parameter . Successful prediction intend goal reach either ipsilateral contralateral field , prior onset movement main outcome measure phase 2 study . In Phase 3 investigation , healthy volunteer perform simple finger movement task analyze special attention give time intention move intention affect EEG signal . In order ass whether spontaneous movement without prior instruction associate different physiological marker typical self-paced paradigm , record session perform EEG cap place without instruct subject . Results study use design protocol study human voluntary movement clinical application appropriate .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS : Healthy volunteer 18 , willing participate , able give inform consent . STROKE PATIENTS : The stroke patient clinically radiologically document stroke subacute ( 2 week 6 month onset ) chronic state ( 6 month onset ) , lesion subcortical region include basal ganglion , thalamus , internal capsule , combination structure , cerebellum unilaterally . These lesion extend surround area , however include cortical area . Patients 18 year age . PLS/ALS PATIENTS : Patients must fulfill diagnostic criterion propose Pringle ( 1992 ) PLS diagnose PLS least 3 year . Criteria include onset spasticity alone adulthood , slow progressive course , family history , low motor neuron sign , exclusion know cause spasticity . ALS patient probable definite ALS El Escorial criterion . Patients must evidence upper low motor neuron sign two define region : cranial , arm , leg , torso . Only PLS/ALS patient recently participate study protocol 06N0174 include . Some subject study inpatient . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS : Subjects unable perform simple voluntary movement hand . Subjects neurological psychiatric condition . Subjects implant metal body remove prior MRI MEG scan . STROKE PATIENTS : We investigate particular EEG pattern associate voluntary movement believe may present patient multiple stroke involve cerebral cortex ; therefore , exclude population stroke patient . We , however , include patient multiple stroke cerebral cortex involve hypothesize EEG pattern look preserve patient subcortical stroke lesion . A . Patients MRI finding consistent brain tumor , trauma AVMs exclude . B . Patients multiple stroke lesion involve cerebral cortex exclude . C. Subjects prestroke history schizophrenia bipolar disorder exclude . D. Subjects cancer exclude . E. Patients capable give informed consent exclude . PLS/ALS PATIENTS : PLS/ALS patient history evidence coexist neurological disorder , stroke , epilepsy , Parkinson 's disease , polio , ataxia neuropathy , history traumatic brain injury , skull defect neurosurgery exclude . PLS/ALS patient neuropsychological test frontal cortex function protocol 06N0174 . Patients score 133 ( 144 ) Mattis dementia rating scale classify impaired patient unable give inform consent exclude . PLS/ALS patient unable travel exclude . PLS/ALS patient respirator dependent exclude .</criteria>
