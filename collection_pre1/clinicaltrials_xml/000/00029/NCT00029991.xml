	<brief_title>Extract Ginkgo Biloba ( EGB 761 ) Vascular Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study determine highly standardized herbal extract leave Ginkgo Biloba tree , widely use Europe two decade , benefit patient pain walk due narrow artery leg . A study do ten year ago Germany appear benefit patient . It important confirm finding learn may work . Animal study suggest extract , know EGb 761 , work strong antioxidant mechanism . A second action suggest stimulates cell line inside artery produce compound nitric oxide . These cell , know endothelial cell , susceptible damage blood cholesterol , smoke high blood pressure , damage , allow cholesterol deposit artery . Antioxidants prevent endothelial cell damage , therefore important know EGb 761 work mechanism . These cell also produce nitric oxide naturally defense injury , EGb 761 effect nitric oxide would also provide benefit . Consumption Gingko Biloba product , many uncertain purity , increase rapidly United States . Confirmation benefit , derive largely Europe , important protect health American people find new inexpensive remedy common problem , narrow artery legs . If benefit find problem , highly likely atherosclerotic deposit cause heart attack many stroke may also preventable treatable compound . Any benefit find also lead future study determine constituent mixture present EGb 761 confers benefit . If action , others , discover , herbal product could become use great confidence . This double-blind study randomly assign parcicipants receive 4 month either EGb 761 320 mg/day placebo . Improving walk distance 30 % great major goal . A second goal test safety EGb 761 careful examination liver kidney function measure general health . Also , thorough search occur antioxidant action change endothelial cell nitric oxide production . Two study visit occur baseline , two occur Month 4 .</detailed_description>
