	<brief_summary>This study use transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) identify interaction unaffected affected side brain stroke patient . Results previous study suggest stroke , motor cortex ( part brain control movement ) unaffected side brain might negatively influence motor cortex affect side . TMS procedure delivers brief electrical current stimulate brain . Studies small number patient show TMS cause temporary decrease activity motor cortex . Healthy normal volunteer chronic stroke patient may eligible study . Subjects may participate four session reaction time ( speed motor response ) test . They perform series movement index middle finger either leave right hand response signal computer monitor . The time take task measure score . There rest period session . TMS do session examine motor cortex affect recovery function stroke . For procedure , insulated wire coil place scalp . A brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . Depending coil place , stimulation may cause muscle twitch ( sometimes strong enough move limb ) , feel movement tingle limb , twitch jaw . During stimulation , subject may ask tense certain muscle slightly perform simple action . The electrical activity muscle activate stimulation record use metal electrode tap skin muscle . Subjects also ask draw mark line paper rate attention level fatigue , well think execute task . Participants also magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . This procedure use strong magnetic field radio wave provide detailed image brain . During scan , subject wear earplugs muffle loud thump sound occur electrical switching radio frequency circuit . The subject communicate staff member performing study time intercom system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interhemispheric Interactions Associated With Performance Voluntary Movements Patients With Stroke Motor Disability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Performance accurate skilled movement relies interhemispheric interaction two motor cortex . It propose abnormal interaction could contribute motor deficit result chronic hemispheric lesion stroke . The purpose protocol identify change interhemispheric inhibitory interaction associate performance motor task patient chronic hemispheric stroke . The overall hypothesis cortical representation paretic hand receives abnormally high task-related interhemispheric inhibitory influence originate intact motor cortex stroke patient relative healthy volunteer . It important test hypothesis , proven correct , could lead development novel neurorehabilitative strategy .</detailed_description>
