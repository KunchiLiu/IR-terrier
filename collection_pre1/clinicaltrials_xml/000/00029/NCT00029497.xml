	<brief_title>Sham Device , Pill Placebo Treatment For Arm Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There evidence magnitude placebo effect produce device great produce pill . If case , significant ramification trial involve device understanding role placebo effect randomize control trial ( RCT ) . This two phase study 1 ) investigates role placebo effect RCT 's 2 ) conduct two trial treatment persistent upper extremity pain secondary repetitive strain injury ( RSI ) , include carpel tunnel syndrome . In Phase I . 240 patient RSI randomly assign receive placebo device ( recently validate sham acupuncture device ) placebo pill ( dummy amitriptyline ) . Our primary hypothesis patient respond good sham device placebo pill . A finding sham acupuncture produce great placebo response placebo pill important implication interpretation result trial compare device sham device , device pill , medical management surgery . Phase II randomly assign patient sham acupuncture arm Phase I receive either TCA continue receive sham version . Patients placebo pill arm Phase I randomly assign receive either AMI continue receive placebo pill . From patients'perspective , shift treatment assignment Phase I II noticeable . Phase II allow u test whether active treatment outperform respective placebo . Both treatment show promise small study , neither prospectively study large trial appropriate control . Because Phase I also function run-in period Phase II , analysis combining phase allow u examine whether run-in methodological advantage device trial . Moreover , combine analysis permit test whether patient level response placebo Phase I affect response active treatment Phase II . A positive finding would contribute importantly understanding role placebo RCTs .</detailed_description>
