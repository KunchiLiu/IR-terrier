	<detailed_description>The concept asthma condition acute chronic inflammatory change airways play fundamental role well establish . The role leukotrienes crucial element inflammatory process support abundant laboratory clinical evidence . There potential herbal medicinal approach ameliorate leukotriene-mediated inflammation asthma base data literature laboratory . Studies suggest dietary GLA , find borage even primrose oil , unique among ( n-6 ) polyunsaturated fatty acid family member ( linolenic acid , GLA arachidonic acid ) potential attenuate inflammatory process . For instance , randomize , placebo-controlled trial ( RCT ) demonstrate efficacy dietary GLA treat patient rheumatoid arthritis active synovitis . Ginkgo biloba , flavonoid-rich extract leave Ginkgo biloba tree , study one RCT asthma patient recommend complementary alternative practitioner treatment allergic inflammation asthma . Ginkgo biloba supplement know adverse effect . We assess clinical efficacy and/or adverse effect dietary borage oil Ginkgo biloba patient asthma 17 month RCT . We also propose delineate whether clinical course treatment correlate suppression leukotriene B4 ( LTB4 ) , LTC4 LTD4 generate activated polymorphonuclear cell . Additionally , Ginkgo biloba arm study , vitro/ex vivo inhibition histamine release assay , since one major constituent , quercetin , know structurally related cromolyn sodium show vitro study exhibit similar activity . Furthermore , anti-inflammatory activity Ginkgo biloba compare individual constituent series vitro experiment . It hop finding study evolve relatively non-toxic therapeutic alternative attenuate bronchial hyperresponsiveness inflammation patient asthma .</detailed_description>
