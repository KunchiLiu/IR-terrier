	<brief_summary>Despite risk reduction counseling , individual HIV vaccine trial vaccine preparedness study may engage risk behavior result HIV infection . The purpose HVTN 403 study find person respond HIV infection receive experimental HIV-1 vaccine become HIV infect . Some people HVTN 403 receive experimental HIV vaccine participant clinical trial get infect HIV . Other people study vaccine preparedness study get infected HIV . None individual become infected HIV result participation HIV vaccine vaccine preparedness study . HVTN 403 compare immune responses previously receive experimental HIV vaccine .

	<brief_title>A Study Patients Who Develop HIV Infection After Enrolling HIV Vaccine Trials HIV Vaccine Preparedness Trials</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It important study person vaccinate candidate HIV-1 vaccine become HIV-1 infected follow reason . First , transient HIV-1 infection detect effectively suppress clear , important document antigenic relationship breakthrough virus vaccine epitopes attempt answer question specificity breadth immune response determinant immunity . A second reason gain well understand vaccine-induced response participant transiently persistently HIV-1-infected compare placebo recipient become HIV-1-infected . If vaccine prevent HIV-1 infection , important characterize course disease measure longitudinal viral load measurement , CD4+ count , clinical symptom . Understanding breadth , magnitude , specificity immune response partially fully immunize vaccinee infection impact clinical symptom disease progression potentially result valuable information subsequent design vaccine efficacy trial , ultimately , consideration potential effectiveness HIV-1 vaccine . Study visit occur Days 0 , 7 , 14 , 28 , 2 month , 3 month , 6 month , every 6 month thereafter . At visit , patient give physical exam , blood drawn , donation genital fluid request certain visit . Patients ask donate sample either semen ( men ) cervical secretion ( woman ) ; viral load measure compare amount type virus blood . He/she may refuse donate genital fluid still eligible remain study . Primary medical care medication HIV infection provide study .</detailed_description>
