	<brief_summary>During transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , magnetic coil place front part head . Electric current pass coil brief pulse . Magnetism current produce separate , small electric current inside brain , activate brain cell coil . This treatment may result decreased depression improve Parkinson 's disease symptom .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The major aim study carry sequential Phase I trial prefrontal transcranial magnetic brain stimulation ( TMS ) electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) patient Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) severe depression . Depression complicate PD 50 % case , lead deterioration motor performance quality life ; antidepressant medication fail produce intolerable side effect 25-30 % patient . Case report uncontrolled trial suggest ECT effective ameliorate simultaneously mood motor symptom PD . Only small study ECT PD prospective randomize , assessment protocol limit , result variable . TMS new , promising , alternative treatment refractory depression , appear easy safer ECT . Requiring hospitalization , anesthesia , recovery time , TMS investigate alternative therapy mood disorder . TMS study depressed patient PD serious central nervous system diseases . This study extend past present research PD , depression , ECT , TMS . We comprehensively evaluate effect leave prefrontal TMS mood , motor , neuropsychological function , together quality life index depress PD patient . All patient initially receive treatment TMS . Those fail benefit proceed ECT . Comprehensive evaluation continue another eight week TMS-only ECT group . The key issue address study include : ( 1 ) potential benefit TMS mood movement depress PD patient , ( 2 ) tightness association mood motor function TMS ECT . Overall , study provide important preliminary data relationship among mood , cognitive motor function PD , influence quality life . The result help direct future application TMS alternative therapy brain disorder , elucidate relative benefit TMS ECT depress PD patient . A positive effect TMS impetus towards randomize , placebo-controlled trial .</detailed_description>
