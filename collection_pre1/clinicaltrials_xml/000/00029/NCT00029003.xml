	<brief_title>Gefitinib Treating Patients With Stage IIIB Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess one-years survival rate previously-untreated previously-treated patient advance bronchioalveolar carcinoma receive chronic oral ZD1839 . II . To assess progression-free survival overall survival group patient . III . To evaluate frequency severity toxicity associate treatment regimen . IV . To evaluate response rate use standard RECIST criterion computer-assisted image analysis patient measurable disease . V. To measure EGFR EGFR variant III overexpression tumor tissue sample explore relationship aforementioned clinical outcome . VI . To measure EGFR expression activation status slide buccal brushing submit S9925 initiation treatment ZD1839 explore association response survival . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior systemic treatment bronchioalveolar carcinoma ( yes v ) . ( The previously untreated stratum close accrual 2/15/2003 . ) Patients receive oral gefitinib daily . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 6 month 2 year annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
