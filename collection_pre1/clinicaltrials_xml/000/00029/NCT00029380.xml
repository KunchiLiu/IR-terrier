	<brief_title>Cord Blood Transplantation Sickle Cell Anemia Thalassemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : During past decade , number advance make treatment patient sickle cell anemia thalassemia . Among advance allogeneic bone marrow transplantation , current treatment offer potential cure . In sickle cell anemia , transplantation perform patient advanced organ damage . In thalassemia , transplantation perform evidence iron-related tissue damage . Due concern engraftment graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) , transplant patient hemoglobinopathy limit situation human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) compatible donor exist . Unfortunately , HLA-matched related donor often available . Umbilical cord blood ( UCB ) , recently recognize source hematopoietic stem cell , use successfully transplant bone marrow 500 patient . The potential advantage cord blood donor source stem cell minimal risk high-grade GVHD ( even without complete HLA compatibility ) . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This study establish national sibling donor cord blood ( SDCB ) program , evaluate use multi-center pilot study transplantation , develop Web-based data management system support two project . A multi-center pilot study conduct cord blood transplantation child either sickle cell disease thalassemia . The investigator test hypothesis novel immunosuppressive conditioning regimen ( fludarabine , cyclophosphamide , busulfan ) post transplant therapy ( mycophenolate mofetil cyclosporine ) would improve engraftment rate prevent disease recurrence . The effect SDCB transplantation hematologic parameter GVHD monitor . Enrollment study suspend December 29 , 2003 . The protocol revise , replace previous condition regimen fludarabine , busulfan , cyclophosphamide conventional regimen rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin ( Sangstat ) , busulfan , cyclophosphamide . The revise protocol open enrollment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Suitable UCB collection HLAidentical sibling Sickle cell anemia ( Hb SS S beta thalassemia ) significant disease manifestation define least one follow criterion : 1 . A history painful event define three painful event 2 year prior enrollment . Pain may occur typical site associate vasoocclusive painful event explain cause sickle cell disease . The pain must last least 4 hour require treatment either parenteral narcotic , equianalgesic dose oral narcotic ( pain treat local facility parenteral narcotic routinely use treat painful event ) , parenteral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug . Painful event manage home consider documentation event clinical record may review investigator . 2 . Acute chest syndrome ( ACS ) two episode ACS development new infiltrate chest radiograph and/or perfusion defect demonstrable lung radioisotope scan 3 . Any combination painful event episodes ACS total three event 2 year transplantation 4 . Any clinically significant neurologic event ( stroke hemorrhage ) neurologic defect last 24 hour 5 . Abnormal cerebral MRI abnormal cerebral MRA 6 . An episode dactylitis first year life significant anemia ( Hbg le 7 g/dL ) , leukocytosis second year life risk severe adverse outcome 18 year age exceed 54 % ( define cooperative study sickle cell disease ( CSSCD ) infant cohort study ) 7 . History positive transcranial Doppler study ( average great 200 cm/sec ) Beta thalassemia major significant disease manifestation define follow criterion : Beta thalassemia genotype consistent clinical diagnosis beta thalassemia major ( could include patient Ebeta thalassemia genotype ) require eight red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion year iron chelation therapy . Younger patient risk transfusional iron overload yet initiate iron chelation therapy eligible . Adequate physical function measure follow criterion : 1 . Cardiac : Asymptomatic , symptomatic , leave ventricular ejection fraction rest must great 40 % must improve exercise , shorten fraction great 26 % 2 . Hepatic : Less 5 time clinical baseline AST le 2.5 time clinical baseline mg/dL total serum bilirubin ( clinical baseline determine mean four recent test result ) 3 . Renal : Serum creatinine within normal range age serum creatinine outside normal range age renal function ( creatinine clearance GFR ) great 50 % low limit normal ( LLN ) age 4 . Pulmonary : Asymptomatic , , symptomatic , DLCO , FEV1 , FEC ( diffusion capacity ) great 45 % predict ( correct hemoglobin ) ; unable obtain PFT , oxygen saturation great 85 % room air</criteria>
