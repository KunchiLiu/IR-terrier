	<brief_summary>This study examine whether PET image reveal happen lymph node patient systemic lupus erythematosus , lupus , period active disease . Patients may periods active disease may feel sick fever , fatigue , ache swollen joint . Their blood test abnormal kidney , lung heart may affect . At time , disease inactive , patient feel well , blood normal , evidence organ disease . In lupus , like autoimmune disease , body 's immune system attack healthy tissue . Activated lymphocyte ( type immune cell ) lead production antibody chemical signal contribute disease process . In animal lupus , cell activate lymphoid organ , lymph node spleen . It know exactly cell activate human . Because lymph node locate deep inside chest abdomen ; surgery currently way examine . PET imaging may provide alternative , non-invasive , mean obtain information lymph node activity human . This test use radioactive sugar molecule call F18-FDG find area increase cellular activity body . ( Cells use sugar fuel , active cell , active lymphocyte , use FDG body tissue . ) This study determine whether PET detect area increase activity lupus active disease . Patients active inactive lupus may eligible study . Candidates screen history , physical examination , routine blood urine test . Women pregnant breastfeeding may participate . Participants undergo PET scanning . On day scan brief medical history physical examination blood sample drawn check blood count look marker lymphocyte activation . Then , small plastic tube ( catheter ) place vein patient 's arm , FDG inject catheter , patient rest hour . For scan , patient lie flat cradle move central hole doughnut-shaped PET camera , picture take next 2 hour , patient lie quietly , without move head arm . After scan finish , patient empty bladder approximately every hour 6 hour excrete radioactive sugar .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) Locate Areas White Blood Cell Activity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study aim evaluate value Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) assess distribution activate lymphocyte SLE patient . Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , often define prototypical autoimmune disease , chronic occasionally life threatening , multisystem disorder . Determining disease activity SLE essential selection appropriate effective therapeutic regime . Lymphocyte activation hallmark SLE correlate well disease activity . 2-deoxy-2 [ F-18 ] fluoro-2-D-Glucose positron emission scan ( FDG-PET ) physiologically base method image provide non-invasive information uptake metabolism glucose various tissue . Actively metabolize cell preferentially take radioactively label glucose analog therefore demonstrate increase signal . Actively proliferate lymphocyte take FDG high rate rest lymphocyte expect accumulate select lymph node spleen anatomic site lymphocyte activation . Lymphocyte activation confirm FACS analysis circulate lymphocyte . This study design single center pilot study two group patient divide active vs. non-active SLE group undergo FDG-PET scanning . The primary objective evaluate feasibility FDG-PET assess distribution activate lymphocyte active inactive SLE patient . The goal detect activate lymphocytes home site correlate pattern distribution clinical disease activity .</detailed_description>
