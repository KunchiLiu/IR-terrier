	<brief_summary>This study determine whether stepwise increase drug infliximab ( RemicadeÂ® ( Registered Trademark ) ) control juvenile rheumatoid arthritis effectively fix dose . It look safety effectiveness increase dose maximum 15mg/kg body weight per dose , examine drug 's effect bone cartilage , whether improve abnormal growth , metabolism hormone . Infliximab approve treat adult rheumatoid arthritis Crohn 's disease . Children 4 17 year age active juvenile rheumatoid arthritis respond adequately standard therapy may eligible study . Participants receive nine infusion infliximab 62-week study . The drug give intravenously ( IV , vein ) 2 hour . The first three infusion dose 5 mg/kg body weight . Children improve regimen receive another 6 infusion dose . Children significantly improve 5 mg/kg end 6 week ( third infusion ) may continue phase 2 study , randomly assign receive either : 1 ) 6 additional dos drug 5 mg/kg per dose , 2 ) gradually increase dose maximum 15 mg/kg . In addition , child continue take methotrexate dose enter study . Participants visit NIH Clinical Center 12 time ( every 8 week ) study follow test procedure : - History physical examination , include complete joint exam - Puberty assessment - breast development girl , testicle size boy , pubic hair - Height weight measurement Children image study ( x-ray , MRI Dexa scan ) begin end study collect 24-hour urine sample infliximab infusion . Patients may elect endocrine evaluation . This involve Clinical Center hospitalizations 1-1/2 day visit 1 , 4 12 . Small amount blood drawn every 20 minute ( indwell catheter avoid multiple needle stick ) 8 hour child sleep . The blood examine normal rhythm growth hormone substances body affect arthritis . Participants complete questionnaire year 2 year provide information health status problem might relate study drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Infliximab , murine chimeric monoclonal antibody target TNF-alpha recently license treatment adult patient establish rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . A double blind placebo control trial child juvenile rheumatoid arthritis ( JRA ) use single dose fix infusion regimen currently ongoing . This dose finding study design determine whether clinically guide intravenous ( iv ) infusion regimen allow intra-patient dose escalation superior achieve 70 % clinical response fix dose administration infliximab child polyarticular course JRA . We model pharmacokinetic profile phase study . We plan enroll maximum 48 patient allow 36 patient randomized two treatment arm . In first phase study patient receive fix dose 5mg/kg/dose total 3 infusion 6 week ( week 0 , 2 , 6 ) . In second phase week 14 , patient achieve 70 % improvement randomize 2:1 ratio either receive intra-patient dose escalation cap 15mg/kg/dose every 8 week continue receive 5mg/kg/dose every 8 week blind fashion . After 6 additional IV dos , patient evaluate clinically , radiographically serologically clinical response . Patients achieve 70 % response week 14 keep 5mg/kg/dose every 8 week trial duration 62 week , include primary endpoint analysis . We also plan evaluate patient endocrinologically metabolically determine effect TNF blockade system .</detailed_description>
