	<brief_summary>Although patient hypercortisolism diagnose treat long-term effect hypercortisolism treatment unknown . This study attempt answer follow question : 1 . What rate perioperative complication ? Patients Cushing syndrome often undergo transsphenoidal surgery pituitary gland treatment disease . During surgical procedure pituitary gland reach pass sphenoid bone . The risk patient develop hypopituitarism immediate postoperative period unknown . Patients Cushing syndrome abnormal level hormone circulate blood affect surgery often apparent long procedure . 2 . What recurrence rate ? The recurrence rate disease estimate 5 - 10 % . However , figure confirm . If actual rate recurrence high estimate many patient may elect undergo radiation therapy lower rate recurrence . 3 . Do factor immediate postoperative period predict experience recurrence Cushing syndrome ? 4 . What long-term complication hypercortisolism ? Studies show patient hypercortisolism four time great risk death people age without hypercortisolism . Researchers tend believe figure high . However , well establish hypercortisolism weaken bone ( decrease bone density ) , cause secondary hypogonadism , increase level fat blood ( hyperlipidemia ) , decrease thyroid function ( hypothyroidism ) . The potential condition reverse know . These question address blood urine sample postoperative period , outpatient follow-up periodic questionnaire first 10 year curative surgery Cushing syndrome perform NIH .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although patient hypercortisolism diagnose correctly successfully treat , long-term sequela hypercortisolism treatment unknown . This study address follow question : 1 ) What recurrence rate successful treatment Cushing 's syndrome ? 2 ) Do factor immediate postoperative period predict recurrence Cushing 's syndrome ? 3 ) What long-term complication hypercortisolism term mortality , morbidity , return endocrine function bone density ? 4 ) What quality life patient surgical treatment Cushing 's syndrome ? While question relate specifically care patient Cushing syndrome , final question relevance many patient render Cushingoid therapeutic use glucocorticoid . These question address blood urine sample post-operative period , outpatient follow-up periodic questionnaire first 20 year curative surgery Cushing syndrome perform NIH .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients Cushing syndrome document NIH recruit protocol prior surgery intended cure Cushing syndrome selectively . Thus , patient undergo transsphenoidal exploration resection adenoma , unilateral adrenalectomy adenoma , resection tumor produce ACTH ectopically candidate study . We also recruit many 500 patient treat since 1983 possible , group `` late followup '' patient . These individual participate primarily questionnaire . Hematocrit 30 % . A CBC obtain prior enter study . Patients hematocrit 30 % accepted study ; iron replacement give patient low TIBC . Ages 18 85 . Children le 18 studied protocol questionnaire validate young individual . For questionnaire portion protocol additional inclusion criterion : Patients must able read write English . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : There formal exclusion criterion , patient meet inclusion criterion . All ethnic group gender recruit . However , patient may withdraw study PI unable meet study requirments , mail questionnaire .</criteria>
