	<brief_summary>This study use transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) examine brain control muscle movement dystonia . Dystonia movement disorder involuntary muscle contraction cause uncontrolled twist repetitive movement abnormal posture . Dystonia may focal , involve one region body , hand , neck face . Focal dystonia usually begin adulthood . Generalized dystonia , hand , generally begin childhood adolescence . Symptoms begin one area become widespread . Healthy normal volunteer patient focal [ generalize ] dystonia [ 21 65 year age ] may eligible study . Participants transcranial magnetic stimulation . For test , subject seat comfortable chair , hand place pillow lap . An insulated wire coil place scalp . A brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . ( This may cause muscle , hand arm twitching coil near part brain control movement , may induce twitch transient tingle forearm , head face muscle . ) During stimulation , subject ask either keep hand relax move certain part hand response loud beep visual cue . Metal electrodes tap skin muscle computer record electrical activity hand arm muscle activate stimulation . There three part study , last 2-3 hour perform separate day .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate modulation inhibition within motor cortex movement patient focal dystonia . For selective movement task , certain muscle normally recruit others inhibited cortical level . We hypothesize disturbance cortical inhibitory control could result failure focus desire motor action within motor cortex ( disturbed center surround inhibition ) may account co-contraction antagonist muscle overflow extraneous muscle dystonic patient . Intracortical inhibition ( ICI ) silent period ( SP ) two major cortical inhibitory mechanism demonstrate transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . Alteration inhibitory mechanism study dystonia rest , however , dystonic symptom mainly occur selective task movement plan study intracortical inhibitory mechanism movement use different TMS paradigm .</detailed_description>
