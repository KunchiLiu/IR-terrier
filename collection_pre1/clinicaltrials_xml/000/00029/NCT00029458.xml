	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness clozapine treatment manic phase bipolar disorder . A significant proportion manic patient either respond adequately conventional treatment tolerate adverse effect associate therapeutic dos agent . Clozapine may safe effective treatment mania . However , efficacy clozapine alternative therapy treatment-resistant bipolar disorder mania extensively research . The study conduct three phase . Phase 1 screen phase take place 2 7 day . Participants undergo baseline positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan brain end period . In Phase 2 , participant randomly assign receive either clozapine placebo ( inactive pill ) 3 week . They may also receive lorazepam first 10 day Phase 2 . After 3 week , patient treat clozapine undergo second PET scan . During Phase 3 , participant receive placebo improve offer clozapine 3 week . Those received clozapine improve receive treatment 3 week . At end Phase 3 , participant treat clozapine another PET scan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A significant proportion manic patient either respond adequately conventional treatment ( lithium , valproate carbamazepine ( without antipsychotic drug ) , tolerate adverse effect associate therapeutic dos agent . Thus , need exist additional effective treatment . Preliminary study group suggest clozapine may antimanic action effective treatment-resistant bipolar disorder . However , efficacy clozapine alternative therapy treatment-resistant mania never subject definitive study adequate number subject . Thus , propose conduct large double-blind , placebo-controlled trial date , clozapine , bipolar manic patient unresponsive intolerant six week treatment lithium , valproate , carbamazepine least one antipsychotic drug . The specific aim investigation 1 ) ass acute treatment efficacy clozapine treatment-resistant mania , 2 ) investigate functional anatomical correlate mania , 3 ) investigate effect clozapine treatment cerebral glucose metabolism metabolic correlate effective antimanic , clozapine treatment . Forty-two subject ( two group 21 ) randomly assign treatment clozapine placebo three week . We anticipate maximum 33 % patient withdraw acute phase study due reason intolerable adverse effect withdrawal consent . Thus , expect enter sample yield 14 complete subject per cell . This sample size allow adequate statistical power test hypothesis state . Patients , age 18-65 , diagnosis bipolar I disorder manic mixed ( without psychotic feature ) , randomize double-blind treatment receive either clozapine ( 200-550 mg/day ) placebo , period 3 week . Following acute period , patient receive either open-label clozapine treatment clinically indicate . If clozapine find effective treatment-resistant mania , would significant step forward treatment patient would major health implication . In addition , would establish gold standard newer treatment compare . Finally , glucose metabolism image obtain use PET [ F-18 ] FDG baseline follow 3 week clozapine treatment investigate functional anatomical correlate mania compare drug-induced metabolic change responder nonresponders .</detailed_description>
