	<brief_summary>This large multi-center , prospective , randomized trial design determine whether mild intraoperative hypothermia result improve neurological outcome patient acute subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) undergo open craniotomy clip aneurysm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypothermia During Intracranial Aneurysm Surgery Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose trial determine whether mild intraoperative body cool ( body temperature = 33 degree Celsius 91.4 degree Fahrenheit ) open neurosurgical craniotomy aneurysm clip improves neurological outcome ( measure 3 month surgery ) patient suffer aneurismal SAH . This may NIH-funded trial examine impact intraoperative intervention neurological outcome follow neurosurgical procedure , certainly large trial kind yet undertaken . Many method propose `` protect '' neurosurgical patient neurological complication occur intracranial vascular procedure . However , treatment target intraoperative period ever systematically test . Mild hypothermia chosen treatment test extensive review medical literature discussion many anesthesiologist neurosurgeon expert field suggest intervention likely beneficial . Hypothermia also easily produce operating room anesthesiologist familiar manage mild hypothermia . As result , investigator felt trial hypothermia practical reasonably safe .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult great 18 year old Nonobese ( body mass index le 35kg/m2 ) Nonpregnant World Federation Neurologic Surgeons preoperative Grade I , II , III patient acute SAH schedule undergo open craniotomy aneurysm clip within 14 day document SAH . There must contraindication cool ( e.g. , sickle cell anemia , cryoglobulinemia , severe Raynaud 's disease ) . Patients must also preSAH Rankin disability score 0 1 ( i.e. , serious preexist functional disability kind ) , perioperative course Nimodipine ( calciumchannel blocker drug know improve outcome patient SAH ) must plan . Each center must approval local Human Subjects Committee participate trial write informed consent either patient , nextofkin , legal guardian require .</criteria>
