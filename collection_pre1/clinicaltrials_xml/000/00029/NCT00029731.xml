	<brief_title>Arginine Treatment Acute Chest Syndrome ( Pneumonia ) Sickle Cell Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pneumonia patient SCD particularly severe come call acute chest syndrome . ACS common cause morbidity SCD patient common cause death SCD . Multiple factor involve severity acute pulmonary injury SCD . Nitric oxide multitude related function , many could impact favorably ACS SCD . Nitric oxide important inflammatory mediator produce conversion L-arginine citrulline nitric oxide synthase . Nitric oxide precursor , arginine , know low SCD patient ACS , suggest therapy , arginine , aim increase nitric oxide production improve clinical course ACS . Patients receive 1 3 dos arginine hydrochloride orally 3 time day 3 day hospitalize . The efficacy arginine measure increase nitric oxide production physiological effect assess . Completion date provide represent completion date grant per OOPD record</detailed_description>
