	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) curative potential individual sickle cell disease . While result conventional HCT good , treatment carry risk significant short- term longterm toxicity . For reason , HCT reserve child experience severe symptom predict poor outcome . Of interest , patient develop stable donor-host hematopoietic chimerism conventional HCT . Due natural enrichment donor erythrocytes blood , develop stable chimerism significant clinical benefit , even minority donor cell . These observation parallel effort develop less-toxic , non-myeloablative preparative regiment transplantation , prove first canine model transplantation , subsequently translate successfully clinical trial older adult hematological malignancy . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Multicenter open-label phase I-II study 30 child sickle cell disease combine non-myeloablative pre-transplant hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) therapy modulate post-grafting immunosuppression control host-versus-graft graft-versus-host reaction . The approach rely ability establish maintain donor-host chimerism . The primary study endpoint stable donor cell engraftment ; secondary endpoint measure impact therapy sickle cell-related symptom end-organ damage ( disease-free survival , patient survival , graft-versus-host disease , complication etc ) . The trial conduct within exist network Comprehensive Sickle Cell Centers , centrally coordinate Sickle Cell Coordinating Center .</detailed_description>
