	<brief_summary>This study examine effect repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) Parkinson 's disease symptom . rTMS way stimulate brain may able change electrical activity nerve cell brain . It propose treatment brain disorder , include Parkinson 's disease . In preliminary study , patient ' symptom improve ; worsen temporarily , show change . Patients 40 80 year age moderately severe Parkinson 's disease , whose main problem slowness movement stiffness , may eligible study . Participants randomly assign one two treatment group : one receive rTMS part brain involve controlling movement ; receive sham , placebo , stimulation . Nine treatment give 4-1/2 week period . Patients take Parkinson 's disease medication study , stop take medicine 4 5 hour one session . For rTMS , insulated wire coil place scalp . A brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . The pulse deliver train , short burst , last 1 second . There 48 train total 1200 pulse per 24-minute session . The stimulation may cause muscle twitch scalp face may also cause small movement limbs . Just rTMS session , patient neurologic examination , include evaluation walking . Their motor function test record videotape document possible improvement allow physician rate improvement . The physician know patient receive actual rTMS receive sham treatment . Ratings first last rTMS session detail .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The treatment Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) need improvement , particularly area gait freezing . A promising technique repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) , far , produce small effect bradykinesia drug free patient limited trial . We hypothesize rTMS beneficial effect gait freezing medicate patient , propose test control trial . Specifically , propose look effect 25 Hz stimulation since type stimulation show increase excitability cerebral cortex . Over one-year period , enroll 40 adult PD evaluate effect 8 treatment period 4 week . We investigate effect motor cortex dorsolateral prefrontal cortex since region may underactivated PD recent data suggest change diencephalic dopamine function rTMS prefrontal cortex . Symptoms evaluate standard test motor function include Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale specific test gait freeze . We look acute effect stimulation cumulative effect .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Men woman age forty eighty five year DOPAresponsive , akineticrigid PD . Patients participate Human Motor Control Section ( HMCS ) protocols PD past interview examine either PI Brain Stimulation Unit ( BSU ) HMCS physician order establish diagnosis PD rule neurologic condition . Only patient Hoehn Yahr grade 3 5 `` '' accept . Patients must regimen include levodopa , total dose medication equal 375 mg levodopa equivalent include dopamine agonist agent . Patients problem walk , include freezing , gait time 10meter distance 5 second . Any patient whose record contain neurological examination past year reexamine enrollment . The study explain informed consent obtain protocol investigator . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Any significant medical psychiatric illness ( PD ) , pregnancy ( urine sample pregnancy test obtain prior rTMS start , day initial interview sign consent form ) , history epilepsy , concurrent use tricyclic antidepressant , neuroleptic agent , licit illicit drug antiparkinsonian agent could lower seizure threshold . Persons surgically traumatically implanted foreign body pacemaker , implanted medication pump , metal plate skull , metal inside skull eye ( dental appliance filling ) may pose physical hazard magnetic stimulation . Patients participation study would , opinion investigator , cause undue risk stress reason tendency fall , excessive fatigue , general frailty , excessive apprehensiveness . Mentally impaired patient capacity provide consent exclude study . The physician establish diagnosis apply UPDRS evaluate patient 's mental capacity use conventional clinical interview . No psychological test use . Formal reevaluation do . Children exclude since Parkinson 's disease , generally , disorder child .</criteria>
