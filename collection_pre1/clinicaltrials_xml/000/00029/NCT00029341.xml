	<brief_summary>The purpose study find anti-HIV drug stop without virus become resistant drug . The study also examine fast anti-HIV drug leave body . Not HIV-infected patient may require continuous indefinite anti-HIV therapy . There evidence stop anti-HIV therapy make virus resistant efavirenz ( EFV ) , anti-HIV drug remain body longer treatment drug . In another study , patient treat EFV , zidovudine ( ZDV ) , lamivudine ( 3TC ) . The patient ' virus control despite fact patient miss medication dosage . Many patient stop anti-HIV therapy negative effect . This study examine body 's ability fight control virus patient stop therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Demonstrate That Anti-HIV Drug Therapy Can Stopped Without Causing Viral Resistance , Characterize Drug Elimination From Body</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The concept patient HIV-1 infection require continuous indefinite antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) question . There theoretical reason support empiric evidence suggest discontinue ART select EFV-resistance . In Dupont Protocol 006 , antiretroviral-naive patient randomize receive EFV , ZDV , 3TC . This regimen associate excellent sustain virologic response . It certain many patient study able maintain sustain suppression HIV-1 RNA limit detection despite miss occasional dos medication . Since therapy ZDV 3TC alone unlikely maintain virologic control , emergence substantial high-level EFV resistance lead virologic failure . The fact relatively virologic failure study provide indirect strong evidence simultaneous discontinuation EFV , ZDV , 3TC unlikely associate emergence EFV resistance . Many individual discontinue antiretroviral therapy adverse effect . This study provide opportunity determine whether virologic response patient discontinue antiretroviral therapy compromise . Participants discontinue EFV . Other antiretroviral drug patient ' regimen may continue three day last EFV dose . Patients resume EFV antiretroviral agent least 28 day stop EFV , unless CD4 cell count decline level indicates need resume therapy . Throughout study , patient blood draw specified day plasma EFV assay , intracellular NRTI-TP assay , demonstration EFV resistance . After patient antiretrovirals least four week , may choose restart ART , start new regimen , discontinue ART . Patients restart ART need come clinic seven day restart blood drawn . After plasma EFV assay complete HIV resistance demonstrate , three patient clonal analysis perform .</detailed_description>
