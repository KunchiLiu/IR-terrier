	<brief_title>Carotid Occlusion Surgery Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall purpose research determine surgical operation call `` Extracranial-Intracranial Bypass '' reduce chance subsequent stroke someone complete blockage one main artery neck ( carotid artery ) supply blood brain already suffer small stroke . This surgery involve take artery scalp outside skull , make small hole skull connect scalp artery brain artery inside skull . In way blockage carotid artery neck bypass blood flow brain . In people natural bypass artery develop brain already get plenty blood . These people low risk stroke take medicine . In people , natural bypass artery develop less blood flow brain . This second group much high risk stroke take medicine , high 25-50 % within next two year . It second group people may benefit bypass operation candidate study . This bypass surgery consider experimental generally perform condition unknown whether lead decrease , increase change risk stroke . In order determine people fit second group people may benefit bypass operation need test call PET scan . The PET scan measure amount blood get brain amount oxygen brain use . The PET scan us radioactive oxygen water experimental ( approve United States Food Drug Administration ) . If PET scan show less blood get brain , 50-50 chance ( like coin toss ) receive bypass surgery . There follow-up visit clinic one month later every three month two year check appropriate medical treatment everyone receive determine stroke . The study hypothesis extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery add best medical therapy reduce 40 percent subsequent stroke within two year participant recent TIA ( 'ministroke '' ) stroke ( &lt; /= 120 day ) due blockage carotid artery reduce blood flow brain measure PET .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Vascular image demonstrate occlusion one internal carotid artery . Transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) ischemic stroke hemispheric carotid territory one occlude carotid artery . Most recent qualify TIA stroke occur within 120 day prior project performance date PET . Modified Barthel Index &gt; 12/20 ( 60/100 ) . Language comprehension intact , motor aphasia mild absent . Age 1885 inclusive . Competent give inform consent . Legally adult . Geographically accessible reliable followup . Nonatherosclerotic carotid vascular disease . Blood dyscrasia : Polycythemia vera , essential thrombocytosis , sickle cell disease ( SS SC ) . Known heart disease likely cause cerebral ischemia ( echocardiography require ) . This include follow condition ONLY : Prosthetic valve , Infective endocarditis , Left atrial ventricular thrombus , Sick sinus syndrome , Myxoma , Cardiomyopathy ejection fraction &lt; 25 % . This allinclusive list . The following condition NOT EXCLUSIONS : Atrial fibrillation , patent foramen ovale , atrial septal aneurysm . Other nonatherosclerotic condition likely cause focal cerebral ischemia . Any condition likely lead death within 2 year . Other neurological disease would confound followup assessment . Pregnancy . Subsequent cerebrovascular surgery plan might alter cerebral hemodynamics . Any condition participate surgeon 's judgment make subject unsuitable surgical candidate . Participation experimental treatment trial . Participation within previous 12 month experimental study include exposure ionize radiation . Acute , progress unstable neurological deficit . Neurological deficit must stable 72 hour prior performance PET . If supplemental arteriography require , allergy iodine xray contrast medium , serum creatinine &gt; 3.0 mg/dl contraindication arteriography . If aspirin use antithrombotic therapy perioperative period , allergy contraindication aspirin ineligible . Medical indication treatment anticoagulant drug , ticlopidine , clopidogrel antithrombotic medication medication replace aspirin perioperative period deem necessary COSS neurosurgeon participant randomize surgical treatment . Remediable medical condition . Patients follow condition become eligible exclusion criterion long applies within 120 day onset recent qualify event : Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus ( FBS &gt; 300 mg % /16.7 mmol/L ) , Uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic BP &gt; 180 , diastolic BP &gt; 110 ) , Unstable angina , Uncontrolled hypotension ( diastolic BP &lt; 65 ) .</criteria>
