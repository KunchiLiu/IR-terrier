	<detailed_description>To conduct successful trial , ability study sit recruit , enroll , retain , inform cohort risk HIV infection critical . Building site 's capacity function essential component overall preparedness HIV vaccine trial . The design Phase III HIV vaccine trial conduct HVTN depend interplay 4 parameter : number participant enrol , HIV incidence rate among enrollee , duration follow-up , number participant retain follow-up . Dramatically different study design may require depend parameter , information must obtain characterize parameter HVTN site . Based previous work , many HVTN research sit establish effective standard operating procedure recruit retain high-risk population research study characterize HIV incidence rate population . Work required establish similar research infrastructure knowledge base potential expansion sit previously represent HIV vaccine research network assess potential recruitment new cohort exist HVTN site . This HIV Vaccine Preparedness Study ( VPS ) serve purpose . Each study site target 1 major risk group ( heterosexual men woman high sexual risk , men sex men ( MSM ) , injection drug user ( IDU ) ) enrollment . Within group , 200 500 HIV-negative participant enrol . Potential study participant undergo screen interview identify person high-risk HIV infection . Those meet study eligibility criterion ( except HIV test ) , well additional site-specific criterion , complete Behavioral Risk Assessment , receive HIV pre-test risk reduction counseling , test HIV antibody syphilis . Women must provide urine sample pregnancy test . Participants test HIV-negative meet eligibility criterion enrol study maintain follow-up next 12 month . Specifically , participant complete `` locator contact '' Months 3 9 follow-up visit Months 6 12 . The Months 3 9 locator contact serve purpose enhance retention study provide mechanism confirm update participant ' locator information ; confirm reschedule next follow-up visit ; reinforce instruction contact study site update locator information and/or , need , request HIV counsel and/or test schedule visit . The follow-up visit Months 6 12 include assessment , counseling , test similar do screening visit .</detailed_description>
