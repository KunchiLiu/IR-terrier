	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Despite mark reduction risk transfusion-transmitted disease , lesson learn delayed recognition HIV transmission transfusion , underscore necessity continue vigilance blood safety . The study correct significant lack prospective study transfusion transmit disease infant child country . A critical material outcome study establishment large serum cell repository link patient recipient sample . Such repository , represent prospective study pediatric population , unique . It provide mean ongoing surveillance identify rapidly emerge infectious agent aid determine whether present significant risk blood supply . Because close collaboration parallel structure two related adult transfusion study , age related comparison viral clearance clinical outcome likewise derive work . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The prospective study pediatric transfusion recipient determine residual risk transmit know infectious agent hepatitis virus , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) human T-cell leukemia virus ( HTLV ) , current donor screening assay , potential risk know agent routinely screen blood donation , might , nonetheless , infect blood recipient diseases cytomegalovirus , parvovirus B-19 , human herpes virus-8 ( HHV-8 ) newly propose hepatitis virus , TTV SEN virus ( SEN-V ) . An additional primary goal study establish repository link donor recipient sample new infectious agent emerge future , test repository rapidly establish whether agent present threat blood supply . To insure large number sample great statistical power , sample study merge large repository generate NHLBI-sponsored RADAR ( REDS Allogeneic Donor Recipient ) study . The current study pediatric arm RADAR multi-center study . Further , current pediatric study undertaken collaboratively similarly design study adult conduct NIH Clinical Center . In study recipient enrol prior transfusion follow least 6 month post-transfusion . Blood sample obtain 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 24 week transfusion . Molecular serologic test routinely perform agent cite particular emphasis molecular assay human retrovirus ( HRV ) , hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) . HIV , SEN-V , cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) , parvovirus B-i 9 human herpesvirus-8 ( HHV-8 ) . Aliquots retain frozen storage . In addition , pre post-transfusion donor whole blood sample freeze allow recovery recipient DNA identification microchimerism . Such microchimerism may result transfusion-associated graft versus host disease immunosuppression long term consequence development immune mediate disease recipient . In summary , primary pediatric study propose collaboration allow determination transfusion risk variety blood-screened unscreened infectious agent , allow comparison transfusion risk pediatric adult patient , well comparison viral persistence clinical outcome accord age . In addition , contribute pre post-transfusion sample blood recipient link donor sample , study help establish large serum cell repository allow future determination whether virtually infectious agent transfusion-transmitted potential risk blood recipient .</detailed_description>
