	<brief_summary>This study collect white blood cell plasma research immune system control HIV infection . The immune system small group HIV-infected patient , call non-progressors , able control HIV long period without antiretroviral therapy . Some immune system-related gene important control identify patient . This study examine contribution HLA gene B*57+ , B*27+ A*01+ HIV disease progressors long-term non-progressors . ( HLA type genetic marker immune system . ) HIV-infected patient 18 year age old HLA type B*57+ , B*27+ and/or A*01+ may eligible study . Participants undergo apheresis-a method collect large quantity certain blood component safely collect simple blood draw-by one follow two method : - Automated pheresis - Blood drawn needle place arm vein spun machine , separate blood component . The white cell extract red cell , without plasma ( liquid part blood ) , re-infused donor needle needle arm . An anticoagulant ( medication prevent blood clot ) usually add blood machine prevent clot processing . - Manual pheresis - One unit ( 1 pint ) blood drawn needle place arm vein , similar donate pint whole blood . The red blood cell , without plasma , separate rest blood re-infused donor needle . Manual pheresis do person estimate total blood volume red cell count low safely permit removal blood pheresis machine . An adult small size markedly anemic , example , may fall category . Some blood collect apheresis may store future study HIV disease immune function HLA testing , genetic test marker immune system . Some blood may use screen different type viral liver infection , hepatitis A , B , C , D , E , F , G .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Leukapheresis Obtain Plasma Lymphocytes Studies HIV-infected Patients , Including Long-term Non-progressors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In attempt elucidate mechanism ( ) immune-mediated restriction HIV viral replication , aim study four group individual : 1 ) HIV-infected long-term nonprogressors ( LTNP ) , appear control HIV primarily virus-specific cellular immunity ; 2 ) HIV-infected patient broadly cross neutralize antibody activity HIV ; 3 ) HIV-infected patient receive antiretroviral therapy undergo treatment interruption ; 4 ) family member patient exhibit immunologic control HIV infection . Although previous effort focus investigate virus-specific immune response unique group patient term LTNP control HIV cellular immune-mediated mechanism , recently , another group rare individual naturally develop broadly cross neutralize antibody activity HIV isolate also identify laboratory . Passive transfer study nonhuman primate demonstrate neutralize antibody detectable subject time challenge protect infection . We aim recruit patient effort characterize compare virus-specific cellular humoral immune response individual experience progressive infection . In addition , necessary define whether putative correlate immune mediate restriction viral replication cause effect HIV viremia . To end , enrol patient discontinue antiretroviral regimen examine virologic immunologic parameter treatment interruption . Through arm study , attempt characterize mechanism HIV evade and/or suppresses effective anti-viral immune response identify feature virus patient immune response associate virologic control follow treatment interruption . As attain great insight difference patient group , hope perform genetic study would enable u precisely identify susceptibility protective gene , could potentially use construct familial pedigree . We anticipate finding contribute enhance understanding nature effective HIV-specific humoral cellular immunity , help focus future vaccine design effort . For study , necessary obtain large quantity plasma mononuclear cell safely obtain simple phlebotomy . These component easily safely obtain use apheresis procedure Clinical Center Apheresis Unit . This protocol design conform requirement Apheresis Unit donor leukapheresis plasmapheresis procedure .</detailed_description>
