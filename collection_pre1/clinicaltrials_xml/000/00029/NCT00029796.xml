	<brief_title>Isoflavones Acute-phase Response Chronic Renal Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up 40 percent end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) patient suffer chronic inflammatory process currently amenable specific treatment associate high morbidity mortality . High circulating level production pro-inflammatory cytokine essential part ongoing acute-phase response believe exacerbate many clinical manifestation ESRD , include renal osteodystrophy . Like inflammatory process undergone extensive investigation , nuclear factor , Nuclear Factor Kappa-B ( NFKB ) promise critical cellular intermediate acute-phase response mediator target inflammatory cytokine effect . In current search agent may able negate ongoing acute-phase response ESRD , soy isoflavones genistein daidzein emerge potentially useful . These isoflavones present many soyfoods , available over-the-counter nutritional supplement receive grow attention due biological property potential therapeutic agent . Inhibitory effect isoflavones tyrosine kinase NFKB activity , inflammatory cytokine production oxidative stress demonstrate group many investigator may highly relevant renal failure population . Additionally , find recently intake soy food ESRD patient result high blood level isoflavones well tolerate . It work hypothesis chronic renal failure variety endogenous exogenous factor trigger acute-phase response activation NFKB production pro-inflammatory cytokine , intervention soy isoflavones inhibits NFKB activation cytokine production , thus block ongoing acute-phase response affect positively clinically relevant parameter disease activity ESRD . The specific objective proposal conduct randomize , double-blinded dietary intervention trial hemodialysis patient determine whether : 1 . Dietary intake soy isoflavones ESRD patient clinical sign ongoing acute-phase response decrease production proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha , IL-1 IL-6 peripheral blood , thus change balance cytokine antagonist sTNF RI , sTNF RII , IL-1ra . 2 . Suppression inflammatory cytokine production soy isoflavones associate improvement clinically relevant parameter disease activity , include improvement blood marker acute-phase response , decrease blood level marker metabolic bone disease . 3 . Intake soy isoflavones suppress NF-KB activity peripheral blood monocytic cell ESRD patient , manner consistent change cytokine level clinical parameter disease .</detailed_description>
