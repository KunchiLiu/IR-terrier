	<brief_title>Effects Lutein Retinitis Pigmentosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Retinitis pigmentosa ( RP ) group congenital retinal degeneration affect 100,000 individual US , characterize nightblindness , gradual loss peripheral vision , eventually total vision loss . Despite surgical medical effort possible slow , let alone reverse , process photoreceptor degeneration RP . However , recent patient-initiated pilot study demonstrate RP patient may respond nutrition supplement ( lutein ) modest , statistically significant gain visual acuity central visual field area ; demonstration effect rely critically frequent home vision test use letter chart screen personal computer wall chart measure central visual field . Supporting reliability data highly significant correlation eye color vision change ; eye color earlier show influence macular pigment change follow lutein supplementation . At state , study long-term lutein benefit would costly , without placebo-controlled pilot data , premature . We propose prepare long-term clinical trial exploratory study , investigate effect lutein create PC-based home vision test . In initial 6 month study , develop adapt standard clinical vision test use personal computer , recruit two study group : 1 ) 42 RP patient study effect lutein vision , use placebo 20 dosage randomize , double-masked crossover design ( Latin Square , 2x16 week ) , test possible adverse effect serum hepatic panel every 4-6 week , measure compliance baseline end-value serum carotenoid test frequent macular pigment density test ; 2 ) 31 volunteer ( 10 normally sign , 21 RP patient ) , along first group , monitor vision every 1-2 week home use PC-based test . Results validate obtained standard test multiple visit center . The result tool produce study enable long-term lutein supplementation trial vision principal outcome measure , study serve model supplement trial . Moreover , virtue PC-based home vision test develop part study , future trial may , proper safeguard , enroll remote participant would download test software , perform frequent outcome test home , submit test result via e-mail , examine periodically local physician detect potential adverse effect .</detailed_description>
