	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety tolerability intratumoral fowlpox-TRICOM patient metastatic melanoma . II . Determine local response rate patient treat agent . III . Determine systemic clinical response patient treat agent . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine increase transgene expression B7-1 , leukocyte function-associated antigen-3 ( LFA-3 ) , intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) patient treat agent . II . Determine effect agent CD8-positive antitumor T-cell frequency measure tetramer ELISpot patient HLA-A2 positive . III . Correlate transgene expression B7-1 , LFA-3 , ICAM-1 tumor cell change function number melanoma antigen-specific CD8-positive T lymphocytes patient treated agent . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive fowlpox-TRICOM intratumorally day 1 week 1 , 4 , 7 ( maximum 3 injection single lesion ) ( course 1 ) . After 3 injection ( course 1 ) , patient stable respond disease receive additional injection new lesion follow schedule . Treatment repeat every 9 week maximum total 9 injection ( 3 injection total maximum 3 different tumor ) ( total 3 course ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month disease progression approximately every 6 month 5-15 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 14-28 patient accrue study within 14-28 month .</detailed_description>
