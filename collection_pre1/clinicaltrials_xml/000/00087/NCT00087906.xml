	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Background . COPD common chronic health condition . Because current medical treatment minimal impact disease progression , strategy prevent COPD-related disability would important clinical public health benefit . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study test specific conceptual model disability develop COPD . The aim : ( 1 ) To evaluate impact respiratory impairment , especially pulmonary function impairment , risk functional limitation COPD . Using control group , elucidate prevalence respiratory impairment , functional limitation , disability directly attributable COPD . ( 2 ) In adult COPD , delineate longitudinal effect functional limitation risk incident disability . The investigator hypothesize development functional limitation , pulmonary function impairment , major determinant disability . ( 3 ) To determine prospective impact disability risk future adverse health outcome . The investigator assemble prospective cohort 1200 randomly sample adult COPD member large regional health maintenance organization . A matched control group 300 subject recruit . Subjects undergo detailed physical assessment measure respiratory impairment ( e.g. , pulmonary function ) functional limitation ( e.g. , low extremity function , muscle strength , exercise performance , cognitive function ) . Structured telephone interview ascertain disability outcome baseline 18-month prospective follow-up . The investigator also study modulate effect specific risk factor protective factor progression functional limitation COPD-related disability , include psychological factor , environmental exposure , health care process factor .</detailed_description>
