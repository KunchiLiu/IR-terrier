	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Hyperbaric oxygen may increase blood flow decrease swell area brain damage radiation therapy . Giving hyperbaric oxygen therapy together dexamethasone may effective treatment radiation necrosis brain . PURPOSE : This randomized clinical trial study well hyperbaric oxygen therapy work treat patient radiation necrosis brain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Obtain pilot data demonstrate potential increase benefit complement conventional steroid therapy adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen therapy ( HBOT ) patient brain radionecrosis . - Estimate magnitude benefit HBOT use objective measure neurologic function , radiographic imaging , standardize quality life measure patient . - Determine , preliminarily , effect HBOT cerebral revascularization use perfusion MRI patient . - Determine feasibility perform large-scale , randomize , control study ( particularly regard patient recruitment retention ) compare HBOT conventional steroid therapy . OUTLINE : This pilot , randomize , control study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I ( conventional care ) : Patients receive baseline steroid therapy comprise oral dexamethasone 4 time daily . Steroid dose either increase decrease per standard protocol 90-day treatment period . Patients demonstrate neurological deterioration evaluation ( evidenced decrease Karnofsky performance status score ) receive escalate dos dexamethasone maximum daily dose 32 mg reach . Patients reach maximum daily dose dexamethasone remove study . Patients also receive anticonvulsant therapy study therapy . - Arm II ( conventional care hyperbaric oxygen therapy [ HBOT ] ) : Patients receive conventional care arm I* . Patients also undergo HBOT daily , 5 day week , 90 day ( 60 treatment total ) . NOTE : *Patients arm II reach maximum daily dose dexamethasone remove study . - Cerebral revascularization study : Five patient arm randomly select undergo perfusion MRI treatment within 1 week completion study therapy determine proportion cerebral neovascularization arm . Patients evaluate study standardized physical examination , positron emission tomography scan , perfusion MRI , complete neurologic assessment , standardize , health-related quality life measure baseline , 30-day interval treatment , end treatment , 1 , 2 , 4 month completion study therapy . After completion study therapy , patient follow 1 , 2 , 4 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
