	<brief_title>Ixabepilone Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . To determine effect percent 50 % decrease PSA response patient metastatic prostate cancer progress androgen ablation therapy classify 1 3 separate category : 1 . Never receive prior chemotherapy/cytotoxic therapy 2 . Received prior taxane-based regimen 3 . Received 2 prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen ( include , limited , prior taxane anthracyclines ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine measurable disease response patient measurable disease treat drug overall response rate . II . Determine toxic effect drug patient . III . Determine duration PSA measurable disease response patient treated drug . IV . Determine expression p53 , multidrug resistance protein , Bcl-2 immunohistochemistry primary tumor patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior chemotherapy ( none v 1 prior taxane-containing regimen vs 2 prior cytotoxic regimen ) . Patients receive ixabepilone IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
