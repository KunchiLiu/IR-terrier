	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Currently , predominant hypothesis regard atherosclerosis major part drive two independent pathway : hyperlipidemia ( `` stimulation '' ) inflammation ( `` response '' ) . Although vascular cell mediate influence inflammation atherosclerosis , little known vascular cell epidemiology relationship vascular cell phenotype atherosclerosis . The main hypothesis test study variation vascular cell biology relate population variation atherosclerosis . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The cross-sectional study nest within large cohort study , Multiethnic Study Atherosclerosis ( MESA ) . A partial sample 1,000 individual undergone special laboratory analysis identify new measure collect part upcoming site visit . A number novel cellular phenotype describe innate immune response ( monocyte activation , natural killer T cell count ) , adaptive immune response ( TH1 TH2 helper cell , memory T cell ) , vessel integrity ( circulate endothelial progenitor cell ) measure participant . Plasma constituent also measure relate cellular phenotype . The overall goal test hypothesis novel phenotype associate subclinical atherosclerosis coronary carotid artery assess quantification coronary calcification ( CAC ) B-mode ultrasound ( CIMT ) , addition subclinical measure available MESA cohort .</detailed_description>
