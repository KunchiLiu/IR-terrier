	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , topotecan , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well high-dose topotecan work second-line therapy treat patient recurrent extensive-stage small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topotecan Treating Patients With Recurrent Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine overall survival patient recurrent extensive stage small cell lung cancer treat high-dose topotecan hydrochloride . Secondary - Determine safety toxic effect drug patient . - Determine recurrence-free survival patient treated drug . - Determine time response tumor response patient treated drug . - Determine quality life patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This non-randomized , multicenter study . Patients receive high-dose topotecan hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 . Treatment repeat every 56 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline , day 1 course ( except course 1 ) , end study treatment , every 3 month thereafter . Patients follow 7-14 day every 3 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 65 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
