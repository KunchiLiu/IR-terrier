	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Pivanex Patients With Malignant Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Pivanex histone deacetylase inhibitor induces tumor differentiation , inhibit proliferation , induces apoptosis . Pivanex generally well tolerated clinical trial show preliminary evidence efficacy patient non-small cell lung cancer . Pivanex show in-vitro in-vivo evidence anti-tumor activity melanoma , therefore , represent promise therapeutic approach patient malignant melanoma . Purpose : This open-label trial determine response rate Pivanex patient malignant melanoma . Objectives : - Determine time disease progression - Determine overall survival - Determine safety profile Pivanex malignant melanoma Outline : This open-label , single center study patient malignant melanoma whose disease progress failed respond chemotherapy Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) . Patients treat 2.5 g/m2 Pivanex administer intravenously 6 hour daily Days 1 – 3 . Treatment repeat every 21 day tumor progression patient withdrawn treatment protocol-specified reason . Tumor status assess prior every odd-numbered treatment cycle use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) method . Patients continue experience tumor response stabilization time treatment discontinue follow every 12 week tumor status disease progression .</detailed_description>
