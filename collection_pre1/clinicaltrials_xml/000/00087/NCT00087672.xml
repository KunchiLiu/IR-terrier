	<brief_title>A Phase II Study CC-5013 Myelofibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lenalidomide block activity substance blood call tumor necrosis factor alpha . Tumor necrosis factor alpha substance believe prevent new blood cell form bone marrow . Lenalidomide also believe help body 's immune system fight disease . Before treatment start , complete physical exam , include blood ( 3 teaspoonful ) urine test . A bone marrow sample take . To collect bone marrow sample , area hip chest bone numb anesthetic small amount bone marrow withdrawn large needle . An ECG ( test measure electrical activity heart ) may perform . Women able child must negative pregnancy test [ blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine ] . These pregnancy test must occur within 10 - 14 day within 24 hour start lenalidomide . Women able child regular menstruation must pregnancy test weekly first 28 day every 28 day therapy ( include break therapy ) ; stop take lenalidomide Day 28 last dose lenalidomide . Females irregular menstruation must pregnancy test weekly first 28 day every 14 day therapy ( include break therapy ) , stop take lenalidomide Day 14 Day 28 last dose lenalidomide . You consider woman able child sexually mature female : 1 ) undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ; 2 ) naturally postmenopausal least 24 consecutive month ( i.e. , menses time precede 24 consecutive month ) . You take 2 lenalidomide capsule mouth daily . You swallow lenalidomide capsule whole water time day . Do break , chew open capsule . If miss dose lenalidomide , take soon remember day . If miss take dose entire day , take regular dose next schedule day ( NOT take double regular dose make miss dose ) . If platelet count le 100,000 time study enrollment , dose one capsule daily . The dose may decrease depend side effect . The dose may increase needed well control disease . This decide cycle cycle . During treatment , give blood sample ( 1 tablespoon ) every week . The test may repeat frequently check side effect . You need return M. D. Anderson monthly first 3 month , least every 3 month afterwards ( study ) order evaluate response tolerance lenalidomide . Only one 28-day cycle lenalidomide may give cycle per month . You may continue receive therapy long severe side effect worsen disease . You ask keep diary document take capsule . You also need return empty medication bottle visit . If 4 6 month treatment without evidence benefit , may take study . This investigational study . Lenalidomide new drug relate drug call thalidomide . Lenalidomide approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment specific type myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) combination dexamethasone patient multiple myeloma ( MM ) receive least 1 prior therapy . MDS MM cancer blood . It currently test variety cancer condition . In case consider investigational . Up 41 participant may take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
