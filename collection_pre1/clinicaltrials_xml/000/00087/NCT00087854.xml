	<brief_title>Study Individualized Amonafide Treat Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , Phase I/II , multicenter study Amonafide subject androgen-independent metastatic prostate cancer . Amonafide metabolize N-acetylation active metabolite , N-acetyl-Amonafide . Inter-subject difference N-acetylation explain variability Amonafide-induced myelosuppression . This dose-defining protocol design assess safety efficacy Amonafide men androgen-independent prostate cancer , assign individualized dos base acetylator phenotype information . The total duration study approximately 12 - 16 month : approximately 6 - 10 month enrollment , approximately 6 month subject screening , treatment , follow per protocol . Subjects treat PSA progression , disease progression , unacceptable toxicity . Subjects may continue participation study Cycle 5 investigator 's discretion PSA progression , disease progression , unacceptable toxicity report . If subject fulfills criterion PSA progression disease progression , yet opinion investigator , subject appear derive clinical benefit study medication , request may make Xanthus medical monitor allow subject continue study participation compassionate basis . A follow-up evaluation subject do 30 - 35 day receive last dose Amonafide . Subjects contact every 3 month survival completion active phase study , death . PSA response report subject receive Amonafide treatment . PSA level measure Screening per treatment cycle thereafter ( Day 1 cycle ) . A PSA responder define subject experience 50 % decrease PSA level , confirm four week later , demonstration clinical radiographic evidence disease progression prior second PSA measurement . Duration PSA response time PSA progression also report . In addition PSA endpoint , traditional response criterion overall tumor response rate ( complete + partial tumor response ) , duration tumor response , time tumor progression capture subject measurable lesion . All complete partial response must confirm repeat assessment perform less 4 week criterion response meet . Subsequently , order evaluate safety , subject assess sign adverse event accord Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 3 date June 10 , 2003 . All serious adverse event ( SAEs ) grade Â¾ toxicity review Sponsor 's medical monitor . Appropriate action may take terminate put study hold warrant unanticipated toxicity .</detailed_description>
