	<brief_title>Defining Obesity QTL Chromosome 3q</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In last several decade obesity emerge major public health threat . While prevention lifestyle change long-term solution , good understand physiologic mechanism would greatly assist development drug target prevention . Obesity highly heritable condition gene must account substantial proportion individual susceptibility elude detection . Powerful new genetic genomic tool permit comprehensive evaluation candidate gene , include gene linkage peak . These tool include new genomic resource ( human genome sequence , databases common SNPs , haplotype map ) , rapid inexpensive discovery genotyping new analytic method ( haplotype-based association admixture mapping ) . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In large African American family set Dr. Zhu colleague obtain strong linkage evidence obesity chromosome 3q ( combine LOD score = 3.7 ) . A prime candidate ( adiponectin ) lie near peak . They propose follow find combine epidemiologic data high-throughput genotyping move linkage association analysis . The result QTL evaluate within available environmental factor assess potential gene-environment gene-gene interaction . The available phenotype include body composition , rest metabolic rate , physical activity , plasma insulin , glucose , leptin . In family-based design examine linkage peak center position 188 cM chromosome 3q ( 20 Cm 1-LOD support interval ) , follow step-wise strategy : ( ) Genotype 200 single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) region 300 family ( 1,000 individual ) ; ( b ) Conduct linkage , linkage disequilibrium admixture map potentially narrow region ; ( c ) Conduct resequencing haplotype-based association study candidate gene peak . Statistical analysis incorporate intermediate phenotype environmental covariates use characterize potential gene x gene gene x environment interaction . Replication test additional population African European origin .</detailed_description>
