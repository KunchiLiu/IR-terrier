	<brief_title>Safety Study AP23573 Patients With Progressive Recurrent Glioma ( 8669-023 ) ( COMPLETED )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study determine safety , tolerability , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) AP23573 administer intravenously daily five day repeat every two week patient progressive recurrent glioma fail standard therapy receive enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant ( EIAC ) medication . The secondary objective : characterize pharmacokinetic profile AP23573 administer daily five day repeat every two week indicate dosage level patient receive receive EIAC ; describe progression-free survival six month ; describe change protein affect mTOR inhibition ; describe single timepoint status protein affect mTOR inhibition tumor tissue surgical specimen AP23573 dosing ; describe status key protein mTOR signal pathway archival tumor sample , available ; describe health-related quality life start trial prior study drug infusion various timepoints throughout trial . Protocol Outline : This Phase I , open-label , non-randomized , sequential dose escalation cohort trial safety , tolerability , MTD AP23573 administer intravenously 30-minute infusion , daily five day , repeat every two week , patient progressive recurrent malignant glioma .</detailed_description>
