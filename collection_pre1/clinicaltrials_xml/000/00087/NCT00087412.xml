	<brief_title>S0341 : Erlotinib Treating Patients With Advanced Primary Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess survival patient advance non-small cell lung carcinoma Zubrod Performance Status 2 treat OSI-774 . II . To evaluate objective tumor response rate ( confirmed plus unconfirmed , complete partial ) , patient advance non-small cell lung carcinoma Zubrod Performance Status 2 treat OSI-774 . III . To investigate preliminary manner possible correlation EGFR expression , mutation , and/or EGFR polymorphism response and/or survival . IV . To investigate preliminary manner possible correlation activate signal pathway molecule , include basal p27 expression level response and/or survival . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral erlotinib daily day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
