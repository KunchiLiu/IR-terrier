	<brief_title>Erlotinib Treating Patients With Stage I-IIIA Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Undergoing Surgical Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine biochemical response rate ( &gt; 75 % decrease P-MAPK and/or P-AKT ) daily oral OSI-774 ( erlotinib ) 14 consecutive day patient early stage , operable NSCLC . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerance daily oral OSI-774 ( erlotinib ) pre-operative treatment early stage operable NSCLC . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To correlate antiproliferative ( Ki-67 , p27 ) apoptotic ( TUNEL assay ) tumor responses OSI-774 ( erlotinib ) pre-therapy tumor skin EGFR pathway functional status post-therapy tumor skin EGFR pathway inhibition patient resectable NSCLC treat preoperatively OSI-774 ( erlotinib ) 14 day . II . Assessment functional EGFR status : HER1 , HER-2 , HER3 , HER4 , PHER1 , AKT , P-AKT , MAPK-P-MAPK , STAT-3 , P-STAT-3 , EGFR-III immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) . III . Assessment proliferative response : Ki67 p27 IHC . IV . Assessment apoptotic response : TUNEL assay . V. To study role gastrin-releasing factor estrogen receptor pathways sensitivity resistance NSCLC OSI-774 ( erlotinib ) . VI . To identify pattern gene protein expression pre-therapy post-therapy associate tumor clinical , biochemical , antiproliferative , apoptotic response . VII . To study antitumor activity OSI-774 ( erlotinib ) NSCLC tumor heterotransplanted nude mice surgical resection investigate sequential molecular change associate tumor response OSI-774 ( erlotinib ) therapy . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral erlotinib daily day 1-14 day 1-21 absence unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo surgical resection last day study drug administration ( day 14 day 21 ) . Patients may receive chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy surgical resection discretion primary physician . Patients follow 5 year study registration .</detailed_description>
