	<brief_title>Topotecan Treating Women With Persistent Recurrent Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine antitumor activity topotecan patient persistent recurrent carcinoma cervix fail high priority treatment protocol . - Determine nature degree toxicity drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive topotecan IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 22-60 patient accrue study within 1-2 year .</detailed_description>
