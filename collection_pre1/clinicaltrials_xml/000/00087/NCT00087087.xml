	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , pemetrexed disodium , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well pemetrexed disodium work treat patient recurrent persistent ovarian epithelial cancer primary peritoneal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pemetrexed Disodium Treating Patients With Ovarian Epithelial Cancer Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine antitumor activity pemetrexed disodium patient recurrent persistent platinum-resistant ovarian epithelial primary peritoneal cancer fail high priority treatment protocol . - Determine nature degree toxicity drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV 10 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning 7 day continue 3 week last dose pemetrexed disodium , patient also receive oral folic acid daily cyanocobalamin ( vitamin B_12 ) intramuscularly every 9 week . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 19-51 patient accrue study within 11-22 month .</detailed_description>
