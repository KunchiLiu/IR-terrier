	<brief_title>Comparison Two Combination Chemotherapy Regimens Treating Women With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare disease-free survival woman node-negative breast cancer treat adjuvant fluorouracil , epirubicin , cyclophosphamide v doxorubicin cyclophosphamide . Secondary - Compare survival , recurrence-free interval , distant recurrence-free interval patient treat regimen . - Compare adverse event patient treat regimen . - Compare quality life , regard physical functioning , vitality , symptom , rate post-chemotherapy amenorrhea , premenopausal patient treat regimen . - Determine effect induction post-chemotherapy amenorrhea disease-free survival premenopausal patient treat regimen . - Correlate post-chemotherapy amenorrhea disease-free survival hormone receptor status premenopausal patient treat regimen . - Correlate change leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) self-reported physical functioning patient treat regimen . - Compare efficacy regimens patient Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 ( HER2 ) /neu and/or topoisomerase-2-alpha gene amplification . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord hormone receptor status ( estrogen receptor [ ER ] positive progesterone receptor [ PR ] positive v ER negative PR negative ) type prior surgery ( lumpectomy v total mastectomy ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm 1 : Patients receive doxorubicin IV 15 minute follow cyclophosphamide IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course . - Arm 2 : Patients receive fluorouracil IV , epirubicin IV 15 minute , cyclophosphamide IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course . In arm , treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . All patient ER- PR-positive tumor receive hormonal therapy daily begin within 3-12 week completion chemotherapy continue least 5 year . All patient undergone prior lumpectomy undergo whole-breast radiotherapy begin soon possible completion chemotherapy . Patients undergone prior total mastectomy may undergo chest wall radiotherapy investigator 's discretion . Patients assign partial breast irradiation ( PBI ) group protocol NSABP-B-39 undergo PBI accord protocol-specific guideline . Quality life assess baseline , day 1 course 4 chemotherapy , every 6 month 3 year . Patients follow every 6 month 5 year annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 2,700 patient ( 1,350 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 3.75 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligibility Patients must great equal 18 year age . The patient must life expectancy least 10 year , exclude diagnosis breast cancer . ( Comorbid condition performance status take consideration , diagnosis breast cancer . ) The interval last surgery breast cancer treatment ( lumpectomy , mastectomy , sentinel lymph node biopsy , axillary surgery , reexcision lumpectomy margin ) randomization must 84 day . The tumor must invasive adenocarcinoma histologic examination . ( Patients tumor pure tubular mucinous adenocarcinoma eligible . ) The primary tumor must T13 clinical pathologic evaluation . Lymph node obtain axillary staging procedure must pN0 accord pathologic staging criterion 6th edition American Joint Committee Cancer ( AJCC ) Cancer Staging Manual . Patients must undergo axillary nodal stag procedure , example sentinel node ( SN ) biopsy alone , SN biopsy follow axillary sampling completion dissection , axillary node dissection obtain lymph node pathologic evaluation . If patient palpable node , axillary dissection require . Patients must estrogen receptor ( ER ) analysis perform primary tumor prior randomization . If ER negative , progesterone receptor ( PgR ) analysis must perform . If ER positive , PgR analysis desire , mandatory . ( `` Marginal '' `` borderline '' result [ i.e. , definitively negative ] consider positive regardless methodology use . ) Patients must either lumpectomy total mastectomy . Patients must clinical radiologic evidence metastatic disease . Patients skeletal pain eligible inclusion study bone scan roentgenological examination fail disclose metastatic disease . Suspicious finding must confirm benign xray , MRI , biopsy . The patient 's menopausal status must determine prior randomization . Pre postmenopausal woman eligible . The following criterion use define postmenopausal : prior document bilateral oophorectomy , history least 12 month without spontaneous menstrual bleeding , age 55 old prior hysterectomy age 54 young prior hysterectomy without oophorectomy ( status ovary unknown ) , document folliclestimulating hormone ( FSH ) level demonstrate confirmatory elevation lab 's postmenopausal range . Women fail meet one criterion classify premenopausal . At time randomization , patient must follow : history physical exam , EKG , PA lateral chest xray chest CT within past 3 month ; bilateral mammogram within past 6 month ; pelvic exam ( woman uterus receive tamoxifen ) within past year . Within 3 month prior entry , patient must baseline LVEF measure Multi Gated Acquisition ( MUGA ) scan echocardiogram equal great low limit normal facility perform procedure . At time randomization : The postoperative absolute granulocyte count ( AGC ) must great equal 1500/mm3 ( great equal 1200/mm3 , opinion investigator , represent ethnic racial variant normal ) . Postoperative platelet count must great equal 100,000/mm3 . Significant underlying hematologic disorder must exclude platelet count ULN lab . There must postoperative evidence adequate hepatic function , i.e. , total bilirubin must less equal ULN lab unless patient chronic Grade 1 bilirubin elevation ( great ULN 1.5 x ULN ) due Gilbert 's disease similar syndrome due slow conjugation bilirubin ; alkaline phosphatase must less 2.5 x ULN lab ; aspartate transaminase ( AST ) [ serum glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) ] must less equal 1.5 x ULN lab . There must postoperative evidence normal renal function ( serum creatinine less equal ULN ) . Patients history nonbreast malignancy eligible diseasefree 5 year prior randomization deem physician low risk recurrence . Patients follow cancer eligible diagnose treat within past 5 year : carcinoma situ cervix , melanoma situ , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . Special condition eligibility lumpectomy patient : radiation therapy surgery Patients treat lumpectomy follow breast radiation therapy must meet eligibility criterion addition following : Generally , lumpectomy reserved tumor le 5 cm . However , investigator 's discretion , patient treat lumpectomy tumor great equal 5 cm eligible eligibility criterion lumpectomy meet . The margin resect specimen must histologically free invasive tumor DCIS determine local pathologist . In patient pathologic examination demonstrate tumor present line resection , additional operative procedure may perform obtain clear margin . This permissible even axillary dissection perform . Patients tumor still present resect margin reexcision ( ) must undergo total mastectomy eligible . This nodenegative study , therefore irradiation regional lymph node prohibit trial . Whole breast irradiation require unless patient assign partial breast irradiation group NSABP B39 . Postmastectomy chest wall irradiation investigator 's discretion permit . However , nodenegative study ; therefore irradiation regional lymph node prohibit trial . Ineligibility Male patient eligible study . Pure tubular mucinous adenocarcinoma . Bilateral malignancy ( include DCIS ) mass mammographic abnormality opposite breast suspicious malignancy unless biopsy proof mass malignant . Primary tumor stag T4 reason . Suspicious palpable node ipsilateral contralateral axilla palpable supraclavicular infraclavicular node . Patients condition consider ineligible unless biopsy evidence involve tumor . Prior history breast cancer , include DCIS ( patient history lobular carcinoma situ [ LCIS ] eligible ) .

( These patient eligible therapy discontinue prior randomization . ) Therapy hormonal agent raloxifene ( EvistaÂ® ) , tamoxifen , selective estrogen receptor modulators ( SERMs ) , either osteoporosis breast cancer prevention . ( Patients eligible medication discontinue prior randomization . With exception tamoxifen , medication permit study . ) Cardiac disease would preclude use anthracyclines . This include : document myocardial infarction ; angina pectoris require use antianginal medication ; history document congestive heart failure ; serious cardiac arrhythmia require medication , severe conduction abnormality ; valvular disease document cardiac function compromise ; poorly control hypertension , i.e. , diastolic great 100 mm/Hg . ( Patients hypertension well control medication eligible entry . ) Nonmalignant systemic disease ( cardiovascular , renal , hepatic , etc . ) would preclude patient subject treatment option would prevent prolonged followup . Pregnancy lactation time propose randomization . Women reproductive potential must agree use effective nonhormonal method contraception . Concurrent treatment investigational agent . Psychiatric addictive disorder condition , opinion investigator , would preclude patient meeting study requirement . Special condition ineligibility lumpectomy patient : radiation therapy surgery . For patient treated lumpectomy , breast irradiation require . The following patient ineligible : Patients diffuse tumor ( demonstrated mammography ) would consider surgically amenable lumpectomy . ( These patient eligible undergo mastectomy . ) Patients treated lumpectomy another clinically dominant mass mammographically suspicious abnormality within ipsilateral breast remnant . Such mass must biopsied demonstrate histologically benign prior randomization , malignant , must surgically remove clear margin . Patients margin resect specimen involve invasive tumor ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) . Additional surgical resection obtain free margin allow . Patients tumor still present additional resection ( ) must undergo mastectomy eligible . ( Patients margin positive LCIS eligible without additional resection . )</criteria>
