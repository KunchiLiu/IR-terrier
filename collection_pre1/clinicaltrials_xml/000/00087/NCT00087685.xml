	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn RAD001 shrink slow growth tumor patient recurrent endometrial cancer . The safety drug also study . Objectives : Primary Objective : 1 . To determine efficacy RAD001 patient progressive recurrent endometrial cancer . Secondary Objective : 1 . To determine nature degree toxicity RAD001 cohort patient . 2 . To characterize , pre- post- treatment tumor sample , available , expression level total phosphorylated mTOR ( mammalian `` target rapamycin '' ) well relevant upstream downstream signal component ( optional ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RAD001 Recurrent Endometrial Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RAD001 new drug design block protein important development growth cancer . Before treatment start , complete physical exam , routine blood test ( 2-3 teaspoon ) , chest x-ray , CT scan MRI abdomen pelvis . Women able child must negative blood pregnancy test . Routine blood test ( 2 teaspoon ) do weekly treatment , course therapy , every 4 week . A complete checkup include evaluation side effect , also do course therapy end therapy ( 4 week treatment end ) . You take RAD001 10 mg mouth every day . One course therapy 4 week long . RAD001 take time every day empty stomach ( fast state ) light , fat-free meal . You wait least 6 hour eat regular ( fat-free meal ) take RAD001 . You eat fatty food least one hour take RAD001 . If side effect occur dose , doctor may lower RAD001 dose , depend severity side effect . After additional 4 week therapy , dose reduce side effect resolve , doctor may increase dose back original dose , may continue reduce dose . You give amount drug need one course therapy time . You keep diary study list much drug take . This diary review course therapy research nurse physician file chart . You CT MRI scan chest x-ray ( patient chest disease ) evaluate response tumor treatment . These scan do first two course ( eight week ) every third course ( every 12 week ) end therapy . Treatment stop disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . This investigational study . RAD001 authorize FDA use research . Up 35 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically confirm progressive recurrent endometrial cancer ( endometrioid mixed endometrioid component histology ; grade ) . 2 . Patients may fail two prior chemotherapy recurrent disease ( include chemosensitizing radiation ) . 3 . All patient must measurable disease . Measurable disease define lesion measure physical examination mean image technique . Ascites pleural effusion consider measurable disease . 4 . Patients must pretreatment granulocyte count ( i.e. , segment neutrophils + band ) &gt; /=1,500/Fl , hemoglobin level &gt; /=9.0 gm/dL platelet count &gt; /=100,000/Fl . 5 . Patients must adequate renal function document serum creatinine &lt; /=2.0 mg/dL . 6 . Patients must adequate hepatic function document serum bilirubin &lt; /=1.5 mg/dL , regardless whether patient liver involvement secondary tumor . Aspartate transaminase ( SGOT ) must &lt; /=3x institutional upper limit normal unless liver involved tumor , case aspartate transaminase must &lt; /=5x institutional upper limit normal . 7 . Patients must Zubrod performance status 0 , 1 , 2 . 8 . Patients must sign approve informed consent . 1 . Patients previously receive RAD001 another mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) inhibitor . 2 . Patients whose tumor serous carcinoma , mixed malignant mullerian tumor ( MMMT ) component uterine sarcoma . 3 . Patients isolated recurrence ( vaginal , pelvic , paraaortic ) amenable potentially curative treatment radiation therapy surgery . 4 . Patients history psychiatric disorder would interfere consent followup . 5 . Patients history myocardial infarction within previous six month congestive heart failure require therapy . 6 . Patients history prior malignancy ( except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer ) cancer patient diseasefree least five year . 7 . Pregnant lactating woman . Women reproductive potential may participate unless agree use effective contraceptive method . 8 . Patients history seizures ineligible . Patients receive phenytoin , phenobarbital , antiepileptic prophylaxis ineligible . 9 . Patients severe concurrent disease would make patient inappropriate entry study , include significant hepatic , renal , gastrointestinal disease . 10 . Patients deep venous arterial thrombosis ( include pulmonary embolism ) within 6 week study entry . 11 . Patients &gt; /= grade 2 hypercholesterolemia hypertriglyceridaemia ( fast state ) , despite lipid lower therapy exclude enter study . 12 . Patients currently take medication list Appendix A ( Patients give list medication time inform consent ) . 13 . Known hypersensitivity everolimus , sirolimus excipients include hydroxytoluene , magnesium stearate , hydroxypropylmethylcellulose , crospovidone lactulose .</criteria>
