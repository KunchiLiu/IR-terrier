	<brief_title>Bryostatin 1 Plus Vincristine Treating Patients With Recurrent Refractory HIV-Related Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose bryostatin 1 administered vincristine patient recurrent refractory HIV-related B-cell lymphoma . II . Determine toxicity profile regimen patient . III . Determine objective response survival patient treat regimen . IV . Determine immunomodulatory effect regimen interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) , IL-2 receptor , IL-6 cytokine level patient . V. Determine effect regimen CD4+ lymphocyte count HIV load patient . VI . Determine effect regimen human herpes virus-8 load patient body cavity-based lymphoma . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study bryostatin 1 . Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV continuously day 1 15 vincristine IV 5 minute day 2 16 . Treatment continue every 4 week minimum 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos bryostatin 1 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity .</detailed_description>
