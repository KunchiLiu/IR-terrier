	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety effectiveness combination two antibody , apolizumab rituximab ( Rituxan ) , treat B-cell lymphoma chronic lymphocytic leukemia . Rituximab attach molecule call CD20 B-cell lymphoma cause significant shrinkage tumor half patient . However , cure lymphoma , usually return . Also , effective leukemia . Apolizumab attach protein call 1D10 B-cell cancer also able shrink tumor patient . There little experience apolizumab patient leukemia . This study test whether two antibody together effective tumor either one alone . Patients 18 year old B-cell lymphoma chronic lymphocytic leukemia may eligible study . Patients ' leukemia lymphoma cell must CD20 1D10 antigen receptor must least one systemic treatment disease . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood urine test , electrocardiogram , x-rays imaging study , possibly bone marrow aspirate ( withdrawal small marrow sample needle inserted hip bone ) lumbar puncture ( withdrawal small sample cerebrospinal fluid-fluid bathe brain spinal cord-through needle place bone low back ) . Participants receive infusion rituximab apolizumab week 4 week . The first patient study receive low dos apolizumab standard dos rituximab . If apolizumab well tolerate , subsequent patient give high dos . Patients also give dexamethasone another similar steroid , diphenhydramine ( Benadryl ) , acetominophen ( Tylenol ) reduce reaction antibody . After 4 week treatment , patient follow frequently examine response treatment evaluate drug side effect . Patients whose tumor grow 4 week therapy may offer another course treatment late time . Participants follow periodically treatment end disease worsens study end .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While recurrent non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) often responsive therapy , rarely curable disease control primary therapeutic goal . Rituximab , chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody , show single agent activity diseases currently approve therapy recurrent indolent lymphoma . However , rituximab induces objective remission 60 % case inevitable relapse . The 1D10 antigen , subclass HLA-DR molecule , express majority case B-cell malignancy . Apolizumab humanize monoclonal antibody target antigen . In phase I dose escalation trial antibody show clinical activity B-cell NHL express 1D10 antigen . Acute infusional toxicity tolerable , maximum 5 mg/kg give 4 weekly dos . Preclinical vitro data Dr. George Weiner 's laboratory suggest least additive anti-tumor efficacy cell expose antibody simultaneously . This trial pilot use combination therapy rituximab apolizumab patient tumor express antigen . Feasibility tolerability regimen determine . Experimental endpoint include pharmacokinetics apolizumab , assessment apoptosis circulate CLL cell FACS analysis Annexin 5 , assessment T-and B-cell dynamic , effect rituximab apolizumab CLL mRNA measure cDNA microarray . Following first 21 patient trial , administration sequence rituximab apolizumab change rituximab first apolizumab first potentially reduce sensitization apolizumab toxicity rituximab .</detailed_description>
