	<brief_title>T138067 Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer That Has Not Responded Previous Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective tumor response rate patient locally advanced metastatic non-small cell lung cancer fail first-line therapy taxane treat T138067 sodium . II . Determine qualitative quantitative toxic effect drug patient . III . Determine number patient progress treat drug . IV . Determine duration response , time disease progression , median survival patient treated drug . V. Correlate toxic effect drug peak plasma level patient population . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive T138067 sodium IV 3 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month study completion . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-35 patient accrue study within 9 month .</detailed_description>
