	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines may make body build immune response kill tumor cell . Interleukin-2 may stimulate person 's white blood cell kill tumor cell . Combining vaccine therapy interleukin-2 may effective treatment metastatic melanoma . PURPOSE : Randomized phase II trial compare effectiveness vaccine therapy plus interleukin-2 vaccine therapy alone treat patient metastatic melanoma respond previous treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy With Without Interleukin-2 Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma That Has Not Responded Previous Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine clinical response patient HLA-A0201-positive refractory metastatic melanoma treat tyrosinase-related protein-2:180-188 peptide vaccine alone . - Determine clinical response rate patient immediate need receive interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) addition vaccine . - Compare immunologic response , term change T-cell precursor treatment , patient treat vaccine without IL-2 . - Compare toxicity profile regimens patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label study . Patients need immediate interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) receive tyrosinase-related protein-2 ( TRP-2 ) :180-188 peptide vaccine emulsify Montanide ISA-51 day 1 high-dose IL-2 IV 15 minute every 8 hour day 2-5 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients need immediate IL-2 randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive TRP-2:180-188 peptide vaccine emulsify Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive TRP-2:180-188 peptide vaccine emulsify Montanide ISA-51 SC weekly week 1-4 . Treatment repeat every 7 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients complete response ( CR ) receive 1 additional course achieve CR . Patients progressive disease receive vaccine alone may cross receive peptide vaccine IL-2 least 2 course . Patients follow 3 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A maximum 83 patient ( 19-33 need immediate interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) ; 15-25 per treatment arm need immediate IL-2 ) accrue study within 1 year .</detailed_description>
