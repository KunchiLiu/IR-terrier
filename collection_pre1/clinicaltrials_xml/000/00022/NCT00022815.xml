	<brief_summary>This study test safety new treatment method call tissue ultrafiltration . We test method treatment compartment syndrome , condition occur pressure within muscle build dangerous level . In legs part body , tough , stiff membrane cover group muscle nerve blood vessel run next . The entire unit call compartment . The cause compartment syndrome include traumatic leg injury loss blood supply . In tissue ultrafiltration , doctor place hollow probe , catheter , directly muscle compartment injure area lower leg . The probe remove fluid compartment ( extra fluid cause increase pressure ) . We initial safety study group patient surgery break tibia ( inner , large bone lower leg ) high risk develop compartment syndrome . The goal initial study show insert tissue ultrafiltration catheter muscle compartment safe do repeatedly without problem ; show tissue ultrafiltration use monitor biochemical environment inside tissue ; show catheter apparatus provide accurate measurement pressure compartment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The human clinical trial organize series consecutive study design demonstrate safety efficacy ultrafiltration management compartment syndrome ( CS ) . The first study cohort study patient tibial shaft fracture test safety catheter well demonstrate ultrafiltration fiber provide improve method monitoring myofascial compartment physiology . The goal study ( 1 ) demonstrate insert ultrafiltration ( UF ) catheter safe reproducible ; ( 2 ) show CSUF allow biochemical assessment cellular function ; ( 3 ) show CSUF apparatus provide accurate measurement intracompartmental pressure . The study population consist 10 patient close open Gustilo grade I , grade II , grade IIIa tibial shaft fracture require surgical stabilization . We recruit patient study study center . Data collect study numerical value biochemical measurement intramuscular pressure ( IMP ) measurement . We compare CSUF system value intramuscular pressure IMP measure Stryker device . Finally , correlate serial change biochemical measure change IMP . The metabolic assay show increase UF level compare serum level . We consider fasciotomy IMP within 30 mmHg patient 's diastolic blood pressure , clinical examination patient demand . We make repeat IMP measurement time fasciotomy record interval reason fasciotomy . Following operative stabilization tibial fracture final closure traumatic wound , insert multiple UF catheter anterior , lateral , posterior ( superficial deep ) compartment leg . Techniques use catheter insertion similar exist method insertion drainage catheter anticipate specific difficulty step . To measure intramuscular pressure , connect one catheter design purpose standard pressure transducer use monitor intracompartmental pressure ( IMP ) real-time . In addition , use standard wick catheter , insert separately , control measurement . For biochemical measurement , analyze sample interstitial fluid remove CSUF level creatine phosphokinase ( CPK ) , lactic acid , lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) , osmolarity , pH , pO2 . We obtain fluid every 4 hour 48 hour . The assay perform standard clinical laboratory technique .</detailed_description>
