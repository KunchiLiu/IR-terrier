	<brief_title>Capecitabine Irinotecan Treating Patients With Locally Advanced , Recurrent , Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary : - Determine overall objective response rate patient locally advance , locally recurrent , metastatic colorectal cancer treat capecitabine irinotecan . Secondary : - Determine time treatment failure , time overall response , duration overall response , duration overall complete response , time progression patient treat regimen . - Determine 1-year survival overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine toxicity safety profile regimen patient . - Determine feasibility predict response regimen molecular profile tumor tissue patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily day 2-15 irinotecan IV 90 minute day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients maintain response stable disease 12 course may continue treatment discretion investigator . Patients follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 65 patient accrue study within 9 month .</detailed_description>
