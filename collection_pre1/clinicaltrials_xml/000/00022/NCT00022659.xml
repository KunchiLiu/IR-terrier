	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Persistent Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine 6-month progression-free survival patient persistent recurrent ovarian epithelial primary peritoneal cancer treat bevacizumab . II . Determine nature degree toxicity drug patient . III . Determine progression-free overall survival patient treated drug . IV . Determine frequency clinical response patient treated drug . V. Determine effect drug initial performance status , age , mucinous clear cell histology patient . VI . Correlate biological image marker 6-month progression-free survival patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
