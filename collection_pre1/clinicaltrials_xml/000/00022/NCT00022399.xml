	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Celecoxib may effective treatment early stage prostate cancer . It yet know celecoxib effective treatment surgery prostate cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized phase I trial determine effectiveness celecoxib give surgery remove prostate treat patient localized prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Celecoxib Compared With No Treatment Before Surgery Treating Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare biomarker modulation ( prostaglandin level ) tissue sample patient localized prostate cancer treat neoadjuvant celecoxib v placebo follow prostatectomy . - Compare effect regimens angiogenic factor within prostate patient . - Determine pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic effect celecoxib patient . - Compare toxicity profile regimens patient . - Compare compliance patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral neoadjuvant celecoxib twice daily . - Arm II : Patients receive oral neoadjuvant placebo twice daily . Treatment arm continue least 4 week follow prostatectomy . Patients follow within 1 month 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 60-70 patient ( least 30 per arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
