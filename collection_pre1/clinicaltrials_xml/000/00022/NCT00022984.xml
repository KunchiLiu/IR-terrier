	<detailed_description>With efficacy implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) therapy well establish , survival time recipient technology must interpret broadly . It important well understand ICD recipient perceive dependence life save technology perception influence Health Related Quality Life ( HRQL ) . The purpose cross sectional , predictive study test causal model may explain link attitude towards dependency technology HRQL sample adult ICD recipient . The hypothesized model consist seven variable : attitude towards technology dependency ; age ; gender ; illness history ; illness representation ; symptom distress ; HRQL . Adult subject ( great 18 year ) receive ICD ask participate . Subjects complete self-administered , mailed questionnaire include five instrument : 1 ) The Medical Outcomes Short Form 36 Survey Version 1.0 ; 2 ) The Important Concerns Distress Questionnaire ; 3 ) The Illness Perception Questionnaire ; 4 ) The Dependency Technology Scales ; 5 ) Demographic Questionnaire . The model test statistically use Structural Equation Modeling technique . The definitive goal study develop theoretically meaningful statistically well-fitting model specifies dependence technology influence HRQL . The hypothesis study full structural equation model fit data sample adult ICD recipient .</detailed_description>
