	<brief_title>BMS-247550 Treating Patients With Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine confirm response rate patient advance soft tissue sarcoma treat BMS-247550 . II . Determine overall survival progression-free survival patient treated drug . III . Determine toxicity drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive BMS-247550 IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response receive 2 additional course . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 14-29 patient accrue study within 8 month .</detailed_description>
