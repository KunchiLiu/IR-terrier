	<brief_title>CCI-779 Treating Patients With Malignant Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine maximum tolerate dose CCI-779 patient malignant glioma . - Determine safety profile drug patient . - Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . - Determine efficacy drug , term survival objective response , patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients phase II stratify accord use enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drug ( EIAEDs ) ( yes v ) disease type ( glioblastoma multiforme stable neuro-imaging radiotherapy v recurrent malignant glioma ) . Patients phase I must currently receive EIAEDs . - Phase I : Patients receive CCI-779 IV 30 minute weekly . Treatment repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos CCI-779 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . - Phase II : Patients receive CCI-779 Phase I . Patients candidate surgical resection recurrent disease receive CCI-779 IV 30 minute 2 hour prior surgery weekly , , recover surgery . Patients follow survival . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 36 patient accrued phase I study within 12 month . A total 87 patient accrue phase II study within 12 month .</detailed_description>
