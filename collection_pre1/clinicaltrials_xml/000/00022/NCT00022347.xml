	<brief_title>TLK286 Treating Patients With Advanced Ovarian Epithelial Cancer , Fallopian Tube Cancer , Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective response rate disease stabilization rate patient platinum-resistant advanced ovarian epithelial cancer , fallopian tube cancer , primary peritoneal cancer treat TLK286 . II . Determine safety regimen patient . III . Determine duration objective response , time tumor progression , overall survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive TLK286 IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 6 week 1 year every 12 week thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 20-40 patient accrue study within 12 month .</detailed_description>
