	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody , see effect patient CLL determine high dose Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody give without cause severe side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary endpoint determine maximum tolerate dose Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody patient CLL . Secondary endpoint include assessment response rate , duration response , relapse free survival , time treatment failure , safety , survival . The dose escalation start 35cGy patient platelet count &gt; 100,000 cells/mm3 ( Cohort A ) increase group 10cGy increment maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) reach . Subsequently , patient platelet count 75,000-100,000 cells/mm3 ( Cohort B ) enrol start 10cGy MTD reach Cohort A dose escalate 10cGy increment MTD .</detailed_description>
