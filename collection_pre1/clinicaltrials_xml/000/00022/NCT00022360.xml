	<brief_title>Taurolidine Treating Patients With Recurrent Progressive Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose taurolidine patient recurrent progressive high-grade glioma . II . Determine safety toxicity drug patient . III . Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . IV . Determine response patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive taurolidine IV 1-4 hour day 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 . Treatment repeat every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 1-6 patient receive escalate dos taurolidine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede least 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Patients follow monthly 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 4-24 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
