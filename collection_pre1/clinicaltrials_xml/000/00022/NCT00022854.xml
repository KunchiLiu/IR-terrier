	<brief_summary>Anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) reconstruction surgery do repair damage ligament knee . In study look whether femoral nerve block , commonly use method pain relief ACL reconstruction , affect way patient feel surgery . We study recovery first week surgery also 3-12 week surgery . We give patient spinal anesthesia . Some patient also receive continuous femoral nerve block 2 day , single injection . We predict patient receive nerve block significantly improve pain result , compare patient receive nerve block .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pain Relief Results After Anterior Cruciate Ligament ( ACL ) Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In project , measure outcome anesthesia pain management common orthopedic procedure . The influence nerve block pain management outcomes outpatient anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) reconstruction study , especially patient 's potential return societal productivity first week surgery . Therefore , design randomized clinical trial study role nerve block pain management technique patient outcome first week surgery recovery 3-12 week surgery . Our hypothesis patient undergo nerve block analgesia manifest well self-reported recovery outcome , physical function outcome , objective measure neuromuscular function . We give consent patient ( n=270 ) undergo ACL reconstruction conventional spinal anesthesia randomize receive femoral nerve block analgesia either single injection , continuous infusion 2 day , saline placebo . We use goniometry test postoperative range motion extension determine whether quadriceps femoris torque output impair . We compare patient-reported recovery outcome across treatment group use three validate health status measure suitable daily assessment ( Verbal Pain Score , SF-8 , Quality Recovery [ anesthesia , QoR-40 ] Score ) . We aim determine quality immediate recovery anesthesia extent report pain . We compare effect single injection continuous infusion femoral nerve analgesia determine well dose strategy patient .</detailed_description>
