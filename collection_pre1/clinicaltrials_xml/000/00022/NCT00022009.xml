	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Treatment plus supportive care may improve quality life patient undergoing cancer treatment . PURPOSE : Randomized phase II/III trial compare effect different gemcitabine regimen plus supportive care quality life patient locally advanced metastatic non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Plus Supportive Care Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare quality life , term degree symptom palliation improvement performance status , patient locally advance metastatic poor prognosis non-small cell lung cancer treat 2 schedule gemcitabine combine best supportive care . - Compare toxicity regimens patient . - Compare overall survival patient treat regimen . - Compare response rate patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label , multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive gemcitabine IV 30 minute week 3 week . Treatment continue every 4 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive gemcitabine IV 30 minute week 2 week . Treatment continue every 3 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients arm also receive best supportive care . Additional course gemcitabine may administer discretion investigator . Quality life assess baseline course chemotherapy . Patients follow every 2 month survival . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 174 patient ( 87 per treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
