	<brief_title>Thalidomide Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate response rate time-to-progression ( TTP ) previously treat patient low grade non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma treat thalidomide . II . To evaluate effect thalidomide microvascular density bone marrow patient low grade cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . III . To evaluate effect thalidomide bFGF level serum urine . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral thalidomide daily . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 6 month 2 year annually 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 21-45 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
