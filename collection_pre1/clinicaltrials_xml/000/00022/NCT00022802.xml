	<brief_summary>This project focus development clinical test image-guided surgical system . The system help surgeon perform procedure involve insert screw , guide pin , drill bit , straight object bone-for example , insert screw break hip bone . These surgery currently do help mobile x-ray device call C-arm , provide surgeon x-ray image procedure . C-arms disadvantage , include image distortion , radiation exposure , need time-consuming adjustment C-arm surgery . The new method would deal shortcoming computer-based system add exist C-arm system . It would provide surgeon real-time view insertion process , could improve accuracy speed certain surgical procedure . Disadvantages associate C-arms include image distortion , radiation exposure , time consume reconfiguration C-arm insertion process . The proposed system would address shortcoming computer-based system augments exist C-arm system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project support development clinical test image-guided surgical system assist surgeon performing procedure involve insertion screw , guide pin , drill bit , linear object bone . These surgery currently perform assistance mobile fluoroscopic x-ray imager know C-arm . Disadvantages associate C-arms include image distortion , radiation exposure , time-consuming reconfiguration C-arm ( A/P lateral view ) insertion process . The proposed system would address shortcoming computer-based system augments exist C-arm system . The new system use optical localizer ( stereo camera device track light-emitting diode ) monitor location orientation drill guide surgical field . The drill guide trajectory graphically superimpose x-ray image . This provide real-time , on-screen positional feedback surgeon improve accuracy speed certain procedure involve insertion drill bit guide pin perform . The research effort focus development clinical prototype evaluation several quantitative qualitative method . The commercial success system depend acceptance surgeon , turn depend extent tool provide good information surgeon without intrude procedure already highly skilled . Commercial success also depend ability system reliably save time operate room . We address issue cadaveric study subsequent clinical trial . Proposed Commercial Applications : The initial commercial application system insertion dynamic compression hip screw case hip fracture . Because common fracture , reduction surgical time great potential cost saving . Other advantage include decrease radiation exposure potential reduction serious complication . Minor modification allow system assist numerous orthopaedic trauma procedure already plan .</detailed_description>
