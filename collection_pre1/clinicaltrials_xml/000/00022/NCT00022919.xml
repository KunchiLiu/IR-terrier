	<brief_summary>This study examine prostate tumor tissue culture try identify genetic abnormality contribute cause progression disease . Patients prostate cancer enrol National Cancer Institute protocol 97-C-0147 ( Collection Serum Tissue Samples Patients Biopsy-Proved Suspected Malignant Disease ) may eligible study . Specimens tissue culture study obtain tumor surgically remove patient participate NCI protocol 97-C-0146 . The finding study may lead good method predict course disease individual patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analysis Prostate Cancer Short-Term Cultures Using Molecular Cytogenetic Methods</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer common solid tumor American male common malignancy among men Western industrialize country . Widespread test early detection prostate cancer utilize digital rectal examination prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) lead significant clinical conundrum . Differentiating organ confine indolent disease aggressive cancer imperfect . Nonetheless , increase detection lead increased radical prostatectomy . A prevailing goal contemporary , ardent research seek discover molecular biomarker prognostication . Given limitation current knowledge molecular pathology prostate cancer , several viewpoint regard process tumorigenesis . However , generally accept hypothetical model describe normal prostatic epithelium progress pre-malignant low-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia ( PIN ) . Then , genetic alteration , succession histologically apparent adenocarcinoma -- first confine , metastatic , finally refractory hormone treatment ensues . Current molecular research show already complex genetics alteration high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia stage . Thus , invasive disease represent amplification aberration precursor event . The seminal event event recognize undiscovered tumor suppressor gene proto-oncogene may principal tumor marker . The purpose study identify specific , share , consistent , chromosomal rearrangement find metaphase preparation short-term culture pathologically identify score primary prostate tumor . These , tumor specimen obtain patient enrol protocol ( 97-C-0147 ) NCI . Fresh tumor , take bi-valved specimen one half undergoing tissue pathology , immediately place growth medium transfer cod specimen sample patient select enrolled protocol ( 97-C-0147 ) . Informed consent obtain participate investigator NCI protocol . The outcome measurement characterization , failure characterization , specific , shared consistent , chromosomal rearrangement . Current molecular cytogenetics technology , primarily utilize chromosomal microdissection , employ toward goal . Ultimately , research may help focus molecular study towards ultimate goal find unique , cancer specific alteration .</detailed_description>
