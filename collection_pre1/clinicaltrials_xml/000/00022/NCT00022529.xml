	<brief_summary>Phase I trial study effectiveness BMS-214662 plus trastuzumab treating patient advance solid tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Monoclonal antibody trastuzumab locate tumor cell either kill deliver tumor-killing substance without harm normal cell . Combining monoclonal antibody therapy chemotherapy may kill tumor cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BMS-214662 Plus Trastuzumab Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose recommended phase II dose BMS-214662 combined trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) patient advance solid tumor . II . Determine dose-limiting toxic effect regimen patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine pharmacokinetics regimen patient . Ii . Determine , preliminary manner , antitumor activity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study BMS-214662 . Patients receive BMS-214662 IV 1 hour day 2 , 8 , 15 , 22 trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) IV 30-90 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos BMS-214662 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Once MTD determine , additional patient accrue receive treatment BMS-214662 trastuzumab recommend phase II dose . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 3-28 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
