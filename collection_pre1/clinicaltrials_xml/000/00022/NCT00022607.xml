	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill deliver cancer-killing substance . Thalidomide may stop growth cancer cell stop blood flow tumor . It yet know whether bevacizumab work well without thalidomide multiple myeloma . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial see bevacizumab work well without thalidomide treat patient relapsed refractory multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab With Without Thalidomide Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare response rate time progression patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma treat bevacizumab without thalidomide . - Compare toxicity regimens patient . - Compare effect regimens histological molecular biomarkers angiogenesis , tumor invasion , cell death patient . - Correlate plasma urine vascular endothelial growth factor basic fibroblast growth factor level potential marker angiogenesis myeloma cell proliferation outcome patient treat regimen . - Determine pharmacokinetics thalidomide patient . - Compare effect regimens psychological/physical well patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior treatment thalidomide ( yes v ) . Patients receive prior treatment thalidomide randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 , 15 , 29 , 43 . Patients also receive oral thalidomide daily . - Arm II : Patients receive bevacizumab arm I . Patients receive prior treatment thalidomide receive bevacizumab arm I . Courses repeat every 56 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow monthly 3 month every 3-4 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 55-103 patient ( 16-32 receive prior thalidomide , 16-32 arm I , 23-39 arm II ) accrue study within 2.5 year .</detailed_description>
