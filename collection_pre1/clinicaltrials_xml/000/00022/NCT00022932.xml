	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety effectiveness use Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody treatment patient large B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) achieve response follow 6-8 cycle CHOP therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody Intermediate Grade Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma Following First Line CHOP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary endpoint determine incidence Grade IV hematologic toxicity follow Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody consolidation patient diffuse large B-cell NHL achieve response ( PR , CRu , CR ) follow first-line CHOP chemotherapy . The secondary efficacy endpoint determine complete response rate , duration response , duration complete response , progression-free survival , time treatment failure . The pharmacokinetic endpoint determine total body residence time follow dosimetric dose . The secondary safety endpoint determine incidence adverse experience , hematologic toxicity ( e.g. , nadir , time nadir , time recovery ) , use supportive care , percent patient convert human anti-murine antibody ( HAMA ) positivity , survival .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically confirm initial diagnosis de novo diffuse large Bcell NHL accord REAL classification . This include intermediate grade International Working Formulation subtypes diffuse , mixed small cell large cell ; diffuse large cell ; follicular large cell ; mantle cell , large cell immunoblastic . Patients must Ann Arbor , stage III stage IV , bulky Stage II disease diagnosis . Patients must less equal 80 year age IPI score . Patients must less average 25 % intratrabecular marrow space involve NHL bilateral bone marrow biopsy specimen assess microscopically study entry . A unilateral bone marrow biopsy demonstrate &lt; 10 % involvement NHL also adequate . Verification bone marrow status must perform time response evaluation follow CHOP chemotherapy within 56 day study enrollment . Patients must treat 6 cycle firstline CHOP chemotherapy achieve PR , CRu , CR . Patients must available compute tomography ( CT ) scan chest , abdomen , pelvis , bone marrow biopsy perform within 56 day prior start CHOP . In addition , must write documentation ( i.e. , copy original medical note radiographic report ) describe preCHOP stag evaluation , number cycle CHOP administer , dose agent , start stop date cycle , postCHOP response evaluation . The postCHOP response evaluation must include CT scan chest , abdomen , pelvis ( gallium scan optional ) . For patient palpable cervical lymphadenopathy , CT scan neck must perform follow CHOP chemotherapy . The CHOP chemotherapy consist standard dose agent , although dosereduction permit . CHOP cycle delay also permit . The patient must enrol within 56 day first day last cycle CHOP chemotherapy within 35 day follow response evaluation CHOP chemotherapy . Patients must evidence tumor tissue express CD20 antigen . Patients must performance status least 60 % Karnofsky Performance Scale anticipate survival least 3 month .
