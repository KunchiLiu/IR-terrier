	<brief_title>Temozolomide Treating Patients With Relapsed Progressive Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine efficacy temozolomide , term response rate safety , patient relapse progressive small cell lung cancer . - Determine time progression overall survival patient treated drug . - Assess quality life patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord response prior chemotherapy ( chemosensitive least 60 day prior therapy vs chemoresistant le 60 day progression prior therapy ) . Patients receive oral temozolomide daily day 1-7 15-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess prior course chemotherapy , 30 day study completion , every 8 week thereafter . Patients follow 30 day every 8 week thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 37-79 patient ( 14-33 chemosensitive 23-46 chemoresistant ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
