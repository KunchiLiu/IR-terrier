	<brief_summary>The goal research project develop new system use laser provide 3-dimensional ( 3-D ) image cervical spine ( seven spinal bone neck ) move person . Doctors researcher could use system examine people spinal disorder learn spine work . The laser technique would better exist image method would provide 3-D view cervical spine would expose patient radiation . These two feature would make laser system safer effective tool image system . This technique suitable wide variety use sensitivity measurement adjust depend study . The benefit research include help doctor health practitioner detect diagnose painful spinal disorder effectively . This lead improve treatment management spinal disorder .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>3-D Laser Imaging Analyze Neck Movement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An improved method spinal visualization important examination treatment people diagnose scoliosis , spinal instability , painful cervical spine lumbar disorder depend good spinal imaging . A system would allow three-dimensional analysis spine move person without risk limitation radiation would greatly enhance research intervention need improve understand spine position movement . Moreover , extremely important physician , physical therapist , athletic trainer , coach , movement scientist rely accurate yet reliable device measure spine activity research . The objective study develop novel automate , nondestructive 3-D laser image system cervical spine motion analysis . The image system base shadow Moir√Ω interferometry finger pattern analysis . The propose technique would superior exist method radiography potential allow 3-D visualization elimination patient exposure radiation . These two attribute would make laser system safer effective tool . We hypothesize laser-based system surpass conventional motion analysis system video motion analysis system , inclinometer , flexible ruler , goniometer , posture grid accuracy , reliability , validity measurement spinal motion position . The technique possess several advantage respect simplicity , versatility suitability operation different environment . The sensitivity measurement adjust base nature object investigation . This make technique suitable wide variety application . The benefit basic study include assist physician allied health practitioner effectively detect diagnose painful spinal disorder . This ultimately enhance treatment management spinal disorder . We plan test device 134 people recruit Northern Illinois University surround community . Thirty-four study participant ( 25 % ) patient seek medical , chiropractic , physical therapy intervention complaint neck pain Northern Illinois University Health Service Northern Illinois area medical , chiropractic , physical therapy facility . The rest participant complaint neck pain .</detailed_description>
