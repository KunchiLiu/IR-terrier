	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody NHL Patients With Greater Than 25 % Bone Marrow Involvement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary endpoint determine maximum tolerate dose Iodine-131 Anti B-1 Antibody patient previously treat NHL 25 % bone marrow involvement lymphoma . Secondary endpoint include assessment response rate , duration response , relapse-free survival , time treatment failure , safety , survival . The dose escalation start 45cGy escalate 10cGy increment maximum tolerate dose reach .</detailed_description>
