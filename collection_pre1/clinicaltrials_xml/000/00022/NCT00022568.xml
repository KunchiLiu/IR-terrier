	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine maximum tolerate dose recombinant vaccinia-TRICOM vaccine patient metastatic melanoma . - Determine clinical toxic effect vaccine patient . - Determine safety vaccine patient . - Determine clinical response patient vaccine . - Determine evidence host anti-melanoma immune reactivity patient treatment vaccine . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive recombinant vaccinia-TRICOM vaccine every 4 week total 3 vaccination . Patients stable respond disease may receive additional course vaccination . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos recombinant vaccinia-TRICOM vaccine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Quality life assess baseline , vaccine administration , study completion . Patients follow 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 12-18 patient accrue study within 6-12 month .</detailed_description>
