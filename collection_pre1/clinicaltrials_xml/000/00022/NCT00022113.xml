	<brief_title>EMD 121974 Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine toxic effect maximum tolerate dose EMD 121974 patient advance solid tumor . II . Determine biologic activity drug patient . III . Determine pharmacokinetic profile plasma biological effect drug identify relationship biologic activity observe toxicity patient . IV . Determine , preliminarily , antitumor efficacy drug patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive EMD 121974 IV 1 hour twice weekly . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-10 patient receive escalate dos EMD 121974 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity .</detailed_description>
