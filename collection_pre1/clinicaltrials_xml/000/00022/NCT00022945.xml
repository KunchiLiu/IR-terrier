	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody Plus CHOP For Untreated Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary efficacy endpoint study determine duration response sequential administration Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody follow six cycle CHOP patient previously untreated MCL . The secondary efficacy endpoint study determine response rate , confirm response rate , complete response rate , confirm complete response rate , duration response confirm responder , duration response complete responder , duration response confirm complete responder , progression-free survival , time treatment failure , predictive value detection minimal residual disease molecular technique response duration . The pharmacokinetic endpoint determine total body residence time Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody follow dosimetric dose . The safety endpoint determine incidence adverse experience , hematologic toxicity , ( e.g. , nadir , time nadir , time recovery ) , use supportive care , percent patient convert human anti-murine antibody ( HAMA ) positivity , effect Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody growth function hematopoietic progenitor cell , survival patient previously untreated MCL treat Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody follow six cycle CHOP .</detailed_description>
