The loss sense taste old people play role decrease appetite poor nutrition . Taste deficit may adversely affect people way well understood . This study examine people ( one-fourth people United States ) taste substance call phenylthiocarbamide ( PTC ) . The inability taste PTC due inherit factor yet clear . Individuals age 18 old taste PTC individual taste PTC may eligible study . Participants taste number liquid solution find one clear taste . Then taste another group solution decide one taste taste .

	<detailed_description>The primary goal study identify underlying cause deficit ability taste different commonly consume substance , include bitter compound phenylthiocarbamide ( PTC ) model . Individuals test identify taste PTC , well ability taste variety sweet , sour , salty , savory substance . Individuals 20 cc blood drawn obtain DNA . These DNA sample analyze variation gene whose product know involved taste perception pathway . Information individual DNA sequence variation correlate taste phenotype identify specific genetic variation cause phenotypic variation , provide molecular structure-function information taste sensory pathway .</detailed_description>
