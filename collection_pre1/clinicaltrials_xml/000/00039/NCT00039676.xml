	<brief_summary>Background : - Individuals may prone develop blood lymph node cancer ( leukemia lymphoma ) variety reason , include genetic predisposition cancer , environmental exposure medical condition . - Studies people family high risk cancer often lead clue cause may also important regard sporadic occurrence cancer general population . - Identifying genetic environmental factor play role development disease may important develop prevention trial , screen program treatment . Objectives : - Describe cancer condition family blood lymph node cancer . - Find describe gene may cause blood lymph node cancer , understand work family . - Use laboratory method try determine possible identify high risk blood lymph node cancer . - Test gene act factor alter risk disease , severity manifestation family . Eligibility : - Individuals age personal family history blood lymph node cancer . - Individuals personal family history medical condition environmental exposure may predispose blood lymph node cancer . Design : - Participants complete questionnaire personal family medical history provide consent researcher review medical record pathology material relate care decease relative blood lymph node cancer , tumor , related illness legally authorize representative . - Participants donate sample blood cheek cell , lock hair genetic study . - Patients may also evaluate NIH Clinical Center one follow specialist : cancer doctor blood specialist , medical geneticist , research nurse clinical social worker . They may blood urine test cheek swab mouth wash collect cheek cell . Some patient may also ask x-rays routine imaging , CT scan ultrasound test , cell surface marker , skin biopsy , , special consent , bone marrow biopsy , MRI PET scan , apheresis fluorescein angiography photography .</brief_summary>
