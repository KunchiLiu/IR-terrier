	<brief_summary>Phase II trial study effectiveness combine zoledronate BMS-275291 treating patient prostate cancer respond previous hormone therapy . Zoledronate may prevent bone loss stop growth tumor cell bone . BMS-275291 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary cancer cell growth . Combining zoledronate BMS-275291 may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate confirm response rate hormone refractory prostate cancer patient treat Zometa BMS-275291 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate toxicity profile associate treatment patient population . II . To evaluate overall progression-free survival associate treatment regimen . III . To explore change marker bone turnover , fPYR , fDPYR , serum sample cross-linked N-telopeptides baseline . IV . To assess change bone tumor metabolism treatment use PET scan . V. To assess change MMP-1 , MMP-9 , VEGF bFGF baseline treatment . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior chemotherapy ( yes v ) participate center . ARM I : Patients receive zoledronate IV least 15 minute day 1 oral BMS-275291 daily day 1-28 . ARM II ( CLOSED TO ACCRUAL AS OF 10/10/2003 ) : Patients receive zoledronate Arm I . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month disease progression every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
