	<brief_summary>The purpose study use brain image technology examine role certain brain chemical individual Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) healthy volunteer . Cognitive dysfunction people AD think arise decreased chemical activity specific part brain . Decreases alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetycholine receptor ( nAChRs ) find brain people die AD ; however , status receptor system live brain remain unclear . This study use single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) study receptor system people AD mild moderate dementia healthy volunteer . In addition , study examine relationship cognitive dysfunction nAChR deficit brain individual AD . Participants AD four clinic visit ; healthy volunteer three visit . At Visit 1 , participant undergo medical history , physical examination , laboratory test . Healthy volunteer Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) cognitive function test . Participants AD MMSE measurement severity dementia . During Visit 2 , participant undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan brain . At Visit 3 , participant undergo SPECT imaging . Only participants AD participate Visit 4 . During visit , cognitive testing perform .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cognitive dysfunction Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) patient think arise part underlying loss cholinergic input cerebral cortex hippocampus . Consistent marked decrease alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChRs ) find postmortem AD brain . However , knowledge vivo status receptor system limit due lack suitable tracer PET/SPECT image . We plan use new SPECT tracer , [ 123I ] 5-I-A-85380 , appear suitable image alpha4beta2 subtype nAChRs , order delineate abnormality receptor system `` subgroup '' 20 mild moderately demented AD patient 20 age match healthy control , `` subgroup '' characterize carry AD susceptibility Apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele . In addition , plan examine relationship cognitive dysfunction alpha4beta2 nAChr deficit cerebral cortex hippocampus AD patient . This study represent initial effort toward long-term goal understanding role important receptor system play pathophysiological mechanism drug manipulation AD .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA ALZHEIMER 'S DISEASE PATIENTS : All AD patient meet NINCDSADRDA criterion probable AD age onset 50 65 year age . The AD patient mild moderately demented assessed Mattis Dementia Rating Scale MiniMental State Examination . In particular , AD patient nonsmoker know effect smoke nAChRs . Patients characterize APOE genotype nAChR change might different differ dos allele . We exclude AD patient participate AChe inhibitor . EXCLUSION CRITERIA ALZHEIMER 'S DISEASE PATIENTS : We exclude patient galanthamine ( Reminyl ) . We exclude patient antidepressant and/or psychotropic drug . INCLUSION CRITERIA CONTROLS : Nonsmoking healthy individual satisfy inclusion exclusion criterion .</criteria>
