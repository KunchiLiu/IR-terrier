	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect monoclonal antibody therapy treat patient ovarian epithelial cancer , melanoma , acute myeloid leukemia , myelodysplastic syndrome , non-small cell lung cancer . Monoclonal antibody locate tumor cell either kill deliver tumor-killing substance without harm normal cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody Therapy Treating Patients With Ovarian Epithelial Cancer , Melanoma , Acute Myeloid Leukemia , Myelodysplastic Syndrome , Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety MDX-CTLA-4 patient previously previously vaccinate GM-CSF-based vaccine use lethally irradiate , autologous melanoma , ovarian cancer , acute myelogenous leukemia/myelodysplasia lung cancer cell . II . To identify preliminary evidence biologic activity efficacy . OUTLINE : Patients receive anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody IV 90 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 2 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow monthly disease progression . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 48 patient ( 12 per disease type ; 36 previously treat sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) -expressing autologous tumor cell vaccine 12 previously treat vaccine ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
