	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Internal radiation therapy use radioactive material place directly near tumor kill tumor cell . Using radiolabeled glass bead kill tumor cell may effective treatment liver cancer remove surgery . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect hepatic arterial infusion use yttrium-90 microspheres ( TheraSphere® ) see well work treat patient liver cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Provide supervised access yttrium-90 glass microspheres ( TheraSphere® ) patient unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma . - Determine response patient unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma treat hepatic arterial infusion yttrium-90 glass microspheres . - Determine toxic effect adverse experience associate therapy patient . - Determine survival time patient treat therapy . - Determine time progression disease liver , duration response , progression-free interval patient treat therapy . - Evaluate influence pretreatment characteristic efficacy parameter patient treat therapy . - Assess quality life patient treat therapy . OUTLINE : Radioactive material yttrium-90 glass microspheres ( TheraSphere® ) infuse directly liver tumor order kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Patients receive TheraSphere® via hepatic arterial infusion day 1 . This artery access femoral artery groin . This procedure generally complete outpatient basis . Patients may receive single dose whole liver , sequential treatment side liver approximately 30 90 day apart . Patients may re-treated late time . Patients follow every 2 4 month rest live access tumor progression , symptom management quality life .</detailed_description>
