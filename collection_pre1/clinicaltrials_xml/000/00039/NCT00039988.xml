	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effect glatiramer acetate ( Copaxone ) alone compare Copaxone plus albuterol patient Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) . MS think autoimmune disease central nervous system . Certain white blood cell immune system become abnormally active mistakenly attack myelin nerve fiber . Myelin fatty sheath surround nerve fiber insulates nerve like insulation around electrical wire . Without proper myelin insulation , message send brain part body may confuse fail completely . Damage myelin cause symptom MS . The common form MS know relapsing-remitting ( RR ) , partial total recovery occur attack . Four therapy currently approve treatment MS . These therapy , however , moderately effective cause undesirable side effect . For reason , need find new therapy minimal side effect may stop disease get bad .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>MS chronic inflammatory disease central nervous system characterize focal T cell macrophage infiltrate lead demyelination loss neurologic function . Four therapy currently approve treatment MS. Three approve treatment patient relapsing-remitting ( RR ) form MS , patient clinical exacerbation follow partial complete recovery function . These treatment modestly effective associate significant toxicity , often cause patient delay therapy significant lengths time . Thus , need find therapy low toxicity administer early disease course potential arresting disease . During pre-treatment phase , patient undergo neurological exam , include extend disability status scale ( EDSS ) , Ambulation Index ( AI ) , disease step ( DS ) scale MS functional composite score , PASAT , 9 hole peg test , 25 foot walking time . A 12-lead electrocardiogram ( EKG ) chest x-ray performed . Serum chemistry assess well electrolyte thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) level . A brain MRI ( without gadolinium ) , urinalysis , urine pregnancy test ( woman reproductive potential ) perform . Blood collect mechanistic study . In treatment phase , patient assign randomly 1 2 study arm : Arm 1 : Copaxone plus placebo . Arm 2 : Copaxone plus albuterol . At treatment visit , blood collect neurological exam brain MRI perform . A pregnancy test administer woman reproductive potential . Neurological exam perform every 6 month . MRIs perform baseline , Year 1 , Year 2 . At end study , patient complete physical exam , neurological exam , brain MRI .</detailed_description>
