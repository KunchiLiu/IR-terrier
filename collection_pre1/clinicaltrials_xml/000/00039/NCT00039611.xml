	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Provide oxaliplatin combination fluorouracil leucovorin calcium use FOLFOX4 regimen front-line treatment patient prior chemotherapy advance colorectal cancer eligible entry ongoing clinical trial high priority . ( The regimen Treatment Referral Center protocol one found superior recent national intergroup study . ) - Further determine safety regimen patient . - Further determine anti-tumor activity regimen , define rate time-to-treatment failure , time progression , survival , patient . - Capture data subsequent salvage therapy administer patient treat protocol . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour day 1 2 , fluorouracil IV 22 hour day 1 2 . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients clinical evidence benefit treatment , define stable disease , partial response , complete response well increase size measurable evaluable lesion new site disease , may eligible additional course . Patients follow death . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A maximum 300 patient per month accrue study .</detailed_description>
