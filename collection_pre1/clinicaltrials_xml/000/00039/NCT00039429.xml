	<brief_title>Atrasentan Treating Patients With Locally Recurrent Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine 6-month progression-free survival rate , term proportion measurable disease bone metastasis , patient locally recurrent metastatic renal cell carcinoma treat atrasentan ( measurable disease stratum close accrual 7/16/04 ) . - Determine toxicity drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior immunotherapy/biologic therapy ( yes v ) characteristic disease ( measurable v bone metastasis ) ( measurable disease stratum close accrual 7/16/04 ) . Patients receive oral atrasentan daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 180 patient ( 90 per stratum [ without prior therapy ] ) accrue study within 6 month ( base prior accrual , bone metastasis group [ specifically patient receive 1 prior therapy ] stratum open accrual ) .</detailed_description>
