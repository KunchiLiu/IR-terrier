	<brief_summary>Diltiazem CD amlodipine drug use treat heart disease high blood pressure . The purpose study find drug interact anti-HIV drug indinavir ritonavir . The study also look safety take study drug together . Heart disease high blood pressure major health concern people HIV . Standard treatment illness often include calcium channel blocker ( CCBs ) . There potential significant drug interaction CCBs HIV protease inhibitor ( PIs ) may influence dosing , monitoring , choose CCBs PIs use people infected HIV . This study examine drug interaction 2 commonly use CCBs PI combination indinavir ritonavir ( IDV/RTV ) . This information help doctor choose appropriate treatment high blood pressure heart disease people take PIs .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ischemic cardiovascular disease hypertension occur person HIV infection , incidence prevalence may increase time infected population age . Standard pharmacologic intervention illness often include calcium channel blocker ( CCBs ) . Many calcium channel blocker metabolize cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP 3A4 ) , inhibited protease inhibitor ( PIs ) . Thus , potential clinically significant interaction CCBs PIs . The presence significant drug-drug interaction may influence dosing , monitoring , choose CCBs and/or PIs use person HIV infection . Because potential concomitant use CCBs PI combination IDV/RTV , study evaluate bi-directional drug-drug interaction 2 commonly use CCBs IDV/RTV . This information assist clinician choose appropriate CCBs treat hypertension cardiovascular disease person take PIs . Patients randomize 1 follow 2 arm : Arm A : diltiazem CD interaction IDV RTV . Arm B : amlodipine interaction IDV RTV . From Days 1 7 , patient take diltiazem CD ( Arm A ) amlodipine ( Arm B ) . Plasma collect PK 24-hour period begin Day 7 . From Days 8 19 , patient stop take assigned CCB take IDV RTV . Plasma collect PK 12-hour period Day 19 . From Days 20 26 , patient continue take IDV RTV add diltiazem CD ( Arm A ) amlodipine ( Arm B ) . Patients stop 3 drug last dose Day 26 . Plasma collect PK 24-hour period begin Day 26 . Blood work , liver kidney function test , urinalysis , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) perform visit .</detailed_description>
