	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate Treating Patients With Myelofibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate ( complete partial ) STI-571 patient myelofibrosis . II . To determine safety STI-571 patient myelofibrosis . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect STI-571 bone marrow morphology ( include effect marrow fibrosis , osteosclerosis cellularity ) patient myelofibrosis . II . To assess effect STI-571 surrogate biologic endpoint include PDGFR expression ( immunohistochemistry ) , PDGFR signal , circulate progenitor ( CD34 positive ) cell . III . To determine effect STI-571 bone marrow cytogenetics patient abnormal karyotype . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord Dupriez risk score ( low v intermediate v high ) . Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day 12 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
