	<brief_summary>This study compare effectiveness two blood thinner , heparin lepirudin , prevent withdrawal occlusion ( blockage ) venous access device ( VAD ) . A VAD catheter ( plastic tube ) place vein beneath collarbone deliver medication withdraw blood sample treatment . The device may become clogged , possibly formation clot around tip , block open make difficult impossible use . The clot dissolve medication call tPA . The blood thinner heparin use many year try prevent blockage occurring , still problem many 25 percent VADs . This study test whether new blood thinner call lepirudin effective heparin prevent withdrawal occlusion cause small clot . Patients 21 year age old enrol NIH protocol Clinical Center require tunnel , open-ended VADs medical care may eligible study . Candidates must expect receive primary medical care Clinical Center first 4 week VAD insert care Clinical Center next 3 month . Participants randomly assign receive either heparin lepirudin flush first 3 4 week placement VAD-the period withdrawal occlusion likely occur . After period , patient use routine heparin flush VAD remove . The patient 's VAD closely monitor withdrawal occlusion 3- 4-week test period continue observe 3 month check lasting effect blood thinner .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This protocol test whether new anticoagulant , lepirudin , superior heparin prevent withdrawal occlusion tunnel , open-ended venous access device ( VADs ) . At Clinical Center approximately 25 % VADs develop withdrawal occlusion require treatment recombinant tissue plasminogen activator ( rtPA ) . Because withdrawal occlusion frequently cause accumulation clot catheter tip , open-ended VADs routinely flush heparinized saline . In theory lepirudin effective prevent accumulation fibrin catheter tip counteract potent clot enzyme thrombin bound fibrin , whereas heparin less able . In protocol assignment flush solution randomize . Because withdrawal occlusion present within week catheter insertion , blind flush heparin lepirudin give least daily first 3 - 4 week catheterization . Then VADs begin unblinded routine flush heparin . The primary study endpoint number patient group require rtPA withdrawal occlusion first 4 month VAD insert . To detect 50 % reduction rtPA usage one-sided significance criterion 0.05 power 0.80 , 147 patient require treatment arm , although accrual goal 170 patient per arm allow small number unevaluable subject . Since tunnel , open-ended VADs Clinical Center use patient bone marrow transplant protocol NCI NHLBI , population primary source participant .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All patient must : Be great equal 18 year old . Be enrol protocols Clinical Center . Require tunnel , openended VADs primary care . Have VADs insert Clinical Center Interventional Radiology . Intend receive majority primary medical care Clinical Center first 4 month VAD insert . Have serum creatinine less equal 2.5 mg/dL glomerular filtration rate great equal 50 mL/minute . Expect platelet count 70,000/microliter without transfusion support first 4 week study anytime hospitalize . Have normal blood coagulation . This define either prothrombin time aPTT within laboratory 's normal range ( 11.814.7 sec 23.434.5 sec respectively ) , hemostatic coagulation factor level patient prolong prothrombin time and/or aPTTs explain mild factor VII deficiency ( 3040 % ) lupus anticoagulant . If patient prolong aPTT due lupus anticoagulant , he/she must normal thrombin time order include study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : A preference primary investigator use saline flush patient 's VAD . A history hypersensitivity heparin , include heparininduced thrombocytopenia . ( Note patient exclude simply he/she participate protocol previous VAD he/she still previously insert VAD leave place . )</criteria>
