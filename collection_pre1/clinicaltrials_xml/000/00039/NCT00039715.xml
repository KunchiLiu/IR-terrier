	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether people develop Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) trauma increase sensitivity effect stress hormone . Patients PTSD small hippocampal volume deficit hippocampal-mediated memory compare healthy people . However , unclear whether small hippocampus consequence PTSD risk factor development PTSD . Some researcher believe people develop PTSD increase cortisol level traumatic experience could neurotoxic hippocampus . Others hypothesize increased sensitivity glucocorticoid receptor cortisol , regardless cortisol level , could lead neurotoxic damage hippocampus . This study compare response stress hormone patient PTSD , participant experience trauma PTSD , healthy volunteer . Participants screen medical psychiatric interview , physical examination , blood test , electrocardiogram , emotional intelligence evaluation . Those eligible study ask collect urine saliva sample 3 day . Participation also include blood draw , PET scan ( brain imaging ) , eye-blink test , neuropsychological testing , procedure . At another study visit , participant undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan ( brain imaging ) , questionnaire , procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Hydrocortisone Patients With Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients post traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) relate combat civilian trauma find small hippocampal volume , deficit hippocampal mediated memory , compare control . However , clear small hippocampus consequence extreme trauma PTSD , risk factor development PTSD . Researchers support causal hypothesis propose increased level cortisol traumatic experience could neurotoxic hippocampus . Several study confirm increase level cortisol stress . However , plasma urine measure cortisol patient PTSD mix ; report increase decrease normal cortisol . The possibility increase sensitivity Type II glucocorticoid receptor circulate cortisol could lead neurotoxic damage hippocampus , despite normal low peripheral level cortisol propose . Furthermore , increase sensitivity glucocorticoid receptor PTSD could lead strong negative feedback inhibition , thereby offer mechanism paradoxical observation lower ACTH cortisol level PTSD . Studies attempt test glucocorticoid receptor super sensitivity theory PTSD confirm presence increase number sensitivity lymphocyte glucocorticoid receptor patient compare healthy subject . However , currently publish report investigate central glucocorticoid sensitivity patient PTSD . A recent study healthy subject Alzheimer 's disease demonstrate central glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity measure hydrocortisone mediate inhibition glucose metabolism measure positron emission tomography ( PET ) 2-deoxy-2 [ F ] fluoro-D-glucose ( FDG ) . We propose evaluate metabolic , cognitive , behavioral effect hydrocortisone placebo administration patient PTSD , subject experienced trauma develop PTSD ( trauma control ) healthy subject .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . The study sample consist : Patients primary diagnosis PTSD due noncombat combat relate trauma accord DSMIV . Subjects noncombat relate traumatic experience without current PTSD Healthy subject without current past history psychiatric major medical illness . 2 . All subject 18 60 year old . 3 . Male female subject include . 4 . All subject must able give write informed consent prior participation study . 5 . Patients PTSD must score great equal 50 ClinicianAdministered PTSD Scale measure PTSD symptom severity include study . 6 . Patients currently medication PTSD . ( Patients discontinue effective medication purpose study ) . 7 . Patients nonresponders psychotropic drug must discontinue least 2 week prior first PET scan . Medications discontinue supervision treat physician research psychiatrist list protocol . ( Nonresponders define subject continue meet criterion PTSD despite treatment 30 mg equivalent paroxetine minimum duration six week ) . 7 . All eligible subject must good physical health confirm complete physical exam ( include normal vital sign ) , electrocardiogram , neurological exam , routine laboratory test blood urine . [ However , patient participate research study blood work primary MD within last 6 month , result use instead repeat blood draw inclusion study . ] EXCLUSION CRITERIA 1 . Subjects clinically significant cardiovascular , pulmonary , endocrine , neurological , gastrointestinal illness unstable medical disorder . 2 . Patients would unable comply study procedures assessment . 3 . Subjects primary trauma related motor vehicle accident . 4 . Patients meet DSMIV criterion alcohol and/or substance abuse substance dependence within 6 month prior screen . 5 . Patients currently fluoxetine ( Justification : Washout fluoxetine could take six week ) . 6 . Patients currently high risk homicide suicide . 7 . Subjects current past history axis I disorder like schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder , bipolar disorder dementia exclude study . However , comorbid history Axis 1 disorder like major depression , dysthymia panic disorder include study . Justification : Approximately 70 % subject PTSD comorbid depression alcohol abuse ; review 134 . Restricting sample PTSD patient without depression accurately reflect biology disorder ] . 8 . Subjects history peptic ulcer disease exclude . ( Justification : Those history acid peptic disease require antacid past exclude , although unlikely single dose intravenous hydrocortisone could precipitate bleed due gastritis peptic ulcer disease ) . 9 . Women childbearing potential practicing clinically accept method contraception positive pregnancy test lactating . 10 . Subjects donate Red Cross unit blood within 60 day prior participation study .</criteria>
