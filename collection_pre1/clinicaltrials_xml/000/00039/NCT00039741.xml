	<detailed_description>Antiretroviral therapy child aim prolong clinical immunologic health . Currently , data define particular highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) strategy optimal first-line therapy child . This study evaluate long-term efficacy two HAART regimen use initial therapy : 1 ) two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) plus protease inhibitor ( PI ) , 2 ) two NRTIs plus nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) . It also evaluate different strategy switch therapy initial regimen fails . The long-term nature study clarify whether early switch therapy improve immunologic virologic outcome , result rapid exhaustion treatment option . The study conduct United States Europe . Participants study CD4 cell count viral load test screen visit . Participants entry visit include blood urine test . Participants randomly assign one four group : Groups PI/1K PI/30K receive two NRTIs plus PI ; Groups NNRTI/1K NNRTI/30K receive two NRTIs plus NNRTI . The medication allow study : abacavir , didanosine , emtricitabine , emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate , lamivudine , lamivudine/zidovudine , stavudine , tenofovir disoproxil fumarate , zalcitabine , zidovudine ( NRTIs ) ; efavirenz nevirapine ( NNRTIs ) ; efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumurate ( NNRTI/NRTI ) ; amprenavir , atazanavir , darunavir , fosamprenavir calcium , indinavir , lopinavir/ritonavir , nelfinavir , saquinavir , ritonavir , tipranavir ( PIs ) . Note : Per 06/28/05 amendment trial , emtricitabine , emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate , tenofovir dioproxil fumarate add list medication could include participant 's treatment regimen . For participant whose initial regimen fail , experience clinical disease progression ( indicate development new CDC Category C diagnosis ) clinical disease progression Week 24 first-line therapy , second-line therapy strongly encourage . ( However , poor adherence suspect possible reason increase HIV viral load , site clinician try improve patient adherence obtain additional confirmatory viral load value within five-week time frame . ) In second-line therapy , participant initially take NRTIs PI switch NRTIs NNRTI . Participants initially take NRTIs NNRTI switch NRTIs PI . The timing switch base participant 's group : Groups PI/1K NNRTI/1K switch second-line treatment viral load 1,000 copies/ml great ; Groups PI/30K NNRTI/30K switch second-line treatment viral load 30,000 copies/ml great . Participants fail second-line therapy discontinue study treatment offer best available therapy discretion clinician . Participants study visit Weeks 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 24 , every 12 week thereafter drug regimen switch second-line treatment . Participants re-entry visit schedule visit restart . Participants study 4 7 year , depend enrol . All study visit include medical history , physical exam , blood collection . Urine collection occur visit . Participants ask complete adherence questionnaire PACTG participant underwent neuropsychological assessment select visit . All participant study encourage coenroll PACTG 219C , Long-Term Effects HIV Exposure Infection Children . Participants European portion study may ask enroll substudy observe development progression lipodystrophy syndrome child .</detailed_description>
