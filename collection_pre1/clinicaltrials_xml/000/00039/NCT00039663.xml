	<brief_summary>Highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) proven effective alter natural history HIV infection many patient . However , therapy may sustainable toxicity medication . Evidence suggest HIV-infected patient HAART may risk premature coronary artery disease . The exact cause unknown . It possible medication directly affect endothelium ( line artery supply blood heart ) lead premature heart disease . Or medication cause lipid abnormality ( high cholesterol ) condition relative insulin resistance , body difficult time process sugar ; know risk factor endothelial dysfunction heart disease . Therapeutic intervention revers lipid abnormality and/or insulin resistance may lower risk factor , normalize endothelial function , decrease risk heart disease . This protocol aim assess endothelial function among group HIV-infected patient vary degrees viral activity level immune function variety HAART regimens . It also aim evaluate effect three different medication lipid , insulin resistance , thus endothelial function . Understanding factor involve cause endothelial dysfunction help well characterize relative risk benefit early versus late continuous versus intermittent HAART therapy . The research may offer insight cause premature heart disease among HIV-infected patient HAART could thoroughly investigate subsequent clinical trial . A total 75 patient recruit : 25 arm study . Each arm evaluate potential benefit particular medication enroll sequentially . An endothelial function test perform outpatient basis . The first 25 patient assigned random receive pravastatin sodium placebo ; next 25 receive gemfibrozil placebo ; final 25 receive rosiglitazone placebo . Patients take pill 6 week , pill next 4 week , opposite treatment 6 week . Two week start study drug , blood take check potential toxic side effect . After 6-week treatment , blood drawn endothelial function test perform .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The natural history HIV infection many patient dramatically alter use highly-active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) . However , treatment paradigm chronic chemotherapy may sustainable give short long-term toxicity medication . Among concern development atherogenic lipoprotein abnormality state relative insulin resistance . Logically , concern metabolic disturbance may predispose towards cardiovascular morbidity mortality . Although therapy widespread use short period time , grow body evidence case report cohort study suggest HIV-infected patient HAART may experience premature coronary artery disease . The explanation phenomenon likely multifactorial . In term pathophysiology , relative contribution HIV viral replication , host immune response , use antiretroviral agent remain unknown . HIV-1 could possibly direct effect endothelium suggest infectious agent chlamydia , herpes simplex , cytomegalovirus . One could postulate virus might capacity effect production nitric oxide ( NO ) , pathogenic mechanism . It unknown whether medication direct toxicity whether common underlie mechanism drug-induced abnormality lipid and/or glucose metabolism . Furthermore , intervention therapeutic reverse metabolic disturbance might ameliorate risk factor , normalize endothelial function , thus decrease risk cardiovascular disease among patient population . Even patient high risk HIV-negative patient similar metabolic profile , attention must pay modifiable risk factor patient live longer . This protocol aim assess endothelial function among group HIV-infected patient vary degree virologic control level immune function variety different HAART regimens . These patient administer medication know effect lipid glucose metabolism determine might serve role improve parameter thus endothelial function . The result study hopefully yield effective strategy maintain efficacy HAART therapy minimize reverse toxicity . Understanding factor important cause endothelial dysfunction help well characterize relative risks/benefits early vs. late continuous vs. intermittent HAART therapy . Additionally , hopefully offer insight underlie pathophysiology phenomenon premature cardiovascular disease among HIV-infected patient HAART could thoroughly investigate subsequent clinical trial . We may ultimately learn either virus antiretroviral drug consequent lipid insulin abnormality induce alters NO function level endothelium .</detailed_description>
