	<brief_title>Capecitabine Treating Patients With Persistent Recurrent Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine antitumor activity capecitabine patient persistent recurrent non-squamous cell carcinoma cervix fail high priority treatment protocol . II . Determine nature degree toxicity drug patient . III . Determine whether mRNA tumor expression level thymidylate synthase ( TS ) , dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase ( DPD ) , thymidine phosphorylase ( TP ) baseline potential predictor clinical outcome ( response survival ) patient treat drug . IV . Determine whether serum level TP potential prognostic indicator clinical outcome ( response survival ) patient treat drug . V. Determine whether TS promoter polymorphism peripheral blood potential prognostic indicator clinical outcome ( response survival ) patient treat drug . VI . Determine association among various measure TS , DPD , TP clinical outcome ( response survival ) patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-14 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
