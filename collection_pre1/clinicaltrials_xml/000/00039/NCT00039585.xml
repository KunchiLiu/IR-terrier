	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate Treating Patients With Refractory Relapsed Ovarian Epithelial , Fallopian Tube , Primary Peritoneal Cancer , Ovarian Low Malignant Potential Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine clinical activity imatinib mesylate patient recurrent relapsed ovarian epithelial , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer ovarian low malignant potential tumor . - Correlate biochemical modulation signal transduction pathway downstream platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) c-kit tyrosine kinases biopsy tissue outcome patient treat drug . - Correlate expression PDGFR c-kit archival fresh biopsy tissue response outcome patient treat drug . - Investigate potential antiangiogenic activity drug microdissected tumor cell stromal lysates patient . - Investigate potential collateral receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition biopsy tissue patient treat drug . - Evaluate application surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time-of-flight detection ( SELDI-TOF ) artificial intelligence bioinformatics serially obtain serum sample prediction response patient and/or toxicity drug . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Up 47 patient accrue study within 12-20 month .</detailed_description>
