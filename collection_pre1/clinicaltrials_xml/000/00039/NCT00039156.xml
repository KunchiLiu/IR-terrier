	<brief_title>BAY 59-8862 Treating Patients With Refractory Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine overall tumor response rate , include complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) rate , patient aggressive refractory non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma treat BAY 59-8862 . - Determine overall survival patient treated drug . - Determine time progression patient treat drug . - Determine duration response ( CR PR ) patient treat drug . - Determine qualitative quantitative toxicity profile drug patient population . - Determine pharmacokinetic profile drug select patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter , open-label study . Patients receive BAY 59-8862 IV 1 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month disease progression every 6 month thereafter 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-140 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
