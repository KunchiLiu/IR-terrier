	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Interleukin-2 may stimulate person 's white blood cell kill tumor cell . Histamine dihydrochloride may help interleukin-2 kill tumor cell make tumor cell sensitive drug . It yet know interleukin-2 effective without histamine dihydrochloride treat stage IV melanoma metastatic liver . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness interleukin-2 without histamine dihydrochloride treat patient stage IV melanoma metastatic liver .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interleukin-2 With Without Histamine Dihydrochloride Treating Patients With Stage IV Melanoma Metastatic Liver</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare duration survival patient stage IV melanoma hepatic metastasis treat interleukin-2 without histamine dihydrochloride . - Compare progression-free survival , response rate , response rate hepatic tumor , lack disease progression patient treat regimen . - Determine safety regimen , term frequency , severity , causal relationship adverse event , patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord participate center location ( North America v Europe ) , lactate dehydrogenase ( less ULN v ULN great ) , metastatic site ( liver v liver site ) . Patients randomize one two treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) subcutaneously ( SC ) twice daily day 1 2 week 1 3 day 1-5 week 2 4 . Patients also receive histamine dihydrochloride SC 10-30 minute day 1-5 week 1-4 . - Arm II : Patients receive IL-2 arm I . In arm , treatment repeat every 6 week least 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 3 year every 6 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 224 patient ( 112 per treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
