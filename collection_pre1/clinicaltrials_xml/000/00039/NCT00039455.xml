	<brief_title>Trastuzumab Flavopiridol Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability flavopiridol combination Herceptin HER-2 positive metastatic breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine dose flavopiridol necessary achieve target plasma level 300-500 nM flavopiridol combination fix dose Herceptin . II . To assess feasibility measure cyclin D1 circulate tumor cell tissue biopsy therapy surrogate marker flavopiridol activity . III . To monitor target activity flavopiridol Herceptin plasma , circulate tumor cell tissue biopsy breast cancer patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study flavopiridol . Patients receive trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) IV 30-90 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 follow flavopiridol IV continuously 24 hour day 1 8 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos flavopiridol maximum tolerate dose determine ( MTD ) . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Once MTD determine , additional cohort 10 patient receive flavopiridol MTD trastuzumab weekly schedule ass true toxicity rate . A second cohort 10 patient receive flavopiridol MTD trastuzumab every 21 day assess tolerability schedule . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30-50 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
