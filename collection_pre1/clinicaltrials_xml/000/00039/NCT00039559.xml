	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Screening test may help doctor detect cancer cell early plan effective treatment ovarian cancer . PURPOSE : Screening trial determine significance cancer antigen 125 ( CA125 ) level detect ovarian cancer participant high genetic risk develop ovarian cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Screen Participants Who Are High Genetic Risk Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine feasibility prospective ovarian cancer screen study within Cancer Genetics Network NCI ovarian program participant high genetic risk develop ovarian cancer . - Identify logistical issue screen participant solution within framework . - Establish normal range distribution CA125 value time within high-risk participant , subclassification pre- post-menopausal status , estrogen-replacement therapy usage , prior prophylactic oophorectomy . - Estimate specificity positive predictive value `` risk ovarian cancer algorithm '' ( ROCA ) suitable design definitive trial screen ovarian cancer high-risk participant . - Establish longitudinal serum plasma biorepository retrospective evaluation promise biomarkers special relevance inherit ovarian breast cancer risk . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Participants 1 2 ovary assign group A , whereas participant prior prophylactic bilateral oophorectomy assign group B ( close accrual 10/18/04 ) . At baseline , participant eligible breast cancer susceptibility gene ( BRCA ) mutation criterion family history criterion undergo probability BRCA mutation give family history cancer ( BRCAPRO ) evaluation . Participants group complete questionnaire request demographic information personal family health history baseline questionnaire request hospitalization cancer diagnosis information blood test . Participants group also complete health status questionnaires every 3 month 6 months-7 year . Participants undergo blood draw measurement CA125 level every 3 month 6 months-7 year . For CA125 measurement , risk ovarian cancer algorithm ( ROCA ) calculate . Group A ( 1 2 ovary baseline ) : - Participants assign 1 2 subgroup base ROCA . - Subgroup A1 : Participants normal-risk ovarian cancer ( ROCA less 1 % ) continue CA125 screening . - Subgroup A2 : Participants intermediate-risk ovarian cancer ( ROCA 1 % le 10 % ) elevated-risk ovarian cancer ( ROCA 10 % ) undergo transvaginal sonography ( TVS ) . Participants elevated-risk undergo additional blood draw confirmatory CA125 level prior TVS . Participants normal TVS continue CA125 screening . Participants abnormal TVS refer gynecologic oncologist decide whether standard clinical intervention potential ovarian cancer need . Participants refer standard clinical intervention continue CA125 screening . Participants refer standard clinical intervention , least 1 ovary remaining , find malignancy continue CA125 screening . Participants refer standard clinical intervention , find malignancy , undergo prophylactic bilateral oophorectomy proceed CA125 screen group B . Participants refer standard clinical intervention find malignancy take study . Group B ( ovary baseline ) ( close accrual 10/18/04 ) : - Participants assign 1 2 subgroup base ROCA . - Subgroup B1 : Participants normal-risk ovarian cancer ( ROCA less 5 % ) continue CA 125 screening . - Subgroup B2 : Participants elevated-risk ovarian cancer ( ROCA 5 % ) undergo additional blood draw confirmatory CA125 level refer gynecologic oncologist decide whether standard clinical intervention potential ovarian cancer need . Participants refer standard clinical intervention continue CA125 screening . Participants refer standard clinical intervention find malignancy continue CA125 screen . Participants refer standard clinical intervention find malignancy take study . Patients follow clinical diagnosis 1 additional year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 2,430 participant accrue study within 12 month .</detailed_description>
