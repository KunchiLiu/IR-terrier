	<brief_title>Erlotinib Treating Patients With Malignant Mesothelioma Lung</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine 1-year survival rate patient unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma treat erlotinib . II . Determine response rate patient measurable disease treat drug . III . Determine frequency severity toxic effect drug patient . IV . Measure epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) expression , EGFR gene amplification , activation product EGFR signal pathway tumor sample correlate clinical outcome patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral erlotinib daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 6 month 2 year annually 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 55 patient accrue study within 14-18 month .</detailed_description>
