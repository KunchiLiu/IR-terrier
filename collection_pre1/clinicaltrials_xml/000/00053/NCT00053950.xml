	<brief_title>Pyrazoloacridine Stem Cell Bone Marrow Transplantation Treating Young Patients With High-Risk Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) PZA give single prolonged infusion ( &gt; = 6 hour ) autologous hematopoietic stem cell ( aHSC ) support child high risk neuroblastoma recurrent refractory disease . II . To determine dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) PZA give schedule . III . To characterize pharmacokinetics PZA give schedule . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To obtain preliminary data antitumor activity PZA within confines Phase I study . II . To determine TP53 mutation status tumor cell bone marrow &gt; 10 % present ; evaluate expression p53 MDM2 proteins flow cytometry &gt; = 0.1 % &lt; 10 % present study entry . OUTLINE : This two-stage , dose-escalation study . Patients without adequate cryopreserved hematopoietic stem cell undergo peripheral blood stem cell harvest bone marrow harvest autologous stem cell least 2 week study therapy . Patients receive high-dose pyrazoloacridine ( PZA ) IV day 0 . Cohort 1 : Groups 3-6 patient receive escalate dos PZA fix infusion time maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . Cohort 2 : Groups 3-6 patient receive PZA dose/hour establish cohort I escalate infusion time another MTD determine . In cohort MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Patients receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) IV subcutaneously begin day 4 continue blood count recover . Patients also undergo reinfusion stem cell 15-30 minute day 4 need per protocol . Patients follow day 28-35 , every 3 month 3 year , every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
