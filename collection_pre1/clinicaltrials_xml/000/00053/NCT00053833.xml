	<brief_title>S0025 Irinotecan Treating Patients With Refractory Ovarian Epithelial , Primary Peritoneal , Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine objective confirm unconfirmed complete partial response rate patient platinum- taxane-refractory ovarian epithelial , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer treat irinotecan . - Determine progression-free overall survival patient treated drug . - Evaluate qualitative quantitative toxic effect drug patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive irinotecan IV 90 minute day 1 8 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
