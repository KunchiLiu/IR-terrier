	<brief_title>Surgery Combination Chemotherapy Treating Children With Extracranial Germ Cell Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine whether child newly diagnose low- intermediate-risk extracranial germ cell tumor ( GCTs ) maintain 3-year event-free survival least 92 % ( intermediate-risk tumor ) overall survival least 95 % ( low-risk intermediate-risk tumor ) treatment surgery follow compressed cisplatin , etoposide , bleomycin ( low-risk disease close accrual 01/20/10 ) . II . Determine percentage patient stage I ovarian stage I testicular GCTs chemotherapy eliminate . III . Determine percentage intermediate-risk patient require 3 course therapy . IV . Determine acute toxic effect compress therapy patient . V. Determine long-term sequela patient treat regimen . VI . Determine number hospital day total drug dos require patient treat compressed therapy . VII . Compare number protocol-directed treatment day use CCG-8882 vs number treatment day use study . VIII . Determine cytogenetic molecular genetic feature patient treated regimen . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord disease risk ( low v intermediate ) . SURGERY : Patients undergo surgical resection . Low-risk disease : Patients gonadal primary evidence disease surgery undergo monitor disease progression . Patients remain disease free receive treatment . Patients disease progression surgery receive compress induction chemotherapy . ( close accrual 01/20/2010 ) Intermediate-risk disease : After surgery , patient proceed compress induction chemotherapy . COMPRESSED INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY : Patients receive cisplatin IV 90 minute etoposide IV 90 minute day 1-3 bleomycin IV ≥ 10 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 3 course ( week 0 , 3 , 6 ) . After completion compress induction chemotherapy , patient change disease status disease progression remove study . Patients evidence disease receive therapy . Patients partial response abnormal tumor marker proceed second-look surgery and/or 3 course compress consolidation chemotherapy . SECOND-LOOK SURGERY : Patients undergo surgical resection residual tumor . After surgery , patient pathologic complete response normal tumor marker receive therapy . Patients remain partial response surgery receive compress consolidation chemotherapy . COMPRESSED CONSOLIDATION CHEMOTHERAPY : Patients receive cisplatin , etoposide , bleomycin induction chemotherapy week 10 , 13 , 16 . Patients follow monthly 6 month , every 3 month 18 month , annually 10 year .</detailed_description>
