	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare effect IL2 receptor antibody ( also know Daclizumab Zenapax ) corticosteroids alone control GVHD . Treatment corticosteroids standard care GVHD . This research do investigator know whether addition new medication standard corticosteroid therapy improve response rate . Since Zenapax bind type cell think cause GVHD possibly inactivate , investigator reason believe addition Zenapax night result well control GVHD This study determine whether addition another medication , Zenapax , effective steroid alone suppress GVHD improve symptom GVHD . Daclizumab ( Zenapax ) approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use patient kidney transplant help prevent graft rejection . This medication use bone marrow transplant patient treat GVHD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Methylprednisolone With Without Daclizumab Treating Patients With Acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GVHD occur donor 's immune system recognize patient 's body foreign reacts . GVHD may result skin rash blister , liver inflammation gastrointestinal problem include nausea , vomit , diarrhea bleeding . Mild GVHD may treat topical medication apply skin . More severe GVHD require medication give intravenously ( vein ) take mouth . Steroids usually give first treat GVHD 40 % people respond alone . OBJECTIVES : - Compare response treatment patient acute graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) treat methylprednisolone without daclizumab . - Compare difference total methylprednisolone dose complication patient treat regimen . - Compare mortality , day antibiotics antifungal therapy , require hospital day within first 100 day patient treat regimen . - Compare overall survival incidence chronic GVHD 1 year patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) prophylaxis ( immunosuppressive therapy v T-cell depletion ) , GVHD organ manifestation ( skin v ) , donor type ( 6/6 match sibling v ) , participate center . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive methylprednisolone equivalent corticosteroid IV orally daclizumab IV 15 minute day 0 , 3 , 7 , 14 , weekly indicate day 100 . - Arm II : Patients receive methylprednisolone equivalent corticosteroid arm I placebo . Patients follow 1 year annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
