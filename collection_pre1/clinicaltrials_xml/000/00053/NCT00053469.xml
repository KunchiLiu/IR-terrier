	<brief_summary>This study explore baby become able use experience object plan manipulate appropriately . For example , adult know pick grocery bag full can food require different action need lift empty bag . This study examine infant first begin adapt action manipulate specific object weigh different amount . Participants include normal healthy baby within 2 week first birthday . If expect result obtain test , 9-month-old child study identify low age boundary task performance . If expect result obtain 12-month test age , old child recruit participate . The study involve one 30-minute session baby mother father . The parent answer question family , size ethnic make-up . The infant small magnetic sensor tap underside arm back . While sit parent lap , infant present plastic toy , action measure sensor reach pick toy . The sensor connect computer track record motion infant arm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The major objective research well understand functional significance object categorization early development . The proposed work design examine emergence infant ability access internal categorical representation service plan action external environment . Representation , capacity , refers simply store information influence later behavior . Categorization refers treatment discriminable object equivalent way . Even young infant appear able visually categorize diverse set discriminable pattern object , form internal representation bound collection . Much less know , however , infant ability actually utilize representation guidance goal direct action . The present research design characterize functional behavioral significance object representation infancy , focus particularly categorically organize representation . The primary research strategy use consist analyze infant examination manipulation novel object vary visual ( i.e. , shape color ) well nonvisual dimension ( i.e. , weight ) . In laboratory procedure , twelve-month old infant explore novel object different weight , subsequent handling modify test object measure electronic motion analysis system . Kinematic analysis infant action test object reveal action prepared relation previous experience similar object .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Infants select inclusion study basis age , gestational status ( i.e. , fullterm vs. preterm birth ) , visual normality , general health status . The initial group recruit participate within two week either side first birthday ( 12 month age ) . Equal number male female recruit participate . If sample participate either experiment fails perform manner expect , additional participant recruit old test age identify course development behavioral guidance emerges . As successive test age separate 6 month interval , independent sample 18 , 24monthold child recruit expected pattern adaptive action observe ( cf . Fossberg , et al. , 1992 ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Infants gestational age le 36 week , and/or history severe perinatal complication , visual abnormality , congenital developmental disorder recruit participation .</criteria>
