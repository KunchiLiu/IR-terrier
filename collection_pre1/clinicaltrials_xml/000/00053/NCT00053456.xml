	<brief_summary>This study look effect cardiac rehabilitation exercise program release stem cell bone marrow heart function . Stem cell primitive cell produce release bone marrow , circulate bloodstream develop white blood cell , red blood cell platelet . Some stem cell may also develop kind cell , include make heart muscle , especially heart damage get sufficient blood . Stem cell call endothelial progenitor cell ( EPCs ) think form new blood vessel carry blood area heart muscle oxygen-deprived clogged artery . Previous experiment show EPCs force bone marrow exercise . This study examine whether repeat exercise lifestyle change increase number EPCs release bloodstream cell improve heart blood vessel function . Patients 21 year age old coronary artery disease may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , include cardiovascular evaluation , blood test . The participant enrol 2- 3-month cardiac rehabilitation program include 24 36 60-minute session exercise , plus instruction lifestyle change relate diet , stress management , relaxation technique . In addition , participant undergo follow test procedure : - Brachial reactivity study : This test measure well artery widen . The patient rest 30 minute , ultrasound device place artery elbow . The device measure size artery blood flow patient give spray nitroglycerin tongue . - Blood test EPC level genetic testing : These measure EPCs determine whether certain gene may regulate EPC function turn . Genes make DNA , molecules lead production protein cell . Some protein may important release EPCs bone marrow travel bloodstream heart repair blood vessel muscle cell . - Treadmill exercise testing : Patients exercise treadmill continuous monitor heartbeat frequent measurement oxygen saturation , use finger clip device . The patient continue exercise moderate chest pain , shortness breath , fatigue develops . - Questionnaire : Patients fill 15-minute questionnaire general physical mental health status first last visit clinic . - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) heart : Patients eligible undergo MRI test twice study , begin rehabilitation program complete program . The MRI show heart function blood flow heart . For test , patient lie stretcher inside long narrow cylinder ( scanner ) . During scan , drug dipyridamole , increase blood flow heart , infuse vein hand arm . Another drug , gadolinium , also infuse brighten image produce .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Exercise Stem Cell Mobilization Heart Function Patients Undergoing Cardiac Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exercise training long recommend mean improve cardiac function reduce morbidity mortality patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . One mechanism benefit may improve endothelial function enhance nitric oxide bioactivity . Such effect may augment blood flow exercise skeletal muscle myocardium . In regard , study animal human show frequent exercise improve endothelial function well blood flow ischemic myocardium . Exercise-induced improvement endothelial function believe result up-regulation endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) transcription due repetitive shear stress associate exercise . However , patient show improved endothelial function myocardial perfusion despite compliant participation cardiac rehabilitation program . We hypothesize endothelial function follow structure exercise program may determine presence function endothelial progenitor cell ( EPCs ) release bone marrow circulate blood stream . Thus , patient low baseline post-exercise EPC level function may limit capacity improve endothelial function , exercise duration , myocardial perfusion function follow participation cardiac rehabilitation program repetitive exercise . On hand , patient high level EPCs baseline follow repetitive exercise , preserve capacity EPCs form endothelial cell , may show improved endothelial function , exercise duration , myocardial perfusion function result repetitive exercise . The primary endpoint study improvement endothelial function determine flow-mediated dilator responsiveness brachial artery 2-3 month repetitive exercise program compare baseline measurement . Secondary endpoint include treadmill exercise duration magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) -determined regional cardiac perfusion gadolinium distribution pharmacologic stress 2-3 month compare baseline measurement . EPCs identify characteristic cell surface marker colony-forming ability specific time-points study , correlation determine EPCs baseline increase EPCs follow repetitive exercise , primary secondary endpoint . We propose patient likely , least likely , benefit cardiac rehabilitation program may identify basis circulate EPCs .</detailed_description>
