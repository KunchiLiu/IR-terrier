	<brief_title>Irofulven Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Ovarian Epithelial Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine antitumor activity irofulven patient persistent recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian epithelial primary peritoneal cancer . II . Determine toxicity drug patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive irofulven IV 30 minute day 1 8 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Patients follow approximately 30 day , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 22-60 patient accrue study within least 6 month .</detailed_description>
