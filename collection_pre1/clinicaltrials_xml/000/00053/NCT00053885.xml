	<brief_title>PTK787/ZK 222584 Treating Patients With Unresectable Malignant Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine efficacy PTK787/ZK 222584 , term 3-month progression-free survival , patient malignant mesothelioma . - Determine response rate patient treat drug . - Determine toxicity drug patient . - Determine overall failure-free survival patient treated drug . - Correlate pretreatment circulate serum level vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , platelet-derived growth factor , VEGF mRNA isoforms response patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral PTK787/ZK 222584 daily . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 2 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
