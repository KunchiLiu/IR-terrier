	<brief_title>Dose Study ACAM2000 Smallpox Vaccine Previously Vaccinated Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specifically , objective study : 1 . Compare safety tolerability four dose level ACAM2000 standard dose Dryvax® healthy adult least 28 year age previously vaccinate smallpox . Safety tolerability determine examination local cutaneous reaction , adverse event , physical examination , vital sign , structure interview , laboratory analysis . 2 . Determine immunogenicity four dose level ACAM2000 standard dose Dryvax® healthy adult least 28 year age comparing : 1. proportion subject dose level develop major cutaneous reaction 2. proportion subject treatment group develop neutralizing antibody , include fold-increase antibody titer Baseline Day 30 serum ; geometric mean vaccinia neutralize antibody titer Day 30 . 3 . Determine minimum dose ACAM2000 calculate produce major cutaneous reaction least 90 % population healthy adult least 28 year age , history smallpox vaccination .</detailed_description>
