	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Understanding genetic basis common multifactorial disease cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) remain elusive goal , great advance molecular genetic technology , statistical genetic method , phenotypic assessment CVD risk factor recent year facilitate sophisticated genetic study risk heart disease . The study follow-up one conducted 1970 's 1980 's . The availability 5 large kindred first identify recruit part `` High Blood Pressure Young '' program important resource . The investigator extensive array baseline data collect late 1970s early 1980s 750 participant stem project , although data available subset participant . The present study population center 764 individual five large , multigenerational , extended family ( four white one African-American ) originally examine 25 year ago . Data collect original participant include hundred biochemical , medical , physiological , behavioral , physical , psychological , genetic demographic trait . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study consist four specific aim : 1 ) Collect 25-year follow-up data approximately 500 original participant , new data approximately 500 relative examine original study . The cardiovascular disease risk factor phenotype collect include hemodynamic measure , carotid intima-media thickness , measure cardiopulmonary function . 2 ) Obtain DNA sample 1,000 individual use modern high-throughput molecular genotyping method create 10 cM genetic marker map . 3 ) Quantify characterize nature genetic influence CVD risk factor use quantitative genetic method suit cross-sectional serial ( follow-up ) data relative large extended family . 4 ) Conduct linkage analyse identify chromosomal region ( QTLs ) harbor gene influence individual variation cardiovascular disease risk factor . Following linkage analysis , investigator examine closely strong linkage signal fine map linkage analysis order narrow chromosomal region interest . The study collaboration Wright State University Southwest Foundation Biomedical Research .</detailed_description>
