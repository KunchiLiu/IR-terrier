	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Thalidomide may stop slow growth cancer cell . Epoetin alfa may stimulate red blood cell production . Combining thalidomide epoetin alfa may improve anemia , decrease need blood transfusion , improve quality life patient myelodysplastic syndrome . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combine thalidomide epoetin alfa treat anemia patient myelodysplastic syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thalidomide Epoetin Alfa Treating Anemia Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine whether combination epoetin alfa thalidomide improve anemia and/or decrease need red cell transfusion patient low- intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndrome . - Determine whether regimen improve bone marrow morphology cytogenetics , alters natural history disease , reduce frequency leukemic transformation patient . - Evaluate whether regimen improve pathophysiologic parameter ( e.g. , apoptosis , tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentration , microvessel density , vascular endothelial growth factor , cytotoxic T lymphocytes ) bone marrow patient . - Determine safety regimen patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive epoetin alfa subcutaneously ( SC ) weekly 8 week . After 8 week , patient unresponsive epoetin alfa alone receive oral thalidomide daily addition epoetin alfa SC weekly maximum 24 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30-40 patient accrue study within 2 years..</detailed_description>
