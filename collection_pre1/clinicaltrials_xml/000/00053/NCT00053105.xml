	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop cancer cell divide stop grow die . Combining one drug may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : Phase I trial study effect combination chemotherapy body treat patient relapsed refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Aggressive Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine maximum tolerate dose recommend dose pixantrone administer cytarabine , methylprednisolone , cisplatin patient relapse refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . - Determine dose-limiting toxic effect regimen patient . - Determine relationship toxicity systemic exposure regimen patient . - Determine safety regimen patient . - Assess pharmacokinetics regimen patient . - Determine , preliminarily , efficacy regimen patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , non-randomized , multicenter , dose-escalation study pixantrone . Patients receive pixantrone IV 1 hour day 1 , methylprednisolone IV 15 minute day 1-5 , cisplatin IV 30 minute day 1-4 , cytarabine IV 2 hour day 5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day least 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos pixantrone maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Additional patient treat recommended dose , define dose precede MTD . Patients follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 3-30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
