	<brief_title>Perifosine Treating Patients With Metastatic Recurrent Malignant Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine efficacy perifosine , term response rate , previously untreated patient metastatic recurrent malignant melanoma . - Assess toxicity drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral perifosine daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) receive 2 additional course documentation CR stable PR ( i.e. , tumor shrinkage ) . Patients follow 4 week every 3 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 15-30 patient accrue study within 12-18 month .</detailed_description>
