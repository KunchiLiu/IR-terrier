	<brief_summary>Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) disorder body 's immune system affect Central Nervous System ( CNS ) . Normally , nerve fiber carry electrical impulse spinal cord , provide communication brain arm legs . In people MS , fatty sheath surround insulate nerve fiber ( call `` myelin '' ) deteriorate , cause nerve impulse slow stopped . As result patient MS may experience period muscle weakness symptom numbness , loss vision , loss coordination , paralysis , spasticity , mental physical fatigue decrease ability think and/or remember . These period illness may come ( exacerbation ) go ( remission ) . Fampridine-SR ( Sustained Release , SR ) experimental drug increase ability nerve conduct electrical impulse . This study evaluate effect Fampridine-SR walk ability subject MS , well examine effect muscle strength spasticity . The study also examine possible risk take Fampridine-SR .</brief_summary>
