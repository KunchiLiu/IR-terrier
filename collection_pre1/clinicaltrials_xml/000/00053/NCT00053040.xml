	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine toxicity peritumoral IL13-PE38QQR surgical resection pediatric patient recurrent malignant glioma . ( Phase I ) - Determine maximum tolerate flow rate maximum tolerate infusion concentration ( MTiC ) drug patient . ( Phase I ) - Estimate rate survival initial progression patient treat maximum safe flow rate MTiC drug . ( Phase II ) Secondary - Describe overall safety tolerability regimen patient start infusion disease progression initiation alternative treatment . - Determine IL13 receptor Î±2 chain expression status distribution pediatric recurrent progressive malignant glioma - Estimate progression-free survival patient treated drug . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study . - Phase I : Patients undergo surgical resection tumor . Within 2-7 day later , patient undergo placement 2-4 peritumoral catheter . One 2 day later , patient receive peritumoral IL13-PE38QQR continuously 96 hour . Catheters remove completion infusion . Cohorts 3 patient receive IL13-PE38QQR escalating flow rate fix concentration maximum safe flow rate determine . The maximum safe flow rate define rate prior one 2 3 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Following determination maximum safe flow rate , cohorts 2-3 patient receive IL13-PE38QQR escalating concentration maximum safe flow rate maximum tolerate infusion concentration ( MTiC ) determine . The MTiC define concentration prior one 2 3 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . - Phase II : Patients receive IL13-PE38QQR maximum safe flow rate MTiC determine phase I study . Patients follow week 18 catheter placement every 8 week thereafter death , disease progression , completion six month ( phase I ) 12 month ( phase II ) follow-up end IL13-PE38QQR infusion . Phase II patient complete one year follow-up without disease progression follow every 12 week thereafter death . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 2-50 patient ( 2-24 phase I approximately 26 phase II ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
