	<brief_summary>This study test safety experimental vaccine call modify vaccinia virus ankara ( MVA ) determine confers protection smallpox virus ( variola ) . There exist vaccine , call Dryvax® ( Registered Trademark ) , effective smallpox ; however , vaccine cause various side effect , include , rare occasion , life-threatening . Dryvax® ( Registered Trademark ) use United States since childhood vaccination stop 1971 , though give certain healthcare laboratory worker , people arm force , recommend general population . Both MVA Dryvax® ( Registered Trademark ) vaccine make use vaccinia virus , closely related variola . Healthy normal volunteer 31 60 year age vaccinate smallpox vaccine 10 year enter study may eligible protocol . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test , include HIV test pregnancy test woman childbearing potential . Participants receive MVA vaccine placebo , follow dose Dryvax® ( Registered Trademark ) . The MVA vaccine placebo inject arm muscle needle syringe . The Dryvax® ( Registered Trademark ) vaccine administer special forked needle poke lightly skin upper arm , usually 15 time , process call scarification . When vaccine work , small pus-filled blister form , follow scab scar site vaccination . The formation blister scab call take , indicate vaccine effective protect smallpox least year . If scarification take , either mean person already immunity vaccine work . Study participant randomly assign one follow dose group : 1 ) one injection MVA ; 2 ) one injection placebo ; 3 ) two injection MVA 4 week apart ; 4 ) two injection placebo 4 week apart . All participant receive challenge dose Dryvax® ( Registered Trademark ) 12 week last injection MVA placebo determine MVA vaccine confer immunity . A take , occur response Dryvax® ( Registered Trademark ) dose indicate lack prior immunity , thus tell whether one two dos MVA need produce immune response . Participants observe least 1 hour injection . They come clinic least week MVA placebo injection least twice week Dryvax® ( Registered Trademark ) injection site evaluate photographed . At visit , participant ask feeling medication , , take . Blood urine test do accord follow schedule : - Before injection ; - 1 week injection ; - 4 week MVA placebo injection finish ; - At time Dryvax® ( Registered Trademark ) dose ; - 4 week Dryvax® ( Registered Trademark ) dose ; - 12 week Dryvax® ( Registered Trademark ) dose . Additional laboratory test may do visit medically necessary .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Trial Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara ( MVA ) Vaccine Against Smallpox</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I/II , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blinded , study MVA vaccine . The hypothesis MVA safe vaccinia-immune adult administer intramuscular injection , vaccine result immunologic response comparable observe Dryvax® ( Registered Trademark ) vaccination previously vaccinia-immunized person . The primary objective include : evaluate safety MVA administer intramuscular ( IM ) injection 10 ( 8 ) PFU , determine whether MVA provide clinical evidence protection 12-week Dryvax challenge compare placebo group . The secondary objective identify schedule MVA administration provide clinical evidence protection Dryvax® ( Registered Trademark ) challenge compare Immunogenicity Dryvax® ( Registered Trademark ) MVA measure vaccinia-specific neutralizing antibody , ELISA intracellular cytokine assay , well variola-specific neutralize antibody assay conduct CDC subset sample .</detailed_description>
