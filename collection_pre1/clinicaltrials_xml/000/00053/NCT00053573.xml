	<brief_summary>Glycogen Storage Disease Type II ( `` GSD-II '' ; also know Pompe disease ) cause deficiency critical enzyme body call acid alpha-glucosidase ( GAA ) . Normally , GAA use body 's cell break glycogen ( stored form sugar ) within specialized structure call lysosome . In patient GSD-II , excessive amount glycogen accumulates store various tissue , especially heart skeletal muscle , prevents normal function . This study conduct evaluate safety effectiveness recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase ( rhGAA ) potential enzyme replacement therapy GSD-II . Patients diagnose infantile-onset GSD-II great 6 month old , less equal 36 month old study .</brief_summary>
