	<brief_title>Search Genes Influencing Childhood Absence Epilepsy ( CAE ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A high familial predisposition epilepsy patient childhood absence epilepsy ( CAE ) , also call petit mal epilepsy , suggest underlie genetic cause contribute disease . Several area harbor potential absence epilepsy gene identify genome . This study narrow area identify gene ( ) involve cause CAE take several approach : 1 . Comparing patient CAE healthy individual without epilepsy 2 . Investigating whole family many member affect epilepsy ) . Participation study require interview regard medical family history saliva ( spit ) collection available family member family many epilepsy case . For family without history epilepsy , parent child ask provide small amount saliva . Healthy volunteer without epilepsy family history seizure ask fill anonymous questionnaire provide small amount saliva well . Although study base Mount Sinai School Medicine New York , study material send home cost participant insurance . For collection saliva , special container provide ship back Mount Sinai pre-paid envelope provide . Study material complete convenience . Results study may enable scientist understand cause absence seizure , perhaps , type seizure well lay foundation well diagnosis treatment epilepsy patient future .</detailed_description>
