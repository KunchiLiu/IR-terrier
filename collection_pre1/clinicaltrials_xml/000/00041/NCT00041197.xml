	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate Treating Patients With Primary Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor That Has Been Completely Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether patient resect primary gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) randomize STI571 ( imatinib mesylate ) Arm long recurrence-free survival compare patient randomize placebo Arm . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To ascertain whether patient resect primary GIST randomize STI571 Arm longer survival compare patient randomize placebo Arm . II . To obtain patient GIST : tumor tissue ( therapy STI571 patient develop recurrence ) , blood specimen ( therapy STI571 ) , serum specimen ( therapy STI571 , complete therapy STI571 , patient develops recurrence ) scientific correlative analysis . III . To assess safety/efficacy oral STI571 therapy adjuvant set . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate ( Gleevec ; STI571 ) daily . Treatment continue 1 year absence unacceptable toxicity . Patients develop recurrence year initial treatment receive imatinib mesylate ( Gleevec ; STI571 ) increase dose . Patients develop recurrence year initial treatment restart imatinib mesylate ( Gleevec ; STI571 ) continue take drug discretion principal investigator . ARM II : Patients receive oral placebo daily . Treatment continue 1 year absence unacceptable toxicity . Patients develop recurrence time discontinue placebo crossover arm I . Treatment arm I continue discretion principal investigator . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 10 year .</detailed_description>
