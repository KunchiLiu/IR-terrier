	<brief_summary>Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness tamoxifen thalidomide treat woman recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer , fallopian tube cancer , primary peritoneal cancer . Estrogen stimulate growth type cancer cell . Hormone therapy use tamoxifen may fight cancer block uptake estrogen . Thalidomide may stop growth cancer stop blood flow tumor . It yet know whether thalidomide effective tamoxifen treat ovarian epithelial cancer , fallopian tube cancer , primary peritoneal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tamoxifen Compared With Thalidomide Treating Women With Ovarian Epithelial Cancer , Fallopian Tube Cancer , Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare recurrence-free survival woman receive tamoxifen thalidomide epithelial ovarian cancer , cancer fallopian tube , primary peritoneal carcinoma complete clinical remission follow front-line treatment high risk recurrence due rise serum CA-125 . II . To compare toxicity complication treatment . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether change serum biomarker level include VEGF and/or bFGF independent randomization treatment . II . To determine whether serum plasma biomarker level include VEGF and/or bFGF associate duration recurrence-free survival . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord interval completion front-line chemotherapy appearance biochemical progression ( 6 month less vs 6 month ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive oral thalidomide daily day 1-28 . ARM II : Patients receive oral tamoxifen twice daily day 1-28 . In arm , course repeat every 28 day 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may receive additional therapy beyond 1 year investigator 's discretion . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
