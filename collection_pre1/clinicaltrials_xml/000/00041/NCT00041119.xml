	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study cyclophosphamide doxorubicin hydrochloride compare paclitaxel adjuvant therapy treat breast cancer woman 0-3 positive axillary lymph node . Giving additional cancer treatment surgery may help low risk cancer come back ( adjuvant therapy ) . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin hydrochloride , paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . It yet know whether standard adjuvant therapy cyclophosphamide doxorubicin hydrochloride effective paclitaxel treat woman breast cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Four Versus Six Cycles Cyclophosphamide/Doxorubicin Paclitaxel Adjuvant Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine equivalence paclitaxel give every two week cyclophosphamide doxorubicin hydrochloride ( CA ) give every two week adjuvant therapy woman 0-3 positive axillary lymph node , disease-free survival . II . To determine long therapy , 12 week , superior shorter therapy , 8 week , either CA paclitaxel disease-free survival woman primary breast cancer 0-3 positive axillary lymph node . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine equivalence paclitaxel give every two week CA give every two week , potential superiority longer vs. short therapy , relation overall survival , local control ( regardless metastatic status ) time distant metastasis ( regardless local recurrence status ) . II . To compare toxicity short long course CA paclitaxel adjuvant therapy woman 0-3 positive axillary lymph node breast cancer . III . To determine effect long short course CA paclitaxel induction menopause pre-menopausal patient . IV . To assess discrepancy myelosuppression among common multidrug resistance protein 1 ( MDR1 ) haplotypes CA treatment arm . V. To assess effect MDR1 haplotypes disease-free survival ( DFS ) adjust treatment . VI . Exploratory analysis effect cytochrome P450 , family 3 , subfamily A , polypeptide 5 ( CYP3A5 ) , cytochrome P450 , family 2 , subfamily C , polypeptide 8 ( CYP2C8 ) , cytochrome P450 , family 2 , subfamily B , polypeptide 6 ( CYP2B6 ) polymorphisms DFS toxicity . VII . To identify genetic marker associate risk develop neutropenia adriamycin/ cyclophosphamide-treated breast cancer patient . VIII . To identify genetic marker associate risk develop peripheral neuropathy paclitaxel-treated breast cancer patient . IX . To identify genetic marker associate difference efficacy chemotherapy regimen . X . To examine genetic association response toxicity phenotypes become apparent future analysis Cancer Leukemia Group B ( CALGB ) 40101 data . XI . To identify copy number variant associate adriamycin/cyclophosphamide-induced neutropenia paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 4 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously ( IV ) doxorubicin hydrochloride IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV doxorubicin hydrochloride IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM III : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM IV : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Note : Randomization Arms II IV longer available , effective 12/15/2007 . After completion study treatment patient follow 4-6 week , every 6 month 2 year , annually 13 year .</detailed_description>
