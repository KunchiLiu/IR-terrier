	<brief_title>Docetaxel Treating Patients With Persistent Recurrent Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine antitumor activity docetaxel patient persistent recurrent squamous cell carcinoma cervix . II . Determine toxicity drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
