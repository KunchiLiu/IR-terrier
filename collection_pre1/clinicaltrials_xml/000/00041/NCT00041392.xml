	<brief_title>Effects Magnesium Individuals Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Approximately 400,000 individual undergo heart operation year cognitive impairment occur frequently follow surgery . An increase number individual elderly particularly susceptible cognitive dysfunction follow surgery . Cognitive impairment notable early stage follow heart surgery , may persist individual . While many people think cognitive impairment subtle , transient , subclinical , perioperative decline associate 5-year cognitive deterioration reduce quality life . Multiple strategy , clinical pharmacological , propose reduce central nervous system dysfunction associate heart surgery . However , strategy unsuccessful , meet limited success , unrealistic cost risk-benefit ratio majority people . This study examine effectiveness supplemental magnesium prevent cognitive decline associate heart surgery . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This study examine effect supplemental magnesium neurocognitive function individual undergo CABG surgery . The two hypothesis test include follow : 1 ) therapeutic level magnesium reduce post-operative neurocognitive dysfunction heart surgery ; 2 ) therapeutic magnesium level protect quality life reduce cognitive dysfunction heart surgery . This double-blind study enroll 400 individual randomly assign either treatment group , receive 100 mg/kg magnesium , control group . Anesthesia management standardize minimize impact anesthesia may neurologic neuropsychologic outcome . Neurocognitive testing conduct prior surgery , 6 week 1 year follow surgery .</detailed_description>
