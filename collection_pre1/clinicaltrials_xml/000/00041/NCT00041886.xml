	<brief_summary>Radiofrequency ablation use treat patient many different condition . It use treat heart arrhythmia benign bone tumor , control bleeding surgery . It approve Food Drug Administration soft tissue ablation ( removal ) . The technique involve insert probe , guide compute tomography ultrasound , send radio wave probe . The radio wave generate heat , destroy adjacent tissue cauterize blood vessel . This study enroll 15 adult ( age 18 old ) soft tissue metastasis suffer pain well control mean , drug . The goal reduce pain use analgesic partially destroy tumor . Patients ineligible study change class pain medication use within 2 week 2 week study treatment . Patients fill short questionnaire pain daily activity ( Brief Pain Inventory ) treatment 1 day , 1 week , 1 month , 3 month , 12 month treatment ascertain whether pain well control less pain medication . For treatment , patient receive local anesthetic area probe insert . Some patient may require general anesthesia . The probe remain place typically 10 30 minute . For large tumor , may insert different position .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study examine efficacy use radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) treat pain soft tissue metastasis well control conventional method treatment , define ongoing pain despite maximum pharmacologic intervention , severe side effect like mental status alteration medication . Prior experience similar technique liver , kidney , heart , bone , prostate , lymph node , brain , pancreas , nerve ganglion find ablation specific volume tissue application RFA energy safe effective . We hopeful method tissue ablation could assist difficult management patient painful lesion . The goal reduce pain , reduce use analgesic . Any decrease strength opiate use , dose equivalent same-medication per week basis consider significant .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA All patient must pain poorly control conventional method , define ongoing pain despite maximum pharmacologic intervention , severe side effect like mental status alteration medication , determine patient along palliative care/ pain consult service and/or patient 's physician . Persistent recalcitrant pain localize specific neoplastic lesion determine consensus review P.I . pain/palliative care service , patient 's physician , diagnostic radiologist review case . Only patient limit number lesion cause pain enrol , target lesion focus ablation . All patient must diagnostic CT scan conclusively reveal soft tissue metastasis , source pain determine Palliative care oncologist . One independent radiologist coinvestigator study must confirm . Tumor completely destroyable RFA , patient may benefit simple debulking , denervation , decrease intratumoral pressure . Age great equal 18 year . Biopsy lesion question histologic cytologic confirmation cancer obtain safe clinically indicate , reasonable doubt diagnosis . Reasonable doubt determine PI , surgeon , palliative care oncologist consensus . Performance Status ECOG 02 . Life expectancy 3 month great . Platelet count great 50,000/mL , absolute granulocyte count ( AGC ) great 1,000/mL , serum creatine less 1.5 mg/dl ( great 1.5 , measure creatine clearance great 50mL/min ) . Any patient elevate PTT PT uncorrectable evaluate NIH hematology safety procedure . This allow patient `` falselyelevated '' value undergo evaluation would surgery invasive procedure . Dr. Horne hematologist coinvestigator protocol . No serious concurrent medical illness . Bidimensionally measurable disease radiographic mean physical examination . The ability understand willingness sign write informed consent form , comply protocol . If question review ethic committee . Consult NCI surgeon Palliative care oncologist determine patient 's pain medication option ( surgical ) optimize prior entry protocol . Surgical option must either possible , reject patient . Surgery either offer ruled alternative NCI surgeon prior treatment . Chemotherapy , radiation therapy , classification drug therapy must stable without change 2 week prior tumor ablation . EXCLUSION CRITERIA Patients coagulopathy correct , bleed diathesis , exclude study . Patients take antiinflammatory agent aspirin , heparin , heparinoids , coumadin exclude prothrombin time partial thromboplastin time normalize . Patients alter mental status precludes understand consent procedure exclude study . Pregnant nursing woman woman childbearing potential unless use effective contraception determine patient 's physician . Patients poor medical risk non malignant systemic disease active , uncontrolled infection . Patients change class pain medication two week prior treatment ineligible class change within two week prior . If class pain medication switch within two week treatment , patient becomes inevaluable .</criteria>
