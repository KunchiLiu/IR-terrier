	<brief_title>Multi-Ethnic Study Atherosclerosis ( MESA ) - Ancillary Eye Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The study expand enlarges finding NHLBI-supported Atherosclerosis Risk Communities ( ARIC ) study relationship retinal microvascular disease presence subclinical clinical cardiovascular disease among Multi-Ethnic Study Atherosclerosis ( MESA ) participant . ARIC data show retinal microvascular change associate following finding : marker persistent hypertensive damage , marker inflammation endothelial dysfunction , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) -detected cerebral infarct independent hypertension , predictive 3-year incident stroke independent hypertension , predictive 3-year incident coronary heart disease woman men . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The MESA-EYE study separate add-on Multi-Ethnic Study Atherosclerosis , six regional center 10 year program begin July 2000 . The overall goal parent study identification risk factor subclinical cardiovascular disease , progression subclinical disease , transition subclinical clinical cardiovascular disease . The eye component tie Exam 2 main study begin August 2002 run January 2004 . Retinal photography document microvascular change perform approximately 6,500 MESA participant Exam 2 . Retinal photography follow standardize write protocol similar use ARIC . Focal arterial narrowing AV nick classify definite , questionable , none . Data handling base protocols previously use several NIH sponsor clinical trial eye retinal study perform . The six specific aim study : ( 1 ) determine relationship retinal microvascular characteristic measure subclinical CVD ( ) magnetic resonance imaging leave ventricular function ( b ) brachial artery ultrasound flow mediate endothelial vasodilatation ( c ) radial artery tonometry measurement peripheral artery function ( ) magnetic resonance image myocardial perfusion ; ( 2 ) determine relationship retinal microvascular characteristic clinical CVD , specifically : ( ) coronary heart disease ( b ) congestive cardiac failure ( c ) stroke ; ( 3 ) determine relationship retinal microvascular characteristic CVD risk factor , specifically : ( ) development type 2 diabetes ( b ) development hypertension ( c ) marker : ( I ) inflammation ( II ) hemostasis ( III ) fibrinolysis ; ( 4 ) determine relation retinal microvascular change structural functional disorder brain ; ( 5 ) describe prevalence retinal microvascular abnormality different racial/ethnic group ; ( 6 ) describe prevalence risk factor ( ) diabetic retinopathy ( b ) age-related maculopathy .</detailed_description>
