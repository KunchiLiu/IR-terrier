	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining one drug may kill tumor cell . It yet know combination chemotherapy regimen effective treat extensive-stage small cell lung cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial compare different chemotherapy regimen treat patient extensive-stage small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare overall survival patient chemotherapy-naive extensive stage small cell lung cancer treat cisplatin oral topotecan v cisplatin etoposide . - Compare response rate , response duration , time progression patient treat regimen . - Compare tolerability regimens patient . - Compare patient-perceived disease status well patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord gender , ECOG performance status ( 0 vs 1 v 2 ) , lactate dehydrogenase ( less 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) vs 1.5 time ULN great ) , country . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral topotecan daily day 1-5 cisplatin IV day 5 . - Arm II : Patients receive cisplatin IV day 1 etoposide IV least 30 minute day 1-3 . Treatment arm repeat every 21 day least 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline , prior course , 4 week study , every 4 week 16 week . Patients follow 4 week , every 4 week 16 week , every 3 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 760 patient ( 380 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 18 month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS : Histologically cytologically confirm extensive stage small cell lung carcinoma ( SCLC ) No prior chemotherapy SCLC OR No chemotherapy within 5 year diagnosis SCLC Prior radiotherapy measurable nonmeasurable disease field allow provided radiotherapy complete least 6 week ago disease demonstrate progress No clinical sign symptom brain and/or leptomeningeal metastasis CT scan MRI Brain and/or leptomeningeal metastasis asymptomatic neurologic exam allow provided metastasis require corticosteroid therapy control symptoms PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS : Age : 18 Performance status : ECOG 02 Life expectancy : At least 3 month Hematopoietic : Hemoglobin least 9.0 g/dL WBC least 3,500/mm3 Platelet count least 100,000/mm3 Neutrophil count least 1,500/mm3 Hepatic : Bilirubin great 2.0 mg/dL SGOT SGPT great 2 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) ( 5 time ULN liver metastasis present ) Alkaline phosphatase great 2 time ULN ( 5 time ULN liver metastasis present ) Renal : Creatinine great 1.5 mg/dL Creatinine clearance least 60 mL/min No preexist renal impairment would preclude cisplatin use Gastrointestinal : No clinical evidence gastrointestinal ( GI ) condition include : Removal portion stomach History recent obstruction GI tract GI autonomic neuropathy Ulcerative colitis Crohn 's disease Malabsorption syndrome Treatment cyclosporine would alter absorption GI motility No condition would preclude absorption oral topotecan Other : Not pregnant nursing Negative pregnancy test Fertile patient must use effective contraception 3 month prior study , , least 1 month study No active infection No prior concurrent malignancy within past 5 year except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , carcinoma situ cervix , localize lowgrade prostate cancer No concurrent severe medical problem would expose patient extreme risk preclude study compliance No prior allergic reaction compound chemically relate study drug No preexist hearing impairment would preclude cisplatin use No overall medical condition study drug would inappropriate PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY : Biologic therapy : No concurrent immunotherapy SCLC Chemotherapy : See Disease Characteristics No concurrent chemotherapy SCLC Endocrine therapy : See Disease Characteristics No concurrent hormonal therapy SCLC Radiotherapy : See Disease Characteristics At least 24 hour since prior radiotherapy expect bone marrow suppression Recovered prior palliative radiotherapy ( e.g , nausea vomit radiation epigastrium ) No concurrent radiotherapy SCLC No concurrent radiotherapy palliation bone metastases CNS lesion unless approve investigator Surgery : At least 3 week since prior major surgery ( short period allow deem best interest patient ) Other : More 30 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) since prior investigational drug No concurrent investigational therapy SCLC No concurrent cyclosporine No concurrent drug would preclude absorption oral topotecan</criteria>
