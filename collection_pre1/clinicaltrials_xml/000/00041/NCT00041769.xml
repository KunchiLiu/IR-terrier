	<brief_summary>Drug resistance test use see anti-HIV drug likely suppress growth HIV select anti-HIV regimen HIV infect patient fail previous drug regimen . Therapeutic drug monitoring ( TDM ) process involve measure blood level drug may increase benefit resistance test offer optimize protease inhibitor ( PI ) drug concentration . The purpose study determine whether change dose PIs , indicate TDM , reduce viral load PI-experienced patient . Hypothesis : Treatment-naive study participant undergo TDM whose clinician ' interpret TDM result adjust PI dose good virologic response rate decrease toxicity ( thus well treatment outcome ) participant undergo TDM .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The use drug resistance test guide selection antiretroviral regimen patient current therapy failing gain grow acceptance clinical practice . Genotypic phenotypic resistance test associate improved short-term virologic outcome prospective interventional trial . There also grow evidence monitor drug level , particularly PIs , may add benefit provide resistance test . This study assess impact TDM resistance test lower viral load treatment-experienced patient also evaluate mean change plasma HIV RNA study entry Step 2 study . No antiretrovirals provide study . Participants follow maximum 48 week . Participants fail least one combination antiretroviral regimen screen drug resistance test perform remain fail regimen . In Step 1 , participant begin salvage antiretroviral regimen within 7 day study entry select clinician use result resistance test . Two week initiation salvage regimen , participant time plasma sample obtain PI trough level . The result trough level test use calculate normalized inhibitory quotient ( NIQ ) order determine eligibility randomization Step 2 Week 4 . Electrocardiograms ( EKGs ) trough level perform Weeks 2 , 6 , 10 ; support interview promote adherence also conduct study nurse clinician time . Some participant take tipranavir may additional blood collection Week 2 . In Step 2 , participant NIQ 1 less randomly assign one two arm . Arm A participant receive standard care ( SC ) , participant Arm B receive SC plus dose-adjusted PIs base NIQ . Clinical viral load assessment conduct screening , entry , Weeks 4 , 10 , 16 , 24 , 32 , 40 , 48 . Arm B participant also PI trough level check Weeks 6 10 . Participants NIQ great 1 assign observational Arm C ( open 50 enrollee ) stop involvement study . Participants Arms A , B , C viral load 1000 copies/ml high experience virologic failure Week 24 eligible receive second resistance test enter Step 3 . Participants Step 3 begin second salvage regimen ; PI trough level measure 2 , 6 , 10 week salvage therapy . Those NIQ great 1 , NIQ 1 less wish escalate dose , follow Step 3 maximum 48 week study entry . All participant encourage coenroll ACTG A5128 , Consent Use Stored Patient Specimens Future Testing .</detailed_description>

Inclusion Criteria Step 1 : HIV infect Viral load 1000 copies/ml study screen At least one viral load 400 copies/ml within 6 month study entry fail antiretroviral regimen Virologic failure least one combination ( two drug ) antiretroviral regimen , least one fail regimen contain PI . Low dose ritonavir hydroxyurea count antiretrovirals . Currently fail combination antiretroviral regimen Plan initiate salvage regimen contain PI within 7 day study entry Acceptable method contraception receive study medication 6 week stop medication . Participants currently take efavirenz undergone surgery prevent conception ( e.g. , hysterectomy , tubal ligation , vasectomy ) must provide physician 's documentation current regimen previous surgery . Resistance least one drug fail regimen , document within 90 day study entry Karnofsky performance scale 70 within 30 day prior study entry Growth factor , interleukin , interferon ( except treatment hepatitis C ) , nonFDA approve systemic drug , HIV vaccine within 30 day study entry Require certain medication prior study Certain heart condition , start PIbased regimen salvage regimen Acute illness infection require treatment within 14 day study entry Any condition would limit ability participate study Cancer require radiation systemic chemotherapy Active drug alcohol use dependence would interfere ability meet study requirement Acute chronic pancreatitis Planned use hydroxyurea salvage regimen Pregnant breastfeeding</criteria>
