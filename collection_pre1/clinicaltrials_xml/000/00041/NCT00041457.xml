	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Venous thromboembolism common condition considerable morbidity mortality . The disorder diverse cause include trauma , stasis , drug , cancer , genetic factor contribute enhance clot coagulation . The study use exist large-scale population study unravel factor responsible contribute venous thromboembolism . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study design prospective cohort study 77,118 person base pool information four large randomize trial US health professional collect detailed risk factor information use common strategy prospectively identify validate case venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) . These trial : Physicians ' Health Studies I &amp; II include 29,071 US male physician , 22,071 follow since initiation first trial 1982 ; Women 's Health Study include 39,876 female health professional average 10 year follow-up ; Women 's Antioxidant Cardiovascular Study include 8,171 female health professional prevalent cardiovascular disease high risk cardiovascular disease average 8 year follow-up . Archived blood sample collect approximately 75 percent participant baseline use assess biochemical genetic marker risk include factor V Leiden , G20210A mutation prothrombin gene , hyperhomocysteinemia , anticardiolipin antibody . The study assess joint association risk marker potentially modifiable factor include body mass index , hormone replacement therapy , physical activity , aspirin use . The study population include 1,000 incident case VTE , include 750 blood sample .</detailed_description>
