	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Coronary heart disease stroke leading cause mortality men woman United States . Current understanding pathogenesis risk factor cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) derive largely prospective study clinically overt disease . Unfortunately , clinical risk factor CVD define method fail predict large proportion CVD event , subject high clinical risk fail develop overt disease . Subclinical disease precedes clinical years/decades difficult quantify . For example , leave ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ) aortic atherosclerosis strong predictor CVD event , difficult accurately non-invasively quantify , especially among elderly overweight subject ( grow population U.S. ) . MRI permit accurate assessment cardiac anatomy/function subclinical aortic atherosclerosis . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The underlie hypothesis study subclinical cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) precursor overt CVD , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) measure subclinical aortic cardiac anatomic disease superior characterization risk compare current measure risk factor well conventional imaging ( e.g. , carotid ultrasound , echo ) . Longitudinal/time-averaged index establish risk factor CVD collect Framingham Heart Study ( FHS ) . These time-averaged index strong predictor clinical CVD single measure . In Pilot study 312 FHS Offspring subject , MRI measure LV mass successfully acquire large proportion subject echo , MR evidence LVH subclinical aortic disease correlate strongly ( echo carotid ultrasound measure ) time-averaged index . Application MRI method FHS offer opportunity identify subclinical atherosclerosis LVH well-characterized cohort relate data conventional imaging measure already acquire cohort . Importantly , near-concurrent acquisition brain MRI/neuropsychologic examination FHS cohort offer unique contemporaneous opportunity examine subclinical cerebrovascular disease MRI index subclinical atherosclerosis . The study expand Pilot study perform heart thoracic/abdominal aorta MRI study 2400 FHS participant allow identification individual CVD risk factor subclinical atherosclerosis . These population-based data extend knowledge distribution severity atherosclerosis adult men woman relation exist echo , carotid ultrasound brain MRI measure . This study provide rare opportunity examine association quantitative MRI measure aortic atherosclerosis LVH cross-sectional time-averaged measure individual atherosclerotic risk factor ( e.g. , blood pressure , cigarette smoking , cholesterol ) novel inflammatory marker ( e.g. , C-reactive protein , MCP-1 ) . Further , FHS consist hundred sibships DNA repository establish , heritability MRI index atherosclerosis LVH determine , lay groundwork future genetic study .</detailed_description>
