	<brief_summary>Normally , nerve fiber carry electrical impulse spinal cord , provide communication brain arm legs . In people spinal cord injury , fiber may destroy site injury , others remain connected work correctly carry electrical impulse . As result , subject incomplete spinal cord injury may spasticity muscle spasm muscle stiffness make movement difficult . Fampridine-SR experimental drug increase ability nerve conduct electrical impulse . This study examine effect Fampridine-SR moderate severe lower-limb spasticity , well effect bodily function bladder control , bowel function sexual function . The study also examine possible risk take Fampridine-SR .</brief_summary>
