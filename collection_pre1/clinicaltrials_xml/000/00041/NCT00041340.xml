	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate Treating Patients With Stage IV Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response Gleevec ( Imatinib Mesylate ) patient metastatic colorectal cancer c-Kit , Arg , Abl , PDGF-R expression . II . To determine side effect Imatinib Mesylate patient colorectal cancer . III . To study biologic effect Imatinib Mesylate c-Kit PDGF-R system downstream signal metastatic colorectal cancer . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily . Treatment continue 8 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable disease well continue therapy disease progression 1 year complete response .</detailed_description>
