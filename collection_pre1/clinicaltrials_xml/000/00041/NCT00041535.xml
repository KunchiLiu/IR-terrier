	<brief_summary>Gaucher disease inherit functional deficiency glucocerebrosidase . This enzyme break fatty substance ( lipid ) call glucocerebroside , present cell body . When cell renew , lipid must break discard . Because enzyme function well , lipid build certain tissue , liver spleen . The nervous system involve well ; memory impair difficult move eye side side . It show repeated infusion glucocerebrosidase help break stored lipid . However , treatment improve neurological symptom . A medicine call OGT 918 show slow production lipid build Gaucher disease . It also show enter brain . It hop take OGT 918 reduce storage glycolipids cell improve neurological symptom disease . This clinical trial seek evaluate OGT 918 treatment neuronopathic Gaucher disease assess change eye movement velocity . A secondary goal assess clinical safety tolerability OGT 918 therapy . Up 30 patient National Institutes Health Institute Child Health ( London ) randomly assign OGT 918 treatment 12 month . Study participant must clinically diagnosed neuronopathic Gaucher disease , 12 year age old , able swallow capsule . They must stable ERT least 6 month study . Patients receive OGT 918 receive dose 200 mg OGT 918 three time daily . Data analysis do 12 month . The study extend 12 month collect safety efficacy data . All patient complete main study enter extension study receive OGT 918 . During 4-week screening period , eye movement velocity measure . These assessment repeat month 12 24 . Also screen month 12 24 , follow test do : MRI/CT , measure spleen liver volume ; pulmonary imaging ( X-ray ) function test ; nerve conduction velocity study neuropsychological assessment ; evoke response study ( measure brain conduct electrical message ) ; tremor measurement . Additional assessment tremor conduct month 6 18 . Plasma sample obtain every 3 month measure disease marker safety profile . Proteasome sample take screen month 6 identify protein may associate Gaucher disease . Blood obtain month 1 first 6 consent patient randomly assign take OGT 918 . These patient also cerebrospinal fluid sample take lumbar puncture month 1 . These sample measure much OGT 918 present . All patient receive OGT 918 initial assessment 1 week begin treatment evaluate tolerance therapy . Clinic visit every 3 month . All patient ask keep simple diary adverse event dietary information . Dose level may reduce patient experience severe gastrointestinal problem .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Gaucher disease inherit functional deficiency glucocerebrosidase ( beta-glucosidase ) lead glycolipid accumulation various tissue . OGT 918 reversible inhibitor glucosylceramide synthase , key enzyme synthesis glycolipids , show beneficial effect clinical study type 1 Gaucher disease . The primary objective clinical trial evaluate OGT 918 treatment neuronopathic Gaucher disease assess change saccadic eye movement velocity . Other marker disease also assess , include neurological pulmonary involvement . Secondary objective assess clinical safety tolerability OGT 918 therapy . Up 30 patient , recruit National Institutes Health , Bethesda , USA Institute Child Health , London , U.K. randomize OGT 918 treatment 2:1 ratio 12 month study period . Patients clinically diagnose neuronopathic Gaucher disease , 12 year age old , stable dose enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) least 6 month able swallow capsule . Randomization stratify base whether patient undergone splenectomy . All patient follow identical visit schedule . Patients age 12 year randomize receive OGT 918 commence treatment dose 200 mg ( 2 x 100 mg capsule ) OGT 918 three time daily . As patient may experience initial gastrointestinal intolerance dose may modify , however aim maintain patient high tolerable dose order achieve clinical benefit . Data analysis plan , compare OGT 918 treatment group , patient complete 12 month study . The study extend , total 12 additional month , collect safety efficacy data . The length extension study dependent result final analysis . All patient complete main study , include initially randomize treatment group , able participate extension study unless safety issue prohibit . All patient extension study receive OGT 918 . Disease activity assessment conduct indicated study flow chart . For complete description study assessment , please refer Section 7 main protocol . Where possible , study assessment blind . The effect OGT 918 electro-oculographic characteristic saccadic activity , specifically amplitude/velocity characteristic ( main sequence ) , primary outcome variable . Saccadic velocity-amplitude relationship decrease neuronopathic Gaucher patient . This study ass whether OGT 918 therapy capable improve stop deterioration ocular function .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients neuronopathic Gaucher disease , confirm clinical diagnosis , receive enzyme replacement therapy stable enzyme replacement therapy least 6 month successfully undergo bone marrow transplant least one year prior study entry . Patients least 4 year old swallow capsule . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients young 18 year unable give inform assent and/or whose legal guardian unable provide inform consent . Patients age 18 provide inform consent and/or whose legal guardian unable provide witness informed consent . Fertile patient , time study could sexually active , agree use adequate contraception throughout study three month cessation OGT 918 treatment . Patients tolerate study procedure unable travel study center require protocol . Patients currently undergo therapy investigational agent patient take drug food supplement may interfere gastrointestinal absorption motility . Patients suffer clinically significant diarrhea ( great 3 liquid stool per day great 7 day ) without definable cause within 3 month Screening Visit , history significant gastrointestinal disorder . Patients intercurrent medical condition would render unsuitable study e.g . HIV , hepatitis infection . Patients opinion investigator ( whatever reason ) think unsuitable study . Patients adjust Creatinine Clearance less 70 ml/min/1.73m ( 2 ) ( CrCl less 70 ) .</criteria>
