	<brief_title>Gefitinib Plus Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe overall response proportion patient advance carcinoma urothelial tract treat cisplatin , gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) ZD1839 ( gefitinib ) , give 21 day schedule , follow maintenance ZD1839 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe time progression , progression-free survival , overall survival patient advance carcinoma urothelial tract treat cisplatin , gemcitabine ZD1839 , give 21 day schedule , follow maintenance ZD1839 . II . To evaluate effect epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) expression level overall response rate progression-free survival patient advance carcinoma urothelial tract treat cisplatin , gemcitabine ZD1839 , give 21 day schedule , follow maintenance ZD1839 . III . To assess toxicity combination cisplatin , gemcitabine ZD1839 give 21 day schedule , follow maintenance ZD1839 patient advance carcinoma urothelial tract . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive gemcitabine intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 8 cisplatin IV 1 hour day 1 . Patients also receive gefitinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) begin day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete remission , partial remission , maintain stable disease continue gefitinib PO QD 5 year disease progression unacceptable toxicity occurs . Patients follow least every 3 month 1 year least every 6 month disease progression relapse .</detailed_description>
