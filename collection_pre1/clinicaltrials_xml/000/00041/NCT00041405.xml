	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Cardiovascular disease lead cause death patient diabetes . The BARI 2D study design determine potential value specific treatment regimens diabetes test hypothesis `` target HbA1C le 7.5 % , strategy hyperglycemic management direct insulin sensitization result low 5 year mortality compare strategy insulin provision . '' This ancillary study design provide mechanistic insight potential benefit derive two different treatment strategy employ characterize thrombotic potential patient assign aggressive medical management strategy long-range goal demonstrate treatment diabetes regimen reduce thrombotic potential decrease cardiovascular risk . The result ancillary study help define extent specific regimens diminish pro-thrombotic state . The study response initiative Ancillary Studies Heart , Lung , Blood Disease Trials release June , 2000 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Thrombotic potential assess determination platelet reactivity thrombin generation activity . Preliminary study find patient diabetes increase coronary intervention . Further , thrombin generation activity increase diabetic subject . Preliminary evidence suggest treatment insulin-sensitizing regimen reduces platelet reactivity , thrombin generation thrombin activity . The BARI 2D study ideally suit determination effect method glycemic control pro-thrombotic potential . In aim 1 investigator determine platelet reactivity first year treatment patient randomize medical treatment randomize also either insulin-sensitizing regimen insulin-providing regimen . They use flow cytometry-based assay platelet function develop validate . In aim 2 determine effect treatment thrombin generation activity group patient . Thrombin generation determine measure concentration blood cleavage fragment ( prothrombin fragment 1+2 ) . Thrombin activity determine measure concentration blood second cleavage fragment ( fibrinopeptide A ) . The result study determine effect method hyperglycemic management pro-thrombotic potential . Further , result define importance prothrombotic potential diabetic subject potentially identify new therapeutic target patient diabetes insulin resistant state . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
