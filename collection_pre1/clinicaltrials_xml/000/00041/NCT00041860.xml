	<detailed_description>The research evaluate benzene metabolism exposure level find environment , high end concentration air inside car bus driven heavy traffic inside private public parking garage . To breath , urine , blood sample prior , expose benzene well benzene level benzene metabolite present measure . The exposure take place Controlled Environmental Facility operate Environmental Occupational Health Sciences Institute ( EOHSI ) . This allow u control exact benzene air level use benzene contain 13C , stable ( non-radioactive ) form carbon , one atom make benzene . Isotopes different form atom . Using 13C allow u tell difference benzene compound change body come experiment compare present body source . In addition benzene exposure day subject also expose methyl tertiary butyl ether ( MTBE ) , another component gasoline , take iron supplement pill and/or take vitamin C E pill . How benzene metabolize change body compare difference well understand body deal benzene .</detailed_description>
