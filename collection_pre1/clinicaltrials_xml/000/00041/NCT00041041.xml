	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate Treating Patients With Persistent Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate cytostatic , anti-tumor activity Gleevec ( Imatinib Mesylate ) probability survive progression-free least 6 month patient recurrent persistent epithelial ovarian primary peritoneal carcinoma receive Gleevec . II . To determine frequency severity adverse effect Gleevec cohort patient assess CTC . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine distribution overall survival . II . To determine distribution progression-free survival . III . To estimate clinical response rate ( partial complete response define RECIST criterion ) . IV . To assess effect prognostic variable : initial performance status , platinum sensitivity , mucinous ( clear cell ) histology ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine level expression c-KIT ligand , stem cell factor ( SCF ) archive , formalin fix , paraffin embed primary tumor collect prior initiation first-line chemotherapy . II . To determine level expression platelet derive growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) ligand PDGF archive , formalin fix , paraffin embed primary tumor collect prior initiation first-line chemotherapy . III . To determine level expression AKT2 activate form , phospho-AKT2 , archive , formalin fix , paraffin embed primary tumor collect prior initiation first-line chemotherapy . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
