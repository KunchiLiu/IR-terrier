	<brief_summary>This study gain information rare disorder call KSHV-associated multicentric Castleman disease ( MCD ) . KSHV , virus , cause several kind cancer , include form MCD . KSHV stand Kaposi sarcoma herpes virus , also call human herpes virus-8 , HHV-8 . Researchers want understand biology KSHV-MCD identify disease cause illness find way treat . There standard therapy effective case KSHV-MCD . The disease often fatal , half people die within 2 year diagnosis . Patients age 12 older may eligible study . Participation entail draw blood repeat tumor biopsy patient receive treatment non-research setting . Researchers would like learn relationship KSHV Castleman disease symptom , want obtain least three biopsy study . There side effect experimental therapy patient may take KSHV-MCD . Zidovudine , Retrovir , use high dose . It give orally vein , four time daily , 7 day longer . Zidovudine cause nausea , vomit , decrease bone marrow function , decrease blood count . Combined valganciclovir , Valcyte , likely toxic bone marrow . Valganciclovir cause problem bone marrow function , lead low blood count , sterility , defect fetus . Combined zidovudine , valganciclovir may cause toxicity bone marrow . It give twice daily 7 day longer . Bortezomib , Velcade , give second rapid push needle vein . It give twice weekly four dos stop 1 week . Bortezomib sometimes cause low blood pressure ; also cause gastrointestinal problem low blood platelet count . Rituximab liposomal doxorubicin drug give catheter vein . Interferon-alpha give injection skin . Those drug experimental , use Castleman disease experimental . Some patient may treat combination chemotherapy follow interferon-alpha . Interferon-alpha infected skin needle . The natural form interferon produce body help control viral infection . KSHV decrease effect body interferon , researcher want see give high dos interferon help control KSHV infection . A positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan , research purpose , may do three time year . A radioactive sugar molecule call fluorodeoxyglucose , FDG , use . It believe activated lymphocyte may find patient disease might use FDG cell burn glucose fuel . Children young 18 year PET scan do . This study may may direct benefit participant . However , detailed assessment make throughout study may provide information help doctor treat KSHV-MCD better .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Virotherapy Natural History Study KHSV-Associated Multricentric Castleman Disease With Correlates Disease Activity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Multicentric Castleman 's disease ( MCD ) rare lethal Kaposi 's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ( KSHV ) associate lymphoproliferative disorder median survival 2 year . It occur often HIV-infected individual without HIV infection . The poor prognosis fully explain underlying HIV , HIV-negative case appear survival advantage HIV-positive cohort . The disease define standard treatment prospectively study comprehensive manner . - KSHV-MCD may provide model development target oncolytic virotherapy pathogenesis-based approach viral-associated malignancy . In KSHV-MCD , viral encode tyrosine kinase gene appear possible target exploit virotherapy approach . Specific viral encode gene appear convert zidovudine ganciclovir ( valganciclovir ) toxic phosphorylated moiety within KSHV-infected tumor cell , specifically target KSHV-infected cell thus lead specific cell death . If successful , could direct therapeutic benefit patient also provide model development approach tumor . Objectives - To study describe natural history KSHV-MCD . - To assess disease activity reflect fever , thrombocytopenia , anemia , neutropenia , lymphocytopenia , human viral interleukin-6 level , C-reactive protein , KSHV viral load . - To describe laboratory pathogenesis-related parameter ( especially serum level human viral interleukin-6 ) relate clinical hematologic parameter list . Eligibility - Age great equal 12 year - Biopsy proven KSHV-associated MCD Design - Natural History study - Inclusion treatment need , guideline preliminary investigation variety specific treatment interest - High-dose zidovudine ganciclovir - High-dose zidovudine ganciclovir bortezomib - Sirolimus - Rituximab liposomal doxorubicin follow interferon-alpha - Rituximab EPOCH chemotherapy</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Age great equal 12 year . Biopsy proven KSHVassociated MCD , confirm Laboratory Pathology , CCR . Willing give inform consent . A parent guardian must available give consent pediatric subject 18 year age . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Any abnormality would score NCI CTC Grade IV toxicity unrelated HIV , treatment , MCD would preclude protocol treatment and/or observation . Presence another malignancy require current treatment would preclude use study treatment ability monitor natural history MCD untreated .
