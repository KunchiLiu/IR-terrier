	<brief_summary>This 2-part study examine much exercise people usually course daily live two different type exercise-stretching walking-affect amount fat body certain hormone blood . It also examine whether exercise increase physician counseling without use pedometer , exercise change level stress , anxiety , depression . Breast cancer survivor woman high risk breast cancer 18 75 year age exercise le 3 time per week may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , endurance flexibility test stretch exercise 6-minute walk run . All participant complete study Part 1 . Those eligible may also participate Part 2 . - Part 1 : Subjects wear pedometer ( small device measure number step take ) waistband wake hour 1 week without change usual level activity . Depending level activity , subject may invite participate Part 2 study . - Part 2 : Subjects place either walk group stretch group 12 week . At end 12-week period , walk group offer participation stretch group , stretch group offer participation walk group . Walking group participant wear pedometer every day 12 week . They ask gradually increase number step take day , keep record daily step count , report periodically study staff progress . For 1 week study , participant also wear device call accelerometer use verify accuracy pedometer step count . Stretching group participant follow program stretching exercise 12 week , progress monitor periodically staff . During week 12 , participant wear pedometer accelerometer . All Part 2 participant also follow test procedure : - Blood draw : collect begin end study test certain hormone HDL cholesterol level . - Questionnaires : stress , anxiety , depression level ; complete begin end study , detailed questionnaire diet complete home clinic visit . - Body composition measurement : A `` bioelectrical impedance '' test , measure body fat , do begin end study . For test , subject lie examine table small electrical current pass electrode place one hand one foot . Although small electrical current use , test painful . - Endurance flexibility testing : At end study , participant repeat 6-minute walk run endurance test stretch flexibility test perform screening .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Evidence suggest high level physical activity decrease breast cancer risk . Physical activity could therefore represent viable breast cancer prevention strategy . In order study effect physical activity breast cancer risk , must first develop feasible efficacious physical activity intervention . Objectives : Primary : To determine rate compliance physical activity intervention use pedometer , physician prescription , motivational booklet . To determine whether intervention effective control stretch exercise increase physical activity . Secondary : To determine whether physical activity measure pedometer correlate measure physical activity . To assess effect physical activity intervention serum biomarkers , quality life , functional capacity body composition . To examine long-term compliance program increase physical activity ass post program exercise motivation adherence . Eligibility : Eligible patient woman age 18-75 meet one follow criterion : History breast cancer without evidence recurrent disease . Gail model 5 year risk great 1.7 % . Claus model lifetime risk great 20 % . History appropriately treat DCIS . History high risk lesion breast biopsy ( ADH , ALH , LCIS ) . Known suspected BRCA1 BRCA2 mutation . Patients must sedentary baseline must medically fit exercise . Design : This randomize pilot study design assess feasibility physical activity intervention breast cancer survivor woman high risk breast cancer . Stage I : Patients undergo baseline activity evaluation one week involve wear seal pedometer - average daily step count le 5,000 step eligible randomization . Stage II : Patients assign either walk intervention , ( include pedometer , physician exercise prescription final goal walk 10,000 step per day , motivational booklet ) control stretch exercise period 12 week . Biomarkers , functional capacity , body composition diet assess begin end study . This study plan randomize 80 subject , great 90 % power detect mean increase 3,000 step per day intervention subject .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : This study enroll 40 breast cancer survivor 40 woman high risk breast cancer . All participant must fulfill follow criterion : Age 18 75 . Sedentary baseline , define weekly leisuretime activity score 15 less Godin LeisureTime Exercise Questionnaire . This cutoff equivalent engage moderate activity le 3 time week . Ability complete study questionnaire , willing friend family member assist questionnaire completion . ECOG performance status 01 . Ability successfully perform level physical activity prescribe protocol , assessed Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire ( PARQ ) . Any participant answer yes question screen tool undergo medical evaluation Clinical Center , appropriate , prior enrol study . Cardiac risk assess complete history physical exam , determine examine physician . Only patient felt increased cardiac risk EKG perform . This include patient answer yes question PARQ ass cardiac risk ( # 1,2,3,4,6 ) . Patients worrisome EKG finding finding history physical exam warrant workup opinion health care provider refer cardiology consult service , nonurgent , refer back source regular medical care clearance prior enrol study . If history cancer ( invasive breast cancer , squamous basal cell skin cancer ) , subject must evidence disease time enrollment AND history cancer direct treatment 2 year precede enrollment . Breast cancer survivor : Eligible breast cancer survivor woman document history Stage I , II III invasive breast cancer least two month completion primary therapy , include surgery , radiation chemotherapy . Current use hormonal therapy tamoxifen aromatase inhibitor , permit , however subject must complete 2 month hormonal therapy prior begin study order achieve steady state . Women high risk breast cancer : Women consider high risk develop breast cancer fulfill one follow criterion : A Gail model risk great equal to1.7 percent 5 year study entry Claus model lifetime risk great 20 percent . Lobular neoplasia . Atypical ductal hyperplasia . Ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) previously treat . Patients must least 2 month completion primary therapy , treat hormonal therapy , must complete least two month hormonal therapy . Deleterious mutation BRCA1 2 OR A priori risk assessment 20 percent chance great carry BRCA1/2 gene mutation . The BRCAPRO model ( 109 ) use ass risk . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Currently pregnant plan become pregnant study period . Pregnancy assess woman childbearing potential prior enrol stage II study . Postmenopausal woman woman previous hysterectomy , oophorectomy tubal ligation require undergo pregnancy test . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness , include , limited : ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , recent myocardial infarction stroke , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Physical condition preclude amount daily walk prescribe protocol ( e.g. , severe arthritis , use walker cane , wheelchairbound , etc. ) . Medical psychiatric disorder would , opinion Principal Investigator , render subject unable provide inform consent . Patients metastatic recurrent disease exclude difficulty interpret result context woman disease burden and/or chemotherapy .</criteria>
