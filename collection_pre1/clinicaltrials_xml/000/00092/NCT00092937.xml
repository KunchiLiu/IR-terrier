	<brief_summary>This protocol design single specific patient . It use busulfan condition agent second stem cell transplant procedure patient chronic granulomatous disease ( CGD ) , disorder certain type white cell , call myeloid cell , function properly . This cause increase risk serious bacterial fungal infection lead organ dysfunction , kidney disease , well formation granulomas-non-cancerous mass cause obstruction esophagus , stomach , intestine , block urine flow kidney bladder. ) . The child study previously undergone stem cell transplant treat CGD , , result , produce normal lymphocyte ( another type white cell ) . However , myeloid cell donor engraft successfully , patient still produce defective myeloid cell . In study , child undergo second stem cell transplant combination busulfan , drug target myeloid cell , kill make way healthy , donated myeloid cell . Treatment include following procedure : - Medical evaluation confirm patient healthy enough undergo transplantation - Treatment busulfan , inject patient 's central venous line - Stem cell transplantation central venous line - Blood test day 25 , 56 , 91 transplant ass many cell donor origin - Bone marrow aspiration day 100 , 12 , 24 , 36 month assess many cell donor origin - Pulmonary function ( breathe ) test 12 24 month - Physical examination blood test , weekly twice weekly first 2 3 month 4 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 month transplant - Treatment graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) , complication develops . GVHD attack lymphocytes donor patient 's cell . This good abnormal cell , bad serious damage occur patient 's vital organ . GVHD treat steroid cyclosporine , possibly drug need .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Busulfan Conditioning Agent Second Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single patient study use intravenous busulfan conditioning agent second allogeneic stem cell transplant order increase myeloid engraftment previously transplant recipient chronic granulomatous disease ( CGD ) . CGD inherit disorder neutrophil function lead increase risk infection common rare microorganism , include fungi . Although infection often prevent successfully treat , long-term sequela include organ dysfunction result infection treatment . For example , many anti-fungal agent cause renal impairment even lead kidney failure require dialysis . In addition , abnormal functioning neutrophil lead development granuloma , cause obstruction various organ , particular within gastrointestinal urogenital system sometimes serious sequela . As result life expectancy patient CGD significantly limit patient document reach age 50 2 percent mortality rate per year life . Currently , available cure CGD bone marrow transplantation ; however give inherent associate morbidity mortality , well necessity match ( relate ) donor , offer patient . More recently attempt reduce toxicity potentially curative treatment lead development non-myeloablative regimen , result , lead partial engraftment donor cell recipient , situation refer mixed chimerism . In order achieve adequate number normal neutrophils clinical benefit , level donor chimerism need least 5 percent myeloid lineage . One patient treat previous protocol novel nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen , 100 percent engraftment lymphoid cell , less 1percent engraftment myeloid lineage . As result , continue experience problem associate CGD , problem graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) . In order improve myeloid engraftment , take advantage presence 100 percent lymphoid chimerism , propose treat moderate dose busulfan purify stem cell product original donor second transplant . With study , goal improve patient 's myeloid engraftment ostensibly cure CGD .</detailed_description>
