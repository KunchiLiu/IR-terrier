	<brief_summary>Background : - Chronic graft-versus-host disease ( cGVHD ) multi-organ alloimmune autoimmune disorder occur follow allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( alloHSCT ) . It characterize immune dysregulation , immunodeficiency , impaired organ function , decrease survival . - Each year 7000 patient receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( alloHSCT ) North America 50 % patient transplant develop cGVHD . - Chronic GVHD also disorder simultaneously affect many organ system highly variable fashion require complex coordinate medical management multiple medical specialty . There urgent need progress understand effective treatment cGVHD one serious complication cancer therapy hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . Objectives : - To establish multidisciplinary clinic infrastructure study pathogenesis natural history cGVHD . - To prospectively identify clinical biological prognostic marker patient cGVHD . - To develop clinically relevant cGVHD grade scale . - To identify novel biological characteristic cGVHD describe context clinical history presentation . - To identify potential clinical biological marker cGVHD activity . - To improve understand biology cGVHD-associated graft-versus-tumor effect . Eligibility : -Patients age 1-75 refer primary transplant physician evaluation chronic graft-versus-host disease independent underlying diagnosis . Design : - Patient undergoes initial clinical labotory multispecialty work-up NCI cGVHD clinic . - Minimally invasive biopsy rarely , deep tissue biopsy may obtain confirm diagnosis and/or rule-out pathologic process ( adult ) . - Long tem data collection evaluation long-term outcome conduct every six month first three year study yearly .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Any patient age 175 refer primary transplant physician evaluation chronic graftversushost disease independently age underlying diagnosis ; 2 . Patient patient 's legal representative able willing provide consent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Significant medical condition significant circumstance could PIs assessment affect patient 's ability tolerate , comply , complete study ; 2 . Patients PIs assessment life expectancy le 3 month . Note : Because always possible make clear clinical distinction acute chronic GVHD , patient acute GVHD apriori exclude possibility chronic GVHD reliably exclude basis clinical assessment cGVHD clinic .</criteria>
