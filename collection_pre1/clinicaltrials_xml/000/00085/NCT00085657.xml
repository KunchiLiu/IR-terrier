	<brief_summary>This study examine whether brain stimulation use transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) stroke patient undergo rehabilitation therapy help patient recover strength motor function rehabilitation therapy alone . For tDCS , two small metal disk ( electrode ) attach wire place small cotton pad tap subject 's head , one forehead eye top head . The electrode deliver brief electrical current stimulates cortex , part brain responsible motor function . Adult patient weakness one side body result stroke occur within last 15 day may eligible study . NIH directly recruit patient study . Patients select National Rehabilitation Hospital ( NRH ) Research Center personnel Washington , DC , patient treatment facilitiy . Candidates screen physical neurologic examination , review test do admission NRH , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan , one do since stroke . MRI use strong magnetic field radio wave obtain image brain . The MRI scanner metal cylinder surround strong magnetic field . During MRI , patient lie table slide cylinder . Scanning time study take 30 45 minute . Participants randomly assign receive tDCS placebo stimulation , along rehabilitation therapy , 2 3 week , depend patient 's length stay NRH . For placebo stimulation , electrode place patient 's scalp tDCS , current deliver . Before rehabilitation session electrode , patient undergo Jebsen Taylor motor testing , ask lift small object , turn card , use spoon , stack checker , lift can fast . On day discharge , patient physical neurological examination motor function test describe . The motor test repeat , along standard care review health status , outpatient follow-up visit schedule 3 , 12 month . The motor test : - Wolf motor function test - Patients ask raise forearm table , box , reach across table , push sandbag , place hand table , pull weight , lift , pick pencil , pick paper clip , stack checker , flip card , use key , fold towel , pick basket . - Barthel index - Patients time speed perform certain task , feed , groom , move wheelchair . - Abilhand questionnaire - Patients answer question perform routine daily activity . - GOT test tactile discrimination - Patients describe object feel hand . - Ashworth spasticity scale - A medical staff person move patient 's arm back forth see stiff .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES There universally accept strategy promote recovery motor function stroke , main cause long-term disability among adult . Neurorehabilitation contribute recovery first day week stroke later decelerates . Therefore , desirable develop strategy enhance rehabilitative effect motor recovery particularly early phase stroke patient group . We recently demonstrate cortical stimulation form TMS enhance beneficial effect motor train cortical plasticity healthy volunteer tDCS ( another noninvasive comfortable stimulating technique TMS transiently improve functional motor skill paretic hand chronic stroke patient absence training . Given paucity strategy available enhance neurorehabilitation stroke , crucial determine tDCS enhance beneficial effect customarily use rehabilitative treatment . tDCS use several hundred subject worldwide approximately 9 stroke patient , 15 Parkinson 's disease patient 15 healthy volunteer lab absence undesirable side effect . In addition objective , also apply functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) techniques determine extent change neural response functional shift cortical representations/reorganization result propose intervention strategy . fMRI measure important understanding change brain activation prior , , motor recovery effect tDCS rehabilitative treatment strategy investigation . Integrating TMS together fMRI study provide crucial information functional role brain region activate neuroimaging study association functional recovery . STUDY POPULATION We plan study 120 patient single cortical subcortical subacute stroke . Thirty healthy volunteer sub-group 30 patient 120 patient population also recruit fMRI TMS part study . The reason include 30 patient fMRI TMS component study anticipate 120 patient recruit initial study ( i.e. , tDCS therapeutic intervention phase ) may able perform task require fMRI part study also satisfy Exclusion criterion fMRI scan . In addition , base previous study preliminary fMRI power analysis , estimate 30 patient likely sufficient provide representative sample patient group test hypothesis state protocol . Thirty healthy volunteer necessary fMRI TMS component study order obtain normative data TMS fMRI component investigation . They multiple number TMS fMRI session patient order obtain descriptive information variability measure group . DESIGN The purpose protocol test hypothesis tDCS apply combination customary rehabilitative training use community ( RT ) enhance motor recovery 3 month admission relative placebo RT , functional recovery associate change cortical excitability ipsilesional primary motor cortex ( M1 ) dorsal pre-motor cortex . The tDCS part study do NRH ( evaluate parallel NINDS review process ) . Patients include protocol soon admit NRH RT ( usually 3-10 day ictal event ) . Patients , eligible protocol randomize one two study arm : RT + tDCS RT + placebo stimulation . In study arm patient take part daily customary RT procedure . We record specific rehabilitative therapy receive patient . In tDCS study arm , patient receive tDCS motor cortex associate RT every day time inpatient stay ( 14 day ) . Placebo implement way stimulate equipment place tDCS . Patient therapist ( provide treatment determine primary outcome measure ) aware arm participation ( double-blind study design ) . Normal volunteer recruit fMRI TMS part study carry NIH . They screen base criterion list protocol receive neurological exam determine qualification propose study . OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcome measure Jebsen-Tailor-Test ( JTT ) , test measure functional ability hand daily living activity . Secondary outcome measure include Wolf Motor Function Test ( WMFT ) , Fugl-Meyer-scale ( FMS ) , MRC scale , Abilhand scale ( AHS ) , Barthel Index , Ashworth-Spasticity scale ( ASS ) , grate orientation task ( GOT ) NIH stroke scale . For fMRI TMS study , change BOLD ( blood oxygenation level dependent ) response delay reaction time outcome measure .</detailed_description>
