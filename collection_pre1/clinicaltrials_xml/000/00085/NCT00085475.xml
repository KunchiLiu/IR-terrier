	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans Giant Cell Fibroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine therapeutic activity imatinib mesylate patient locally advance metastatic dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans giant cell fibroblastoma . - Determine progression-free rate 14 week patient treated drug . Secondary - Determine objective response rate , progression-free survival , overall survival patient treated drug . - Determine duration response patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This open-label , non-randomized , multicenter study . Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily least 14 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable disease 14 week receive imatinib mesylate 12 additional week . Patients partial complete response 14 week undergo surgical resection possible . If surgical resection remain tumor possible OR complete resection achieve ( section margin positive ) , patient continue receive imatinib mesylate absence disease progression Patients follow monthly 6 month , every 3 month 6 month , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 44 patient accrue study within 2 year .</detailed_description>
