	<brief_title>US 10 mL Bronchoscopic Lung Volume Reduction ( BLVR ) Phase 1 Emphysema Study - Initial Formulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients emphysema currently limit treatment choice . Many patient treat steroid inhaled medication , often provide little benefit . Recently , lung volume reduction surgery become accept therapy emphysema . Lung volume reduction surgery involve removal diseased portion lung , enable remain , healthy portion lung function well . This procedure , although effective , complicate risky . Aeris Therapeutics develop Aeris Bronchoscopic Lung Volume Reduction System treatment patient advance emphysema . The Aeris BLVR System design reduce lung volume without surgery . Patients treat anesthesia use bronchoscope direct treatment damage area lung . The treatment expect reduce lung volume shrink diseased area lung . The purpose current study find whether Aeris BLVR System safe patient advance emphysema . The risk associate treatment expect similar associate general anesthesia bronchoscopy .</detailed_description>
