	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Interleukin-2 sargramostim may stimulate person 's white blood cell kill melanoma cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give interleukin-2 together sargramostim work treat patient stage III stage IV melanoma previously treat chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interleukin-2 Sargramostim After Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine frequency complete response patient stage III IV melanoma achieve either partial response stable disease prior systemic chemotherapy treat maintenance biotherapy comprise interleukin-2 sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) . Secondary - Determine time progression patient treat regimen . - Determine effect regimen lymphocyte subset patient . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord response prior systemic chemotherapy ( stable disease [ SD ] vs partial response [ PR ] ) . Patients receive sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1-14 low-dose interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) SC day 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 , 22-26 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also receive pulse high-dose IL-2* IV continuously 42 hour day 1 2 course 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 10 12 . NOTE : *Low-dose IL-2 GM-CSF administer day 1 2 high-dose IL-2 administration Patients continue SD PR 12 course therapy may continue receive treatment GM-CSF low-dose IL-2 describe high-dose IL-2 day 1 2 every third course . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-58 patient ( 10-29 per stratum ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
