	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , fluorouracil leucovorin , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Celecoxib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary growth . It yet know whether fluorouracil leucovorin effective without celecoxib treating resect stage III adenocarcinoma ( cancer ) colon . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study celecoxib , fluorouracil , leucovorin see well work compare fluorouracil leucovorin treat patient undergone surgery stage III colon cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Celecoxib Combined With Fluorouracil Leucovorin Treating Patients With Resected Stage III Adenocarcinoma ( Cancer ) Colon</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare disease-free survival patient curatively resect stage III adenocarcinoma colon treat adjuvant fluorouracil leucovorin calcium without celecoxib . Secondary - Compare overall survival , occurrence new primary colon cancer , development new polyp patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord ≥ 4 tumor-positive lymph node ( yes v ) , form adjuvant chemotherapy ( infusional v bolus ) , low-dose aspirin cardiovascular prophylaxis ( yes v ) , participate center . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive fluorouracil leucovorin calcium IV 6 course absence disease recurrence unacceptable toxicity . Patients also receive oral celecoxib twice daily . - Arm II : Patients receive oral placebo twice daily fluorouracil leucovorin calcium arm I . In arm , treatment celecoxib placebo continue 3 year absence disease recurrence unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow annually 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 1,450 patient ( 725 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 2 year .</detailed_description>
