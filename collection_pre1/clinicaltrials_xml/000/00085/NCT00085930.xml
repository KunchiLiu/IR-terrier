	<brief_summary>Patients high-risk neuroblastoma , form cancer typically find child . The patient previously participate gene transfer research study use special immune cell . More information study follow . The body different way fight infection disease . No one way seem perfect fight cancer . This research study combine two different way fight disease , antibodies T cell , hop work together . Antibodies type protein protect body bacterial infection . T cell , also call cytotoxic T lymphocytes CTLs , special infection-fighting blood cell kill tumor cell . Both antibody T cell use treat patient cancer show promise , strong enough cure patient . The antibody use study call 14g2a . It first come mouse develop immunity human neuroblastoma . This antibody stick neuroblastoma cell substance outside cell call GD2 . 14g2a antibody bind GD2 use treat people neuroblastoma . For study 14g2a change instead float free blood , join T cell . When antibody join T cell way call chimeric receptor . T lymphocytes CTLs kill tumor cell normally enough kill tumor cell . Some researcher take T cell person 's blood , grown laboratory give back patient . Sometimes antibody chimeric receptor attach T cell help bind tumor cell . These chimeric receptor-T cell seem kill tumor , n't last long body tumor eventually come back . We find T cell also train recognize virus cause infectious mononucleosis , Epstein Barr Virus ( EBV ) , stay blood stream many year . By join 14g2a antibody CTLs recognize EBV , believe make cell last long time body ( EBV-specific ) recognize kill neuroblastoma cell ( antibody recognize cell place surface ) . Patients receive treatment immune cell describe . They may want receive additional dose cell . This offer option neuroblastoma return enough cell remain provide patient additional dose . These 14g2a antibody CTLs investigational product approve Food Drug Administration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Earlier , patient give u blood make 14g2a chimeric receptor-T cell 14g2a chimeric receptor-EBV CTLs laboratory . These cell grow frozen patient . The patient receive treatment cell . However , enough cell remain able offer treat patient additional dose would like . As original treatment , patient give injection cell vein IV . Before injection receive , patient give dose Benadryl Tylenol . The injection take 2 minute . We follow patient clinic injection 3 hour . The treatment give Center Cell Gene Therapy Texas Children 's Hospital . Medical test treatment -- Before treat , patient receive series standard medical test : - Physical exam - Blood test measure blood cell , kidney liver function - Measurements tumor scan bone marrow study bone marrow may show evidence disease Medical test treatment : The patient receive standard medical test get infusion : - Physical exam - Blood test measure blood cell , kidney liver function - Measurements tumor scan bone marrow study bone marrow evidence disease 6 week infusion Because patient receive cell new gene patient follow total 15 year see long term side effect gene transfer . If procedure relate tumor ( example biopsy tumor resection ) , request permission obtain tissue sample . This help investigators learn T cell CTL treatment neuroblastoma . In event death , request permission perform autopsy learn effect infusion disease .</detailed_description>
