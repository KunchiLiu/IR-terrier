	<brief_title>Triapine First-Line Second-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Cancer Pancreas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine 3- 6-month survival rate patient locally advance metastatic adenocarcinoma pancreas treat 3-AP ( Triapine^® ) first- second-line therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine toxicity tolerability drug patient . II . Determine time treatment failure patient treat drug . III . Determine overall survival disease progression patient treat drug . IV . Determine tumor response patient treated drug . V. Determine laboratory study increase understanding Triapine effect cellular process . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior chemotherapy ( yes v ) . Patients receive triapene IV 2 hour day 1-4 15-18 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3-6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
