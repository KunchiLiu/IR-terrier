	<brief_title>Dietary Fiber Cardiovascular Inflammatory Markers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Recent study find diet higher fiber intake associated reduction cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . However , association prove dietary fiber actually responsible low CVD risk illuminate potential mechanism low risk present . Since diet-CVD connection strong , give CVD major contributor morbidity mortality , additional information would valuable . Our preliminary study work others suggest significant association C-reactive protein ( CRP ) dietary fiber intake . These observation lead u follow unifying hypothesis : Diets high fiber associate low level inflammatory marker . Our long-term goal determine whether inflammation key mediator link fiber intake cardiovascular disease risk . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The three specific aim project 1 : To determine whether total dietary fiber fiber supplementation associate level inflammatory marker ( CRP , fibrinogen , WBC ) among adult participant obesity , hypertension , diabetes National Health Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2000 ; 2 : To determine whether 3 week diet naturally high fiber ( 30g/day ) , diet high fiber supplementation , significantly reduce inflammatory marker compare diet low fiber , clinical trial among 30 lean 30 obese adult hypertensive volunteer ; 3 : To determine whether 3 month diet supplement moderate fiber ( extra 7g/day ) , high fiber ( 15g/day ) , significantly reduce inflammatory marker compare usual diet low fiber ( average 10-15g/day ) three-month long clinical trial among 180 obese adult volunteer . To accomplish aim , three related study conduct . The first utilize exist data contain National Health Nutrition Examination Survey , national database 5773 non-institutionalized adult . The second study additional procedure laboratory examination exist R01 one investigator , examine impact diet naturally high fiber CRP inflammatory marker . The third study consist new primary data collection 180 volunteer evaluate effect different level fiber supplementation CRP , fibrinogen , WBC , interleukin-6 . By use exist data , take advantage ongoing protocol , add new information primary data collection , investigator hope dramatically increase understand association dietary fiber cardiovascular inflammatory marker . This information could serve guide constructive change nutritional guideline reduce CVD risk million at-risk individual .</detailed_description>
