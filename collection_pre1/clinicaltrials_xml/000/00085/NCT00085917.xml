	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety effectiveness combination therapy peginterferon alpha-2a ribavirin treat hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection HIV-infected patient . Peginterferon alpha ribavirin therapy choice people HCV alone . Peginterferon alpha-2a compound result attach polyethylene glycol molecule interferon alpha-2a . This compound stay blood longer unmodified interferon alpha-2a , cause high blood concentration thus maintain great activity hepatitis C virus . HIV-infected patient 18 year age old chronic hepatitis C infection viral load great 2000 copies/mL may eligible 2-1/2 year study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood urine test , eye examination , chest x-ray , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , liver ultrasound , pregnancy test woman able become pregnant . If recent liver biopsy available , test do determine type severity liver disease . The patient give sedative procedure . Then , skin area biopsy site numb local anesthetic needle insert rapidly liver obtain small tissue sample . The patient remain hospital overnight monitoring . Participants begin treatment injection skin peginterferon alpha-2a ribavirin pill mouth study day 0 . Peginterferon give either twice week 4 week week 44 week . Ribavirin give daily . In addition , patient continue take medication prescribe doctor . Clinic visit schedule follow procedure : - Days 1 , 3 , 4 , 7 , 10 week 2 , 3 , 4 - Blood test safety measure measure blood level HIV HCV . - Weeks 6 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 28 , 32 , 36 , 40 , 44 - Blood urine test determine side effect treatment effect HCV infection . In addition , eye examination do every 3 month , pregnancy thyroid function test do several time treatment period . - Week 48 end treatment - Treatment stop 48 week . At time , early complete 48 week , patient return clinic chest x-ray , EKG , blood test , abdominal ultrasound . Patients hospitalize repeat liver biopsy . - Weeks 52 , 56 , 64 72 - Blood urine test determine side effect treatment effect HCV infection , urine pregnancy test woman .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peginterferon Alpha-2a Ribavirin Treat Hepatitis C HIV-infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C infection occur one-third HIV-infected individual . Liver disease become significant among patient coinfected HIV HCV . Several study show coinfected individual develop earlier severe liver disease . Pegylated interferon alpha ribavirin become therapy choice among people HCV alone . This randomize control study address safety efficacy 4 week induction therapy consist twice-weekly pegylated interferon alpha-2a daily ribavirin HIV-1 hepatitis C coinfected individual . Twenty-two patient infect HIV HCV also evidence chronic hepatitis randomize receive peginterferon alpha-2a either twice weekly weekly four week . They continue standard weekly peginterferon 44 week . The patient receive standard daily dose ribavirin entire 48 week . These patient monitor peginterferon level , HCV viral load , HIV viral load CD4 count undergo baseline liver biopsy another end 72 week . The result study enable u good delineate efficacy twice weekly peginterferon induction therapy suppress hepatitis C virus first 4 week therapy . Since viral suppression hepatitis C early phase combination treatment predictive value long term eradication virus , therapy improve early viral suppression may improve long term cure rate . This especially important give current low cure rate HCV among HIV coinfected individual .</detailed_description>
