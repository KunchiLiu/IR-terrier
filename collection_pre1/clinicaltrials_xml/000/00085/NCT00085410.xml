	<brief_title>Bortezomib Treating Patients With Unresectable Locally Advanced Metastatic Adenocarcinoma Bile Duct Gallbladder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective response rate patient unresectable locally advanced metastatic adenocarcinoma bile duct gallbladder treat bortezomib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine time disease progression patient treat drug . II . Determine overall survival patient treated drug . III . Correlate degree proteasome inhibition peripheral blood degree proteasome inhibition tumor specimens patient treated drug . IV . Correlate phenotypic expression NF-kB , p53 , molecular marker biliary washing tumor biopsy clinical outcome patient treated drug . V. Correlate treatment drug change phenotypic expression molecular marker patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive bortezomib IV 3-5 second day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
