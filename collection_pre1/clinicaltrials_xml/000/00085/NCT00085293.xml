	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well decitabine work treat patient metastatic papillary thyroid cancer follicular thyroid cancer stop respond radioactive iodine . Iodine I 131 ( radioactive iodine ) kill thyroid cancer cell . Metastatic thyroid cancer cell lose ability treat radioactive iodine . Decitabine may help thyroid cancer cell regain ability respond treatment radioactive iodine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Decitabine Treating Patients With Metastatic Papillary Thyroid Cancer Follicular Thyroid Cancer Unresponsive Iodine I 131</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . Determine whether decitabine restore iodine I 131 ( 131I ) uptake patient metastatic papillary thyroid follicular thyroid cancer lesion undetectable low-dose iodine 131I scanning . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine efficacy 131I therapy , administer restoration 131I uptake decitabine , patient . II . Determine effect decitabine clinical molecular marker thyroid cancer cell differentiation patient . III . Determine safety tolerability decitabine patient undergo thyroid hormone withdrawal-induced hypothyroidism 131I therapy . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive decitabine intravenous ( IV ) 1 hour day 1-5 8-12 week 1 2 ( course 1 ) . On week 3 , patient undergo iodine I 131 ( 131I ) scan use thyrotropin alfa injection . Patients whose scan demonstrate iodine uptake continue suppressive thyroid hormone therapy receive study therapy . These patient undergo study follow . Patients whose scan demonstrate iodine uptake undergo thyroid hormone withdrawal week 4-8 receive second course decitabine ( course 1 ) week 7 8 . Patients receive 131I therapy week 9 . Patients follow 3 6 month .</detailed_description>
