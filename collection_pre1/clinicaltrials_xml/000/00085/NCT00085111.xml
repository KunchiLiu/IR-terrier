	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Treating Young Patients With Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate maximum tolerable dose ( MTD ) bevacizumab dose escalation maximum 15mg/kg , even MTD reach , administer intravenous infusion , every 2 week child refractory solid tumor . II . To determine dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) toxicities bevacizumab give schedule . III . To characterize pharmacokinetic behavior bevacizumab child refractory cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To preliminarily define antitumor activity bevacizumab within confines phase I study . II . To assess biologic activity bevacizumab measuring level total serum VEGF , parallel angiogenic marker V-CAM-1 , ICAM-1 , bFGF , TSP-1 baseline time point post therapy . III . To explore biologic effect bevacizumab circulate endothelial cell ( CECs ) circulate endothelial cell precursor ( CECPs ) . IV . To determine archival tumor tissue expression VEGF immunohistochemistry and/or real time PCR . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 24 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos bevacizumab maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity .</detailed_description>
