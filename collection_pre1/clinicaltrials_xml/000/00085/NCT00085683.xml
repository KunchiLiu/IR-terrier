	<brief_summary>This study explore whether human herpes virus-6 associate epileptic seizure . The virus may involve brain scarring , call mesial temporal sclerosis , see epilepsy patient . The virus also think possibly interfere neurotransmitter - chemical brain cell use communicate . This study measure level two chemical , GABA glutamate , believe play role development seizure . Patients epilepsy , without mesial temporal sclerosis , healthy control subject 18 year age old may eligible study . Control subject may take medication regular basis . Epilepsy patient may take phenytoin , carbamazepine , oxcarbazepine , lamotrigine , levetiracetam . Candidates screen physical examination blood test . Participants blood drawn undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) . Blood Draw Up four teaspoon blood drawn needle arm study . MRI MRI use magnetic field radio wave produce picture brain . The scanner metal cylinder surround strong magnetic field . During scan , subject lie bed slide cylinder , wear earplug muffle loud noise machine make magnetic field switch . The scan take 90 120 minute , time subject communicate technician . Lumbar Puncture For test subject sits upright lie side knee curl chest . A local anesthetic inject low back , needle inserted space bone cerebrospinal fluid circulate spinal cord . A small amount fluid collect needle . Collection fluid usually take 5 20 minute .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : We would like demonstrate study human herpesvirus-6 play role development mesial temporal sclerosis ( MTS ) result epilepsy . We would also like examine influence virus neurotransmitter glutamate GABA , since believe imbalance major excitatory inhibitory neurotransmitter play important role epilepsy . Study population : The study population consist adult patient epilepsy MTS adult patient epilepsy MTS confirm magnetic resonance ( MR ) image scan brain . We compare finding two group healthy adult volunteer . Design : This natural history study demonstrate presence absence human herpesvirus-6 serum cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) obtain three adult study group : patient epilepsy MTS , patient epilepsy MTS , normal control . We measure three group concentration GABA glutamate CSF . In three group perform proton MR spectroscopy non-invasively measure metabolites brain . Outcome measure : The three subject group compare term presence absence human herpesvirus-6 serum CSF term level glutamate GABA measure CSF magnetic resonance spectroscopy hippocampus temporal lobe .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects race ethnicity include study . Any subject diagnose medically intractable epilepsy eligible epilepsy protocol # 01N0139 evaluate entry study . INCLUSION CRITERIA : All patient seizure disorder document EEG videoEEG . Half patient radiologically document mesial temporal sclerosis half brain MRI without mesial temporal sclerosis . The patient phenytoin , carbamazepine , oxcarbazepine , lamotrigine levetiracetam , since antiepileptic drug least effect glutamate GABA level brain . The patient take medication . Healthy control subject enter study must free serious disease determine standard physical neurological examination . The control subject medication . All subject must able give informed consent allow u use cerebrospinal fluid serum research . All subject able refrain chocolate , tea coffee ( low monoamine diet ; Wood et al.1979 ) alcohol one week study . Patients must seizure free 48 hour prior lumbar tap MRS. EXCLUSION CRITERIA Subjects exclude : They age 18 They female pregnant They history medical disorder affect concentration cerebral metabolite , include diabetes mellitus , renal dysfunction , hepatic dysfunction electrolyte abnormality They take medication normal control group They take medication , exception phenytoin , carbamazepine , oxcarbazepine , lamotrigine levetiracetam epilepsy patient They history psychiatric and/or mood disorder They implant device pacemaker , medication pump defibrillator , metal cranium except mouth , intracardiac line , history shrapnel injury condition/device may contraindicate prevent acquisition MRI They coagulopathy prevents lumbar puncture perform They seizure 48 hour prior MRS lumbar tap Subjects give inform consent allow u use removed fluid research also exclude .</criteria>
