	<brief_title>Docetaxel Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Endometrial Carcinoma ( Cancer )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine antitumor activity docetaxel patient recurrent persistent endometrial carcinoma . - Determine toxicity drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 19-51 patient accrue study within 10-18 month .</detailed_description>
