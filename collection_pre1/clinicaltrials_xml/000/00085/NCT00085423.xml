	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide fludarabine , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Interleukin-2 may stimulate person 's white blood cell kill tumor cell may help person 's immune system recover side effect chemotherapy . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give cyclophosphamide fludarabine together high-dose interleukin-2 work treat patient metastatic melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cyclophosphamide , Fludarabine , High-Dose Interleukin-2 Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine objective response rate lymphodepleted patient metastatic melanoma treat cyclophosphamide , fludarabine , high-dose interleukin-2 . - Determine feasibility regimen patient . Secondary - Determine quality quantity lymphocyte recovery patient treatment regimen . - Determine time disease progression survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive lymphodepleting therapy comprise cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour day 1 2 fludarabine IV 30 minute day 3-7 . Patients receive high-dose interleukin-2 IV every 8 hour ( 14 dos ) day 8-12 22-26 . Patients also receive sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) subcutaneously begin day 8 continue blood count recover . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 18-33 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
