	<brief_summary>This study compare serotonin transporter proteins people alcoholism healthy volunteer examine protein may relate inability people alcoholism appropriately regulate alcohol consumption . Serotonin transporter regulate level brain chemical serotonin . Problems regulation implicate alcoholism . Healthy normal volunteer people suffer alcoholism 18 75 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , psychiatric diagnostic interview , blood urine test , electrocardiogram , urine toxicology screen , write psychological evaluation . Participants undergo positron emission tomography ( PET ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan measure serotonin transporter level brain . PET us small amount radioactive chemical call tracer `` label '' serotonin transporter brain . The tracer use study [ 11C ] DASB . For procedure , subject lie scanner bed . A special mask fit head attach bed help keep subject 's head still scan image clear . A brief scan do radioactive tracer inject . This scan provide measure brain help precise calculation information subsequent scan . After tracer inject catheter ( plastic tube ) place arm , picture take 2 hour . MRI use magnetic field radio wave produce picture brain structure . The subject lie bed slides tube-like scanner , wear earplug muffle loud noise machine make magnetic field switch . The scan take hour , time subject communicate technician .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Serotonin Transporters Alcoholism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alcoholism characterize inability individual regulate consumption alcohol appropriately . Serotonergic dysfunction implicate pathophysiology illness . Serotonin transporter ( SERT ) critically regulate tone serotonergic transmission ( Gobbi et al 2001 ) . In brain imaging study use SPECT radioligand , [ 123I ] Beta-CIT , male alcoholic abstain alcohol four week , significantly reduce serotonin transporter raphe area brainstem compare healthy control subject ( Heinz et al 1998 ) . However , [ 123I ] Beta-CIT ligand , bind high affinity dopamine transporter ( DAT ) SERT . Binding [ 123I ] Beta-CIT region rich SERT DAT attribute SERT DAT respectively regions mixed innervation ( e.g . cortical region ) , possible distinguish SERT DAT . [ 11C ] DASB PET ligand high affinity SERT almost 1,000 fold selectivity versus DAT . Using tracer , able measure SERT binding cortical subcortical brain region include mixed innervation . [ 11C ] DASB PET study human ( Houle et al 2000 ; Meyer et al 2001 ) indicate feasibility quantify SERT bind SERT rich region . In current protocol , plan use PET image radioligand , [ 11C ] DASB , serotonin transporter ( SERT ) delineate regional abnormality SERT bind two subject group consist 30 patient alcoholism 30 healthy volunteer . Our goal present study understand role serotonergic system pathophysiology alcoholism .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA : Alcoholic healthy subject recruit screen Dr. Daniel Hommer use either protocol ( Protocol number 98AA0009 ) use identify recruit adult participant meet DSMIV criterion alcohol dependence , alcohol abuse healthy control protocol ( Protocol number 05AA0121 ) assessment treatment people alcohol drink problem . As state protocol 98AA0009 , subject recruit primarily Washington , DC metropolitan area newspaper advertisement . These approve NIAAA IRB past change . As necessary advertisement primarily publish Washington Post Health Section , review revise . Any revision present IRB . Subjects also recruit outreach health care professional treatment facility throughout Northern Virginia , West Virginia Washington , DC Baltimore metropolitan area . Patient referral source throughout U.S. occasion international referral also use . Increased effort make recruit alcoholic subject Hispanic community . This take form contact treatment program serve Hispanic population , well advertise Spanish language newspaper . We decide exclude child protocol NIH Clinical Center currently inpatient unit capable treat substance abuse patient age 18 . Every effort make recruit similar number agematched male female . The two group individually match age . For example , seek control subject match particular alcoholic patient 's age . Instead two group match mean age . We obtain informed consent subject per NIH guideline research study . INCLUSION CRITERIA PATIENTS : Age : 1875 DSMIV criterion alcohol dependence alcohol abuse . INCLUSION CRITERIA CONTROLS : Age : 1875 EXCLUSION CRITERIA : PATIENTS AND CONTROLS : Other current DSMIV Axis I diagnostic criterion alcohol dependence alcohol abuse . Psychotropic medication drug may cross blood brain barrier . Serious organic disease e.g . liver disease . Claustrophobia . Pregnancy . Prior participation research protocol within past year radiation exposure together present study would exceed annual limit . Any condition increase risk MRI ( e.g. , pacemaker , metallic foreign body eye , etc . )</criteria>
