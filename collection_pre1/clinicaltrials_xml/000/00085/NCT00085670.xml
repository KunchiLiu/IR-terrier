	<brief_summary>This study examine whether cytokine gene polymorphism affect progression response therapy bone marrow failure disorder . Cytokine gene instruct cell produce protein call cytokine influence immune system response . As many gene , cytokine gene differ slightly person person . These difference call gene polymorphism . Different patient bone marrow failure disease often progress respond treatment differently . This study look possible role cytokine gene polymorphisms difference . Patients 2 80 year old participate NHLBI Hematology Branch treatment protocol acquire aplastic anemia , myelodysplastic syndrome , pure red cell aplasia recruit participate study . Blood collect stored time screen treatment protocol test cytokine gene polymorphism . No additional test , procedure , treatment involve study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The NHLBI Hematology Branch investigate feature may affect clinical course bone marrow failure patient . We particularly interested identify factor , determine treatment response outcome . Cytokines biological mediator immune response . In normal population considerable variation precise sequence gene control cytokine production ( Cytokine Gene Polymorphism CGP ) . As consequence individual differ quality immune response mount self foreign antigen . Since bone marrow failure disorder aplastic anemia myelodysplastic syndrome involve auto-immune suppression marrow function , important discover whether recurrent pattern cytokine production disorder may contribute marrow failure . This do studying sequence gene control cytokine production find whether recurrent gene pattern disease study . In addition need understand patient fail respond immunosuppressive treatment . By compare CGP responder non-responders may able find patterns cytokine production favorable unfavorable response . Better understanding CGPs marrow failure syndrome make possible improve outcome patient fail immune suppression use drug block specific cytokine . None polymorphism associate known clinical disease classifiable 'genetic defect ' . All test do sample collect store research purpose consent bone marrow failure subject participate Hematology Branch research protocol .</detailed_description>
