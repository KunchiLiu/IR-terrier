	<brief_title>Erlotinib Treating Patients With Stage IIIB , Stage IV , Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Prospectively identify downstream marker EGFR link signal pathway predictive response OSI-774 ( Erlotinib ) population . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate antitumor objective response rate per RECIST . II . Estimate disease control rate ( CR+PR+SD ) . III . Estimate time progression overall survival . IV . Estimate grade 2 rash predictor response OSI-774 ( Erlotinib ) patient survival . V. Assess safety profile OSI-774 ( Erlotinib ) population . VI . To determine whether smoke status link outcome advanced NSCLC patient treat OSI-774 ( Erlotinib ) . OUTLINE : This pilot , multicenter study . Patients receive oral erlotinib daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients complete Smoking Status Survey , questionnaire regard smoke habit , baseline , every 3 month study treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 129 patient accrue study within 6 month .</detailed_description>
