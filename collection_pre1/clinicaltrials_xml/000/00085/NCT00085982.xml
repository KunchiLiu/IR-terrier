	<brief_summary>Leptin hormone produce fat cell researcher show play role control appetite . Certain people severe insulin resistance little leptin . The purpose study investigate people whose leptin level find low 85 percent general population . Researchers determine whether insulin level participant improve treat genetically engineer leptin . Study participant must age 8 year old must severe insulin resistance syndrome leptin deficiency . During initial 7-day visit Clinical Center , researcher evaluate participant ' metabolic parameter , insulin responsiveness , lipid level , appetite , hormone level . After take test , participant self-inject dos leptin twice day monitor treatment outcomes well side effect via follow-up visit . These inpatient follow-up visit involve blood test image study Clinical Center 4 , 8 , 12 month initial visit , every 6 month thereafter .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Leptin Therapy Treatment Severe Insulin Resistance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over course past Fifteen year , observe recombinant leptin improve metabolic abnormality subject lipoatrophy leptin deficiency . The mechanism leptin treatment improve insulin sensitivity lipodystrophy patient correlate decrease triglyceride content occur liver muscle tissue leptin therapy , unclear completely account increase insulin sensitivity . We follow two patient mutation insulin receptor , refractory standard insulin resistance treatment . We administer recombinant leptin hormone 10 month two patient observed effect insulin sensitivity glucose tolerance pilot protocol . Initial result study demonstrated two patient extreme insulin resistance respond leptin therapy decrease HgbA1c , decrease fast serum glucose level , decrease fast serum insulin level , concomitant improvement glucose insulin tolerance treatment period leptin therapy . Three month follow leptin withdrawal , metabolic improvement deteriorate pre-treatment level . During 10-month period leptin treatment , adverse reaction therapy observe two patient . The diabetes group clinically challenge control . The new insulin sensitize medication currently test , clearly sufficient control diabetes optimal target range . In study , would like continue test safety efficacy leptin replacement therapy rare , complex group patient . We would like see whether leptin improve insulin sensitivity , thus decrease insulin resistance situation mechanism insulin resistance attribute presumed defect insulin receptor . This allow u learn leptin overcome receptor defect activate down-stream molecule insulin signal cascade . This open-labeled study 20 patient . We include ethnicity gender patient age 5 high , identify presumed insulin receptor mutation , extreme form insulin resistance , manifest fast hyperinsulinemia , fast hyperglycemia , severe glucose intolerance standard oral glucose tolerance test . These patient also need demonstrate concomitantly low fast leptin level ( less 12.0 ng/mL female less 8.0 ng/mL male ) . Patients evaluate every 6-12 month first two year therapy . If improvement see one year therapy , study medication withdrawn . If patient show improvement his/her metabolic parameter leptin , patient invite continue take study medication . After two year treatment , extend treatment period annual basis decision patient , principal investigator Aegerion Pharmaceuticals . Leptin supply Aegerion Pharmaceuticals , LLP currently available research study . Neither NIH Aegerion Pharmaceuticals guarantee leptin available indefinitely and/or study end . With leptin therapy , hope continue see improvement metabolic control demonstrate two pilot study patient . We hope good assess role leptin play regulate glucose control insulin sensitivity unique population patient , defect insulin sensitivity due know presumed insulin receptor mutation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Ethnicity : All ethnic group Gender : Males female Age &gt; 5 year . In experience young child , find participation serial blood test MRI scan improve greatly least 5 year age . Also , experience Type A insulin resistant patient , initial insulin resistance manifest extreme hyperinsulinemia hypoglycemia young patient . We would want treat young child experience chronic hypoglycemia . Clinically significant , severe insulin resistance . This document know suspected defect insulin receptor characteristic phenotypic identification . These include following : Rabson Mendenhall syndrome , usually associate mutation insulin receptor ; Type A insulin resistance , usually associate mutation insulin receptor ; Type B insulin resistance , associate autoantibody insulin receptor . The inclusion criterion include patient extreme insulin resistance appropriately low leptin level . Syndromes lipodystrophy similar , already approval treat group patient . Circulating leptin level &lt; 12.0 ng/ml female &lt; 8.0 ng/ml male measure Linco assay serum sample overnight fast . Presence least one follow metabolic abnormality : Fasting insulin &gt; 30 ( Micro ) U/ml OR Presence diabetes define 2006 ADA criterion : Fasting plasma glucose &gt; = 126 mg/dL 2 hour plasma glucose &gt; = 200 mg/dL follow 75 gram ( 1.75g/kg less 40kg ) oral glucose load , Diabetic symptom random plasma glucose &gt; = 200 mg/dL EXCLUSION CRITERIA General : Pregnant woman , woman reproductive year use effective method birth control , woman currently nurse lactate within 6 week complete nursing . Exclusions underlie disease likely increase side effect hinder objective data collection : Known infectious liver disease Known HIV infection Current alcohol substance abuse Psychiatric disorder impede competence compliance Active tuberculosis Use anorexiogenic drug Other condition opinion clinical investigator would impede completion study . Subjects know hypersensitivity E. Coli derive protein .</criteria>
