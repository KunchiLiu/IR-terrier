	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , melphalan , arsenic trioxide , ascorbic acid , work different way stop cancer cell divide stop grow die . Arsenic trioxide ascorbic acid may also help melphalan kill cancer cell make sensitive drug . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give melphalan together arsenic trioxide ascorbic acid work treat patient relapsed refractory multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Melphalan , Arsenic Trioxide , Ascorbic Acid Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine time progression patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma ( MM ) treat melphalan , arsenic trioxide , ascorbic acid . - Determine response rate ( combined complete response , partial response , minimal response ) patient treat regimen . - Determine safety tolerability regimen patient . Secondary - Determine time response overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine effect regimen renal failure associate MM patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , non-randomized , multicenter study . Patients receive oral melphalan daily day 1-4 week 1 arsenic trioxide ( ATO ) IV 1-2 hour ascorbic acid IV 15 minute day 1-4 week 1 twice weekly week 2-5 . Treatment repeat every 6 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients disease progression time course 1 also receive oral prednisone daily day 1-4 22-25 course . Patients achieve complete response 6 course therapy undergo bone marrow biopsy receive therapy . Patients achieve stable disease partial response 6 course therapy continue receive ATO ascorbic acid weekly . Patients follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 65 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
