	<brief_title>FR901228 Treating Patients With Recurrent High-Grade Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) FR901228 ( depsipeptide ) patient recurrent malignant glioma take enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drug ( EIAEDs ) . ( Phase I ) II . Determine safety profile drug patient . ( Phase I ) III . Determine pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics drug patient . ( Phase I ) IV . Determine clinical efficacy drug , measure 6-month progression-free survival objective tumor response , patient . ( Phase II ) V. Determine safety profile drug administer phase I MTD concurrently without EIAEDs patient . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This multicenter , phase I , dose-escalation study follow phase II study . Patients stratify accord study phase ( I vs II ) , concurrent use enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drug ( EIAEDs ) ( yes v ) , histology ( recurrent glioblastoma multiforme/gliosarcoma v recurrent anaplastic glioma ) , pre-operative candidacy ( yes v ) , measurable/evaluable disease ( yes v ) . Patients assign 1 2 treatment group ( group A : EIAEDs group B : concurrent use EIAEDs ) . Phase I ( group B ) : Patients receive FR901228 ( depsipeptide ) IV 4 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos FR901228 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Phase II ( group A B ) : Group A ( phase II ) : Patients receive FR901228 phase I dose level 1 . Group B ( phase II ) : Patients receive FR901228 phase I MTD .</detailed_description>
