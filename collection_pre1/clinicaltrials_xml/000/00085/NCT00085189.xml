	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Stage IIC-IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES I . To perform two-cohort , two-stage phase II two cohort pilot trial multi-peptide melanoma vaccine ( multi-epitope melanoma peptide vaccine ) Montanide ISA 51 ( incomplete Freund 's adjuvant ) ISA 51 VG ( Montanide ISA 51 VG ) adjuvant 7909 ( agatolimod sodium ) define safety tolerability regimen , evaluate immune reactivity tyrosinase/gp100/MAGE-3 class I peptide vaccine combine Montanide ISA 51 ISA 51 VG CpG adjuvant 7909 human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) class I A1 , A3 A11 B44 match patient surgically resect stage IIC , III IV melanoma . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 2 treatment cohort . COHORT I : Patients receive multi-epitope peptide melanoma peptide vaccine incomplete Freund 's adjuvant agatolimod sodium subcutaneously ( SC ) 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 14 , 18 , 22 , 26 , 38 , 50 week every six month two year 16 vaccination absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . COHORT II : Patients receive multi-epitope peptide melanoma peptide vaccine Montanide ISA 51 VG agatolimod sodium SC 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 14 , 18 , 22 , 26 , 38 , 50 week every six month two year 16 vaccination absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
