	<brief_summary>This study evaluate : 1 ) whether compute tomography ( CT ) scan good regular x-ray measure change stiffness , fusion , spine patient ankylose spondylitis ; 2 ) CT use determine fast extra bone form spine patient . Better way measure spinal fusion need able evaluate effectiveness medicine slow stop progression . CT use x-ray provide detailed picture inside body valuable detect spinal abnormality precision show structure . For procedure , patient lie table move large , donut-shaped scanner move around body take picture different angle , view computer monitor . Patients 18 year age old ankylose spondylitis currently take plan receive treatment anti-TNF alpha medication ( etanercept , infliximab , adalimumab ) 1 year may eligible study . Participants eight clinic visit , schedule study entry 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 48 month , NIH Clinical Center follow procedure : - Clinical assessment ( visit ) - include medical history physical examination , measurement spine flexibility tape measure protractor , symptom questionnaire - Blood test measure inflammation , include red blood cell sedimentation rate C-reactive protein level ( visit ) - Urine pregnancy test woman child-bearing age ( visit 1 , 4 , 7 , 8 ) - X-rays pelvis , low back , neck ( visit 1 , 4 , 7 ) - X-ray low back ( visit 8 ) - CT scan low back ( visit 1 , 4 , 7 ) - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) low back ( visit 1 , 4 ) - MRI combine powerful magnet advance computer system radio wave produce accurate , detailed picture organ tissue . The patient lie table narrow cylinder contain magnetic field , wear earplug muffle loud noise occur electrical switch magnetic field . He speak staff member via intercom system time procedure . During scan , contrast dye ( gadolinium ) inject bloodstream catheter ( plastic tube insert vein ) brighten image . In addition , participant complete symptom questionnaire mail every 4 month 2 year visit 7 8 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Progression Spinal Fusion Ankylosing Spondylitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spinal fusion clinical , radiological , pathological hallmark ankylose spondylitis ( AS ) . However , spinal fusion occur slowly AS . Serial radiograph rarely show change 2 year , often 5 year need demonstrate progression spinal fusion . Methods sensitive change extent spinal fusion plain radiograph need test treatment slow halt spinal fusion AS . The need improved measure spinal fusion heighten several new medication available potential markedly decrease spinal inflammation AS . The goal pilot study test whether measurement bone mineral density , bone volume , bone mass annulus fibrosis lumbar disc space compute tomography ( CT ) provide reliable , valid , sensitive measure spinal fusion patient AS . Fifty-five participant lumbar spine CT scan baseline , 12 month , 24 month , lumbar spine magnetic resonance image baseline 12 month , spinal radiograph baseline , 12 month , 24 month , 48 month . In addition , clinical assessment do every 4 month first 24 month . An option perform baseline study also possible . No treatment provide protocol . Reliability image processing test repeated measurement baseline scan . Reliability also assess repeat CT scan 10 participant . Construct validity test correlation CT measure score plain radiograph , lumbar magnetic resonance imaging , spinal range motion . The sensitivity change CT measure 12 month 24 month compare two score system base plain radiograph .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A. LONGITUDINAL STUDY PROTOCOL : Fiftyfive patient study . INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Age 18 year old 2 . Diagnosis AS modified New York criteria 3 . Lumbar spine BASRI score 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 We aim recruit least 6 patient follow BASRI lumbar spine category : 0 1 ( normal suspicious change ) 2 ( erosion , sclerosis square without syndesmophytes 2 few vertebra ) 3 ( syndesmophytes 3 vertebrae fusion 2 vertebra ) EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Inability provide inform consent . 2 . BASRI lumbar spine score 4 ( complete fusion ; 12 ) 3 . Contraindication MRI scan base NMR Center MRI Safety Screening Questionnaire size weight limitation scanner . 4 . History allergic reaction gadoliniumDPTA contrast use MRI 5 . Anticipated unavailability followup 2 year 6 . Pregnancy 7 . Onset AS age 16 young 8 . Spondyloarthropathy AS 9 . Severe scoliosis spinal malalignment would complicate scan interpretation B. CROSSSECTIONAL ( RELIABILITY ) STUDY PROTOCOL Up 20 patient study . INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Age 18 year old 2 . Diagnosis AS modified New York criterion ( 5 ) EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Inability provide inform consent 2 . BASRI lumbar spine score 4 ( complete fusion ) &lt; TAB &gt; 3 . Pregnancy 4 . Onset AS age 16 young 5 . Spondyloarthropathy AS 6 . Severe scoliosis spinal malalignment would complicate scan interpretation</criteria>
