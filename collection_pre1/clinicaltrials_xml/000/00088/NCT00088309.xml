	<brief_summary>This study examine long-term effect , particularly bone metabolism , drug tenofovir DF child HIV infection . Tenofovir DF approve treat HIV-infected adult , use child yet approve . The drug may helpful child treat many drug still detectable HIV blood despite ongoing therapy . In previous study , many child give tenofovir DF respond well , increase T-cell count decrease viral load . However , many child also experience bone thinning . This study explore problem bone thin child take tenofovir DF combination highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) . HIV-infected patient 4 20 year old take tenofovir DF tenofovir DF treatment recommend may eligible 3-year study . Participants take tenofovir DF every day addition antiretroviral therapy . They frequent follow-up visit test procedure follow : - Study day 0 , 2 , 4 : blood test . - Screening every study visit start day 6 : Physical exam , medical history , blood urine test . - Baseline every 48 week : Dental eye examination , kidney ultrasound , tuberculin skin testing , chest x-ray , electrocardiogram echocardiogram , compute tomography ( CT ) scan , neuropsychological test neurologic assessment . - The bone age hand x-ray do every 24 week , unless growth plate fuse ( i.e . child stop grow ) - DEXAs do 0 , 12 , 24 week every 24 week thereafter . Dual energy x-ray absorptionometry ( DEXA ) scan use ass bone density . The patient lie still table spine hip scan use small amount radiation . Only spine hip scan DEXA scan test . - Baseline week 24 : Optional bone biopsy . Some patient ask undergo bone biopsy well understand effect Tenofovir DF bone . For procedure , child give sedative . The skin hipbone numb small needle , small incision make large needle insert bone . Some bone tissue withdrawn needle incision close . - Possible lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) : This optional procedure analyze cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , fluid bathe brain spinal cord . The patient give local anesthetic needle insert space bone low back CSF circulate spinal cord . A small amount fluid collect needle . There specific schedule procedure patient opts . Patients benefit tenofovir DF therapy show sign bone effect offer treatment pamidronate ( Aredia ) , drug use treat hypercalcemia ( much calcium blood ) . Patients stop take tenofovir DF bone toxicity continue follow regular study schedule . Those stop drug toxicity bone toxicity toxicity relate tenofovir DF follow every 4 week laboratory test result improve .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) approve treatment HIV-infected adult October 2001 . In November 2001 , begin enrollment phase I/II study tenofovir DF HIV-infected child ( 02-C-0006 ) . That study complete enrollment . The virologic immunologic response see study group heavily treatment-experienced child multidrug resistant HIV surprisingly good . The drug well tolerate , significant decrease bone mineral density see minority patient . With current study enroll systematically investigate HIV-infected child tenofovir DF use part salvage combination HIV therapy . The primary objective study characterize change bone mineral density ( BMD ) , measure lumbar spine dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) , follow treatment tenofovir DF-containing antiretroviral therapy HIV-infected child . The study enroll 3 cohort child : 1 ) HIV-infected child start tenofovir DF-containing antiretroviral regimen , 2 ) HIV-infected child already tenofovir DF available baseline DEXA result , 3 ) HIV-infected child already tenofovir DF without baseline DEXA result come investigation bone metabolism . Studies bone metabolism include periodic measurement serum urine calcium phosphorus , PTH vitamin D level , bone resorption marker ( urinary collagen cross-linked N-telopeptide free deoxypyridinoline ) , bone formation marker ( serum osteocalcin bone specific alkaline phosphatase ) , IGF-1 level , bone age , DEXA scan . Patients start tenofovir DF ( cohort 1 ) offer option transiliac crest core bone biopsy tetracycline labeling perform baseline 6 month assess static dynamic parameter bone quality turnover ( histomorphometry ) . Subjects substantial presumed tenofovir DF-related bone toxicity derive benefit tenofovir DF-containing antiretroviral drug regimen offer option pamidronate therapy . The effect pamidronate treatment bone toxicity associate tenofovir DF patient assess exploratory fashion . It expect 40 patient baseline BMD measurement enrol onto protocol . An additional 10 patient undergoing tenofovir DF treatment receive baseline BMD measurement also permit enroll order contribute data use characterize change toxicity .</detailed_description>
