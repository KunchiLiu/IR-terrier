	<brief_summary>This study examine holoprosencephaly ( HPE ) affect people , change time , gene may involve cause disorder . HPE defect brain development utero forebrain fail sufficiently divide two hemisphere , result single-lobed brain skull facial malformation . In case , defect severe baby die birth . There three classification HPE . In alobar HPE brain divide ; form usually associate severe facial deformity . In semilobar HPE hemispheres divide somewhat , cause intermediate form disorder . In lobar HPE , mild form , separation hemisphere nearly normal . Patients HPE direct blood relative may participate study . Patients see team medical specialist NIH Clinical Center follow procedure : - Physical neurological examination - Eye examination - Imaging study , echocardiogram , abdominal ultrasound , brain MRI - Electroencephalogram ( EEG ) - Hearing evaluation - Blood urine sample genetic endocrine study , routine blood chemistry , urinalysis , urine electrolyte - Other consultation need - Possibly photograph , include front side view face body part may involve HPE , eye , teeth , hand , foot Parents ask question child 's prenatal , birth , newborn , past medical history , growth , behavior development , therapy medication . Because HPE genetic disorder gene change pass family , parent also ask undergo following procedure : - Completion medical family history form - Physical neurological examination - Blood urine sample ( mother ) - Specialty consultation indicate - Possibly photograph , include front side view face body part may involve HPE , eye , teeth , hand , foot - Psychosocial study . Some parent ask participate telephone interview complete questionnaire , , attitude , belief , concern family cope child 's condition . Some questionnaire may include question aspect marriage personal feeling experience . Parents meet doctor genetics nurse discuss result test answer question . Parents may ask bring child back NIH 2 year follow-up examination possible additional repeat testing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Holoprosencephaly ( HPE ) defect midline forebrain development occur soon conception . It prevalence 1 250 early embryonic development , 1 10,000 1 20,000 term . In live born infant , abnormality associate HPE divide three main category : alobar , semilobar , lobar HPE . A fourth variant , middle interhemispheric variant , also recognize . The purpose study increase understand genetic clinical manifestation HPE detail physical , psychological , developmental , neurologic , endocrinologic , radiologic study . We examine spectrum clinical characteristic HPE facilitate early diagnosis clinical management , include genetic counseling . Finally , plan assess psychosocial impact HPE family unit . Most patient family see NIH Clinical Center . A subset may examine outside NIH , subset , psychosocial study , may interview phone .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Depending willingness participate , subject may enroll DNA laboratoryonly ( 98HG0249 ) , psychosocialonly , clinicalonly . However , conserve resource meet study objective , subject know mutation give priority selection extensive clinical study . All race gender know risk HPE , anywhere world . Nationality place origin specific barrier participation . 2 . Direct blood relative ( typically parent , occasionally sibling affected individual ) patient HPE also eligible participate . 3 . Individuals fatty liver ( relate hepatic change steatohepatitis ) , without HPE , may participate submit blood sample DNA testing . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Anyone unwilling provide inform consent ( adult , behalf child minor ) assent . 2 . Medical condition ( ) mental retardation reason exclusion judgment refer physician would involve minimal risk . We anticipate child mental handicap would include research population . We make every effort explain study purpose assent manner family feel age developmentally appropriate child . 3 . We generally review brief clinical description refer physician potential research subject determine subject appropriate enter study . We reserve right exclude case clearly HPE related direct research interest ( e.g . HPE case syndromic like Smith Lemli Opitz syndrome , Trisomy 13 , Trisomy 18 , drugrelated , teratogenrelated ) . This almost never happen , would attempt make referral appropriate investigator . 4 . Similar , regards individual fatty liver ( relate hepatic change steatohepatitis fibrosis ) , review brief clinical description refer physician determine subject appropriate enter study . We reserve right exclude participant liver abnormality reason directly relate direct research interest ( chronic alcohol use infectious cause ) . However , environmental factor may contribute multifactorial etiology hepatic change , may exclude case .</criteria>
