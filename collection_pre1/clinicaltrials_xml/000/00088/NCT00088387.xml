	<brief_summary>This study examine effect drug lithium divalproex ( Depakote ) tau protein , type protein brain spinal fluid alter patient Alzheimer 's disease . Both drug approve Food Drug Administration treat mood disorder , show animal study decrease amount alter tau protein . This study determine whether lithium alone combination divalproex reduces alter tau protein spinal fluid patient Alzheimer 's disease . Patients Alzheimer 's disease 40 90 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , neurologic neuropsychological evaluation , blood urine test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , , need , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan brain . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Drug treatment : Patients take study drug 6 week . - Weekly clinic visit : Patients come clinic week physical examination , blood urine test , review drug side effect , receive next week 's supply medication . - Lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) : Patients lumbar puncture study week 2 , 4 , 6 measure various brain chemical tau proteins cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , bath brain spinal cord . For test , local anesthetic give needle inserted space bone low back CSF circulate spinal cord . A small amount fluid collect needle . - Follow-up visit : Two week complete study medication , patient return clinic final evaluation , include physical examination blood urine test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall objective study examine acute effect lithium alone and/or combination divalproex surrogate measure neuroprotective activity patient Alzheimer 's disease . It hypothesize safe tolerable dos drug inhibit glycogen synthase kinase-3 activity reduce phosphorylated tau epitope threonine-181 threonine-231 implicated pathogenesis disorder . In proof-of-principle study , efficacy reduce tau phosphorylated epitope assess cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) measurement . Safety monitor mean frequent clinical evaluation laboratory test .</detailed_description>
