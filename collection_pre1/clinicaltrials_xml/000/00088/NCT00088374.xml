	<brief_summary>This study examine whether drug 17AAG ( 17-allylamino 17-demethoxygeldanamycin ) shrink kidney tumor patient Von Hippel-Lindau disease ( VHL ) , rare , inherited syndrome patient develop tumor certain part body . 17AAG contributes destruction protein cell may play role cause cancer spur tumor growth . The study also look effect 17AAG tumor patient may cause VHL , amount blood vessel tumor , biologic activity tumor , cell circulate bloodstream , well safety drug impact kidney tumor patient whose tumor ( ) remove . Patients 18 year age old von Hippel-Lindau disease least one kidney tumor large enough pose risk metastasis ( spread cancer part body ) may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , compute tomography ( CT ) scan , brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , see ) , blood urine test . Additional test , include 24-hour urine collection , ultrasound testicle men , hear test , eye exam , MRI spine , may do recent test result available . Participants undergo follow test procedure : MRI : This test use strong magnetic field radio wave show structural chemical change tissue . During scan , patient lie table narrow cylinder contain magnetic field , wear earplug muffle loud noise occur electrical switch magnetic field . A catheter ( plastic tube ) insert patient 's arm administer contrast dye enhances image . 17AAG treatment : Patients receive 17AAG infusion vein week 3 week every 4 , 3 month . The infusion last 1 2 hour . Repeat testing : After 3 month , patient repeat MRI scan measure change tumor activity , blood flow , number blood vessel tumor since pretreatment scan . They may additional test , include CT scan , eye exam , test evaluate effect 17AAG tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Von Hippel-Lindau disease hereditary cancer syndrome affect individual risk develop tumor number organ , include brain , spine , adrenal gland , eye pancreas . The molecular hallmark VHL inactivation VHL gene lead accumulation hypoxia inducible factor ( HIF ) ; , turn result overexpression several gene include vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , glucose transporter 1 ( GLUT-1 ) , transform growth factor alpha ( TGF-Î± ) , platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) erythropoietin , play important role tumorigenesis , tumor growth metastasis . 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin ( 17AAG ) inhibitor cellular chaperone heat shock protein 90 ( Hsp90 ) , interaction Hsp90 lead destabilization degradation several protein , depend Hsp90 stability . The alpha subunit HIF1 one Hsp90 client protein ' susceptible VHL independent , 17AAG-induced degradation . Objectives : To evaluate efficacy 17 AAG administer single agent von Hippel Lindau patient renal tumor . The primary endpoint trial response renal tumor follow 3 cycle therapy . To study safety tolerability 17 AAG . To evaluate PD modulation hsp90 , explore utility dynamic contrast enhance MRI evaluation blood flow metabolic change renal tumor therapy Eligibility : Adults clinical diagnosis von Hippel Lindau disease Presence one localize renal tumor surgical resection would consider standard approach Design : Patients receive 17 AAG intravenous infusion dose 300mg/m ( 2 ) day 1 , 8 , 15 28 day cycle . The study follow two-stage MinMax phase II design accrue maximum 26 patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must satisfy follow inclusion criterion eligible study enrollment . Clinical diagnosis von Hippel Lindau disease . Presence one localize renal tumor surgical resection would consider standard approach . Age great equal 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use 17 AAG patient less 18 year age , child exclude study . Life expectancy le 3 month . Performance status Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) 02 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : white blood cell ( WBC ) count great equal 3,000/microliter , absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/microliter , platelet count great equal 100,000/microliter , Hgb great 10Gm/dl , serum creatinine less equal 1.0 upper limit normal ( ULN ) measure 24 hour creatinine clearance great 60 ml/min , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) less 1.0 time ULN , total bilirubin less equal ULN ( less 3 time normal limit ( NL ) patient Gilbert 's disease ) . Negative hepatitis B surface antigen ( HbsAg ) , human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV1 ) nonreactive hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) . No history serious intercurrent illness . At least four week completion surgical investigational therapy von Hippel Lindau disease . Willingness undergo resection renal tumor time point define protocol . All men woman childbearing potential must use effective contraception determine principal investigator protocol chair . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Prior concomitant nonvon Hippel Lindau associate malignancy exception adequately treat basal squamous cell carcinoma skin malignancy patient remain disease free five year . Any renal tumor great 4cm size . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event ( grade 1 less toxicity accord Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events version 3.0 ( CTCAE 3.0 ) due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients may receive investigational agent . Patients know metastatic renal cell cancer . Patients history serious allergy egg . Concomitant therapy cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) potent inhibitor . Patients CYP3A4 substrates inducer qualify enrollment study . Pregnant woman exclude study 17 AAG potential teratogenic abortifacient effect , data regard safety pregnant woman available . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother 17 AAG , breastfeed discontinue mother treated 17 AAG . Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive patient exclude study unknown potential pharmacokinetic interaction antiretroviral drug 17 AAG . Use medication prolong may prolong correct QT interval ( QTc ) . Patients significant cardiac disease include heart failure meet New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class III IV definition , uncontrolled dysrhythmias require antiarhythmic drug , patient active ischemic heart disease include myocardial infarction poorly control angina within 12 month study entry . Patients history serious ventricular arrhythmia ( ventricular tachycardia ( VT ) ventricular fibrillation ( VF ) , great equal 3 beat row ) , QTc great equal 450msec men 470msec woman , leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) low limit normal multi gate acquisition scan ( MUGA ) . Patients history prior chest radiation radiation potentially include heart treatment field . Patients congenital long Q wave , T wave ( QT ) syndrome . Patients leave bundle branch block .
