	<brief_summary>Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Gefitinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary growth . Combining docetaxel gefitinib may kill tumor cell . It yet know whether docetaxel effective without gefitinib treat head neck cancer . This randomized phase III trial study docetaxel gefitinib see well work compare docetaxel alone treat patient metastatic locally recurrent head neck cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase III Trial Of Docetaxel Versus Docetaxel Plus ZD1839 In Head And Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine survival poor prognosis patient recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma head neck treat docetaxel without ZD1839 ( Iressa , gefitinib ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine time progression response rate poor prognosis patient recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma head neck treat docetaxel without ZD1839 ( Iressa , gefitinib ) . II . To correlate expression activation status epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) signal pathway clinical outcome patient population . The follow specific biomarkers measure immunohistochemistry paraffin-embedded tumor tissue : EGFR , p-EGFR , AKT , p-AKT , Transforming growth factor ( TGF ) -alpha , Ki-67 , extracellular-signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) , p-ERK , p70s6 , p- p70s6 , p27 . III . To evaluate frequency common polymorphisms Cytochrome P450 3A ( CYP3A ) EGFR study population impact polymorphisms survival , time progression , response rate , toxicity . IV . To analyze docetaxel ZD1839 ( Iressa , gefitinib ) pharmacokinetics correlate polymorphism pharmacokinetic variability , response , toxicity , endpoint . V. To evaluate disease-related symptom overall quality life among patient receive docetaxel receive docetaxel ZD1839 ( Iressa , gefitinib ) . VI . To evaluate whether additional clinical benefit associate ZD1839 ( Iressa , gefitinib ) detect improvement patient-reported symptom FACT Head Neck Symptom Index ( FHNSI ) -10 GP5 . OUTLINE : This randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord treatment prior chemotherapy ( pretreated vs untreated ) , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ( 0 vs 1 v 2 ) , weight loss within past 6 month ( &lt; 5 % v â‰¥ 5 % ) , prior cetuximab treatment ( yes ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive docetaxel intravenously ( IV ) 30-60 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 oral placebo daily day 1-28 . Arm II : Patients receive docetaxel arm I oral gefitinib daily day 1-28 . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients arm I disease progression may receive single-agent oral gefitinib daily disease progression ( call step 2 study ) . Quality life assess baseline , day 15 28 course 1 , day 28 subsequent course , 2-4 week completion study treatment . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 330 patient ( 165 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 31.5 month .</detailed_description>
