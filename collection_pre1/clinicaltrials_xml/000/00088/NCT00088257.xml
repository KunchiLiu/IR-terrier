	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Since case asthma occur first year life , examine pre- early postnatal determinant crucial . This study focus determinant develop immune system . T helper cell two type . Th1 cell participate cell-mediated immunity essential control intracellular infectious agent bacterial virus . Th2 cell essential antibody-mediated immunity control extracellular infectious agent . The Th2 pattern , characterize high level IgE , increase production proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) IL-13 , decreased production interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) , predominate prenatally . If balance Thl pattern birth , e.g. , increase IFN-7 production , risk asthma likely increase . Early childhood immune mechanism associate risk asthma may also involve non-IgE/Th2 pathway , increase production IL-6 TNF-alpha . Preliminary study link asthma various age reduce ratio n-3 n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid , increase birth weight , overweight . Preliminary data also link dietary weight variable systemic production IgE Th2 non-Th2 proinflammatory cytokine . Thus allergy inflammation may pathways pre- early postnatal dietary factor influence development asthma . However , virtually prospective human data link maternal diet fetal/early childhood growth asthma-related immune response childhood . The study take advantage resource Project Viva , ongoing NIH-funded prospective cohort study pregnant woman offspring eastern Massachusetts . Project Viva already include detailed dietary data mother infant , maternal cord blood sample , data anthropometric , social , environmental , demographic , economic , psychological , lifestyle variable . Relevant covariates include , presence severity atopic diseases parent , parental smoking , infant respiratory infection , infant environment . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study examine association maternal gestational n-3 n-6 fatty acid intake , fatty acid level umbilical cord blood , fetal growth , early childhood overweight marker allergy inflammation age 3 year . These marker include allergy-specific total plasma IgE level level proinflammatory cytokine antigen- mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte . This study take advantage resource Project Viva , ongoing NIH-funded prospective cohort study pregnant woman offspring . Project Viva already include detailed dietary data mother infant , maternal cord blood sample , data anthropometric , social , environmental , demographic , economic , psychological , lifestyle variable . This study support several element otherwise fund , include add measurement immune outcomes age 3 year subset 370 cohort participant . Given exist infrastructure Project Viva , study provide relatively economical way address scientific question major public health importance .</detailed_description>
