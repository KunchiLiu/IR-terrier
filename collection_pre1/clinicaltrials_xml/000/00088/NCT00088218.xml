	<brief_title>Clofarabine v Clofarabine Plus With Low-Dose Ara-C Previously Untreated Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) High-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes ( MDS ) .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clofarabine chemotherapy drug design interfere growth development cancer cell . Ara-C chemotherapy drug approve treatment AML MDS . Although experience combination drug , trial explore particular dos schedule clofarabine plus ara-C may receive . Before start treatment study , call `` screening test '' . These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You complete medical history physical exam . You also ask medication take currently level daily activity . About 2 tablespoon blood collect routine blood test make sure increase risk develop side effect . Before first treatment ( usually within 14 day ) , may bone marrow sample collect . To collect bone marrow sample , area hip chest bone numb anesthetic small amount bone marrow withdrawn large needle . The procedure explain doctor require sign separate consent document . Early study result show clearly well response combination treatment compare clofarabine alone treatment . Because , participant study assign clofarabine plus ara-C group . You receive clofarabine vein daily 5 day row . In addition , receive injection ara-C skin day 14 day row . On day clofarabine ara-C take , clofarabine give approximately 4 hour ara-C injection . You teach give ara-C injection . Each cycle may repeat every 3 6 week . You require record injection medication diary . Up 2 cycle ( group ) give dose schedule . If show response treatment , continue 12 cycle therapy , clofarabine give 3 day instead 5 ara-C 7 day instead 14 . Maintenance course may give average every 4 7 week . Before every treatment course , physical exam include measurement weight vital sign . You also ask feel able go daily routine . At least week ( often doctor feel necessary ) , blood sample ( 1-2 teaspoon ) collect routine lab test . Around 3 week first treatment , may sample bone marrow collect . After , bone marrow collection perform every 2 week ( often doctor feel necessary ) . The bone marrow sample test evaluate response disease therapy . You need stay Houston first 4 week treatment . After , return Houston receive clofarabine treatment , check-up visit blood test local doctor . If disease get bad experience intolerable side effect , take study doctor discus treatment option . After finish treatment , long participate study schedule every 3-6 month check status disease overall health long stay study . Once take study , doctor decide often follow-up part standard care . This investigational study . Clofarabine authorize Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use research . Up 108 participant take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
