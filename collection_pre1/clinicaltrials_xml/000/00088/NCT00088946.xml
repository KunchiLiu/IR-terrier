	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Erlotinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary growth . Green tea extract ( Polyphenon® E ) contain certain ingredient may slow growth tumor cell prevent recurrence cancer . Giving erlotinib green tea extract surgery may kill remain tumor cell may prevent recurrence bladder cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study well give erlotinib together green tea extract work prevent cancer recurrence former smoker undergone surgery bladder cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib Green Tea Extract ( Polyphenon® E ) Preventing Cancer Recurrence Former Smokers Who Have Undergone Surgery Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare effect erlotinib v green tea extract ( Polyphenon® E ) v placebo 2-year recurrence rate former smoker resect superficial transitional cell carcinoma bladder . - Develop effective chemopreventative strategy ( adjunct standard care ) medical management superficial bladder cancer patient . Secondary - Determine toxic effect associate drug patient . - Determine safe effective chemopreventative dose erlotinib patient . - Correlate modulation 1 biomarkers bladder cancer recurrence and/or progression patient treat drug . - Determine risk clinical bladder cancer progression patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord disease stage ( Ta vs T1 v carcinoma situ ) participate center . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral erlotinib oral green tea extract ( Polyphenon® E ) placebo daily . - Arm II : Patients receive oral green tea extract ( Polyphenon® E ) oral erlotinib placebo daily . - Arm III : Patients receive oral erlotinib placebo oral green tea extract placebo daily . In arm , treatment continue 12 month absence disease recurrence unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 330 patient ( 110 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 3 year .</detailed_description>
