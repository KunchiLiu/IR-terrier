	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel capecitabine , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Monoclonal antibody bevacizumab locate tumor cell either kill deliver tumor-killing substance without harm normal cell . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell stop blood flow tumor . Combining chemotherapy monoclonal antibody therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give docetaxel capecitabine together bevacizumab work treat patient metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine response rate patient metastatic breast cancer treat docetaxel , capecitabine , bevacizumab first-line chemotherapy . Secondary - Determine time disease progression patient treat regimen . - Determine survival patient treat regimen . - Determine toxicity profile regimen patient . - Determine duration response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive docetaxel IV 1 hour bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Patients also receive oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-14 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive least 2 additional course beyond CR . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year , annually 3 year .</detailed_description>
