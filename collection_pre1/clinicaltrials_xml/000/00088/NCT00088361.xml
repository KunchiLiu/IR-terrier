	<brief_summary>This study determine breathe motion may affect positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan . It discover quality PET scan varies accord part breathe cycle patient hold breath . NIH Clinical Center patient 12 year age old schedule PET compute tomography ( CT ) scan part standard medical care may eligible study . Participants schedule PET CT scan normally would ask hold breath breathing , usual . In addition , study , patient also ask hold breath breathe point breathing . Each breath-hold around 15 second . The scan three different breath-holds examine difference . Some patient may also ask breathe tube call pneumotachometer , spirometer , determine normal breathe pattern . This involve breathe mouthpiece similar snorkel mouthpiece take 2 minute .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Current clinical FDG image NIH 's PET/CT machine ( fact commercial PET/CT machine ) require CT scan acquire prior PET scan . This CT scan use attenuation correction PET data permit fusion anatomical metabolic image data . One difficulty use CT scan attenuation correction ( 'CTAC ' ) CT scan rapid compare breathing cycle . Each CT slice capture lungs one ( usually arbitrary ) phase respiratory cycle . The PET data hand take many minute acquire , average motion effect entire respiratory cycle together . This 'freezing ' respiratory cycle CT , blur respiratory cycle PET produce mis-match PET CT data . This mis-match produce improper attenuation correction PET reconstruction , especially soft tissue/lung interface . The existence phenomenon report literature [ 1-7 ] , especially dome liver , thoroughly quantify . Little data available indicate quantitative error effect produce cardiac image [ 8 ] . This despite fact myocardium 10mm thick , report heart move average 9mm ( much 14mm ) single average respiratory cycle [ 9 ] . The purpose protocol determine degree respiratory motion may influence quantitative PET imaging , especially lung/liver interface free wall myocardium . By characterize magnitude effect , hope gain knowledge correction effect necessary . It hop information gain also allow u suggest potential method perform correction . To gain information modify CT acquisition protocol subject already schedule undergo whole body FDG PET/CT scan . In summary , rather acquire usual single full radiation exposure CT ( take approx 20-30 second ) , acquire 3 CT scan ( take approximately 20-30 second ) , 1/3 usual radiation exposure . Each CT acquire different phase respiratory cycle ( opposed current acquisition , end-expiration ) . The subsequent PET data acquire usual , processed analyze separately CT scan also sum CT scan . Note subject agree participate protocol receive additional radiation exposure . Participation protocol extend current overall scan time ( typically great 45 minute ) small amount ( 40-60 additional second image , 60 additional second patient set , etc ) .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Up 30 subject take part study , choose sequential incoming clinical patient schedule PET/CT study torso diagnostic CT within one week PET/CT study , without regard disease . The number subject select study per week depend patient load availability scanner technologist ) . Approximately equal number male female select alternate selection male female . The selection subject ask participate random , sense whenever technologist analysis time available , next subject schedule whole body scan ask participate . EXCLUSION CRITERIA The exclusion criterion subject respiratory difficulty . Children age 12 .</criteria>
