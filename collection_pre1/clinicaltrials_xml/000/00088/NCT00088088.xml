	<criteria>Histologically and/or cytologically prove NSCLC ( mixed form small cell lung cancer exclude ) clinically stage IIIB stage IV disease . No prior systemic chemotherapy treatment . Prior treatment radiotherapy local ablative therapy allow therapy affect measurable target lesion use purpose protocol . Completion radiotherapy must great equal 4 week prior study entry , and/or resolution acute toxic effect prior radiotherapy major surgical procedure National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Toxicity Criteria ( CTC ) grade less equal 1 . Evidence unidimensionally measurable disease ( ie , great equal 1 malignant tumor mass may accurately measure least 1 dimension great equal 20 mm conventional radiographic technique magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] , great equal 10 mm spiral computerize tomography [ CT ] scan ) . Tumor evaluation positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan ultrasound may substitute CT MRI scan . Bone lesion , ascites , peritoneal carcinomatosis miliary lesion , pleural pericardial effusion , lymphangitis skin lung , cystic lesion , irradiated lesion , disease document indirect evidence ( eg , laboratory test alkaline phosphatase ) consider measurable . Female male , 18 year age old . ECOG performance status 0 1 . Neuropathy Grade 0 Grade 1 . Adequate organ function define follow criterion : Serum aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ; serum glutamateoxalate transferase [ SGOT ] ) serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ; serum glutamatepyruvate transferase ) [ SGPT ] less equal 2.5 x central laboratory upper limit normal ( ULN ) . If liver function abnormality due underlying malignancy , AST ALT may less equal 5 x ULN . Total serum bilirubin less equal 1.5 x ULN Prothrombin time ( PT ) partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) less equal 1.5x ULN Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great equal 1500/mL Platelets great equal 100,000/mL Hemoglobin great equal 9.0 g/dL Serum creatinine less equal 1.5 x ULN The effect STA4783 develop human fetus unknown , however , taxanes platinum analogue know teratogenic . Therefore , woman childbearing potential ( define , unless surgically sterile , woman &lt; =50 year age history amenorrhea &lt; 12 month prior study entry ) must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should female patient become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , must agree inform treat physician immediately , follow delivery . Signed date informed consent document indicate patient ( legally acceptable representative ) inform pertinent aspect trial prior enrollment . Willingness ability comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test , study procedure . Patients large untreated pleural effusion , immediate lifethreatening complication disease , may need urgent radiotherapy ( e.g. , due lobar obstruction , painful bony site , cord compression , superior vena cava syndrome ) . Current participation another clinical drug trial ; may receive investigational drug agent immunomodulatory presume antitumor effect within 4 week study entry . Known brain metastasis , leptomeningeal disease screen CT MRI scan , except treat disease consider clinically radiologically stable , require treatment anticonvulsant and/or steroid . Prior malignancy NSCLC within last 5 year exception : Adequately treat situ carcinoma cervix uterus ; Basal squamous cell carcinoma skin ; Previous nonpulmonary malignancy confine surgically resect evidence active malignancy . Has know allergy Cremophor® Cremophor®based drug product . Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) relate illness . Pregnancy breast feeding . Other medication , severe acute/chronic medical psychiatric condition , laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration , may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator would make patient inappropriate entry study .</criteria>
