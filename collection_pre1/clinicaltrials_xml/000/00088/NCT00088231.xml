	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high safe dos PTK 787 ( vatalanib ) Gleevec ( imatinib mesylate ) give treat Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia-Blastic Phase ( CML-BP ) , Refractory Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ( AML ) , Agnogenic Myeloid Metaplasia ( AMM ) . Another goal see effective combination treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PTK 787 Gleevec Patients With AML , AMM , CML-BP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : The purpose study combine PTK-787 , potent orally vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) receptor inhibitor ( disorder VEGF know involved pathophysiology ) , Imatinib mesylate ( IM ) , protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor abl , Bcr-Abl , platelet derive growth factor ( PDGF ) , c-Kit ( disorder kinases believe important ) . The potential synergy oral agent inhibit kinases disorder two agent , inadequate , single agent activity study protocol . We also opportunity assess correlation response individual kinase mutation e.g. , c-Kit patient AML . If improve outcome observe , study indicate investigate , either , agent predominantly responsible benefit - study facilitate availability potent e.g. , ( AMN107 abl inhibitor ) , ( Bevacizumab , AG013736 VEGF inhibitor ) agent help define relative importance various inhibitory activity . Objectives : To determine maximum tolerated dos ( MTD ) pharmacokinetics ( PK ) PTK 787 imatinib mesylate , give combination patient refractory acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) , agnogenic myeloid metaplasia ( AMM ) chronic myelogenous leukemia blastic phase ( CML-BP ) . To determine efficacy ( response rate , survival , time progression , time treatment failure , duration response ) MTD study population .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients relapse refractory AML ( include refractory anemia excess blast [ RAEB ] , refractory anemia excess blast transition AML [ RAEBT ] , untreated AML standard chemotherapy consider appropriate refuse , CML blastic phase , agnogenic myeloid metaplasia ( AMM ) Age 15 year great ( separate pediatric study conduct result adult study consider sufficiently positive ) Laboratory value less equal 2 week prior study entry Serum bilirubin 1.5mg/dL , unless consider due organ leukemic involvement Gilbert 's syndrome . SGOT SGPT less equal 2.5 x upper limit normal . Serum creatinine less equal 2mg/dL , Negative proteinuria base dip stick reading OR , documentation +1 result protein dip stick reading , total urinary protein less equal 500 mg measure creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) great equal 50 mL/min 24hour urine collection . The effect PTK 787 imatinib develop human fetus unknown . For reason inhibitor mRNA translation know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) duration study participation . Due possible interaction study drug , oral contraceptive use . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . If partner male patient take PTK 787 and/or Gleevec conceive , physician notify Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Performance Status le equal 2 . Patients cytotoxic chemotherapy , except hydroxyurea , radiotherapy within 7 day prior enter study . Patients cleared toxicity prior therapy start study combination . Patients receive investigational drug less equal 2 week prior study entry Prior therapy antiVEGF agent . Concomitant administration anticancer drug permit , except hydroxyurea . Leukopheresis allow within first 28 day treatment require control elevate blast level platelet count . Within first 28 day treatment , hydroxyurea may give maximum dose 5 g daily total 7 day . For leukopheresis , maximum 2 procedure per week 4 procedure first 28 day allow . Patients may receive cytotoxic investigational agent . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition PTK 787 imatinib . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , uncontrolled diabetes , interstitial pneumonia extensive symptomatic interstitial fibrosis lung , chronic liver disease psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing uncontrolled infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , uncontrolled high blood pressure , history labile hypertension , history poor compliance antihypertensive regimen , myocardial infarction less equal 6 month prior registration , uncontrolled diabetes , interstitial pneumonia extensive symptomatic interstitial fibrosis lung , chronic liver disease psychiatric illness/social situation limit compliance study requirement . Pleural effusion ascites cause respiratory compromise ( great equal Common Toxicity Criteria ( CTC ) grade 2 dyspnea ) . Impairment gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption PTK787 ( i.e. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome , bowel obstruction , inability swallow tablet ) . Patients confirm diagnosis human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection exclude A separate study patient HIV perform indicate . Pregnant woman exclude study PTK 787 imatinib may potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother PTK 787 imatinib , breastfeed patient eligible . Patients known central nervous system ( CNS ) disease exclude . Patients history another primary malignancy less equal 5 year , exception inactive basal squamous cell carcinoma skin . Patients w/ recent major surgery exclude ( less 4 wks start study ) minor surgery less equal 2 week prior randomization . Insertion vascular access device consider major minor surgery regard . Patients must recover surgeryrelated toxicity . Patients take warfarin sodium ( Coumadin ) similar oral anticoagulant metabolize cytochrome P450 system . Heparin allow .</criteria>
