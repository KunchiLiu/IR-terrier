	<brief_summary>Capsaicin Control Pain Following Third Molar Extraction Summary : This study test effectiveness drug capsaicin control pain third molar ( wisdom tooth ) extraction . Capsaicin , ingredient chili pepper make `` hot , '' belong class drug call vanilloids , find temporarily inactivate pain-sensing nerve . If capsaicin alleviates pain dental surgery , may potential use many type surgery painful illness . Healthy normal volunteer 16 40 year age require third molar ( wisdom tooth ) extraction may eligible study . Participants undergo follow procedure three visit : Visit 1 Patients touch ( sensory ) test inside mouth use three method : 1 ) apply temperature probe onto gums patient rate warm ; 2 ) apply gentle stroke across gum bristle small paint brush patient say whether feel painful ; 3 ) apply light touch gum small needle patient rate pain intensity follow touch . Following touch testing , patient 's mouth numb anesthetic small piece gum tissue next low wisdom tooth remove ( biopsied ) . Then , small amount either capsaicin placebo ( saline , salt water ) inject next wisdom tooth . Visit 2 Following repeat touch testing , patient sedate injection midazolam . They another biopsy local anesthesia side mouth first biopsy . Their mouth numb anesthetic , give either pain-relieving medicine call Toradol placebo inject arm . One low wisdom tooth extract . After extraction , pain rating record every 20 minute 6 hour . During time , patient monitor vital sign , numbness , pain , side effect . Patients request pain-relief medication give acetaminophen codeine . At end study , discharge clinic give acetaminophen codeine take home , instruct . They provide pain diary record pain rating adverse reaction might occur last visit . Visit 3 Patients return follow-up evaluation 48 hour discharge clinic . At end evaluation , discharge home flurbiprofen pain relief . Remaining wisdom teeth remove `` off-study '' sooner 1 week follow first visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Successful preemptive analgesic strategy superior traditional pain management schemes management post-operative pain . The premise double-blind , placebo positive-controlled clinical study evaluate efficacy vanilloid agonist preemptive agent oral surgery tissue injury model . Vanilloids class small organic compound ; familiar capsaicin , active ingredient hot pepper . Binding capsaicin vanilloid-1 receptor produce initial activation long-acting desensitization pain specific neuron . We propose produce selective , long-term inactivation peripheral pain transmission local application capsaicin oral mucosa effort prevent reduce post-operative pain oral surgery model . Healthy subject recruit , follow local anesthesia conscious sedation , give intramucosal injection either capsaicin placebo , positive control , intravenous ketorolac . Subjects rate pain time analgesic rescue medication request note . Small biopsy remove extraction site prior drug injection 48 hr post-operatively . Tissue level neurogenic inflammatory mediator sensory neuron content compare pre- post-operatively . A decrease post-operative pain decrease analgesic use take positive effect vanilloid decrease post-operative pain . We anticipate long term blockade pain specific fiber pre-operatively significant attenuation post-operative pain development follow surgery . This significant implication reduce pain suffering , decrease analgesic use , reduce post-operative complication follow surgery .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Male female volunteer refer mandibular third molar extraction minimal difficulty rating score 2 3 time screening ; rating verify oral surgeon time surgery . ( Rating scale : 1 = erupt ; 2 = soft tissue impaction ; 3 = partial bony impaction ; 4 = full bony impaction ) . Age 1640 . ASA status 1 2 , deem good general health ( able tolerate outpatient conscious sedation safely ) . Willing wait 4 hour postoperative observation . Willing return 48 hour second tissue biopsy . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : ASA status 35 Emergency operation ( E ) get physician clearance ; i.e . systemic disturbance limit patient 's activity . Pregnant breastfeeding mother .
