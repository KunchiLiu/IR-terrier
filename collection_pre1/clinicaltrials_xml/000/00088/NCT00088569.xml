	<brief_summary>This study test new electrical technique call direct current ( DC ) polarization able change brain activity subtle way short time . A recent study show , depend direction , current could make people perform little good perhaps slightly bad test function brain 's frontal lobe . This study use positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan examine DC polarization affect brain activity . Healthy volunteer 20 70 year age right hand take medication affect brain may eligible study . Candidates screen brief medical history neurological evaluation . Participants PET scan three different day least 3 day apart . Each scan session take 2-1/2 3 hour . For scan , radioactive water inject body vein . Subjects lie bed slide doughnut-shaped scanner , head hold back pad holder front custom-molded plastic mask hole eye , nose , mouth . DC electrode make wet sponge place right side head leave eye hold place elastic bandage . Three kind DC polarization test . In two test current , opposite direction . The third sham ( placebo ) condition current deliver . Each three scan separate least 3 day . On day , series scan do single session . Before injection tracer , DC current turn . This may cause tingle slight burn skin electrode , disappears current turn . In session , subject receive 16 injection tracer 8 minute apart , DC polarization turn 4 8 minute . During 8-minute period , subject show pattern dot every 2 second . Sometimes subject look pattern , sometimes subject asked push button correspond pattern saw current one . Sometimes ask push button correspond pattern come one , three pattern current one . The task last 2 minute time , time relax .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The passage weak DC current across head ( DC polarization ) safe painless mean alter activity cortical neuron response exogenous stimulation . This demonstrated human motor cortex local anodal polarization increase , cathodal decrease , motor evoke potential TMS . Recent experiment lab suggest polarization may analogous effect prefrontal cortex , anodal current enhances function include verbal fluency psychomotor speed cathodal current produce slight performance decrement . We interested potential DC current enhance function patient frontal lobe disorder reduce frontal overactivation condition drug craving . Treatments alter frontal activity may also mood alter property . In order establish principle DC polarization able alter frontal lobe activity propose combine DC polarization variably load frontal activation task measure regional cerebral blood flow ( rCBF H ( 2 ) ( 15 ) O positron emission tomography ( PET ) scanning . Study population : Twenty healthy individual study . Design : On three different day , participant receive right dorsolateral prefrontal anodal , cathodal , sham treatment . On day , rCBF measure rest without treatment . Then subject perform N-back task ( test work memory ) treatment work memory load ( N ) vary 0 3 item scan scan . Outcome measure : Resting rCBF relationship cognitive load rCBF treatment site compare treatment order look effect task-related activation performance .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Participants righthanded volunteer , age 20 70 , without history disorder central nervous system .
