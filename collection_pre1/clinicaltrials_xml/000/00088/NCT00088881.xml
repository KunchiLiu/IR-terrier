	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give rituximab together combination chemotherapy 90-Yttrium ibritumomab tiuxetan work treat patient stage I stage II lymphoma . Drugs use chemotherapy , prednisone , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , work different way stop cancer cell divide stop grow die . Monoclonal antibody rituximab yttrium 90-Yttrium ibritumomab tiuxetan locate cancer cell either kill deliver radioactive cancer-killing substance without harm normal cell . Combining monoclonal antibody combination chemotherapy radiolabeled monoclonal antibody may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate complete response rate ( CR ) functional CR rate patient previously untreated stage I ( least 1 risk factor ) stage II CD20+ diffuse large cell lymphoma receive therapy R-CHOP follow 90-Yttrium -Zevalin™ . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate time treatment failure , duration response , overall survival patient receive therapy R-CHOP follow 90-Yttrium -Zevalin™ . II . To evaluate toxicity therapy . III . To evaluate toxicity add involved field radiation therapy &gt; 12 week Zevalin™ patient CT+/PET+ residual mass . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate PET scan pre -and post - R-CHOP/Zevalin™ therapy . OUTLINE : R-CHOP ( rituximab , prednisone , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine ) : Patients receive oral prednisone daily day 1-5 . Patients also receive rituximab IV several hour follow cyclophosphamide IV , doxorubicin IV , vincristine IV 30-60 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) 2 course receive 2 additional course . Patients achieve partial response , uncertain CR , stable disease receive 4 additional course . Patients evaluate 3 week last course therapy . Patients progressive disease go study . Radioimmunotherapy : Beginning 9 week reevaluation ( 12 week last dose R-CHOP ) , patient receive rituximab IV day 1 follow indium In 111 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV 10 minute image study . Patients receive rituximab IV follow yttrium 90-Yttrium ibritumomab tiuxetan IV 10 minute day 8 . Radiotherapy : Patients residual disease CT scan positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan 12 week radioimmunotherapy undergo conventional involved-field radiotherapy . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually 5 year .</detailed_description>
