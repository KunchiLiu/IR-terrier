	<brief_summary>This study identify abnormality protein call alpha synuclein find brain patient Parkinson 's disease related disorder see serve disease marker . There currently treatment cure delay progression Parkinson 's disease . Thus , need find disease marker help diagnosis disease , follow progression , monitor effect treatment . This study examine compare alpha synuclein blood cerebrospinal fluid ( fluid bathe brain spinal cord ) patient Parkinson 's disease , patient variant disease , healthy normal volunteer determine difference protein might serve disease marker . Patients neurodegenerative disorder Parkinson 's disease Parkinson plus disorder ( diseases variant Parkinson 's disease ) healthy volunteer 18 80 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , neurological evaluation , blood test . A brain MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) scan do needed diagnosis . All participant blood sample drawn lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) . For lumbar puncture , local anesthetic give needle inserted space bone low back cerebrospinal fluid circulate spinal cord . A small amount fluid collect needle . The fluid analyze specific protein chemical leak brain various disease state measure blood . Participation healthy volunteer complete blood draw lumbar puncture . Patients Parkinson 's related disease return clinic year 2 year repeat blood draw lumbar puncture follow change alpha synuclein protein monitor disease progression . Patients specific protein interest may also ask come repeat lumbar puncture 6 month first procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) progressive neurodegenerative disorder unknown etiology several underlying pathophysiological mechanism include proteasomal degradation , mitochondrial dysfunction , inflammation , oxidative stress , excitotoxicity may contribute cell death . No treatment know cure delay progression PD , thus need investigate measurable biologic marker purpose diagnosis , monitor disease progression effect treatment . This study focus alpha synuclein metabolic pathway potential biomarker , assist evaluation pathogenesis future diagnostic therapeutic option . STUDY POPULATION : In pilot study plan include 30 patient Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) , 30 patient Parkinson plus disorder , 30 control patient without neurologic disease autoimmune disorder . DESIGN : Samples serum , plasma cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) collect patient analysis begin study . The assay perform various protein include cytokine primarily relate alpha synuclein ( AS ) pathway . A repeat CSF , plasma serum analysis perform patient PD , Parkinson plus disorder end one two year follow change protein expression profile disease progression . ASSESSMENT OF RISKS AND BENEFITS : This study carry risk associate venepuncture lumbar puncture . OUTCOME ESTIMATE AND POTENTIAL MEANING FOR THE FIELD : The primary outcome measure correlate change alpha synuclein phosphorylation CSF , plasma serum change UPDRS motor score patient PD period 2 year , compare control . The secondary aim study compare protein expression profile different synucleinopathies include PD , Multiple System Atrophy ( MSA ) Dementia Lewy Bodies ( DLB ) time . There currently validate surrogate disease marker PD relate neurodegenerative disorder . Our work would hopefully help understand pathophysiologic mechanism patient PD , monitor disease progression use specific biologic marker , future development target therapy .</detailed_description>
