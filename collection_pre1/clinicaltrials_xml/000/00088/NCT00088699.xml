	<brief_summary>This study examine whether Ketamine cause rapid-next day antidepressant effect patient Major Depression/Bipolar Disorder . Purpose : This study test whether single dose ketamine - drug block brain receptor call NMDA - cause rapid ( next day ) antidepressant effect patient major depression . Several medication effective treat depression ; however , take week month achieve full effect . A rapidly acting antidepressant would significant impact treatment depression . In previous study , ketamine produce rapid antidepressant effect within hour , effect last less 1 week . Understanding ketamine work may lead good understanding cause depression design longer last rapidly act antidepressant.Patients 18 65 year age currently experience episode major depression least 4 week duration respond two treatment trial may eligible study . Candidates screen medical psychiatric history , physical examination , blood urine tests.Participants undergo follow test procedure : Medication tapering : Patients take medication depression taper drug 1- 2-week period . Ketamine/placebo trial : Patients give single dose either ketamine placebo ( inactive substance ) , administer intravenously ( vein ) 40 minute . After 7 day , patient give another dose study drug crossover fashion ; , previously take ketamine switch receive placebo , take placebo switched ketamine . Oximetry ( measurement blood oxygen ) , pulse , blood pressure measure continuously 1 hour 4 hour ketamine placebo dose monitor safety . Interviews rating scale : Patients complete series psychiatric rating scale assess effect study drug mood thinking . The rating scale repeat 18 time study , time take 15 20 minute . Physical examination laboratory test : Patients physical examination , blood test , weight measure , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) begin end study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Bipolar affective disorder ( manic-depressive illness ) unipolar depression common , severe , chronic often life-threatening illness . Impairment physical social function result depression severe chronic medical illness . Recent preclinical clinical study suggest glutamatergic system involve mechanism action antidepressant . In two separate trial , test riluzole ( inhibitor glutamate release ) find antidepressant property patient unipolar bipolar depression ( Zarate et al . 2004 , 2005 ) . In another study , find non-competitive NMDA antagonist ( ketamine ) effective treatment-resistant major depression . Ketamine result rapid , robust relatively sustained antidepressant effect . Response ketamine occur within 2 hour last approximately 1 week ( Zarate et al 2006 ) . The current protocol consist 6 study design address 6 major question . Two study ( 1 5 ) meet enrollment quota sufficient analyzable data obtain . Study 1 ( Rapid improvement research unipolar depression ) Does NMDA antagonist ketamine produce rapid antidepressant effect patient treatment-resistant major depression ? Patients , age 18 65 year treatment-resistant major ( unipolar ) depression double-blind crossover study receive either intravenous ketamine saline solution ( Study complete ) . Study 2 ( Rapid improvement research bipolar depression ) Does NMDA antagonist ketamine produce rapid antidepressant effect patient treatment-resistant bipolar depression ? Patients , age 18 65 year treatment-resistant bipolar depression double-blind crossover study receive either intravenous ketamine saline solution add mood stabilizer ( lithium valproate ) . Study 3 ( Rapid sustain improvement research unipolar depression ) Does riluzole ( inhibitor glutamate release ) prevent relapse patient treatment-resistant major depression rapidly respond single intravenous dose ketamine ? Patients , age 18 65 year , treatment-resistant major ( unipolar ) depression rapidly respond single intravenous dose ketamine double-blind study receive either riluzole placebo determine rapid response obtain sustain . Substudy 4 ( Predictors neural correlate antidepressant response ketamine ) What predictors neural correlate antidepressant response ketamine ? Patients , age 18 65 year treatment-resistant MDD BD , double-blind crossover study , receive either intravenous ketamine saline solution multimodal MRI , MEG polysomnography . Our primary hypothesis study : 1 ) rapid response ( next day ) achieve patient treatment-resistant major ( unipolar ) depression , 2 ) rapid response ( next day ) achieve patient treatment-resistant bipolar depression , 3 ) rapid response ( next day ) sustain patient treatment-resistant unipolar depression , 4 ) predictor neural correlate antidepressant response ketamine identify . Substudy 5 ( Neurophysiological Mechanisms Rapid Antidepressant Response Ketamine ) Will activity glutamatergic circuit within brain change follow onset ketamine-induced antidepressant effect help predict response ketamine ? Drug-free bipolar unipolar patient participate Substudies 2 3 undergo PET scan 2-hours follow drug infusion ( consistent timing onset antidepressant effect ) . ( Study complete ) Substudy 6 ( Role Glutamatergic GABAergic system treatment response ketamine/riluzole ) Will subject treatment-resistant major depression receive ketamine follow riluzole show great increase concentration GABA , glutamate , glutamine NAA compare subject randomize placebo ? Unipolar patient participate Substudy 3 1H-MRS scan immediately infusion ( ketamine , placebo ) end experimental phase .</detailed_description>
