	<brief_summary>This study involve use drug call Thymoglobulin , approve USA treat kidney transplant rejection Canada treat prevent kidney transplant rejection . Thymoglobulin approve treatment prophylaxis graft versus host disease bone marrow transplantation . This study evaluate two ( 2 ) dos Thymoglobulin safety effectiveness use `` myeloablative '' condition regimen prior receive stem cell transplant ( also call bone marrow transplantation ) match , related donor . A myeloablative regimen typically compose chemotherapy radiation destroy subject 's exist bone marrow . Subjects meet inclusion exclusion criterion relative matching ( genetically similar ) stem cell also willing donate ( i.e . matched-related-donor ) eligible participate study . Following myeloablative therapy , donor 's cell transplant ( i.e . infuse ) subject 's blood stream . One common complication type transplant graft-versus-host disease ( GvHD ) . This condition transplant donor cell attack transplant recipient 's body . Treatments , cyclosporine , use minimize risk GvHD follow stem cell transplantation . To enter study , subject must matched-related donor stem cell transplant . If subject qualifies entry study , he/she assign receive Thymoglobulin dose 4.5 mg/kg 8.5 mg/kg . The treatment assignment random choose subject physician . Subjects admit hospital transplant procedure treat Thymoglobulin 3-5 day prior receive donor stem cell . The subject also receive standard GvHD prophylaxis cyclosporine . Methotrexate , commonly use transplant center minimize risk GvHD , use study . Subjects monitor treatment Thymoglobulin transplant hospitalization . Additional subject monitoring occur month 1 , 100 day 6 month follow transplant . Approximately 60 study subject approximately 14 transplant center United States Canada enrol .</brief_summary>
