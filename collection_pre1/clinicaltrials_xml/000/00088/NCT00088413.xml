	<brief_summary>Background : - Many cancer produce two protein , carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) mucin-1 ( MUC-1 ) . - The PANVAC-V priming vaccine PANVAC-F boosting vaccine contain human gene cause production CEA MUC-1 , use target immune system attack cancer . The vaccine also contain gene cause production protein enhance immune activity . - Sargramostim protein boost immune system . Objectives : - To evaluate safety effectiveness PANVAC-V PANVAC-F patient advanced cancer . - To document immune response vaccine anti-tumor response may occur . Eligibility : Patients 18 year age old advanced cancer whose tumor produce CEA MUC-1 protein Design : - This trial four arm : first arm include 10 patient advanced colorectal cancer ; second arm include 10 15 patient advanced non-colorectal cancer produce either EA MCU-1 ; third arm include 12 patient advanced breast cancer ; fourth arm include 12 patient advanced ovarian cancer . - All patient receive PANVAC-V study day 1 , follow PANVAC-F day 15 , 29 43 . The vaccine give injection skin . Sargramostim inject vaccination site day vaccination next 3 day follow vaccination . - Patients whose disease worsen last boosting vaccination may receive 12 additional monthly boosting vaccination . Following 12 vaccination , patient may receive vaccine every 3 month . Patients whose scan show disease progress , otherwise clinically stable may revert back monthly injection . - Patients undergo apheresis collect white blood cell ( lymphocyte ) day 1 day 71 study measure immune response treatment . Blood collect needle place one arm direct cell separator machine lymphocytes extract . The rest blood component return patient needle . - Patients monitor frequent blood test periodic image test ( scan ) monitor safety response treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - CEA MUC-1 overexpressed multiple adenocarcinoma . - Pox viral vector induce strong immune response CEA MUC-1 . - The use agonist epitope within TAA induce good immune response native peptide associate clinical response - Heterologous prime boost regimen superior term generalize immune response ; may translate improved clinical response - The use GM-CSF add significant toxicity pre-clinical model essential induction optimal immune response . - It possible use vector direct TAA may additive synergistic immune response may important overcome antigenic escape variance - Evidence clinical benefit note patient treated vaccine Objectives : - For first two arm ( colorectal cancer non-colorectal cancer ) : 1 To evaluate safety tolerability vaccine . 2 To document objective anti-tumor response may occur - For Ovarian Cancer Breast Cancer arm : 1 To evaluate clinical response vaccine . 2 To evaluate safety tolerability vaccine - 2 ( arm ) To evaluate immune response generate combination therapy measure ELISPOT assay Eligibility : - In first two arm ( colorectal non-colorectal cancer ) , histologically confirm adenocarcinoma CEA MUC-1 positive describe metastatic disease ( measurable evaluable ) metastatic disease document biopsy evaluable imaging ( e.g . small volume peritoneal disease ) - For ovarian breast cancer arm , patient must evaluable disease - Normal organ function , ECOG 0-1 Design : - This non-randomized four arm , pilot trial pox viral vaccine contain transgene CEA MUC-1 ( modify HLA-A2 agonist epitope ) well 3 human T-cell costimulatory molecule , B7-1 , ICAM-1 , LFA-3 [ PANVAC ( TM ) -V ( vaccinia ) PANVAC ( TM ) -F ( fowlpox ) ] patient metastatic carcinoma express CEA MUC-1 antigen . - The first arm enroll 10 patient metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma . - The second arm consist 10-15 patient metastatic non-colorectal carcinoma express either CEA MUC-1 . - The third arm consist 12 patient metastatic breast carcinoma . The fourth arm consist 12 patient metastatic ovarian carcinoma . - All patient receive PANVAC ( TM ) -V ( vaccinia ) subcutaneously ( s.c. ) schedule day 1 , follow PANVAC ( TM ) -F ( fowlpox ) s.c. schedule day 15 , 29 , 43 ( Core Phase ) . - Sargramostim ( 100 micro g ) give site vaccination vaccination day three consecutive day thereafter . - Up 12 additional monthly boosting vaccination ( Extension Phase ) offer patient complete Core Phase study experience disease progression . - Following 12 monthly vaccination , patient without disease progression allow receive vaccine every 3 month . - Patients radiographic evidence progressive disease , otherwise clinically stable may revert back monthly vaccination .</detailed_description>
