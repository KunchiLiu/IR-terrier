	<brief_summary>This study explore development visual perception brain activity underlies . It examine electrical activity brain people process characteristic visual environment , processing might change development . Infants within 2 week either side 4-month birthday may eligible study . A parent child also participate . Parents join study ask basic question family , size ethnic make-up , infant 's birth date , complication pregnancy delivery , health problem infant , congenital developmental disorder visual abnormality . Each family see clinic one time 45-minute visit . The infant outfit elastic net contain many small sensor make contact scalp . He show picture computer screen . The sensor head net connect computer record infant 's brain activity infant watch picture screen . The head net moisten warm water apply , uncomfortable wear . Towels available throughout session dry excess moisture net .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The major objective research well understand response brain significant stimulation early later development . The proposed work design examine infant ' , child 's , adult ' ( especially mother ' ) response salient feature external environment . To , present research study biological base behavioral significance natural preference information processing . The primary research strategy use consist analyze behavioral brain response visual pattern . In laboratory procedure , subject explore pattern brain electrical activity measure simultaneously electronic analysis system . In specific , five experiment visual attention human infant , 1 experiment adult propose . In first experiment infant , baby hypothesize look longer saturated color ; second experiment , baby hypothesize look longer grating align along vertical horizontal orthogonals along oblique . Because saturated color orthogonal stimulation elicit great activity visual system neuron great amplitude evoke potential desaturated color oblique stimulation , respectively , two experiment explore hypothesis simple visual stimulus infant preferably attend particularly appropriate stimulate geniculostriate primary visual system . In third experiment , plan trace ontogeny mature brain response whole pattern oppose part pattern . In fourth experiment , intend compare region-specific activity surface feature familiarize visual target change location change . In fifth experiment , examine individual difference power metric associated attention visual stimuli relation individual difference correspond behavior cod observer . In experiment child adult explore brain response localization picture familiar unfamiliar face .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Participants select inclusion study follow basis age , gestational status ( i.e. , fullterm vs. preterm birth ) , visual normality , general health status . Once recruitment letter mail , brief screen interview conduct parent call express interest participating . These parent ask infant birth date , expect due date , diagnose severe perinatal complication , visual abnormality , congenital developmental disorder . Infants gestational age le 36 week , and/or history severe perinatal complication , visual abnormality , family history colorvision deficiency recruit participation . Equal number male female recruit participate .</criteria>
