	<brief_title>Evaluation Substance P Neurotransmission Panic Disorder PET Imaging NK1 Receptors With 18FSPA-RQ</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The involvement Substance P ( SP ) depression anxiety credibly demonstrate recent clinical trial . Although precise physiological activation mechanism SP system yet know , likelihood exaggerate SP pathway activity pathogenesis anxiety support numerous animal study illustrate anxiogenic , anxiolytic effect SP SP antagonist ( SPAs ) , respectively . Studies show SP release occur response noxious , aversive stimulation . SP stimulate NK1 receptor undergo endocytosis ( i.e. , internalization ) result decrease number NK1 receptor cell surface . NK1 receptor quantification , aversive event , provide dynamic measurement SP neurotransmission . In protocol , use new PET ligand demonstrate ability serve NK1 receptor antagonist , [ 18F ] SPA-RQ ( [ 18F ] -labeled Substance P Antagonist Receptor Quantifier ) . Using tracer , : 1 . ) quantify NK1 bind parameter determine reliability reproducibility measure 10 healthy control , 2 . ) look regional difference NK1 receptor bind 10 patient panic disorder ( PD ) versus 10 normal control , 3 . ) We perform single-blind , placebo-controlled study evaluate NK1 receptor bind PD patient control follow either saline doxapram infusion , respiratory stimulant , 20 patient panic disorder ( PD ) versus 20 normal control . Doxapram act peripheral medullary chemoreceptor increase rate depth breathing . It appear potent specific panicogenic agent , trigger panic attack . The majority PD patient , control , expect experience panic attack ( aversive event ) follow doxapram infusion . Comparison pre-panic post-panic NK1 receptor bind PD patient provide estimate SP release . The goal present study demonstrate involvement SP panic disorder , thereby , understand role psychopathology illness .</detailed_description>
