	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study gemcitabine bevacizumab see well work compare gemcitabine alone treat patient locally advance metastatic pancreatic cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Monoclonal antibody bevacizumab locate tumor cell either kill deliver tumor-killing substance without harm normal cell . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell stop blood flow tumor . Combining gemcitabine bevacizumab may kill tumor cell . It yet know whether gemcitabine effective without bevacizumab treat pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine With Without Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine combination chemotherapy gemcitabine bevacizumab achieve superior survival compare gemcitabine placebo patient previously untreated advanced pancreatic cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare objective response rate , duration response , progression free survival , toxicity two regimens patient advanced pancreatic cancer . II . To measure baseline level VEGF correlate treatment outcome . III . To measure baseline treatment level additional growth factor may co- counter- regulate VEGF correlate response treatment . IV . To measure baseline treatment level coagulation endothelial cell activation marker may predict thrombotic bleeding risk related treatment . V. To generate protein expression profile use MALDI-TOF base platform serum sample . To analyze compare protein expression profile elucidate ion peak differentiate patient respond therapy patient respond . To identify protein responsible differentially express ion peak . To develop quantitative assay protein . VI . To assess difference overall survival within treatment arm ( gemcitabine + bevacizumab ) , two VEGF genotypic group : Group 1 denote individual CT TT genotype Group 2 consist individual CC genotype . VII . To conduct exploratory analysis gene-toxicity , gene-response , gene-survival relationship various polymorphism describe gene implicate gemcitabine pharmacology ( CDA , DCK , DCTD , SLC29A1 , SLC28A1 , SLC29A2 ) . An exploratory quantitative interaction genotype ( group 1 2 ) treatment arm ( gemcitabine + bevacizumab gemcitabine + placebo ) predict overall survival also evaluate . VIII . To identify specific SNPs genetic variation associate difference among patient risk toxicity . IX . To compare effect gemcitabine + bevacizumab versus gemcitabine + placebo resource utilization , cost , utility , applicable , make estimate marginal cost-utility . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord ECOG performance status ( 0-1 v 2 ) , disease extent ( metastatic v locally advance ) , prior radiotherapy ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive gemcitabine IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 . Arm II : Patients receive gemcitabine IV arm I placebo IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 590 patient ( 295 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 26.8 month .</detailed_description>
