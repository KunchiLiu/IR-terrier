	<brief_title>Cyclophosphamide Filgrastim Treating Patients With Stage IV , Relapsed , Refractory Low-Grade Follicular Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine feasibility high-dose cyclophosphamide filgrastim ( G-CSF ) patient stage IV , relapse , progressive low-grade follicular non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . II . Determine toxic effect regimen patient , include marrow involvement . III . Determine rate complete remission ( CR ) partial remission time failure previously treat untreated patient . IV . Determine effectiveness regimen eradicate bcl-2 rearrangement , determine polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , previously untreated patient . V. Correlate duration CR PCR result respond patient . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord prior treatment ( yes v ) . Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV 90 minute day 1 filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously begin day 3 continue blood count recover . Treatment continue every 2 week 4 course absence disease progression stable disease . Patients achieve complete remission ( CR ) completion course 4 receive 2 additional course . Patients achieve partial remission ( PR ) completion course 4 receive 2 additional course , achieve CR completion course 6 receive 2 additional course . Patients follow every 2 month 6 month , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS : Histologically proven lowgrade nonHodgkin 's lymphoma follow subtypes : Follicular , predominantly small cleave cell Follicular mixed ( small cleave large cell ) Previously treat Protocol CLB 8691 previously untreated Previously untreated patient Stage IV disease ( Ann Arbor classification ) must meet following condition : Documented bone marrow involvement Lymph node biopsy must show high grade lymphoma At least 1 additional risk factor follow : At least 2 extranodal site Nodes nodal group least 5 cm Male Previously treat patient must progress relapse Protocol CLB8691 Recurrence document biopsy possible Bidimensionally measurable disease physical exam , radiograph , CT , MRI ( sonography barium study alone acceptable ) Measurable liver disease define : Mass great 3.5 cm CT , MRI , ultrasound OR Histologically document lymphomatous hepatomegaly 5 cm costal margin The following disease manifestation consider measurable : Ascites pleural effusion Bony disease ( lytic lesion xray document follow ) CNS lesions Bone marrow involvement No lymphomatous involvement ( include CNS lymphoma ) require immediate radiotherapy A new classification scheme adult nonHodgkin 's lymphoma adopt PDQ . The terminology `` indolent '' `` aggressive '' lymphoma replace former terminology `` low '' , `` intermediate '' , `` high '' grade lymphoma . However , protocol us former terminology .
