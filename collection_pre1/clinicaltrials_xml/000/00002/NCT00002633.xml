	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Hormones stimulate growth prostate cancer cell . Hormone therapy may fight prostate cancer reduce production androgen . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . It yet know whether hormone therapy plus surgery effective hormone therapy plus radiation therapy prostate cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study give hormone therapy alone see well work compare give hormone therapy together bilateral orchiectomy radiation therapy treat patient stage III stage IV prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hormone Therapy With Without Surgery Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare overall survival , disease specific survival , time progression patient locally advance adenocarcinoma prostate treat total androgen suppression without pelvic irradiation . - Compare symptomatic control measure rate surgical intervention need control local disease ( e.g. , transurethral resection , stent insertion , nephrostomies , colostomy ) patient treat regimen . - Compare quality life patient treat regimen . - Compare sensitivity EORTC-QLQ-C30+3 trial-specific checklist ( PR17 ) FACT-P questionnaire measuring change quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord center , initial PSA level ( le 20 vs 20-50 v great 50 ng/mL ) , method node staging ( clinical [ CT scan ] v radiological [ CT scan negative ] v surgical ) , Gleason score ( le 8 vs 8-10 ) , prior hormonal therapy ( exclude orchiectomy ) ( yes v ) , choice hormonal therapy ( bilateral orchiectomy without antiandrogen v luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [ LHRH ] antiandrogen ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive antiandrogen therapy comprise oral flutamide every 8 hour , oral nilutamide every 8 hour 1 month daily , oral bicalutamide daily . Patients also choose undergo bilateral orchiectomy LHRH agonist therapy comprise goserelin subcutaneously ( SC ) every 4 week ( short-acting formulation ) every 3 month ( long-acting formulation ) , leuprolide intramuscularly every 4 week ( short-acting formulation ) every 3 month ( long-acting formulation ) , buserelin SC every 8 week every 12 week . Patients choose orchiectomy may receive antiandrogen least 6 week surgery counter flare phenomenon may continue antiandrogen surgery ( physician 's discretion ) . - Arm II : Patients undergo total androgen ablation arm I . Patients node-negative dissection undergo radiotherapy 5 day week 6.5-7 week . All patient undergo radiotherapy 5 day week 5 week , follow boost radiotherapy 5 day week 2-2.4 week . Hormonal therapy arm continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline , last day radiotherapy , 6 month , every 6 month thereafter . Patients follow 1 , 2 , 6 month every 6 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 1,200 patient accrue study within 7.5 year .</detailed_description>
