	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Assess safety toxicity cellular adoptive immunotherapy use autologous CD8+ antigen-specific T-cell clone patient metastatic melanoma . - Estimate duration vivo persistence adoptively transfer CD8+ antigen-specific cytotoxic T-cell clone patient . - Evaluate antitumor effect CD8+ antigen-specific T-cell clone patient . OUTLINE : Autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cell harvest CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte ( CTL ) clone target melanosomal antigen generate ex vivo . Patients receive cellular adoptive immunotherapy comprise autologous CD8+ CTL clone 30 minute day 1 . Patients also receive interleukin-2 subcutaneously every 12 hour day 1-14 course 2-3 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow approximately 1 year last infusion . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 20 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
