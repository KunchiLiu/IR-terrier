	<brief_title>Piritrexim Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer Urinary Tract</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate antineoplastic activity piritrexim effect survival patient advance urothelial carcinoma previously treat systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy . II . Evaluate toxicity piritrexim patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive piritrexim mouth 3 time daily , 5 day week , 3 week follow 1 week rest . Patients respond stable disease continue treatment every 4 week unacceptable toxicity progression intervenes . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A maximum 40 patient enter 5-6 month least 1 response observe first 14 evaluable patient .</detailed_description>
