	<brief_title>Surgery With Without Lymph Node Removal Treating Older Women With Stage I Stage IIA Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare local systemic disease-free survival , ipsilateral axillary relapse , occurrence postmastectomy syndrome , overall survival elderly woman clinically operable stage I IIA breast cancer subsequently receive adjuvant tamoxifen treatment breast surgery without axillary node dissection . - Compare toxicity regimens patient . - Compare quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord whether receive prior primary surgery ( yes v ) participate center . - Arm I : Patients undergo mastectomy , lumpectomy , quadrantectomy axillary clearance . Patients receive oral tamoxifen 5 year . Patients may also undergo sentinel node biopsy . - Arm II : Patients undergo surgery arm I without axillary clearance . Patients receive oral tamoxifen 5 year . Patients arm undergo breast-conserving surgery may receive optional radiotherapy 5-6 week remain breast tissue , chest , lung . Upon recurrence conserve breast , patient undergo total mastectomy ; arm II experience ipsilateral axillary recurrence undergo surgical excision . Adjuvant tamoxifen follow continue . Quality life assess . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month receive tamoxifen , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 1,020 patient accrue study within approximately 5 year .</detailed_description>
