	<brief_title>Interleukin-2 Observation Following Radiation Therapy , Combination Chemotherapy , Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation Treating Patients With Recurrent Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare survival disease-free survival patient non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma treat post-transplant therapy interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) treatment . Transplant therapy total body irradiation ( TBI ) , high-dose etoposide , cyclophosphamide peripheral blood stem cell transplant ( PBSCT ) . II . To assess frequency severity toxicity associate post-transplant IL-2 therapy . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord disease grade ( low v intermediate v high ) , chemosensitive disease ( yes v ) , partial complete response initial induction chemotherapy ( yes v ) , performance status ( 0-1 v 2 ) . Part I : Autologous peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) harvest study entry . Patients undergo total body irradiation twice day day -8 -5 , high-dose etoposide IV 4 hour day -4 , cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour day -2 . PBSC reinfused day 0 filgrastim ( G-CSF ) may administer subcutaneously IV day 0-21 . Part II : Within 28-80 day PBSC transplantation recovery toxic effect , patient active recurrent progressive disease randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive interleukin-2 IV continuously day 1-4 9-18 . Arm II : Patients undergo observation . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 275 patient accrue study within 3.5-5.9 year .</detailed_description>
