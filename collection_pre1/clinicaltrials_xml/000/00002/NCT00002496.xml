	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . It yet know chemotherapy plus radiation therapy effective radiation therapy alone treat patient advanced cancer larynx . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness radiation therapy without chemotherapy treat patient advanced cancer larynx .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy With Without Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer Larynx</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare , phase III setting , overall disease-free survival preservation laryngeal function patient stage III/IV squamous cell carcinoma glottic supraglottic larynx treat cisplatin/fluorouracil ( CDDP/5-FU ) follow radiotherapy vs. concomitant radiotherapy plus CDDP vs. radiotherapy alone . II . Compare tumor response completion chemotherapy prior initiation radiotherapy follow completion radiotherapy concurrent chemotherapy . III . Compare pattern relapse ( local regional recurrence distant metastasis ) treatment . IV . Compare incidence second primary tumor patient treat three regimen . V. Compare acute chronic adverse effect three regimen . VI . Compare morbidity experience neck dissection and/or laryngeal salvage surgery follow treatment regimen . VII . Compare quality life patient laryngeal preservation vs. patient require salvage laryngectomy . VIII . Compare quality life patient receive radiotherapy alone vs. receive chemotherapy well . OUTLINE : Randomized study . Patients arm , clinically stag N+ undergo neck dissection follow completion radiotherapy . Arm I : 2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy follow Radiotherapy . Cisplatin , CDDP , NSC-119875 ; Fluorouracil , 5-FU , NSC-19893 ; follow regional irradiation use linear accelerator photon energy 1.25-6 MV , electron energy 8-17 MeV , Co60 . Arm II : Radiotherapy plus Single-Agent Chemotherapy/Radiosensitization . Regional irradiation use equipment Arm I ; plus CDDP . Arm III : Radiotherapy . Regional irradiation use equipment Arm I . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : 546 patient ( 182/arm ) enter approximately 3 year . If arm clearly inferior laryngectomy-free survival 137 patient complete 2 year follow-up study , arm close accrual . A second interim analysis conduct 410 patient complete 2 year follow-up .</detailed_description>
