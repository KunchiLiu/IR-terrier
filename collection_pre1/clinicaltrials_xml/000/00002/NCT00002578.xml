	<brief_title>Gallium Nitrate Treating Patients With AIDS-Related Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response rate duration response patient AIDS-related non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma treat gallium nitrate failure first-line chemotherapy regimen . II . Determine qualitative quantitative toxic effect regimen patient . III . Determine pharmacokinetic parameter regimen patient , determine correlation parameter response . OUTLINE : Patients receive gallium nitrate IV continuously day 1-7 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete remission ( CR ) receive 2 additional course past CR . Patients relapse achieve CR may retreat absence disease progression . Treatment relapse second CR discretion principal investigator . Patients leptomeningeal disease study entry must receive intrathecal ( IT ) methotrexate IV leucovorin calcium IT cytarabine . Patients develop leptomeningeal disease study may continue treatment gallium nitrate must also receive IT methotrexate leucovorin calcium ( without radiotherapy ) IT cytarabine . Patients follow survival . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-35 patient accrue study within 2 year .</detailed_description>
