	<brief_summary>The purpose study see safe effective give protease inhibitor ( PI ) amprenavir ( APV ) patient fat production distribution problem associate PIs . Protease inhibitor effective treat HIV-1 disease . However , patient take drug often problem , hyperlipidemia ( increase level fat blood ) lipodystrophy ( problem way fat produce distribute body ) . Doctors know exactly PIs related problem . APV show safe effective lower plasma viral load ( level HIV blood ) . APV may useful patient develop complication associate PIs .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Amprenavir Patients With Protease Inhibitor-Related Complications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Protease inhibitor highly efficacious treatment HIV-1 disease . Current drug , however , associate high incidence adverse effect well metabolic complication lipodystrophy hyperlipidemia . At time , though , causal relationship link complication use protease inhibitor remain establish . Studies show APV well tolerate effective reduce plasma HIV-1 RNA level . The safety profile APV suggest may offer therapeutic potential subject develop intolerance protease inhibitor . Patients receive open-label APV plus least 2 antiretroviral drug . Fasting blood sample patient medication adherence questionnaire collect Weeks 12 24 . Bodily assessment collect Day 1 Weeks 12 24 . Hematology , serum chemistry , plasma HIV-1 viral load determination CD4+ cell count measurement collect pre-entry every 12 week duration study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Patients must : Documented HIV1 infection . Two consecutive ( least 4 week apart ) screen HIV1 plasma RNA level less equal 10,000 copies/ml prior openlabel drug administration . Hyperlipidemia without lipodystrophy ( Grade 14 toxicity triglyceride total cholesterol ) , intolerant standard protease inhibitor therapy , judgment physician , unable construct viable treatment regimen without APV . Exclusion Criteria Coexisting Condition : Patients follow symptoms condition exclude : Renal failure require dialysis . Hepatic failure . Serious medical condition diabetes , congestive heart failure , cardiomyopathy , cardiac dysfunction , opinion investigator , would compromise safety patient . Malabsorption syndrome gastrointestinal dysfunction , might interfere drug absorption render patient unable take oral medication . Concurrent Treatment : Excluded : Concomitant use another protease inhibitor . Patients follow prior condition exclude : Clinically relevant history pancreatitis hepatitis within last 6 month . Prior Treatment : Excluded : Previous treatment APV . Risk Behavior : Excluded : Patients currently use alcohol illicit drug , investigator 's opinion , may interfere patient 's ability comply requirement study . Included : Prior treatment least one protease inhibitor .</criteria>
