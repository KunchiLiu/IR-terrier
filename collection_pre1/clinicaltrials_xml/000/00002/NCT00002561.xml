	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Radiation therapy use high energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Combining one drug combine chemotherapy radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness radiation therapy , without chemotherapy , chemotherapy alone treat patient stage I stage IIA Hodgkin 's disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Hodgkin 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare 12-year survival patient clinical stage I-IIA Hodgkin 's disease treat radiotherapy without doxorubicin , bleomycin , vinblastine , dacarbazine ( ABVD ) versus ABVD . II . Compare freedom progression 5 10 year patient treat regimen . III . Compare complete remission rate , freedom secondary disease progression 5 10 year , cause-specific survival 5 , 10 , 15 year patient treat regimen . IV . Compare short- long-term toxicity regimens patient . V. Compare quality life patient patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify center . Patients age 40 lymphocyte-predominant nodular sclerosing histology , erythrocyte sedimentation rate le 50 , few 4 disease site ( supradiaphragmatic pelvic node site ) assign cohort 1 ( good prognosis ) . All patient assign cohort 2 ( poor prognosis ) . Cohort 1 : Arm I : Patients supradiaphragmatic disease undergo radiotherapy supradiaphragmatic lymph node area ( mantle region ) , spleen , para-aortic lymph node 5 day week 4 week . Patients pelvic disease undergo radiotherapy `` inverted-Y '' field ( exclude spleen ) 5 day week 4 week . Arm II : Patients receive doxorubicin , bleomycin , vinblastine , dacarbazine IV day 1 15 ( ABVD ) . Treatment continue every 4 week total 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients complete remission ( CR ) course 2 receive 2 additional course past CR . Patients partial remission ( PR ) course 2 receive 4 additional course past PR . Patients unconfirmed/uncertain complete remission ( CRu ) receive 2-4 additional course past CRu . Cohort 2 : Arm III : Patients receive ABVD arm II , follow 4-6 week later concurrent radiotherapy mantle region upper abdomen level L2 5 day week 4 week . Alternatively , radiotherapy may also administer sequentially mantle region 5 day week 4 week upper abdomen level L2 5 day week 4 week . Arm IV : Patients receive ABVD arm II . Patients disease progression treatment arm II IV consider radiotherapy . Quality life assess day 1 course chemotherapy ( arm II-IV ) day 28 last course chemotherapy ( arm II IV ) ; first final day radiotherapy ( arm I III ) ; 4 week 3 , 6 , 12 month completion radiotherapy ( arm I III ) chemotherapy ( arm II IV ) ; annually 2-10 year . Patients follow month 3 , 6 , 12 annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 450 patient accrue study within 7.5 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligibility Criteria Histologically prove Hodgkin 's Disease . A needle aspirate specimen consider sufficient diagnosis . Pathologic material must review designated local reference pathologist ( LRP ) prior randomization . Histologic subtype determine LRP use patient cohort assignment . Patients must clinical stage I IIA disease accord Ann Arbor stag criterion . Clinical stage must base least one tissue biopsy . The following aspect consider determine patient stage : ) Splenic Enlargement : Splenic enlargement determine image study consider evidence splenic involvement Hodgkin 's disease . Patients consider splenic involvement spleen palpable physical examination enlarge image study , image study show focal abnormality consistent Hodgkin 's disease . These patient , present supradiaphragmatic disease would therefore assessed Stage III disease would ineligible . ii ) Bone Disease : Lytic blastic lesion see plain radiographs abnormality bone scan consistent Hodgkin 's disease consider bone involvement Hodgkin 's disease . These patient would therefore assessed Stage IV disease would ineligible . iii ) Pleural Effusion Ascites : The presence pleural effusion ascites consider evidence Hodgkin 's disease even cytological examination negative . These patient would assess probable Stage IV disease therefore would ineligible . Patients assess Xray pleural thicken `` blunt '' costophrenic angle may eligible . iv ) Extranodal v . Stage IV Disease : Patients disease involve single extranodal site may consider `` limitedstage '' provide disease include standard radiation field . Patients extranodal disease include field ( eg , lung , bone ) multiple sit extranodal disease eligible trial . Pulmonary function test must do patient symptomatic lung disease . FVC , FEV1 DLCO must ≥ 60 % predict value . Patients asthma control medication eligible criterion meet . Patient 's age ≥ 16 year . ( Note low age limit centre determine centre 's policy regarding age individual may sign consent . ) Patient must receive previous chemotherapy radiotherapy . Laboratory requirement : granulocyte ≥ 1.5 x 109/L ( S.I . ) ≥ 1.5 x 103/uL ( U.S. ) platelets ≥ 125 x 109/L ( S.I . ) ≥ 125 x 103/uL ( U.S. ) bilirubin ≤ 2.5 x UNL ( unless due hemolytic anemia ) serum creatinine ≤ 2 x UNL Patient must see radiation oncologist medical oncologist agree patient able receive protocol radiation therapy . Patient consent must obtain accord local Institutional and/or University Human Experimentation Committee requirement . It responsibility local participate investigator obtain necessary local clearance , indicate write NCIC CTG Clinical Trials Coordinator clearance obtain , trial commence centre . Because differ requirement , standard consent form trial provide sample form give . The patient must sign consent form prior randomization . Please note consent form study must contain statement give permission NCICCTG monitoring agency review patient record . Availability patient followup quality life ( QoL ) assessment . Patients must accessible treatment followup . Investigators must assure patient registered trial available complete documentation treatment , toxicity followup . Comparison quality life endpoint study . Patients must complete prerandomization quality life assessment willing complete future assessment . The exception patient unable read english french . Patients study expect complete quality life assessment , prove possible , retain study analysis . Ineligibility Criteria Prior concurrent malignancy , except adequately treat basal cell carcinoma skin . ( Patients prior carcinomainsitu cervix eligible . ) Cardiac disease define symptomatic congestive heart failure coronary artery disease , know valvular ( asymptomatic mitral valve prolapse ) congenital heart disease ( asymptomatic atrial septal defect ) need cardiac medication . Hypertension control drug therapy exclusion criterion . Other major medical illness judge likely local investigator preclude safe administration protocol treatment require followup .
