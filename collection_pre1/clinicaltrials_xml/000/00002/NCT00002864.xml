	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Estrogen stimulate growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use tamoxifen without octreotide may fight breast cancer block uptake estrogen . It yet know treatment regimen effective breast cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness tamoxifen without octreotide treat postmenopausal woman stage I , stage II , stage III breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tamoxifen With Without Octreotide Treating Postmenopausal Women With Stage I , Stage II , Stage III Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare event-free , recurrence-free , overall survival follow adjuvant therapy tamoxifen alone vs. tamoxifen plus octreotide long-acting release formulation postmenopausal woman stage I/II/III breast cancer . II . Compare toxicity quality life associate treatment regimen . III . Compare effect treatment regimen insulin-like growth factor-I ( IGF-I ) physiology , study relationship IGF-I physiology outcome . OUTLINE : This randomize study . Patients stratify participate institution , whether receive adjuvant chemotherapy , axillary lymph node status , hormone receptor status . All patient randomize within 12 week definitive surgery . Patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy prior protocol treatment randomize within 6 week last dose chemotherapy . One group patient receive daily oral tamoxifen , second group receive daily oral tamoxifen plus octreotide ( long-acting release formulation ) monthly depot injection . Treatment group continue 5 year disease recurrence development second malignancy . Patients follow monthly 4 month , every 4 month 3 year , every 6 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 850 patient enter 4.2 year multicenter study .</detailed_description>
