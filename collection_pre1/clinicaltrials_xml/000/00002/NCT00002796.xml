	<brief_summary>Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Interferon-gamma may interfere growth tumor cell slow growth tumor . Combining one drug interferon-gamma may kill tumor cell . This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose give fluorouracil together phenylbutyrate , indomethacin , interferon-gamma see well work treat patient stage IV colorectal cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I-II Study Fluorouracil Combination With Phenylbutyrate Advanced Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine Phase I study toxicity flurouracil ( FU ) give escalate dos combination fix dos phenlylbutyrate ( PB ) , indomethacin recombinant human interferon-gamma ( rhIFNg ) patient advanced colorectal cancer . II . To determine Phase II study efficacy FU combination PB , indomethacin rhIFNg patient advance colorectal cancer . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) . Phase I : Patients receive 5-FU IV 24 hour day 1 ; phenylbutyrate IV 120 hour oral indomethacin daily day 2-6 ; interferon gamma subcutaneously day 2 , 4 , 6 . Courses repeat weekly absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos 5-FU maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose less 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) . Phase II : Patients receive 5-FU , phenylbutyrate , indomethacin , interferon gamma phase I MTD . Patients follow survival . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A maximum 24 patient accrued phase I portion study approximately 46 patient accrue phase II portion study .</detailed_description>
