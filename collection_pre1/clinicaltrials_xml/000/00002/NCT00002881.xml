	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Hormone therapy may effective treatment prostate cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial evaluate effectiveness treatment flutamide suramin without hydrocortisone men metastatic recurrent prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Flutamide , Suramin , Hydrocortisone Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare time progression survival patient metastatic recurrent adenocarcinoma prostate treat orchiectomy LHRH analogue ( i.e . leuprolide goserelin ) plus flutamide vs. without suramin hydrocortisone . II . Compare two treatment respect qualitative quantitative toxic effect . III . Evaluate normalization prostatic-specific antigen ( PSA ) , duration PSA response , use PSA surrogate marker tumor response patient . IV . Compare two treatment respect quality life pain status . OUTLINE : This randomize study . Patients stratified choice androgen suppression technique participate institution . Within 3 day randomization , patient receive daily flutamide . On day 4 , patient undergo orchiectomy begin monthly LHRH analogue therapy leuprolide goserelin . Patients randomize receive suramin begin 12-week course 8-25 day orchiectomy/LHRH therapy . Hydrocortisone replacement therapy begin concomitantly suramin continue least 3 month completion suramin treatment disease progression intervenes . Patients follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 800-1,000 patient enter within 3.25 4.25 year .</detailed_description>
