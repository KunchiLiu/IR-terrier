	<brief_title>A Study Nitazoxanide Treatment AIDS-Related Diarrhea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cryptosporidial enterocolitis AIDS patient frequently chronic severe , contribute substantially morbidity , mortality , health care cost population . NTZ exhibit antimicrobial activity may extend Cryptosporidial infection . Patients enrol group 7 . Group A receive low dose NTZ . Groups B - D receive sequentially high dos . Patients Groups B - D begin therapy patient enrol precede dose . For determination single-dose pharmacokinetics , patient receive single dose NTZ Day 1 blood sample obtain next 24 hour . Immediately follow 24-hour blood sample collection , patient begin treatment phase take NTZ additional 13 day . Blood sample obtain Day 14 determine full plasma concentration-time profile dose interval . At end treatment , responder discontinue treatment nonresponders continue NTZ treatment additional 14 day dose . Patients still fail respond provide additional month NTZ . Patients schedule visit clinical parasitologic efficacy assessment safety laboratory test .</detailed_description>
