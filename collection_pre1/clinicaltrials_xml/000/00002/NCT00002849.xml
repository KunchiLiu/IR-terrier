	<brief_title>S9628 Dexamethasone Plus Interferon Alfa Treating Patients With Primary Systemic Amyloidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Evaluate M protein organ dysfunction response overall progression-free survival patient primary systemic amyloidosis treat dexamethasone/interferon alfa . - Identify prognostic factor may relate response overall survival patient . - Evaluate qualitative quantitative toxic effect regimen . OUTLINE : Patients stratify prior amyloidosis treatment ( yes v ) . All patient receive induction therapy oral dexamethasone day 1-4 , 9-12 , 17-20 every 35 day total 3 course . Maintenance therapy begin within 5-8 week ( within 10 week patient undergo stem cell harvest ) initiation third course induction , follow : oral dexamethasone 4 day every 4 week ; subcutaneous interferon alfa 3 time per week . Patients achieve less 50 % reduction serum M protein urinary Bence-Jones protein experience less grade 3 toxicity induction receive 3 additional course pulse dexamethasone concurrently entry maintenance therapy initiation interferon alfa . Combination therapy continued 2 year entry ; thereafter , interferon administer alone least 3 year , toxicity permitting . Patients stable disease 5 year therapy may discontinue interferon alfa discretion treat physician . Patients follow every 6 month 2 year yearly thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 100 patient ( 50 prior melphalan/prednisone iododoxorubicin treatment 50 without ) enter 3 year .</detailed_description>
