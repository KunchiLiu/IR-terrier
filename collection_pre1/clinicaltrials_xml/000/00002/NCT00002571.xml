	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop cancer cell divide stop grow die . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage cancer cell . Antiviral therapy may effective treatment AIDS-related lymphoma . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combination chemotherapy , radiation therapy , antiviral therapy treat patient AIDS-related lymphoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I. Assess response rate AIDS-related lymphoma ProMACE-CytaBOM ( cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , etoposide , prednisone , cytarabine , bleomycin , vincristine , methotrexate ) . II . Assess toxic effect ProMACE-CytaBOM patient AIDS-related lymphoma . III . Evaluate whether incorporation filgrastim ( G-CSF ) regimen allow treatment full dose myelotoxic agent patient . IV . Determine whether intensive CNS treatment intrathecal cytarabine whole-brain irradiation prevents meningeal relapse control meningeal lymphomatous involvement patient . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord participate institution descriptive factor : histopathology ( diffuse large cleaved/noncleaved immunoblastic lymphoma v others ) , CD4 count ( le 50 v 50 cells/mm3 ) , prior opportunistic infection ( yes v ) , performance status ( 0 1 v 2 ) , concurrent AZT ( yes v ) , concurrent protease inhibitor ( yes v ) , marrow involvement ( yes v ) . Patients receive ProMACE-CytaBOM regimen follow : Cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , etoposide IV day 1 Cytarabine , bleomycin , vincristine , methotrexate IV day 8 Oral prednisone day 1-14 Oral leucovorin calcium every 6 hour 4 dos day 9 Patients also receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously day 9-20 oral co-trimoxazole 3 day week throughout treatment , plus antiretroviral therapy discretion treat physician . Treatment repeat every 21 day maximum 6 course . Patients progressive disease remove study 2 course . Remaining patient receive additional 2 treatment course restaged . Patients without stable progressive disease receive 2 course absence unacceptable toxicity . Patients positive bone marrow study entry receive CNS prophylaxis 5 evenly spaced dos intrathecal cytarabine first 2 treatment course day 1 subsequent course . Patients positive CSF cytology study entry receive intrathecal cytarabine day 1-5 first treatment course day 1 subsequent course CSF negative 5 daily dos . Patients whose CSF remain positive 5 day receive 5 evenly spaced dos intrathecal methotrexate second treatment course . Patients negative bone marrow CSF cytology study entry receive 5 evenly spaced dos intrathecal cytarabine within 1 month systemic therapy . All patient achieve complete partial response follow systemic therapy intrathecal cytarabine receive cranial irradiation meningeal surface . Patients follow monthly 1 year , every 2 month 1 year , every 3 month 1 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 50 patient accrue study approximately 2 year .</detailed_description>
