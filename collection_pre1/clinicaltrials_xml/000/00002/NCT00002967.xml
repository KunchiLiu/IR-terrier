	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining hormone therapy chemotherapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial study effectiveness tamoxifen , octreotide , chemotherapy treat woman stage I stage II breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine whether addition octreotide pamoate tamoxifen alone tamoxifen chemotherapy improve disease free survival patient primary invasive breast cancer estrogen receptor ( ER ) positive tumor histologically negative axillary lymph node histologically negative sentinel lymph node participate NSABP B-32 . II . Determine whether rate endometrial cancer associate tamoxifen alter concurrent administration octreotide pamoate . III . Determine whether addition octreotide pamoate tamoxifen decrease rate opposite breast cancer tamoxifen alone . IV . Evaluate incidence gallstone formation ( include development symptom complication biliary tract disease ) , hyper hypoglycemia , hypothyroidism , vitamin B12 deficiency patient treat octreotide pamoate comparison patient treat octreotide pamoate . OUTLINE : This randomize study . Patients randomize one four treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive oral tamoxifen ( TMX ) daily continously 5 year . Lumpectomy patient receive breast radiotherapy follow recovery surgery . Arm II : Patients receive TMX Arm I octreotide pamoate ( SMS 201-995 pa LAR ) intramuscularly ( IM ) every 21 day 4 dos , follow octreotide pamoate IM 28 day 23 additional dos . Lumpectomy patient receive breast radiotherapy follow recovery surgery . Arm III : Patients receive doxorubicin ( DOX ) IV cyclophosphamide ( CTX ) IV every 3 week 4 course TMX Arm I. Lumpectomy patient receive breast radiotherapy recovery chemotherapy . Arm IV : Patients receive DOX CTX Arm III , TMX Arm I , octreotide pamoate Arm II . Patients receive TMX octreotide pamoate day 1 first course chemotherapy . Lumpectomy patient receive breast radiotherapy recovery chemotherapy . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Total accrual 3,000 patient acrrued study 5 year .</detailed_description>
