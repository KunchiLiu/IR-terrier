	<brief_title>Tributyrin Treating Patients With Refractory Prostate Cancer Other Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose optimum schedule tributyrin patient prostate cancer solid tumor . II . Determine toxic effect tributyrin patient . III . Determine pharmacodynamics tributyrin , include modulation tumor marker , evaluation clinical remission ( possible ) , assessment F-reticulocytes and/or F cell , evaluation hemoglobin F treatment , patient . IV . Determine pharmacokinetics tributyrin , include maximum plasma concentration , terminal half-life , area concentration time curve , volume distribution , clearance butyrate , patient . V. Determine relationship pharmacokinetics toxic therapeutic pharmacodynamic effect butyrate patient . VI . Calculate tributyrin dose , use result pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic study , achieves sustain butyrate concentration capable increase therapeutic effect reduce toxicity . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study . Patients receive oral tributyrin every 8 hour 3 week . Treatment continue every 4 week 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve stable disease may receive additional course discretion protocol chairperson . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos tributyrin maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity .</detailed_description>
