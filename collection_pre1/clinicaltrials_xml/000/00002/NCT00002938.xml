	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Prostatectomy may effective treatment prostate cancer respond radiation therapy . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well prostatectomy work treat patient recurrent persistent prostate cancer respond radiation therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgery Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine characteristic failure-free survival , disease-free survival , overall survival , surgical morbidity mortality , quality life patient treated salvage prostatectomy recurrence persistent disease treatment prior radiotherapy localized prostate cancer . - Develop expertise use salvage prostatectomy prior possible phase III trial salvage prostatectomy population versus control arm hormonal therapy cryotherapy . - Determine quality life measure patient . - Determine preliminary data quality life patient undergoing salvage radical prostatectomy use data design phase III study . - Determine histologic morphometric characterization carcinoma . OUTLINE : Patients undergo modified bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection . Patients negative node undergo salvage prostatectomy via either retropubic perineal approach . Patients positive node may undergo radical prostatectomy discretion investigator . Postoperative hormonal therapy may give time symptomatic disease progression newly positive bone scan , consistently rise prostate-specific antigen . Adjuvant hormonal therapy also allow . Quality life assess prior surgery 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month surgery . Patients follow least every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 40 patient accrue study within 2 year .</detailed_description>
