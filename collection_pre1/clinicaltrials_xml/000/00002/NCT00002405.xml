	<brief_summary>The purpose study see safe give amprenavir ( APV ) HIV-infected patient . This study also examine effect APV level HIV blood . Earlier study show APV effective slow growth HIV body . Patients fail previous anti-HIV treatment unable take protease inhibitor ( PIs ) may benefit availability new PI APV .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Amprenavir HIV-Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Earlier Phase II/III clinical trial indicate APV effective retarding HIV progression body . Despite data , however , drug yet receive regulatory approval . At time , urgent need grant pre-approval access specific group patient eager benefit anti-HIV potential inherent APV . This study examine relative effect APV patient prior treatment failure intolerance previous protease inhibitor therapy . Patients see clinic pre-entry , baseline ( Day 1 ) , every 4 week thereafter . Data current antiretroviral treatment , HIV-1 associate condition adverse event collect every scheduled visit . Laboratory value ( i.e. , hematology , serum chemistry , plasma HIV-1 viral load CD4+ cell count ) collect assessed pre-entry Weeks 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 . Optimal therapeutic effectiveness dictate combine use 2 antiretroviral agent patient fail current antiretroviral therapy . APV , therefore , must initiate component treatment regimen also include least one antiretroviral drug patient previously receive .</detailed_description>
