	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Estrogen stimulate growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use exemestane tamoxifen may fight cancer block uptake estrogen . PURPOSE : Randomized phase II/III trial compare effectiveness exemestane tamoxifen treat postmenopausal woman locally recurrent metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exemestane Compared With Tamoxifen Treating Women With Locally Recurrent Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare efficacy exemestane v tamoxifen , term progression-free survival , postmenopausal woman locally recurrent metastatic breast cancer . - Determine safety profile exemestane patient . - Compare overall survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . ( Phase II study close 6/14/00 ) . Patients stratify participate center , prior adjuvant tamoxifen ( yes v ) , prior chemotherapy metastatic disease ( yes v ) , dominant site metastasis ( visceral without others vs bone v bone soft tissue v soft tissue ) . Patients randomize receive either oral exemestane oral tamoxifen daily . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 18 month least every 6 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 342 patient accrue study within 4.7 year .</detailed_description>
