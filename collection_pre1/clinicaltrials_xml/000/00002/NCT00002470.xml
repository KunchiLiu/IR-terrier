	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Interferon alfa may interfere growth cancer cell . Combining interferon alfa chemotherapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness fluorouracil plus interferon alfa treat patient advanced metastatic carcinoid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fluorouracil Plus Interferon Alfa Treating Patients With Advanced Metastatic Carcinoid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine objective response rate duration remission patient advance metastatic carcinoid tumor treat fluorouracil interferon alfa-2b . - Determine symptomatic response patient treat regimen . - Determine toxicity regimen patient . - Determine quality life patient treat regimen . - Determine survival characteristic patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : Patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously 10 week interferon alfa subcutaneously 3 time week 12 week . Treatment continue every 12 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline week 1 , 7 , 11 course . Patients follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 50 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
