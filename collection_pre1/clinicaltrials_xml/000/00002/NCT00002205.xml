	<brief_summary>To assess safety , tolerance , efficacy amprenavir ( APV ) plus abacavir ( ABC ) patient previously fail antiretroviral treatment contain protease inhibitor ( PI ) . To provide open-label , pre-approval access APV adult adolescents HIV-1 infection limit treatment option . This study conduct provide open-label APV patient danger HIV disease progression , well may benefit beyond expect outcomes current anti-retroviral therapy . Despite unapproved status , APV may prove highly efficacious combat HIV progression may help need , prior regulatory approval .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study conduct provide open-label APV patient danger HIV disease progression , well may benefit beyond expect outcomes current anti-retroviral therapy . Despite unapproved status , APV may prove highly efficacious combat HIV progression may help need , prior regulatory approval . Patients stratify one follow treatment option : Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) -naive : Option 1- APV / ABC / PI / NNRTI / +nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( ) ( NRTI ) Option 2- APV / ABC / NNRTI / NRTI ( ) NNRTI-Experienced Patients : Option 1- APV / ABC / PI / +NRTI ( ) Option 2- APV / ABC / +NRTI ( ) To assess clinical efficacy , lab value ( i.e. , hematology , serum chemistry , plasma HIV-1 viral load determination CD4+ cell count measurement ) collect pre-entry every 12 week thereafter .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Exclusion Criteria Coexisting Condition : Patients follow symptoms condition exclude : Hepatic failure elevate ALT AST value . Malabsorption syndrome gastrointestinal dysfunction may interfere drug absorption render patient unable take oral medication . Renal failure require dialysis . Concurrent Medication : Excluded : Patients currently participate , would qualify access , enrol study APV ( ACTG 398 ACTG 400 ) . Patients follow prior condition exclude : Patients suffer serious medical condition diabetes , congestive heart failure , cardiomyopathy , cardiac dysfunction , opinion investigator , would compromise safety patient . History clinically relevant pancreatitis hepatitis within last 6 month . Prior Medication : Excluded : Previous treatment one HIV protease inhibitor . ABC use great 8 week prior enrollment study . Risk Behavior : Excluded : Patients current alcohol illicit drug use , opinion investigator , would interfere patient 's ability comply requirement study . Patients : HIV1 infection . CD4+ cell count less equal 400 cells/mm3 plasma HIV1 RNA great equal 10,000 copies/ml first preentry assessment . Evidence failure antiretroviral treatment regimen contain protease inhibitor . Clinical evidence failure current regimen require antiretroviral therapy , need APV plus ABC induce viral load suppression .</criteria>
