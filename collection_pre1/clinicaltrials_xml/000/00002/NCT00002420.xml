	<brief_title>The Safety Effectiveness Didanosine Plus Stavudine Plus Delavirdine Mesylate Plus MKC-442 HIV-Infected Patients Who Have Not Had Success With Protease Inhibitors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive treatment regimen consist didanosine , stavudine , delavirdine , MKC-442 24 week . During study , patient evaluate change baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA level lymphocyte subset development adverse event toxicity . Samples population pharmacokinetics collect patient every 4 week . Patients experience virologic failure may add hydroxyurea treatment regimen discontinue study . Patients add hydroxyurea regimen subsequently experience virologic failure discontinue study . After Week 24 , patient document virologic response eligible continue receive study treatment plasma HIV-1 RNA level return baseline level . For patient receive hydroxyurea begin Week 24 , visit conduct Weeks 28 , 32 , 36 , every 12 week thereafter . For patient continue take didanosine , stavudine , delavirdine , MKC-442 start hydroxyurea treatment Weeks 12 20 , follow-up visit conduct every 12 week , sooner need , patient permanently discontinue study treatment .</detailed_description>
