	<brief_title>Etoposide Treating Patients With Advanced Ovarian Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine efficacy prolong oral etoposide ( VP-16 ) patient advanced ovarian epithelial cervical cancer . II . Evaluate frequency severity observe adverse effect patient population treat prolonged oral VP-16 . OUTLINE : Patients receive etoposide mouth daily day 1-21 every 4 week . Patients respond disease continue treatment 12 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable disease continue treatment 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : If 4-6 response observe first 25 patient , additional 15 patient enter . The estimate duration study 8 month .</detailed_description>
