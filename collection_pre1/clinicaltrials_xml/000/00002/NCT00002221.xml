	<brief_summary>The purpose study see safe effective use gene therapy treat non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) HIV-positive patient . Stem cell transplantation procedure use treat NHL . Stem cell immature cell develop create different type blood cell . In study , stem cell treat gene therapy , mean cell treat virus cause disease . Some cell receive virus contains ribozymes , enzyme may help fight HIV . Other cell treat virus contain ribozymes see virus work alone . Some cell treat . Doctors would like see whether give patient stem cell ribozymes treat NHL stop HIV grow time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In study , CD34+ cell ( stem cell ) transduce retroviral vector construct incorporate multiple ribozymes , form RNA ability selectively inhibit gene expression , target different site within HIV virus . These transduced cell reinfused patient part bone marrow transplant procedure AIDS/lymphoma . Patients undergo autologous bone marrow transplantation enter study . A `` neutral '' retrovirus name `` LN '' retrovirus contain two ribozyme sequence name `` L-TR/Tat-neo '' introduce patient 's PBPC . The L-TR/Tat-neo retrovirus show tissue culture experiment inhibit replication HIV . The LN retrovirus serve internal control examine selective advantage gene therapy . Patients bone marrow sample take . After additional round chemotherapy refer physician , patient receive daily injection G-CSF aid collection stem cell . Daily stem cell collection perform . It anticipate three four collection require , many six may necessary . To prepare transplantation stem cell , patient admit 7-day series intensive chemotherapy . Following conditioning , gene-modified untreated stem cell infuse back patient . The collected cell divide three pool . One set aside without modification , one modify LN control vector , one modify L-TR/Tat-neo construct . The LN L-TR/Tat-neo sample pool give patient IV infusion 15 minute . The unmodified cell infuse 10 15 minute . Patients remain hospital blood cell return adequate level well enough release . Following transplantation , patient follow Months 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 , 24 . Because experimental nature gene therapy , patient follow periodically throughout lifetime .</detailed_description>
