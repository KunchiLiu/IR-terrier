	<brief_title>Safety Effectiveness Anti-HIV Drug Combination HIV-Positive Patients Who Have Failed Previous Treatment With Protease Inhibitors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive indinavir ritonavir twice daily plus 2 NRTIs ( NRTIs provide study ) . Physical examination laboratory test , include plasma viral RNA level CD4 cell count , perform Day 1 Weeks 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 ( discontinuation ) . The incidence serious drug-related adverse experience tabulate determine drug safety . The proportion patient achieve plasma viral RNA level 50 copies/ml ( UltraSensitive assay ) estimate statistically determine drug efficacy .</detailed_description>
