	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III clinical trial study combination chemotherapy high dose cyclophosphamide recombinant interferon alfa-2b see well work compare combination chemotherapy alone treat patient previously untreated stage I-III multiple myeloma . Drugs use chemotherapy , vincristine sulfate , carmustine , melphalan , cyclophosphamide , prednisone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Recombinant interferon alfa-2b may interfere growth cancer cell . It yet know whether give combination chemotherapy without alternate high-dose cyclophosphamide recombinant interferon alfa-2b effective treat multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy With Without High Dose Cyclophosphamide Recombinant Interferon Alfa-2b Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Stage I-III Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare response rate , time response , duration response , toxicity , survival two regimen ( vincristine sulfate , carmustine , melphalan , cyclophosphamide , prednisone [ VBMCP ] vs. VBMCP alternate high-dose cyclophosphamide recombinant interferon alfa-2b [ r alpha2b-IFN ] ) patient previously untreated multiple myeloma . II . To determine value ancillary laboratory study predict response survival . OUTLINE : INDUCTION PHASE : Patients receive VBMCP comprise vincristine sulfate intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , carmustine IV day 1 , melphalan orally ( PO ) day 1-4 , cyclophosphamide IV day 1 , prednisone PO day 1-7 . Treatment repeat every 35 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . CONSOLIDATION PHASE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive VBMCP induction phase . Courses repeat every 35 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : Patients receive vincristine sulfate , carmustine , melphalan induction phase , high-dose cyclophosphamide IV day 1-4 prednisone PO day 1-4 course 3 5 . Patients receive VBMCP induction phase even number course . Patients receive recombinant interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 15 , 17 , 19 , 22 odd course begin course 7 . Treatment repeat every 35 day course 3-5 , every 21 day even course begin course 6 , every 22 day odd course begin course 7 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . In arm , treatment continue 2 year . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 year .</detailed_description>
