	<brief_summary>The purpose study see safe effective give adefovir plus anti-HIV drug HIV-infected patient fail anti-HIV drug combination . This study try make adefovir available AIDS patient need . Some patient respond anti-HIV drug combination , even different combination try . Adefovir may able help patient fight HIV .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Effectiveness Giving Adefovir ( Preveon ) Plus Other Anti-HIV Drugs HIV-Infected Patients Who Have Not Responded Other Anti-HIV Drug Combinations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent study indicate use triple-combination therapy , particular combination reverse transcriptase inhibitor protease inhibitor , result significant decrease plasma HIV-1 RNA level increase CD4 cell count . Continued follow-up patient take triple-combination drug regimens case demonstrate sustained suppression plasma HIV-1 RNA level 18 month . Furthermore , despite potent antiviral effect triple combination , percentage patient continue measurable level ( 500 copies/ml ) HIV-1 RNA plasma , even treat combination 2 reverse transcriptase inhibitor indinavir . Over time , patient experience rebound plasma HIV-1 RNA reason well understood . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 7/8/98 : Randomization 2 dose level may allow patient derive therapeutic benefit Preveon minimize adverse effect . ] Patients previously enrol clinical trial Preveon randomize 1 2 dos Preveon orally daily L-carnitine orally daily . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 7/8/98 : Patients must receive antiretroviral agent concomitantly Preveon ; least 1 antiretroviral agent must add Preveon previously administer patient.Patients previously enrol Preveon clinical trial `` roll '' expand access receive least 16 week Preveon receive open-label Preveon orally daily L-carnitine orally daily , take without food time day . ] All patient enrol expanded access randomize 1:1 fashion 1 2 dos take orally daily . Patients initially assign high dose Preveon dose reduce low dose Week 16 treatment . Patients initially assign low dose continue dose unless dose modification even low dose toxicity require . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 7/8/98 : Additional inform consent need reduction due limit efficacy low dosage treat HIV infection . ]</detailed_description>
