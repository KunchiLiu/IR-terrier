	<brief_title>Suramin Treating Patients With Refractory Relapsed Multiple Myeloma Castleman 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine tumor response patient refractory relapse multiple myeloma Castleman 's disease treat suramin . II . Determine effect regimen cytokine-mediated symptom patient Castleman 's disease . III . Determine overall progression-free survival patient multiple myeloma Castelman 's disease treat regimen . IV . Determine qualitative , quantitative , cumulative toxic effect regimen patient . V. Determine effect regimen level serum interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , soluble IL-6 receptor , soluble gp130 patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive suramin day 1-5 , 8 , 11 , 15 , 19 , 22 , 29 . During course 1 , patient also receive suramin day 36 , 43 , 50 , 57 , 64 , 71 , 78 . Suramin administer IV 2 hour day 1 course 1 1 hour subsequent infusion day . Patients undergo rest least 12 week course . Patients respond disease completion course 2 may receive additional course absence unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow weekly 1 month , every 2 week 1 month , 3 month , monthly thereafter indicate . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-40 patient multiple myeloma accrued study within 10-20 month . A total 20-40 patient Castleman 's disease accrue study within 2.9-8 year .</detailed_description>
