	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining one drug give drug different way may kill tumor cell . It yet know surgery effective without chemotherapy colon cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial evaluate whether perioperative 5-Fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) chemotherapy curative resection could improve overall survival disease-free survival patient Duke 's B3 C colon cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To determine adjuvant therapy one week continuous 5-FU give within 24 hour curative colon resection follow 6 month 5-FU/leucovorin effective prolong disease-free survival increase overall survival patient Dukes ' B3 C colon cancer , compare patient treat 5-FU/leucovorin . II . 1 . To determine week perioperative continuous 5-FU affect disease-free survival overall survival patient Dukes ' B2 colon cancer . OUTLINE : This open-label , randomized phase III study . Patients undergo curative colon resection via laparotomy . Patients randomize 1 2 arm 1:1 ratio . Arm I ( Perioperative 5-FU ) : Within 24 hour colon resection , patient receive perioperative 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) intravenously ( IV ) 24 hour 7 day . Arm II ( No perioperative 5-FU ) : Patients receive perioperative fluorouracil . After surgery , patient stage I , stage IIA , stage IV colon cancer immediately remove study . Patients stage IIB , IIC , III colon cancer re-registered within 35 day postoperatively . Beginning 21-35 day surgery , patient stage IIC III disease receive leucovorin calcium IV bolus immediately follow 5-FU IV bolus day 1-5 . Courses repeat every 28 day total 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stage IIB disease receive adjuvant 5-FU leucovorin calcium . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually 15 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 800-2,000 patient ( least 400 per treatment arm ) accrue study 2-3 year .</detailed_description>
