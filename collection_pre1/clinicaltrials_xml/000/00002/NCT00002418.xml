	<brief_summary>The purpose study see safe effective give new anti-HIV drug combination HIV-infected patient never take nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTIs ) fail respond protease inhibitor ( PIs ) . The drug combination contain didanosine ( ddI ) plus stavudine ( d4T ) plus nevirapine ( NVP ) plus MKC-442 . Hydroxyurea ( HU ) may add .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Safety Effectiveness Didanosine Plus Stavudine Plus Nevirapine Combined With MKC-442 HIV-Infected Patients Who Have Not Had Success With Protease Inhibitors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive regimen didanosine , stavudine , nevirapine , MKC-442 24 week . Throughout study , patient evaluate change baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA level lymphocyte subset development adverse event toxicity . Patients experience virologic failure option add hydroxyurea treatment regimen discontinue study . After Week 24 , patient document virologic response may continue treatment didanosine , stavudine , nevirapine , MKC-442 , , applicable , hydroxyurea change virologic status occur ( i.e. , patient experience virologic failure ) .
