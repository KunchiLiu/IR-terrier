	<brief_summary>Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness surgery without combination chemotherapy treat patient stage I non-small cell lung cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining one drug may kill tumor cell . It yet know whether surgery effective without chemotherapy non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgery With Without Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Stage I Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine adjuvant chemotherapy favorably alter prognosis subgroup resect stage I patient , follow complete surgical resection disease , define `` high risk '' base presence T2N0 tumor ( accord criterion International Staging System lung cancer ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I To compare failure-free survival patient T2N0 stage I NSCLC treat adjuvant chemotherapy . II . To determine toxicity associate adjuvant chemotherapy . III . To describe pattern disease recurrence . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord tumor histology ( squamous cell vs nonsquamous cell ) , degree differentiation ( poorly differentiate v ) , mediastinal node sample surgery ( yes v ) . Within 4-8 week surgery , patient randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive therapy . Arm II : Patients receive adjuvant therapy comprise paclitaxel IV 3 hour follow carboplatin IV 1-2 hour day 1 . Treatment continue every 3 week 4 course . Patients follow every 4 month 2 year every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
