	<brief_title>SWOG-9430 : Surgery Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Assess overall progression-free survival patient metastatic melanoma ( beyond drain lymph node ) complete surgical resection know disease . - Determine ability Southwest Oncology Group Melanoma Committee enroll patient metastatic melanoma resect disease-free state . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . All patient undergo gross total resection know disease . Patients whose disease completely resect disease recurrence surgery remove study . Patients find microscopic residual disease surgery consider completely resect . Resected tissue submit analysis protocol SWOG-9431 . Patients may receive adjuvant therapy ( e.g. , radiotherapy , interferon , and/or vaccine ) deem clinically appropriate treat physician . Patients follow periodically 5 year study entry . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 100 eligible patient completely surgically resected disease accrue study .</detailed_description>
