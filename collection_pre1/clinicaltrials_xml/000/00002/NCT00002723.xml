	<brief_title>Low , Intermediate , High Dose Suramin Treating Patients With Hormone-Refractory Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare response patient advance hormone-refractory adenocarcinoma prostate treat low- vs intermediate- v high-dose suramin . II . Compare toxic effect regimens patient . III . Compare overall failure-free survival patient treat regimen . IV . Compare duration complete partial response patient treat regimen . V. Determine population pharmacokinetics regimens correlate parameter toxicity regimens response rate patient . VI . Compare quality life patient treat regimen . VII . Determine relationship absolute relative decrease PSA rate PSA decrease likelihood duration response patient treat regimen . VIII . Determine whether change fibroblast growth factor level patient treat suramin associate pharmacokinetics suramin likelihood clinical response patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord disease site ( bone v soft tissue ) , CALGB/Zubrod performance status ( 0 1 v 2 ) , number prior hormonal therapy ( 1 2 v 3 ) , participate center . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive low-dose suramin IV 1 hour day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 29 , 30 , 36 , 37 , 57 , 58 , 64 , 65 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Arm II : Patients receive intermediate-dose suramin arm I . Arm III : Patients receive high-dose suramin arm I . Patients new progression partial complete response may receive additional course , discretion study chairperson , begin least 12 week completion first course continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess . Patients follow every 4 week disease progression periodically new primary cancer ( ) survival .</detailed_description>
