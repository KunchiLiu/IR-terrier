	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate safety immunization HLA class I-matched allogeneic human prostate carcinoma cell genetically engineer secrete interleukin-2 interferon gamma patient prostate carcinoma . II . Evaluate antitumor effect treatment assess post-therapy decline PSA . III . Evaluate induction cellular humoral immunity vivo treatment . OUTLINE : Tumor Cell Vaccine Therapy . Immunization irradiate , MHC class I-matched allogeneic human prostate carcinoma cell , LNCaP cell , engineer secrete approximately 58 ng/24 hr/million cell interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) approximately 0.72 U/24 hr/million cell interferon gamma ( IFN-G ) . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Up 12 patient enter Phase I study ; accrual continue total 25 patient treat MTD ( Phase II ) . Accrual expect require 2 year .</detailed_description>
