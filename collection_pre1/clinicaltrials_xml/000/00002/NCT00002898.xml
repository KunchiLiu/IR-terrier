	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining one chemotherapy drug surgery and/or radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study surgery follow different regimen combination chemotherapy give together radiation therapy and/or additional surgery compare well work treat patient soft tissue sarcoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Assess whether good survival rate maintain patient stage I ( pathologic T1 ) soft tissue sarcoma ( STS ) treat limited chemotherapy complete surgical resection , whether disease-free survival improve improving precision pretreatment stag assessment completeness resection . - Compare survival patient high-risk nonmetastatic STS treat alternate regimen carboplatin , epirubicin , vincristine ( CEV ) ifosfamide , vincristine , etoposide ( IVE ) v continuation ifosfamide , vincristine , dactinomycin ( IVA ) initial therapy IVA . - Assess whether improved outcome see patient stage III ( node positive ) STS earlier protocol ( SIOP-MMT-89 ) maintain 3 course alternate CEV/IVE without alter local therapy . - Compare outcome patient nonmetastatic STS stage IV STS register protocol refer treatment European Intergroup Stage IV Study . - Assess survival risk late sequela patient non-rhabdomyosarcoma malignant mesenchymal tumor treat protocol . - Evaluate role neoadjuvant chemotherapy , new prognostic factor ( e.g. , ploidy , histologic grading ) , recommendation management fibrosarcoma infant fibromatoses . - Assess ifosfamide nephrotoxicity base total dose administer long-term toxicity base potential predictive value early evidence nephrotoxicity . OUTLINE : This randomize study patient high-risk , nonmetastatic sarcoma , except follow characteristic : age le 6 month , stage I/II non-alveolar orbital tumor , stage III disease , age le 3 year parameningeal disease . Patients stratify accord disease type ( rhabdomyosarcoma ( RMS ) vs non-RMS disease ) , parameningeal site disease , participate center . Patients RMS randomize alveolar histology . Randomization occur first course chemotherapy . All patient , regardless disease stage , register study outcome follow , although patient metastatic RMS non-RMS malignant mesenchymal tumor refer treatment SIOP-MMT-98 study . Patients diagnose 8 week prior entry unavailable follow-up treat study . Doses modify patient 1 year age 10 kg body weight . All patient assign therapy base risk group . After surgery , patient complete resection proven possible chemosensitive histology proceed chemotherapy low-risk regimen . Patients questionable completeness resection proceed chemotherapy standard-risk high-risk tumor , appropriate . Regardless resection result , patient underwent scrotal surgery paratesticular tumor proceed chemotherapy standard-risk tumor . Alveolar RMS consider high risk . LOW-RISK TUMORS ( T1 N0 M0 ) : Strategy 951 - Tumors must resectable without extensive , mutilate surgery , resection margin must microscopically negative site . Patients positive margin may undergo re-excision . - Vincristine administer weekly 4 week dactinomycin give day first fourth dos vincristine . The course repeat 3-week rest . STANDARD-RISK TUMORS ( T1-2 N0 M0 ) : Strategy 952 - After resection , patient incompletely resect T1 tumor , completely resect T1 tumor extend beyond tissue organ origin , completely incompletely resect T2 tumor favorable site ( vagina , uterus , paratesticular region ) receive chemotherapy regimen . - Ifosfamide , vincristine , dactinomycin ( IVA ) start within 8 week surgery administer every 3 week 3 course ; course , vincristine administer weekly throughout 6 week . Response assess week 8 . - Patients least 50 % response week 8 receive 3 course IVA reassess week 17 ; complete response ( CR ) discontinue treatment , less CR begin local therapy ( describe ) week 18 concurrently 3 course IVA ( unless response see week 8 ) . - Patients less 50 % response week 8 receive carboplatin , epirubicin , vincristine ( CEV ) week 9 , 15 , 21 ifosfamide , vincristine , etoposide ( IVE ) week 12 , 18 , 24 . Patients less CR week 17 receive concurrent local therapy begin week 18 . HIGH-RISK TUMORS : Strategy 953 - Patients high-risk tumor surgery randomize IVA strategy 952 ( Arm I ) 3 week IVA ( 1 course ) Strategy 952 follow CEV IVE Strategy 952 ( Arm II ) . Response assess week 8 . Patients parameningeal disease least 3 year age proceed radiotherapy week 9 , regardless response . - Patients Arm I least 50 % response week 8 receive 3 course IVA reassess week 17 ; continue respond week 8 17 receive 3 additional course IVA . Patients response receive 4 alternating course CEV IVE . All patient le CR week 17 begin local therapy week 18 concurrently additional chemotherapy . Patients Arm I less 50 % response week 8 receive alternate CEV IVE Strategy 952 . Patients less CR week 17 begin concurrent local therapy week 18 . - Patients Arm II least 50 % response week 8 continue treatment 2 course sequential IVA , CEV , IVE . Local therapy concurrently administer , begin week 18 , patient achieve CR week 17 . Patients Arm II less 50 % response week 8 proceed immediately local therapy additional chemotherapy investigator 's discretion . Patients less CR local therapy consider treatment phase II protocol . LOCAL THERAPY - Local therapy consist conservative resection residual disease ( unless debilitate surgery appropriate ) . Patients residual disease surgery undergo external-beam radiotherapy 5 day per week 6-7 week brachytherapy ; hyperfractionation specifically exclude . For patient receive radiotherapy , dactinomycin dose IVA regimen omit middle course chemotherapy possibly last course chemotherapy concurrent administration . Patients receive alternate CEV IVE course reverse concurrent radiotherapy , possible omission epirubicin third course . - Radical surgery consider patient residual disease week 27 . TREATMENT FOR RELAPSE - Patients treat Strategy 951 proceed therapy least 6 alternate course IVE CEV , local therapy initiate second course . Other patient receive least 6 alternate course CEV vincristine , carboplatin , etoposide ( modify Vincaepi ) , local therapy initiate second course . Patients already receive either regimen may re-treated carboplatin etoposide vincristine cyclophosphamide relapse occur 6 month treatment , relapse le 6 month consider phase II chemotherapy trial . Patients metastatic relapse evaluate bone marrow peripheral blood stem cell transplantation . Patients follow every 2 month 2 year diagnosis , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually 10 year diagnosis . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 400 patient high-risk nonmetastatic disease accrue study within approximately 4 year .</detailed_description>
