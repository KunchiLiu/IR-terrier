	<brief_title>Aminocamptothecin Treating Patients With Recurrent Unresectable Epithelial Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective response rate patient advance , recurrent , inoperable ovarian epithelial cancer treat aminocamptothecin second-line therapy . II . Determine toxic effect regimen patient . III . Correlate topoisomerase-I level response patient accessible tumor treat regimen . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord disease ( measurable v nonmeasurable ) . ( The measurable disease stratum close accrual effective 08/1998 . ) Patients receive aminocamptothecin IV continuously day 1-3 . Courses repeat every 2 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 4 additional course past CR . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 60 patient ( 30 per stratum ) accrue study within approximately 15 month . ( The measurable disease stratum close accrual effective 08/1998 . )</detailed_description>
