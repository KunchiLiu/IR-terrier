	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Cryosurgery kill cancer cell freeze . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining cryosurgery chemotherapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase I trial study effectiveness cryosurgery without chemotherapy treat patient soft tissue sarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cryosurgery Treating Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I. Assess safety morbidity associate cryosurgical ablation patient soft tissue sarcoma extremity . OUTLINE : All patient undergo 1 session cryoablation . Patients high-grade sarcoma receive systemic chemotherapy 10-14 day cryoablation discretion consult medical oncologist , undergo surgery 2-3 week follow chemotherapy . Patients low-grade sarcoma high-grade sarcoma receive chemotherapy undergo surgery 4-6 week cryoablation . Surgery patient consist en bloc resection amputation , limb salvage attempt feasible . Patients follow weekly 3 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 12 patient ( approximately 6 patient low-grade , high-risk sarcoma 6 high-grade sarcoma ) enter approximately 6 month . The study suspend following : vascular complication require surgical intervention correction 2 patient ; neuropraxia show evidence resolution 3 month 2 patient ; wound complication require surgical correction 4 patient ; deep wound infection require surgical drainage 4 patient .</detailed_description>
