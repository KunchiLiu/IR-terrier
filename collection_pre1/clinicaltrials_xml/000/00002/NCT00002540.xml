	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether screen digital rectal examination ( DRE ) plus serum prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) reduce mortality prostate cancer men age 55-74 entry . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess screen variable , mortality , intervention include sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value . II . To assess incidence , stage , survival cancer case . III . To investigate mortality predictive value biologic and/or prognostic characterization tumor tissue intermediate endpoint . IV . To conduct biomolecular genetic research factor associate cancer carcinogenesis promotion , well early detection factor . OUTLINE : Participants overall PLCO study stratify screen center , gender , age ( 55-59 v 60-64 vs 65-69 v 70-74 ) . Participants randomize 1 2 arm ( control v screen ) . ARM I ( Control ) : Participants receive standard medical care . Participants complete Diet History Questionnaire ( DHQ ) baseline . ARM II ( Prostate Screening ) : Participants undergo blood sample collection PSA analysis baseline annually 5 year . Serum use study store NCI biorepository . Participants also undergo DRE baseline annually 3 year . A schedule tracking procedure implement ensure regular attendance repeat screen participant screen negative designate suspicious positive screening subsequent diagnostic procedure reveal prostate cancer ( follow-up diagnostic procedure medical care environment ) . Participants diagnosed prostate cancer via screen test refer treatment accordance current accepted practice appropriate stage disease , patient age , medical condition ; procedure provide contact qualified medical personnel insure appropriate therapy . Participants complete Dietary Questionnaire ( DQX ) baseline DHQ year 3 . An Annual Study Update ( ADU ) ( previously refer Periodic Survey Health [ PSH ] questionnaire ) mail participant annually 13 year identify prevalent incident prostate cancer death occur among screen control subject trial . After completion screening , participant follow least 13 year .</detailed_description>
