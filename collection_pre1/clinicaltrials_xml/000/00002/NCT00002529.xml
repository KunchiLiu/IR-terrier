	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Estrogen stimulate growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy may fight breast cancer block uptake estrogen . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining chemotherapy hormone therapy may kill tumor cell . It yet know treatment regimen effective breast cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness hormone therapy combination chemotherapy hormone therapy alone treat perimenopausal postmenopausal woman stage II stage IIIA breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hormone Therapy Chemotherapy Treating Perimenopausal Postmenopausal Women With Node-Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare overall survival local systemic disease-free survival produce adjuvant chemoendocrine therapy 4 course anthracycline/cyclophosphamide concurrent vs. sequential tamoxifen ( TMX ) toremifene ( TOR ) peri- postmenopausal woman node-positive breast cancer consider suitable endocrine therapy alone . II . Evaluate endpoints patient randomized chemoendocrine therapy vs. endocrine therapy alone . III . Evaluate endpoints patient randomize TMX vs. TOR endocrine therapy agent . IV . Compare quality life patient treat regimen . V. Compare toxic effect regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize study . Patients stratify type primary therapy participate institution . Therapy must begin within 6 week surgery . Patients first group receive doxorubicin ( epirubicin ) cyclophosphamide every 28 day total 4 cycle oral tamoxifen daily 5 year , begin day 1 chemotherapy . Patients second group receive chemotherapy oral tamoxifen initiate day 8 fourth chemotherapy cycle continue 5 year . Patients third group receive oral tamoxifen daily 5 year . Patients fourth group treat first group , tamoxifen replace toremifene . Patients fifth group treat second group , tamoxifen replace toremifene . Patients sixth group receive oral toremifene daily 5 year . The timing optional radiotherapy patient less total mastectomy group base institutional policy ; radiotherapy administer 5-6 week remain breast tissue , chest wall , lung . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year , yearly thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : 1,140 patient accrue approximately 9 year , 1 additional year follow-up .</detailed_description>
