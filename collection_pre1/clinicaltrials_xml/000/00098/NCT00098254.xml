	<brief_summary>This study investigate effect side effect BAY 43-9006 patient advance , recurrent , refractory non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . BAY 43-9006 one new class anticancer agent know bi-aryl urea . Patients 18 year age old NSCLC recur progress one regimen chemotherapy may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination ; blood test ; tumor biopsy ( see ) ; chest x-ray ; electrocardiogram ; image study , include positron emission tomography-computed tomography ( PET-CT , see ) dynamic , contrast-enhanced MRI ( DCE-MRI , see ) . Participants take BAY 43-9006 mouth twice day , morning evening . On first 15th day treatment , patient admit hospital pharmacokinetic study ; , test body handle drug . For test , blood collect interval ( 15 minute , 30 minute , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 24 hour ingestion ) determine drug 's level bloodstream . Treatment BAY 43-9006 continue study doctor determine medication beneficial patient wish withdraw study . In addition drug therapy , patient undergo follow test procedure : - Physical examination every 4 week - Blood pressure check week first 4 week - Blood test every week - CT scan image test , ultrasound MRI , every 8 week evaluate tumor 's response treatment . CT x-ray test provide detailed picture inside body . It do different angle , provide 3-dimensional picture part body study allow doctor see location , nature , extent disease . MRI use powerful magnet radio wave instead x-ray produce accurate , detailed picture organ tissue . - PET-CT approximately every 8 week look different part body take use glucose ( sugar nutrient ) . Because rapidly grow cell , tumor , use sugar normal cell , test use detect cancer . For test , patient give injection sugar solution radioactive tracer attach sugar molecule . A special camera detect radiation emit solution , result image show much sugar use various part body . PET-CT us PET scan combination standard CT machine test . - DCE-MRI 2 week treatment . This test use MRI special non-radioactive dye examine blood flow certain part body . - Tumor biopsy ( optional ) 2 week treatment . A biopsy surgical removal small piece tissue . The tumor biopsy do either use small bore needle CT guidance direct visualization use laparoscope/thoracoscope . For needle biopsy , needle insert skin guide CT tumor mass . For laparoscopy/thoracoscopy , patient sedate asleep small light tube insert small hole make skin . The tumor locate tissue withdrawn .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite advance systemic chemotherapy , patient stage IV NSCLC die disease . The median survival patient 8-16 month , one year-survival rate 33 % . Chemotherapy mainstay treatment advance disease . Based available data randomize trial , current treatment recommendation treat one several effective cisplatin-doublets result median survival 16 18 month . Second line chemotherapy able improve outcome patient prior cisplatin therapy . Although important milestone represent improvement care patient metastatic NSCLC , outcome able improve substitute one active drug another platinum-based doublet , treat patient four cycle chemotherapy use cisplatin-based triplet . It clear improve outcome NSCLC patient , need develop drug novel mechanism action perhaps inhibit major cellular signal pathway affect survival , proliferation angiogenesis . One new compound , BAY 43-9006 , design inhibit Raf also know inhibit kinase include VEGFR2 , VEGFR3 , PDGFR-beta , Flt3 , c-KIT , p38 ( 1 ) . BAY 43-9006 show vitro activity NSCLC cell line NCI-H460 A549 tumor growth inhibition 27 % 68 % . In addition , BAY 43-9006 show activity H460 NSCLC xenograft model . In NSCLC , proliferation signal Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway increase due frequent ( 30 % ) presence K-ras mutation tumor . Mutations K-ras associate malignant transformation normal epithelium constitutive activation p21 downstream effect cellular proliferation inhibition apoptosis . Clinical observation show tumor K-ras mutation tend small poorly differentiate , associate significantly bad three-year mortality rate . As mentioned , pathways significant malignant potential NSCLC , particularly involved angiogenesis , may also affect BAY 43-9006 . The vitro vivo data support clinical investigation BAY 43-9006 inhibitor Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK downstream proliferation effect . The goal phase II trial determinate BAY 43-9006 active NSCLC , measure BAY 43-9006 biological effect Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway . To achieve goal , patient relapse recurrent NSCLC give BAY 43-9006 ( four week cycle 400mg PO BID ) . A series correlative study do treatment measure biological clinical effect BAY 43-9006 . These study include analysis tissue blood sample well correlative image study .</detailed_description>
