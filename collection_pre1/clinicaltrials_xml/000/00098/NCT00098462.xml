	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Gefitinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , sirolimus , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Sometimes chemotherapy give , stop growth tumor cell . The tumor say resistant chemotherapy . Giving gefitinib together sirolimus may reduce drug resistance allow tumor cell kill . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose sirolimus give gefitinib see well work treat patient recurrent refractory stage IIIB stage IV non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gefitinib Sirolimus Treating Patients With Recurrent Refractory Stage IIIB Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine maximum tolerate dose sirolimus combine gefitinib patient recurrent refractory stage IIIB IV non-small cell lung cancer . Secondary - Determine overall response rate ( complete response [ CR ] partial response [ PR ] ) patient treat regimen . - Determine disease control rate ( CR , PR , stable disease ) patient treat regimen . - Determine time progression overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This open-label , phase I , dose-escalation study sirolimus follow phase II study . - Phase I : Patients receive oral gefitinib daily oral sirolimus daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos sirolimus maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . - Phase II : Patients receive gefitinib sirolimus phase I MTD . Quality life assess baseline , day 1 course , 1 month post-progression . Patients follow every 9 week . Patients withdraw study treatment without evidence disease progression follow every 6 week disease progression . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 25 patient ( 11 phase I 14 phase II ) accrue study within 8.3 month .</detailed_description>
