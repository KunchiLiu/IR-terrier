	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well romidepsin work treat patient recurrent and/or metastatic thyroid cancer respond radioactive iodine . Romidepsin may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It may also help radioactive iodine chemotherapy work well make tumor cell sensitive drug</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Romidepsin Treating Patients With Recurrent and/or Metastatic Thyroid Cancer That Has Not Responded Radioactive Iodine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine antitumor activity romidepsin ( depsipeptide ) , term proportion patient achieve complete partial response disease stabilization , patient progressive recurrent and/or metastatic non-medullary thyroid carcinoma refractory radioactive iodine ( RAI ) . II . Determine safety tolerability drug patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Document change RAI uptake compare pre- post-treatment RAI scan patient treated drug . II . Evaluate change expression Na+/I- symporter ( NIS ) tumor , measure immunohistochemistry pre- post-treatment biopsy specimen ; real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) NIS mRNA pre- post-treatment change biopsy specimen . III . Determine post-treatment change serum thyroglobulin patient treat drug . IV . Correlate change post-treatment positron-emission tomography scan whole-body RAI scan patient treated drug . OUTLINE : Patients receive romidepsin IV 4 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression .</detailed_description>
