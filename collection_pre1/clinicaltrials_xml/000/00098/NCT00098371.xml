	<brief_title>Flavopiridol Treating Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Prolymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine complete response ( CR ) overall response rate ( CR + Partial Response [ PR ] ) regimen . II . To assess toxicity profile regimen . III . To examine response duration , progression-free survival overall survival , follow treatment . IV . To assess pharmacokinetics novel schedule administration . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine influence adverse prognostic factor include interphase cytogenetics , VH mutational status , ZAP-70 expression , CD38 , p53 mutational status response flavopiridol treatment . II . To determine influence flavopiridol treatment serial measurement mcl-1 ( mRNA protein ) , HIF-1 ( mRNA protein ) , NF-kappaB activity , IkappaB , IkappaB phosphorylation , GSK-beta , IL-6 down-stream target . III . To assess relationship drug induce apoptosis mitochondrial perturbation Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) cell vitro subsequent relationship clinical response tumor lysis vivo . IV . To examine cytokine level ( IL-6 , IFN-gamma , TNF-alpha ) treatment flavopiridol . V. To assess pharmacokinetics ( PK ) determine variability PK PD analyse treatment administration correlation specific Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms ( SNPs ) potentially involved flavopiridol disposition . VI . To assess difference diagnosis relapse sample investigate mechanism acquire flavopiridol resistance primary CLL cell . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive flavopiridol IV 30 minute follow 4-hour infusion day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 42 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve least partial remission ( PR ) whose PR last &gt; 6 month completion treatment may receive 6 additional course flavopiridol.Patients follow 2 month every 3 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
