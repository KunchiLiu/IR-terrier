	<brief_summary>This study examine test healthy volunteer patient pulmonary hypertension try learn disease find good way detect , treat , , possible , slow progression . Pulmonary hypertension rare blood vessel disorder lung pressure pulmonary artery ( blood vessel lead heart lung ) rise normal level may become life-threatening . Normal volunteer patient pulmonary hypertension 18 year age old may eligible study . All candidate screen review medical record . Normal volunteer also medical history , electrocardiogram , echocardiogram ( heart ultrasound ) , pulmonary function test , subject breathes tube measure lung volume , mechanic function . All participant undergo follow test procedure : - Echocardiogram measure heart function blood pressure lung . A small probe hold chest us sound wave obtain picture heart . - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) evaluate heart 's pump action . Subjects lie stretcher slide long , tube-shaped scanner . The machine use magnetic field radio wave obtain image heart . - 6-minute walk measure far subject walk 6 minute . Subjects walk around hospital 6 minute comfortable pace . - Exercise test measure ability exercise subject 's oxygen level exercise . Subjects exercise bike treadmill oxygen carbon dioxide breathe measure use small device place mouth . - Right heart catheterization measure pressure heart lung . A small catheter ( plastic tube ) place arm vein . A longer catheter call central line place deep vein neck neck , leg arm . A long , thin catheter measure blood pressure directly insert vein advance chamber heart lung artery measure pressure heart obtain blood sample . - Genetic protein study . DNA , RNA , proteins blood sample study gene protein might predict development progression pulmonary hypertension . In addition , patient whose pulmonary hypertension cause blood vessel injury undergo test describe . The right heart catheter insert catheterization procedure remain place obtain measurement effect nitric oxide nitrite following procedure : - Inhalation nitric oxide ( gas naturally produce cell line artery ) 30-minute interval examine effect lung heart pressure . - Inhalation aerosolize nitrite 5-minute interval measure effect lung heart pressure . - Inhalation nitric oxide 24 hour obtain multiple measurement effect lung heart pressure . - Blood draws laboratory test . In patient whose pulmonary hypertension cause blood vessel injury , also plan follow response standard therapy .

	<brief_title>Endothelial Cell Dysfunction Pulmonary Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Primary pulmonary hypertension , know idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension ( IPAH ) , subgroup pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) , rare disorder characterize severe morbidity high mortality rate . There routine screening test validate marker disease activity IPAH , broad group PAH . Therefore , patient usually present advanced stage disease . The pathogenesis IPAH form PAH remain unclear . Prior theory stress `` one-hit '' hypothesis . Current thinking focus `` two-hit '' hypothesis : 1 ) genetic susceptibility , 2 ) trigger stimulus initiate pulmonary vascular injury , result endothelial cell ( EC ) dysfunction mobilization endothelial progenitor cell ( EPC ) . Loss function mutation bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 ( BMPR2 ) gene , implicate pathogenesis IPAH . EC dysfunction IPAH associate decrease endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) expression nitric oxide ( NO ) production . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) interact alter endothelial cell surface , may also important disease process . Objectives : We plan define subset differentially regulate biomarkers IPAH PAH may lead early diagnosis well method measure response therapy . Specifically , hope identify biomarkers IPAH form PAH suggestive NO therapeutic response may useful titrate NO therapy . We also hope identify novel target development new therapeutic strategy . Methods : This study consist pilot study primary study . The pilot study enroll 30 patient 30 control order obtain complete study 10 normal subject 10 patient PAH . The goal pilot study determine best technique circulate endothelial cell ( CEC ) PBMC identification , quantification , isolation EPC identification quantification . The subject pilot phase undergo right heart catheterization obtain hemodynamics pulmonary artery blood . Pulmonary artery peripheral blood use EPC quantification CEC PBMC isolation . CECs PBMCs study depth use high density oligonucleotide microarrays . In addition , plasma obtain PAH patient healthy volunteer apply vitro various cell population suspect central disease pathogenesis include limited ECs , circulate mononuclear cell , cardiac myocytes and/or vascular smooth muscle cell . Phenotypic alteration induce plasma exposure assess use vitro assay . The primary study recruit follow subject group : 1 ) patient IPAH form PAH ( vascular injury-induced pulmonary hypertension ) currently therapy , less equal 6 month IV therapy , less equal one year oral therapy , 2 ) patient pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) ascribe nonvascular injury process 3 ) normal individual . The following baseline study perform group : 1 ) noninvasive assessment right ventricular ( RV ) function echocardiogram magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , 2 ) determination exercise capacity cardiopulmonary stress test six minute walk , 3 ) measurement hemodynamic parameter right heart catheterization 4 ) characterization disease phenotype cell surface marker , oligonucleotide microarrays , proteomics use peripheral pulmonary arterial blood . EPCs quantitated CECs PBMCs isolate analyzed flow cytometry expression cell surface marker involve coagulation , adhesion , angiogenesis , important process IPAH PAH . Furthermore , ECs ( identify positive negative selection isolate cell sort ) PBMCs study depth use high density oligonucleotide microarrays fully characterize transcriptome . A major impediment widespread use chronic home base inhaled NO related delivery system duration effect . In PAH patient plan study novel NO delivery system ( INO pulse delivery device ) . Patients PAH give inhale NO ( 20 40 ppm ) place inhaled NO use INO pulse delivery device 24 hour . Hemodynamics obtain serially dose upon completion 24 hour therapy , pulmonary artery peripheral blood drawn reexamine flow cytometry , microarrays , proteomics . We also plan follow response standard therapy ( determined refer physician ) . After initial day 0 study , restudy parameter ( exclude NO study ) patient PAH approximately 4 month , yearly 5 year therapeutic intervention .</detailed_description>
