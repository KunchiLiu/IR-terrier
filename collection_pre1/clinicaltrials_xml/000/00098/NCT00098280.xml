	<brief_summary>This study examine safety effectiveness experimental drug eculizumab treat patient paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ( PNH ) , rare disorder red blood cell lead premature destruction cell result anemia . Patients may high risk blood clot may develop bone marrow failure aplastic anemia , low white blood cell platelet count . Eculizumab monoclonal antibody may help improve survival red blood cell . Patients 18 year age old PNH require blood transfusion anemia receive least four transfusion 12 month precede evaluation study may eligible enroll . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , check vital sign . Participants electrocardiogram ( EKG ) blood urine test , vaccinate Neisseria meningitides , common bacteria cause disable fatal type meningitis . They enter observation phase study , monthly visit complete questionnaire ; update health status , transfusion record , medication use ; vital sign check PNH symptom evaluate ; blood urine test ; receive transfusion , necessary . These visit continue 3 month patient receive `` qualify '' transfusion ; , transfusion give consequence certain hemoglobin level symptom different level without symptom . Patients randomly assign receive either eculizumab placebo ( salt solution active ingredient ) . Both study medication give intravenously ( vein ) 30 minute week five dos every 2 week another 11 dos . At treatment visit ( study week 0-24 ) , patient update health status , transfusion record , medication use ; vital sign check ; provide blood sample . At various visit , also complete questionnaire , provide urine sample EKG . At last treatment visit ( week 26 final visit patient end participation visit 18 ) patient complete physical examination addition procedure list .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Eculizumab Treat Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ( PNH ) acquire clonal disorder hematopoietic stem cell characterize intravascular hemolysis , hemoglobinuria , anemia , thrombosis . The clinical feature PNH result lack one GPI-linked protein serve protect cell autologous complement mediate attack . Two protein , CD55 ( decay accelerate factor ) CD59 ( reactive lysis inhibitor ) show absent PNH erythrocytes platelet well cell type . Evidence strongly suggest lack terminal complement inhibitor CD59 responsible sensitivity PNH erythrocytes platelet effect autologous complement . Since pathogenesis PNH due inability PNH red cell platelet inhibit activation terminal complement , logical hypothesize terminal complement inhibitor could effectively stop intravascular hemolysis , obviate lessen need transfusion , possibly decrease propensity life threaten thrombosis . Eculizumab humanize monoclonal antibody like CD59 inhibit terminal complement . This study randomize , double-blind , placebo control , multi-center study eculizumab placebo administer intravenously approximately 75 PNH patient . The study design evaluate safety eculizumab transfusion dependent patient paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ( PNH ) determine administration terminal complement inhibitor could provide safe effective substitute CD59 function .</detailed_description>
