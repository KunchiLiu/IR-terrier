	<detailed_description>Interactions different bacteria play important role biofilm development primary colonization human tooth surface . Well study example interaction include receptor polysaccharide ( RPS ) -mediated interaction viridans group streptococci oral bacteria include type 2 fimbriated Actinomyces naeslundii . Previous study result identification different structural , antigenic molecular type RPS streptococci initiate colonization tooth surface . This information provide basis current protocol , address number important question involve nature commensal relationship exist biofilm-forming bacteria host . For example : ( 1 ) How many type RPS produce resident flora individual one time ? ( 2 ) Does resident population RPS-producing clone change lifetime host ? ( 3 ) Do individual produce secretory antibody bacterial RPS , , drive change antigenic type RPS produce ? ( 3 ) When infant acquire RPS-producing bacteria , tooth eruption ? To address question , wish collect analyze sample early dental plaque member individual family . The collection sample accomplish gently rub expose tooth surface sterile cotton swab . Adult volunteer also ask provide small sample saliva , assay presence specific anti-RPS antibody . The sampling procedure propose protocol present significant risk either adult infant volunteer . The information gain study , although directly beneficial individual , expect provide important insight commensal relationship exist biofilm-forming bacteria host . This turn contribute improve understanding variable associate maintenance oral health initiation disease .</detailed_description>
