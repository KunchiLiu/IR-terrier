	<brief_title>Imuran ( Azathioprine ) Dose-Ranging Study Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DESCRIPTION : Medical therapy Crohn 's disease variable success ameliorate cardinal symptom disease ( diarrhea , abdominal pain ) , treat extraintestinal manifestation ( fatigue , anorexia , fever , weight loss , arthralgia , skin , eye , liver kidney manifestation ) , prevent complication ( stricture , fistula , abscess ) . Currently , therapy often implement stepwise fashion , progress anti-inflammatory medication ( sulfasalazine , mesalamine ) , antibiotic ( metronidazole , ciprofloxacin ) , corticosteroid , immunomodulatory immunosuppressive medication , include thioguanine compound ( 6 mercaptopurine prodrug azathioprine ) , methotrexate , finally , infliximab ( anti-tumor necrosis factor ) . A common approach gradual addition potent medication agent believe safe , may also less effective . Despite current approach medical therapy Crohn 's disease , substantial number patients—from 20 40 % —require surgery within 3 year diagnosis , exclude require surgery time diagnosis . Nearly 80 % patient require surgery 20 year onset disease . Corticosteroids long mainstay therapy Crohn 's disease although side effect frequently observe short term long-term use . Potential side effect well-described , may include relatively minor problem insomnia acne , well serious adverse effect , include hypertension , narrow-angle glaucoma , depression , weight gain , adrenal suppression , Cushing 's syndrome , diminish bone mineral density , infection . Azathioprine often use treat patient steroid resistant dependent Crohn 's disease . Azathioprine use steroid sparing agent , treatment active , inflammatory disease , maintenance remission , therapy perforate disease ( fistula ) , specific extraintestinal manifestation . To date , however , randomize , control clinical study assess range dos azathioprine Crohn 's disease conduct . The optimal weight-based dose know . EXPECTED CONTRIBUTION : This study identify optimal weight base dose azathioprine treatment patient active Crohn 's disease require treatment corticosteroid . STUDY HYPOTHESIS : An optimal weight-based dose azathioprine induce maintain remission subject steroid-dependent Crohn 's disease . COMPARISON : Three different dos azathioprine compare study ( 0.5 , 2.5 , 3.5mg/kg/day ) . Subjects take study medication 9 month .</detailed_description>
