	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines make person 's tumor cell white blood cell may make body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose vaccine therapy treat patient undergo surgery stage IB , stage II , stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients Who Are Undergoing Surgery Stage IB , Stage II , Stage IIIA Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine maximum tolerate dose adjuvant autologous dendritic cell load irradiated autologous tumor cell patient stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer undergo resection . - Determine safety tolerability vaccine patient . Secondary - Determine feasibility vaccine patient . - Determine vaccine-specific antitumor immunity patient treated vaccine . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients undergo leukaphersis isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) . PBMC expand ex vivo generate monocyte-derived dendritic cell ( DC ) . Autologous tumor cell harvest purified time surgical resection . DC load irradiate autologous tumor cell . Within 4-8 week surgical resection , patient receive autologous DC load irradiate autologous tumor cell intradermally approximately day 1 , 30 , 60 absence unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 6-9 patient receive escalate dos vaccine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . If 2 9 patient first cohort experience dose-limiting toxicity , dose level consider MTD . Patients follow approximately 1 4 month , every 6 month 4 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 12-15 patient accrue study within 18 month .</detailed_description>
