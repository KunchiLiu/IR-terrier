	<brief_title>Lapatinib Treating Brain Metastases Patients With Stage IV Breast Cancer Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate objective response rate central nervous system ( CNS ) ( complete plus partial response ) , assessed standard MRI , oral GW572016 among patient progressive brain metastasis HER2-positive breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate site first failure ( CNS , extra-CNS , , death ) overall survival patient treat GW572016 brain metastasis . II . To evaluate overall objective response rate ( complete plus partial response ) time first progression site . III . To assess quality life ( QOL ) , neurologic QOL , cause death patient treat GW572016 brain metastasis . IV . To determine qualitative quantitative toxicity associate oral GW572016 , give dose 750 mg orally , twice daily . V. To evaluate sensitivity PET dedicate brain sequence detect brain metastasis breast cancer . VI . To explore relationship decline PET uptake 1 week decline PET uptake 8 week . VII . To characterize vessel pattern see MRI baseline , 8 week , 16 week treatment GW572016 . VIII . To describe change serum HER2 ECD time . IX . To describe baseline EGFR , HER2 , IGF-IR , degree HER2 gene amplification primary tumor block . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive oral lapatinib twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline 8 week . Patients follow every 2 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 12-37 patient accrue study within 0.5-1.5 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm invasive breast cancer , stage IV disease HER2 overexpressing breast cancer , define 3+ stain immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) , 2+ stain IHC conjunction HER2 gene amplification fluorescent situ hybridization ( FISH ) , HER2 gene amplification FISH alone ( patient whose tumor block assess IHC ) ; patient tumor 2+ IHC negative FISH assay ineligible At least one measurable lesion CNS , define lesion &gt; = 10 mm long dimension T1weighted , gadoliniumenhanced MRI One following : Cohort 1 : Prior treatment CNS metastases whole brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) and/or stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) , OR ; Cohort 2 : Asymptomatic CNS metastasis discover screen radiological study without prior WBRT SRS Disease progression CNS , assess least one follow : New neurological sign symptoms New lesion CNS image study Progressive lesion image study Note : patient progressive lesion require meet Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion progression order eligible study Prior treatment trastuzumab , either alone combination chemotherapy require ; trastuzumab discontinue least 2 week prior enrollment study ; note : patient document CNSonly metastasis require prior treatment trastuzumab ; situation , absence extraCNS disease must document physical examination , CT scan chest , abdomen , pelvis , bone scan At least 2 week since prior radiotherapy , last chemotherapy , immunotherapy , biologic therapy , hormonal therapy cancer , sufficiently recover stabilized side effect associate prior therapy ;
