	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give UCN-01 together topotecan work treat patient small cell lung cancer relapse progress previous chemotherapy . Drugs use chemotherapy , topotecan , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . UCN-01 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It may also increase effectiveness topotecan make tumor cell sensitive drug . Giving UCN-01 together topotecan may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine anti tumour activity UCN-01 combination topotecan patient SCLC relapse progress &gt; = 3 month complete first-line platinum-based chemotherapy ( patient sensitive disease ) use objective response rate ( complete partial ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine anti tumour activity UCN-01 combination topotecan regard stable disease rate , median overall survival rate well determine safety tolerability combination . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive topotecan IV 30 minute day 1-5 UCN-01 IV 3 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) receive 2 additional course beyond CR PR . Patients follow survival .</detailed_description>
