	<brief_summary>Retinoids analogue vitamin A regulate cellular differentiation , lead therapeutic use skin disease malignancy . In animal model kidney disease , retinoids restore podocyte phenotype toward normal reduce proteinuria . The objective phase II trial evaluate safety develop preliminary evidence efficacy retinoid treatment patient podocyte disease . The study open-label trial isotretinoin ( 13-cis retinoic acid ) . The study perform auspex IND FDA . We enroll 10 adult patient biopsy-proven minimal change disease ( MCD ) , focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS ) , collapse glomerulopathy ( CG ) . Inclusion criterion include prior trial immunosuppressive therapy proteinuria great equal 3.5 g/d angiotensin antagonist therapy . The duration trial 6 month possible additional 6-month extension patient develop partial response ( PR ) limit response ( LR ) . Those complete response ( CR ) continue treatment one additional month , 7 month total . Non-responders stop end 6 month . The primary clinical endpoint reduction proteinuria compare baseline value assess paired test . The secondary clinical endpoint fraction patient achieve ( CR ) ( PR ) 6 month one year , confirm urine collection four week apart . Retinoid therapy discontinue time CR confirm , one month first detection CR . Follow-up last one year cessation drug therapy . Patients CR PR , experience relapse great 3.5 g/d proteinuria follow-up eligible retinoid therapy . All Participants option undergo two research kidney biopsy : 1 ) baseline , unless renal biopsy do within 24 week enrollment 2 ) diagnosis CR increase proteinuria confirm alternatively upon complete 6 month therapy ( patient exit trial 6 month due non-renal adverse event undergo renal biopsy ) ; 3 ) one year therapy complete undergoing 6-month extension . Histologic endpoint include change linear extent podocyte foot process effacement , extent podocyte proliferation , expression podocyte gene RNA protein level . Laboratory endpoint include serum urine cytokine level urine level podocyte protein , include nephrin . Toxicity screen include serum urine chemistry , psychological profile , radiographic film cervical , thoracic spine calcaneus , bone mass assessment dual photon excitation absorptiometry ( DEXA ) spine hip .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients podocyte disease , MCD , FSGS ( include primary , secondary , adaptive variant ) , CG ( include HIVassociated variant ) , meet follow criterion : An adequate renal biopsy , define minimum 10 glomerulus light microscopy minimum 3 glomerulus electron microscopy , unless podocyte disease diagnostic few glomerulus . Patients nondiagnostic technically inadequate biopsy offer opportunity undergo research biopsy determine eligibility . For patient nondiagnostic technically inadequate biopsy , repeat renal biopsy may clinically indicate effort diagnose treat potentially serious kidney disease . Greater equal 16 year age . The rationale exclude young child retinoids may carry great toxicity child , report premature epiphyseal closure , development slender long bone , periostial thickening . Prior treatment least two immunosuppressive agent show induce remission MCD FSGS : glucocorticoid , cyclosporine , tacrolimus , cyclophosphamide , chlorambucil , mycophenolate mofetil . Therapy agent must last least 8 week . Exemptions make contraindication medication tolerate medication . The rationale recruit patient fail conventional therapy . All patient immunosuppression least 4 week start retiniods order avoid confound effect . Three first void urine protein/creatinine ratio &gt; 2 g/g obtain within one month prior enrol study . These urine collection obtain patient stable dose ACE inhibitor ARB least 4 week ( maximal antiproteinuric effect medication occur 4 week ) . The rationale patient nephroticrange proteinuria high risk progressive renal disease , justify participation clinical trial novel agent . Patients steroidsensitive frequently relapse MCD require used ACE inhibitor ARB , steroids alone typically sufficient therapy induce remission . If hypertensive : blood pressure less equal 140/90 stable dose ACE inhibitor ARB least 1 month great equal 75 percent measurement entry study . The rationale uncontrolled hypertension exacerbate proteinuria . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Pregnancy , breastfeeding , unwillingness use least two contraceptive method ( least one must primary , include tubal ligation , partner vasectomy , oral contraceptive , implanted contraceptive , intrauterine device ) . The rationale retinoids teratogenic excrete breast milk . Abnormal liver function test , include AST , ALT , total bilirubin , protime . The rationale retinoids hepatotoxic . The exception follow : cause abnormality LFTs felt due specific hepatotoxic drug statin level less 2 time upper limit normal AND normalize upon hold offend drug , patient may consider study participation consultation hepatology service . Hypertriglyceridemia great 500 mg/dL despite statin/fibrate therapy . The rationale retinoids increase lipid , particularly triglyceride lead pancreatitis . Any medical condition require concurrent immunosuppression , pilot study design evaluate effect retinoids monotherapy . Any medical condition require concurrent use tetracycline , minocycline , doxycycline , due enhance risk increase intracranial pressure . Hypersensitivity retinoids . Presence unstable cardiovascular disease , uncontrolled diabetes hemoglobin A1c great 8 percent , chronic inflammatory infectious condition except HIV1 infection . Retinoids associate chest pain unclear etiology , increase serum glucose , myelosuppression increase risk infection . The etiology infection clear may relate myelosuppression . Those HIV1 infection must evidence opportunistic infectious complication CD4 count great equal 200 . Both tretinoin isotretinoin safely study HIVinfected patient indication . GFR le 40 ml/min/1.73m ( 2 ) estimate 5variable MDRD equation , metabolities retinoids excrete part urine , concern increase toxicity . In participant le 18 year age , use Schwartz equation . Expansion glomerulus interstitial formation biopsy . Untreated depression , retinoids associate depression , suicidal ideation , aggressive behavior . If patient manifest significant depressive symptom , include study assess agree psychiatrist ( either NIH ) regular followup visit psychiatrist . Factors increase risk renal biopsy . These include following : unwillingness accept blood transfusion , bleed diathesis , single kidney , small kidney ( less 9.5 cm ) .</criteria>
