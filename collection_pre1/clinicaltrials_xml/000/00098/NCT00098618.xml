	<brief_summary>Sorafenib may stop growth tumor cell block enzyme need growth block blood flow tumor . Interferon alfa may interfere growth tumor cell slow growth kidney cancer . Sorafenib may help interferon alfa kill tumor cell make tumor cell sensitive drug . Giving sorafenib together interferon alfa may kill tumor cell . This phase II trial study well give sorafenib interferon alfa work treat patient locally advance metastatic kidney cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib Interferon Alfa Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine feasibility tolerability sorafenib interferon alfa patient locally advance metastatic renal cell carcinoma . II . Determine response rate ( complete response partial response ) patient treat regimen . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine progression-free survival response duration patient treat regimen . II . Correlate change laboratory parameter response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily interferon alfa subcutaneously three time week 8 week . Courses repeat every 8 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable respond disease follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually 1 year disease progression . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 40 patient accrue study within 10 month .</detailed_description>
