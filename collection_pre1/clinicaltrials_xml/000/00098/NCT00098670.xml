	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give fludarabine together rituximab follow alemtuzumab work treat patient chronic lymphocytic leukemia . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab alemtuzumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , fludarabine , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving fludarabine together rituximab follow alemtuzumab may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine rate complete response toxicity concurrent treatment fludarabine rituximab follow consolidative alemtuzumab patient previously untreated , symptomatic , CLL . II . To determine alemtuzumab improves CR rate acceptable toxicity administer consolidation therapy follow induction therapy fludarabine rituximab . III . To estimate progression-free overall survival high risk ( VH gene unmutated p53 dysfunction ) low-risk ( others ) patient follow therapy fludarabine rituximab induction consolidative alemtuzumab . IV . To determine frequency molecular ( PCR ) remission follow fludarabine rituximab induction therapy alemtuzumab consolidation therapy serve surrogate marker prolong progression-free overall survival . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect concurrent treatment fludarabine rituximab follow consolidative alemtuzumab recovery T-cells , NK cell , serum immunoglobulin level . II . To determine clinical molecular feature predict poor response fludarabine rituximab induction subsequent alemtuzumab consolidation therapy . III . To assess preliminarily molecular feature CLL relapse patient respond chemoimmunotherapy CLL . IV . To determine frequency patient remain high risk progression CLL despite therapy thus eligible nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation study CALGB 109901 . V. To perform limited rituximab pharmacokinetics determine ideal schedule administration subsequent rituximab maintenance treatment approach follow induction therapy fludarabine rituximab . OUTLINE : Patients receive induction therapy comprise rituximab IV 4 hour day 1 , 3 , 5 course 1 day 1 subsequent course fludarabine IV 30 minute day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression . Approximately 4 month completion induction therapy , patient achieve partial response , nodular partial response , stable disease receive consolidation therapy comprise alemtuzumab subcutaneously day 1-3 . Treatment repeat weekly 6 course absence disease progression . Patients follow 2 month , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 7 year study entry .</detailed_description>
