	<brief_title>Lapatinib Treating Patients With Recurrent and/or Metastatic Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine overall response rate patient recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma head neck treat lapatinib . II . Determine progression-free survival , time progression , overall survival patient treated drug . III . Determine toxicity drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients assign 1 2 cohort accord prior epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted therapy ( yes v ) . Patients receive oral lapatinib daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 2 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 40-88 patient ( 21-50 epidermal growth factor receptor [ EGFR ] inhibitor-naive patient [ cohort A ] 19-38 EGFR inhibitor-pre-treated patient [ cohort B ] ) accrue study within 4-12.6 month .</detailed_description>
