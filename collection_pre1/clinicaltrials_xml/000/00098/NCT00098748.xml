	<brief_summary>Maraviroc ( UK-427,857 ) , selective reversible CCR5 co-receptor antagonist , show active vitro wide range clinical isolates ( include resistant exist class ) . In HIV-1 infected patient United States , maraviroc ( UK-427,857 ) approve use part combination antiretroviral treatment treatment-experienced treatment-naive adult subject . At least 50 % treatment-experienced patient infected R5-tropic HIV-1 exclusively . However , even patient infect dual tropic ( R5 + X4 ) phenotype , large proportion virus population still use CCR5 exclusively . Thus , purpose study evaluate antiretroviral activity , safety , maraviroc ( UK-427,857 ) ( combination agent ) HIV infect , treatment experience patient fail current antiretroviral regimen infect R5-tropic virus exclusively . This study involve 200 center globally achieve total randomized subject population 192 subject . Patients randomly ( 1:1:1 ) assign one three group : Optimized Background Therapy [ OBT ( 3-6 drug base treatment history resistance test ) ] + maraviroc ( UK-427,857 ) 150 mg take daily , OBT + maraviroc ( UK-427,857 ) 150 mg take twice daily , OBT alone . Randomization stratify Enfuvirtide use OBT ( yes/no ) Screening HIV-1 RNA level ( viral load ) ( &lt; 100,000/â‰¥ 100 , 000 copy per milliliter [ copy per mL ] ) . The study enroll approximately 9 month period 48 week treatment . Physical examination perform study entry , week 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 32 , 40 48 . Blood sample also take study entry , week 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 32 , 40 , 48 . Additionally , blood sample draw twice , least 30 minute apart , week 2 24 maraviroc ( UK-427,857 ) pharmacokinetic analysis . As part clinical study blood sample also take non-anonymized pharmacogenetic analysis . Patients undergo 12-lead electrocardiogram study entry , week 24 48 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>( ) Subjects remain assigned therapy 48 week , unless subject discontinue early protocol-defined treatment failure reason adverse event , loss follow-up , withdrawal consent , death . ( ii ) If subject meet criterion treatment failure discontinue another reason ( eg , pregnancy , adverse event ) require alternative regimen , subject follow Week 48 visit accord protocol guideline . The new regimen , select Investigator base result resistance testing time failure , record CRF . ( iii ) Open-label maraviroc ( UK-427,857 ) provide sponsor , commercially available , subject complete 48 week therapy medically appropriate continue therapy maraviroc ( UK-427,857 ) .</detailed_description>
