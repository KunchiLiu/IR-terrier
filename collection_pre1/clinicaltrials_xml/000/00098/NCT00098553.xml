	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , everolimus , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Everolimus may also stop growth melanoma block blood flow tumor . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well everolimus work treat patient stage IV melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Everolimus Treating Patients With Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine median time disease progression patient stage IV malignant melanoma treat everolimus . Secondary - Determine median overall survival patient treated drug . - Determine clinical benefit rate ( i.e. , stable disease , partial remission , complete response rate ) patient treat drug . - Determine toxicity profile drug patient . - Determine change serum vascular endothelial growth factor level patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral everolimus daily 8 week . Courses repeat every 8 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 2 month disease progression every 4 month 5 year registration .</detailed_description>
