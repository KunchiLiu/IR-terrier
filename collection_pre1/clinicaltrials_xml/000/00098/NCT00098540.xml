	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well sorafenib work treat patient stage IIIB stage IV non-small cell lung cancer . Sorafenib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It may also stop growth non-small cell lung cancer block blood flow tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib Treating Patients With Stage IIIB Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response rate patient stage IIIB IV non-small cell lung cancer treat sorafenib . II . Determine clinical toxic effect drug patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine 24-week progression-free survival rate patient treat drug . II . Determine overall survival patient treated drug . III . Determine time disease progression patient treat drug . IV . Correlate predictive disease marker ( K-ras B-raf mutation ERK/pERK , AKT/pAKT , VEGFR2/p-VEGFR2 expression ) patient activity drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
