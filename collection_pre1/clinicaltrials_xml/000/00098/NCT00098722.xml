	<brief_summary>Maraviroc ( UK-427,857 ) , selective reversible CCR5 coreceptor antagonist , show active vitro wide range clinical isolates ( include resistant exist class ) . In HIV-1 infected patient , maraviroc ( UK-427,857 ) give monotherapy 10 day reduce HIV-1 viral load 1.6 log , consistent currently available agent . Safety toleration study 400 subject 28 day 300 mg twice daily . No significant effect see QTc interval . The purpose study evaluate antiretroviral activity maraviroc ( UK-427,857 ) HIV infect , treatment experience patient fail current antiretroviral regimen infect R5-tropic virus exclusively . This study involve 100 center Europe Australia achieve total randomized subject population 500 subject . Patients randomly ( 2:2:1 ) assign one three group : Optimized Background Therapy [ OBT ( 3-6 drug base treatment history resistance test ) ] + maraviroc ( UK-427,857 ) 150 mg take daily , OBT + maraviroc ( UK-427,857 ) 150 mg take twice daily , OBT alone . The study enroll approximately 9 month period 48 week treatment . This may extend additional year depend result 48 week . Physical examination perform study entry , week 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 32 , 40 48 . Blood sample also take study entry , week 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 32 , 40 48 . Additionally , blood sample draw twice , least 30 minute apart , week 2 24 maraviroc ( UK-427,857 ) pharmacokinetic analysis . As part clinical study blood sample also take non-anonymized pharmacogenetic analysis . Patients undergo 12-lead electrocardiogram study entry , week 24 48 .</brief_summary>
