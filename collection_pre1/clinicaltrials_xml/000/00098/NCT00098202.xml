	<detailed_description>Poor mineral nutrition , especially deficiencies iron zinc , major cause maternal , especially , infant morbidity/mortality develop world country . The objective study determine whether : ) linear growth velocity 6 12 month infant receive 5mg Zn supplement great infant receive placebo ; b ) linear growth velocity great infant receive complementary food contain low phytate maize infant feed wild-type control maize . In addition , Zn metabolic study perform . The objective metabolic study measure key variable Zn homeostasis maternal participant change reproductive cycle infant time vulnerable Zn deficiency . The primary outcome measurement linear growth velocity 6 12 month . Secondary outcome weight gain , diarrheal incidence/prevalence infant neurodevelopmental measure . Optional maternal infant biochemical data collect convenience sample comprise willing participant . One additional component study collect information nutritional status woman receive low-phytate vs. control maize infant enrol study . The current protocol infant study specifies measurement exchangeable zinc pool ( EZP ) 6 12 month age ; order lessen burden study participation plan conduct metabolic study infant nine month age . In addition decrease number infant study , change enable family participate metabolic study ( simultaneously enrol sibling cohort ) cease study demand end nine month measurement ( overall decrease three month study participation ) . The primary outcome measure study quantity zinc absorb ( mg/day ) complementary food Zn supplement age 9 month . The rationale measure zinc absorption infant low phytate complementary feeding expect beneficial public health effect result enhance mineral , especially zinc , absorption . Therefore , confirmation increase zinc absorption regard first logical stage efficacy study . The sample size 420 require order observe 6 % increase growth rate Zn supplement infant compare placebo treated infant within maize group 80 % power .</detailed_description>
