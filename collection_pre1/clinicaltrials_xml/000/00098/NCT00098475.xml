	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study lenalidomide low-dose dexamethasone see well work compare lenalidomide standard-dose dexamethasone , give without thalidomide , treat patient multiple myeloma . Biological therapy , lenalidomide , may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Lenalidomide thalidomide may also stop growth multiple myeloma block blood flow cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , dexamethasone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving lenalidomide , thalidomide , dexamethasone together may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Dexamethasone With Without Thalidomide Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate response rate toxicity CC-5013 ( lenalidomide ) plus dexamethasone ( standard dose ) versus CC-5013 plus low dose dexamethasone patient newly diagnose myeloma time first 4 cycle treatment determine CC-5013 plus low dose dexamethasone similar response rate low toxicity ( First Phase ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate response rate thalidomide plus dexamethasone ( Thal/Dex ) patient newly diagnose myeloma achieve complete partial response time first 4 cycle CC-5013 dexamethasone combination either two arm ( First Phase ) . II . To study effect CC-5013 bone marrow microvessel density angiogenesis grade , plasma cell label index ( PCLI ) , expression vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) marrow ( First Phase ) . III . To study effect CC-5013 dexamethasone bone marrow mesenchymal progenitor cell ( MPCs ) ( First Phase ) . IV . To evaluate separate expansion phase efficacy aspirin ( 325 mg/day ) versus Coumadin ( dose adjust maintain target international normalized ratio [ INR ] 2-3 ) prevent deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) patient newly diagnose myeloma receive CC-5013 plus standard dose dexamethasone . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive lenalidomide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 , standard-dose dexamethasone PO QD day 1-4 , 9-12 , 17-20 . Arm II : Patients receive lenalidomide Arm I low-dose dexamethasone PO QD day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Patients respond point first 4 course lenalidomide dexamethasone assign 1 2 salvage therapy arm . Patients progress treatment Arms I II option register salvage therapy Arms III IV respectively . Arm III ( patient response treatment Arm I ) : Patients receive thalidomide PO QD day 1-28 standard-dose dexamethasone PO QD day 1-4 , 9-12 , 17-20 . Arm IV ( patient response treatment Arm II ) : Patients receive thalidomide Arm III low-dose dexamethasone PO QD day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . In salvage therapy arm , course repeat every 28 day absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . After completion 4 course therapy , patient may undergo stem cell harvest ( use growth factor ) cryopreservation . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually 2 year .</detailed_description>
