	<brief_title>Study Feasibility Derive Vaccine From Tumor Tissue Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antigenics enrol patient Phase II study test feasibility derive autologous investigational vaccine ( HSPPC-96 ) tumor tissue patient resectable non-small cell lung cancer . All patient undergo surgery remove tumor follow recurrence overall survival . The primary goal trial determine HSPPC-96 make tumor tissue patient resectable non-small cell lung cancer . The secondary goal characterize safety efficacy profile , evaluate disease recurrence patient receive , evaluate overall survival patient receive HSPPC-96 . HSPPC-96 investigational , immunotherapeutic agent make individual patient 's tumor , collect time surgery . A portion tumor tissue send Antigenics ' manufacturing facility undergo process create vaccine . This vaccine may help patient 's immune system attack cancerous cell leave healthy cell alone .</detailed_description>
