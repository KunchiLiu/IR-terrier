	<brief_summary>This Phase II trial study well give epratuzumab together establish chemotherapy platform work treat young patient relapse acute lymphoblastic leukemia . Monoclonal antibody , epratuzumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Chemotherapy drug work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill stop divide . Giving monoclonal antibody therapy combination chemotherapy may kill cancer cell effectively .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemoimmunotherapy With Epratuzumab Relapsed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ( ALL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine feasibility epratuzumab administer alone combination re-induction combination chemotherapy pediatric patient relapse CD22-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia . II . Determine toxic effect regimen patient . III . Determine antitumor activity regimen patient . IV . To estimate remission re-induction rate four-month event-free survival ( EFS ) patient early first relapse ALL receive epratuzumab combination cytotoxic thermotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine pharmacokinetics epratuzumab patient . II . Determine biologic activity epratuzumab use measurement minimal residual disease patient . III . Determine human anti-human antibody ( HAHA ) response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study comprise feasibility part A ( closed accrual 10/30/06 ) follow pilot part B study . A Simon 's two stage design initially use evaluate efficacy weekly dosing schedule part B patient ( call B1 cohort ) , plan accrue total 112 patient 56 enrol first stage . After completion accrual stage 1 , i.e . 56 patient enrol , design part B revise evaluate modify schedule ( twice weekly , call B2 cohort ) use stratify two-stage design London Chang ( 2005 ) , patient enrol B2 stratify accord relapse ( first early marrow relapse occur &lt; 18 month initial diagnosis v 18-36 month initial diagnosis ) . PART A ( CLOSED TO ACCRUAL 10/30/06 ) : REDUCTION THERAPY : Patients receive epratuzumab IV several hour day -14 , -10 , -6 , -2 cytarabine intrathecally ( IT ) day -14* . NOTE : *Patients receive IT chemotherapy within 7 day study entry prior maintenance chemotherapy ( e.g. , diagnosis relapse ) receive first dose IT cytarabine . RE-INDUCTION THERAPY ( BLOCK 1 ) : Patients receive vincristine IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 ; oral prednisone two three time daily day 1-29 ; pegaspargase intramuscularly ( IM ) day 2 , 9 , 16 , 23 ; dexrazoxane IV follow doxorubicin IV 15 minute day 1 ; methotrexate IT day 15 29 CNS-negative disease ; epratuzumab IV 1 hour day 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 . Patients CNS-positive disease also receive triple IT therapy ( ITT ) consist methotrexate , cytarabine , hydrocortisone day -10 , -6 , 1 15 . RE-INDUCTION THERAPY ( BLOCK 2 ) : Beginning least 7 day last dose IT chemotherapy , patient receive etoposide IV 2 hour cyclophosphamide IV 30 minute day 1-5 . Patients also receive high-dose methotrexate IV continuously 24 hour day 22 . Beginning 42 hour start methotrexate infusion ( day 24 ) , patient receive leucovorin calcium IV every 6 hour minimum 3 dos . Patients CNS-negative disease also receive methotrexate IT day 1 22 . Patients CNS-positive disease receive triple IT re-induction therapy ( block 1 ) day 1 22 . Patients receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously ( SC ) daily begin day 6 continue blood count recover . RE-INDUCTION THERAPY ( PART 3 ) : Beginning least 7 day last dose IT chemotherapy , patient receive cytarabine IV 3 hour twice daily day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 native E. Coli asparaginase IM day 2 9 . Patients receive G-CSF SC daily begin day 10 continue blood count recover . PART B : RE-INDUCTION THERAPY ( BLOCK 1 ) : Patients receive vincristine , prednisone , pegaspargase , doxorubicin , cytarabine , methotrexate , epratuzumab phase I re-induction therapy ( block 1 ) . Epratuzumab give Days 1 , 8 , 15 22 amendment 5 ( B1 cohort ) Days 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 , 15 , 18 , 22 25 amendment 5 ( B2 cohort ) Patients CNS-negative disease receive methotrexate IT day 1 22 . Patients CNS-positive disease receive triple IT therapy comprise methotrexate , cytarabine , hydrocortisone day 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 . RE-INDUCTION THERAPY ( BLOCKS 2 AND 3 ) : Patients receive re-induction therapy block 2 3 part A re-induction therapy ( block 2 3 ) portion study . Patients follow annually .</detailed_description>
