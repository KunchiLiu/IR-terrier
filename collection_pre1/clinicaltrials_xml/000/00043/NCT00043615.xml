	<brief_summary>This study collect biological samples-blood , bone marrow , tumor tissue samples-for use cancer-related research . The specimen use various test drug resistance , blood vessel formation , cancer-causing protein immune function . The purpose identify step cancer development process may serve target treatment test various therapy current future cancer treatment clinical trial . Individuals 18 year age old cancer pre-cancerous condition , colon polyp cervical dysplasia , eligible study , patient high risk cancer . In addition , patient cancer require surgery , biopsy procedure another medical reason may include normal specimen donor . Participants 40 milliliter ( 3 tablespoon ) blood draw upon enter study additional 40-ml sample draw periodically course treatment . No 120 ml blood drawn 12-month period . Some patient may require surgical procedure biopsy ( removal tumor tissue ) medical reason part enrollment research treatment study . In case , portion specimen collect procedure use research study protocol .</brief_summary>
