	<criteria>Patients must newly diagnose , limited stage SCLC ( small cell lung cancer ) , prior radiotherapy . Patients allow resection biopsy . Women reproductive potential must negative serum pregnancy test study screen visit . Patients must give write informed consent participate study . Patients must able take oral medication . Patients completely recover recent surgery . Laboratory criterion : Patients must adequate bone marrow reserve adequate kidney liver function . Patients must evaluate radiation oncologist prior study entry . Extensive Stage SCLC . Women pregnant lactating . Use investigational drug within 30 day prior first dose study medication . Any medically/clinically significant active infection . Symptoms SCLC spread brain . Patients limited stage SCLC undergone complete resection measurable disease prior start chemotherapy . Severe medical problem , unrelated SCLC , would limit patient 's full ability follow study rule procedure , would expose patient extreme risk .
