	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging Women Receiving Chemotherapy Stage III Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Identify surrogate marker response neoadjuvant chemotherapy contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) predictive pathologic remission survival woman stage III breast cancer . - Identify two group patient statistically different 3-year disease-free survival use MRI measurement tumor response neoadjuvant chemotherapy . - Determine whether MRI measurement tumor response first course neoadjuvant chemotherapy predict patient ultimately poor clinical response chemotherapy . - Compare accuracy MRI v mammography predict extent residual disease determine histopathology patient . - Determine whether initial MRI tumor characteristic ( morphologic vascular pattern ) predict pathological response and/or survival patient . - Estimate conditional probability response paclitaxel base MRI measurement response doxorubicin cyclophosphamide patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive injection gadopentetate dimeglumine undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) magnetic resonance spectroscopy breast within 4 week begin neoadjuvant chemotherapy , 20-28 hour 48-96 hour first course doxorubicin cyclophosphamide ( Type 1 chemotherapy ) , Type 1 chemotherapy paclitaxel chemotherapy regimen ( Type 2 chemotherapy ) ( MRI ) patient continue Type 2 chemotherapy , 3-4 week final neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment ( 1-2 week surgery ) . Patients also undergo mammogram possibly ultrasound coincide first last MRI . Core needle biopsy perform first MRI first course Type 1 chemotherapy Type 1 chemotherapy Type 2 chemotherapy ( patient continue Type 2 chemotherapy ) . Patients follow every 6 month 7-10 year .</detailed_description>
