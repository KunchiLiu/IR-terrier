	<brief_summary>This study determine whether drug celecoxib ( Celebrex® ( Registered Trademark ) ) help stabilize improve vision patient age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) receive photodynamic therapy , PDT ( also call cold laser treatment ) . The macula part retina back eye determine central best vision . AMD severely impair central vision , affect person 's ability read , drive , carry daily activity . This vision loss cause formation abnormal new blood vessel choroid-a thin , pigment vascular layer eye behind retina-that leak blood macula . PTD stop growth blood vessel slow rate vision loss . However , treatment usually cause vision improve , temporary effect , require several treatment 2 year . Furthermore , PDT work patient may actually cause swell re-growth blood vessel . Celecoxib anti-inflammatory drug , animal study , prevent growth abnormal blood vessel associate tumor injury cornea . Thus , drug might reduce swell prevent vessel re-growth AMD , enhance effectiveness PDT . Patients 55 year age old AMD visual acuity 20/20 20/200 may eligible study . Participants randomly assign take either celecoxib placebo ( look-alike pill active drug ) twice day undergo various test procedure detail . Not every examination do every visit , may require one visit . - Medical history physical examination - Blood drawing : A blood sample drawn arm vein evaluate liver kidney function - Eye examination : Visual acuity eye pressure measure , lens , retina , pupils eye movement examine - Photography : Photographs eye take use special camera bright flash - Fluorescein angiography : Pictures retina take look abnormal blood vessel . A yellow dye inject arm vein travel blood vessel eye . The retina photograph use camera flash blue light eye . The picture show dye leak vessel retina , indicate possible blood vessel abnormality . - Indocyanine green angiography : This procedure , similar fluorescein angiography , use green dye photograph retina identify portion abnormal vessel deep part retina . - Optical coherence tomography : This new technique us light produce 2-dimensional cross-sectional picture retina . The patient look machine call optical coherence tomograph pattern flash rotate red green light , first one eye . One week start study medication , laser treatment begin . For procedure , needle place arm vein chemical call verteporfin ( Visudyne® ( Registered Trademark ) ) infuse vein 10 minute . After 15 minute , eye anesthetize numbing drop . A special contact lens place eye laser beam direct eye 83 second . Patients follow clinic every 6 week 36 week various examination possible re-treatment , need . Some patient ask return 1 2 week first PDT eye examination fluorescein angiography .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Celecoxib Treat Macular Degeneration Patients Receiving Photodynamic Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) represent common cause blindness patient age 60 . The major cause vision loss disease due development choroidal neovascularization . Several clinical trial show eye predominately 'well-defined ' area neovascularization ( lesion least 50 % vessel readily demarcate fluorescein angiography ) benefit treatment photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) . However , treatment benefit result reduction number patient suffer severe vision loss . Few patient demonstrate improvement visual acuity . In addition , neovascular lesion predominate occult ( vessel difficult outline fluorescein angiography ) pure occult demonstrate substantial treatment benefit . Histopathologic study demonstrate presence inflammatory response retina patient choroidal neovascularization well eyes receive PDT . In addition , eye receive PDT , vascular remodel continued neovascular process occurs . Therefore , use celecoxib ( Celebrex® ( Registered Trademark ) ) , specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor , possess anti-angiogenic well anti-inflammatory property , may beneficial patient neovascular AMD undergoing PDT . The study organize double-masked , randomize , placebo-controlled , prospective multi-center clinical trial investigate ability celecoxib alter inflammatory neovascular response AMD patient undergo PDT . The result study contribute design large definitive clinical trial . The primary outcome measure drop 15 letter best correct visual acuity follow initial PDT treatment 1 year . The secondary outcome measure stabilization ( drop 4 letter less baseline ) improvement best correct visual acuity follow initial PDT treatment week 36 , improvement 5 letter visual acuity baseline week 36 , time retreatment PDT , number retreatments PDT change CNV size , extent leakage stain detect fluorescein angiography . Additional outcome measure change size extent vascular remodel choroidal new vessel formation determine optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) high-speed indocyanine green angiography ( HS-ICG ) .</detailed_description>
