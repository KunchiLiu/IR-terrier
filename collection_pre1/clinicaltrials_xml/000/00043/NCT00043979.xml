	<brief_summary>This study examine safety effectiveness stem cell transplantation treat patient sarcoma ( tumor bone , nerve , soft tissue ) . Stem cell immature cell bone marrow blood stream develop blood cell . Stem cell transplant healthy donor travel patient 's bone marrow begin produce normal cell . In patient certain cancer , leukemia lymphoma , donor 's immune cell attack patient 's cancer cell call `` graft-versus-tumor '' effect , contribute cure disease . This study determine whether treatment use successfully treat patient sarcomas . Patients 4 35 year age sarcoma spread primary site remove surgically , effective treatment available , may eligible study . Candidates must diagnose age 30 time enrollment . They must match donor ( usually sibling ) . Participants undergo follow procedure : Donors : Stem cell collect donor . To , hormone granulocyte colony stimulate factor ( G-CSF ) inject skin several day move stem cell bone marrow bloodstream . Then , cell collect apheresis . In procedure blood drawn needle place one arm pump machine stem cell separate remove . The rest blood return donor needle arm . Patients : For patient already central venous catheter ( plastic tube ) , one place major vein . This tube stay body entire treatment period give medication , transfuse blood , , withdraw blood sample , deliver donated stem cell . Before transplant procedure , patient receive one three cycle `` induction '' chemotherapy , cycle consist 5 day fludarabine , cyclophosphamide , etoposide , doxorubicin , vincristine , prednisone follow least 17-day rest period . All drug infuse catheter except prednisone , take mouth . After induction therapy , patient admit hospital 5 day chemotherapy high dos cyclophosphamide , melphalan , fludarabine . Two day later , stem cell infuse . The anticipated hospital stay 3 week , may longer complication arise . Patients discharge white cell count near normal , fever infection , take sufficient food fluid mouth , sign serious graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) -a condition donor 's cell `` see '' patient 's cell foreign mount immune response . After hospital discharge , patient follow clinic least twice weekly medical history , physical exam , blood test 100 day . They receive medication prevent infection GVHD , need , blood transfusion . If GVHD develop 120 day post transplant , patient receive additional white cell boost immune response . After 100 day , follow-up visit may less frequent . Follow-up continue least 5 year . During course study , patient undergo repeat medical evaluation , include blood test radiology study , check cancer treatment side effect . On four occasion , white blood cell may collect apheresis see immune response generate sarcomas treat study . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan may do five occasion . This test use radioactive material produce image useful detect primary tumor cancer spread .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stem Cell Transplantation Patients With High-Risk Recurrent Pediatric Sarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Treatment pediatric sarcoma enjoy progress past 25 year patient localize , chemosensitive disease prognostic factor available identify subset patient dismal prognosis ; patient primary metastatic disease , especially bone bone marrow metastasis . - Patients primary chemoresistant disease early recurrence also poor prognosis lack suitable treatment option . For patient , critical alternative approach cytotoxic chemotherapy identify . - Basic laboratory study show Ewing 's sarcoma susceptible immune mediate mechanisms cytolysis vitro . Interestingly , Ewing 's sarcoma appear true chemosensitive chemoresistant cell line . - Recent progress field bone marrow transplantation identify approach reproducibly induce allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell engraftment adult hematologic malignancy . In case , approach show beneficial effect patient solid tumor result development allogeneic , immune-mediated graft versus tumor effect . Objectives : - To determine transplantation human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) match , peripheral blood stem cell result full donor engraftment ( great 95 percent day 100 ) patient high risk-pediatric sarcoma . - To identify characterize toxicity HLA-matched peripheral blood stem cell transplant ( PBSCT ) patient high-risk pediatric sarcoma . In particular identify incidence graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) pace immune reconstitution population . - To determine allogeneic graft-versus-tumor response follow allogeneic PBSCT induce clinically significant anti-tumor effect measure radiographic evidence antitumor response follow PBSCT patient measurable disease improve clinical outcome compare historical control patient population universally poor outcome . Eligibility : - Patients , age great 4 year enrollment less 30 year diagnosis age le 35 enrollment , ultra-high risk Ewing 's sarcoma family tumor , desmoplastic small round cell tumor alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma . - Patients must complete standard front-line therapy salvage therapy . - Patient must availability 5 6 antigen HLA-matched first-degree relative donor genotypically identical twin . - Patients must adequate cardiac , pulmonary , renal , liver , marrow function . Design : -Donor prepared peripheral blood stem cell harvest Filgrastim mobilization , 10 microg/kg per day subcutaneous ( SQ ) 5-7 day stem cell collect apheresis . The stem cell cryopreserved . Patients receive 1 3 21 day cycle Fludarabine-EPOCH induction chemotherapy . The preparative regimen consist cyclophosphamide , fludarabine melphalan follow stem cell infusion . GVHD prophylaxis consist sirolimus tacrolimus .</detailed_description>
