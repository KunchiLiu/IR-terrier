	<brief_summary>This study evaluate woman increase genetic risk develop ovarian cancer close relative mutation BRCA1 BRCA2 gene ( gene cause genetic form ovarian cancer ) strong family history breast and/or ovarian cancer . The study two aspect . There two group subject study . One group woman ovaries fallopian tube surgically remove prophylactic ( preventive ) measure develop ovarian/fallopian tube cancer . These woman study determine whether surgery , fact , decrease risk ovarian tubal cancer whether decrease risk breast cancer . The tissue remove surgery also investigate see whether new way examine ovary remove provide good information cancer-related tissue change . A second group subject woman choose preventive surgery . These woman follow closely see screen multiple CA-125 blood testing time ( see ) detect ovarian tubal cancer early stage . Both group woman undergo examination process woman decide upon various option lower ovarian cancer risk detail assessment choice impact quality life . It look opt ovariectomy feel surgery choose screen feel time screen . All participant undergo follow procedure : - Medical history , physical examination , blood draw upon enter study , include blood sample future ovarian cancer research . - Screening mammogram , CA-125 blood test , transvaginal ultrasound upon enter study , yearly repeat mammograms participant yearly transvaginal ultrasound exam woman screen arm study . CA-125 protein find blood whose level elevate woman ovarian cancer . Transvaginal ultrasound way take picture ovary use sound wave . If result test normal , additional test may require learn reason abnormality . - Questionnaires personal , medical family history , ovarian cancer risk factor , medication use , medical choice , quality life enter study , repeat quality life medication use questionnaires every 6 month study period . - Blood sample follow-up visit CA-125 test every 3 month screen ovarian/fallopian tube cancer . Some blood sample save future ovarian cancer research . - Semi-annual report duration study regard health quality life change occur prior 6-month period . Researchers use pattern rate change CA-125 level time woman screen group decide test need test ovarian cancer . Women surgery portion undergo surgical removal ovary fallopian tube . The removed tissue study use new method examine cell closely usual , portion tissue store future research ovarian cancer . This study conduct collaboration Gynecologic Oncology Group ( GOG ) , designate GOG Protocol 0199 . Subjects may join study participate GOG institution ( http : //www.gog.org ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Removal Ovaries/Fallopian Tubes CA-125 Screening Reduce Risk Ovarian Cancer Women Increased Genetic Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Annually , 25,500 woman develop ovarian cancer ( OC ) 16,000 die disease United States . Women high genetic risk OC much high lifetime risk develop OC woman general population . OC difficult detect use current screening method , include CA-125 monitoring transvaginal ultrasound ( TVUS ) ; woman diagnose disease advanced stage , survival chance low . This protocol investigate novel OC screening strategy [ longitudinal CA-125 level ( use mathematical algorithm know ROCA ) TVUS ] surgical method [ risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy ( RRSO ) ] manage woman high genetic risk OC . Objectives : To pool resource intramural extramural OC investigator obtain first prospective data high-risk woman address incidence critical cancer endpoint quality life , thus determine : 1. . much RRSO reduces OC/Breast Cancer ( BC ) risk , 2. . RRSO affect quality life , 3. . factor influence decision management approach choose , 4. . premature menopause affect risk develop medical problem , 5. . detectable abnormality ovary allow early diagnosis , 6. . cellular/molecular malignant process occur . Eligibility : Women age 30 old prior history OC least one intact ovary . Must increase genetic risk OC meet one follow criterion : 1. . Subject close blood relative test positive BRCA1/2 mutation , 2. . Subject family history 2 close blood relative BC and/or OC , 3. . Subject family history 1 close blood relative BC and/or OC Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry , 4. . Subject premenopausal BC Ashkenazi Jewish descent , 5. . Subject estimate probability BRCA1/2 mutation use BRCAPRO evaluation . If presence BC use eligibility , least one BC must premenopausal onset . If menopausal status time BC diagnosis unknown , age diagnosis must less 50 year . Design : International , multi-institution , prospective cohort , collaborative study NCI 's Clinical Genetics Branch , Gynecologic Oncology Group ( GOG ) , Cancer Genetics Network . Two-arm , non-randomized study woman contemplate RRSO diminish OC risk . Women decide whether undergo RRSO consultation physician . 1. . Women choose RRSO surgery standardized procedure . Clinically occult primary cancer precursor lesion seek , material bank molecular study . CA-125 level measure twice yearly . 2. . Women decline RRSO choose OC screen quarterly CA125/ROCA , provide estimate likelihood subject OC . TVUS gynecologic oncology consultation may arrange . TVUS do annual basis , minimum . Subjects arm complete demographic , epidemiologic , psychosocial instrument provide blood sample research-based genetic testing ( germline BRCA1/2 ) , CA-125 testing , serum/plasma/DNA storage . Primary outcome development OC , fallopian tube cancer , primary peritoneal carcinoma , BC . Study accrual goal include approximately 800 subject RRSO arm 2,400 subject screen arm , include least 400 BRCA1/2 mutation carrier .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : To consider increased genetic risk OC , subject must : Age great equal 30 ; No prior history OC , include low malignant potential cancer ( LMP ) , primary papillary serous carcinoma peritoneum ; At least one intact ovary : Satisfied one follow additional criterion : The family subject document deleterious BRCA1 BRCA2 mutation either : subject test positive deleterious BRCA1 BRCA2 mutation ; OR subject first seconddegree relative deleterious BRCA1 BRCA2 mutation OR The family contain least two ovarian and/or breast cancer among subject first seconddegree relative subject within lineage . This condition satisfy multiple primary cancer person . Where breast cancer require meet criterion , least one breast cancer must diagnose prior menopause ( age diagnosis less equal 50 age menopause unknown ) ; OR The subject Ashkenazi Jewish ethnicity one firstdegree two seconddegree relative breast and/or OC . Where breast cancer require meet criterion , least one case must diagnose prior menopause ( age less equal 50 , age menopause unknown ) . OR The subject Ashkenazi ancestry breast cancer . To meet criterion , breast cancer must diagnose prior menopause ( age diagnosis less equal 50 age menopause unknown ) . OR The probability carry BRCA1/2 mutation give family pedigree breast OCs exceed 20 % calculated BRCAPRO . Note : BRCAPRO NOT need calculate everyone enters study . Patients eligible base family history meet one specific pattern describe protocol , regardless BRCAPRO result . BRCAPRO assessment valuable family genetic test do , family history fit one specific pattern describe , pattern cancer lead believe family might still consider highrisk . At point , BRCAPRO estimate mutation carrier great 20 percent , patient IS eligible . Signed approve informed consent authorization permit release personal health information . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : A first seconddegree relative deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation , subject test NEGATIVE exact mutation . Women currently pregnant plan pregnancy study . Women participate another OC early detection trial ( except ROCA study run Cancer Genetics Network . Women enrol ROCA study subsequently choose undergo surgery may enroll surgical cohort GOG 0199 ) . Women psychiatric , psychological condition prevent fully inform consent . Women current untreated malignancy ( exclude nonmelanoma skin cancer ) . Women adjuvant radiation therapy chemotherapy within past 1 month ( 31 day ) . For purpose study , biologic agent administer anticancer therapeutic intent ( e.g. , Herceptin ) also permit . Women treat prior metastatic malignant disease within past 5 year . Women undergone intraperitoneal surgery within prior 3 month ( include laparoscopy ) . Women ovaries remove prior study entry . Women history medical condition place subject risk relate need donate blood research purpose , e.g. , chronic infectious disease , severe anemia , hemophilia . Note : Enrollment woman significant preoperative clinical suspicion might exist ovarian fallopian tube caner avoid . The intent study ascertain subject contemplate riskreducing , rather therapeutic , procedure . Women finding uncertain significant baseline TVUS remain eligible .</criteria>
