	<brief_summary>This study examine safety effectiveness monoclonal antibody call daclizumab treat uveitis , eye inflammation . Monoclonal antibody genetically engineer protein make large quantity direct specific target body . Daclizumab design prevent specific chemical interaction need immune cell call lymphocyte produce inflammation . In ongoing NIH study 10 adult uveitis , 8 patient able decrease corticosteroid immunosuppressive medicine take receive daclizumab month even year . The study conduct three different site , include NIH Clinical Center . Patients 6 year age old non-infectious uveitis least 3 month ' duration require treatment immune suppress medicine , prednisone , cyclophosphamide , cyclosporine , azathioprine , methotrexate , others , may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood test , complete eye examination , questionnaire patient 's vision daily activity . Participants come study center every 2 week treatment evaluation . Daclizumab treatment give injection skin , usually arm . Patients receive maximum 28 treatment 1-year period . Treatment may extend month participant reach 1-year mark . The first two induction treatment higher dose ( 2 mg/kg body weight ) maintenance dose 1 mg/kg . After first daclizumab treatment , uveitis medication taper , one time . If disease remain quiet , drug may eventually stop completely . For first 6 month , patient receive daclizumab injection evaluation every 2 week . After , medication reduce vision remain stable , treatment evaluation may spread every 3 4 week . Over time , few test may require biweekly examination patient well , nearly examination do screen repeat 3-month interval . If inflammation vision loss occur drug tapering , appropriate treatment administer . If vision loss great , patient treat steroid medicine take study . Additional , special test do select study center include follow : - Fluorescein angiography : This test do check abnormality eye blood vessel . A yellow dye inject arm vein travel blood vessel eye . Pictures retina take special camera flash blue light eye . The picture show dye leak vessel retina , indicate possible abnormality . - Pelvic ultrasound urine test : These test do enrollment 1 year check kidney , lymph node , pelvic area . - Blood test : Additional blood test do enrollment every 3 6 month laboratory immunology study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Daclizumab Injections Treat Non-Infectious Sight-Threatening Uveitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uveitis refers intraocular inflammatory disease important cause visual loss . Standard systemic immunosuppressive medication uveitis cause significant adverse effect . Consequently , effective treatment safer side effect profile highly desirable . Daclizumab humanize anti-Tac monoclonal antibody direct high affinity IL-2 receptor CD25 Tac subunit . The IL-2 receptor system play central role induction immune response via activated T B-lymphocytes , observe uveitis animal model surface human cell patient uveitis . Blocking system impedes immune response inhibit development local inflammatory response . Previous study use intravenous daclizumab treatment suggest continue daclizumab treatment 1 mg/kg every 2-4 week may effectively control uveitis even complete withdrawal standard immunosuppressive medication . Subcutaneous ( SC ) daclizumab injection 1 2 mg/kg healthy volunteer well tolerate show produce serum daclizumab trough level comparable intravenous treatment . This open-label , multi-center Phase II trial SC daclizumab design provide information current trial design feasibility well preliminary safety efficacy data 15 participant 3 site 6 year age old require standard systemic immunosuppression control non-infectious posterior intermediate uveitis . The SC daclizumab treatment give every 2 week 6 month unless safety endpoint require study exit . A re-induction SC daclizumab therapy may permit initial efficacy failure . Therapy begin two induction treatment 2 mg/kg ( limit 200 mg ) , follow maintenance therapy 1 mg/kg ( limit 100 mg ) . Beginning first SC daclizumab treatment , initial immunosuppressive medication load taper staggered fashion target level 50 % less original dose within 8 12-week period , tolerate . After preliminary efficacy evaluation 12 week , taper continue SC daclizumab therapy may continue clinically indicated duration trial . The primary efficacy outcome maintenance visual acuity simultaneous reduction original immunosuppressive medication load . Primary safety measure visual acuity occurrence adverse event . Secondary outcome measure include anterior chamber vitreous cell , vitreous haze , questionnaire result .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Participant 6 year age ( upper age limit ) . Participant diagnosis noninfectious intermediate posterior uveitis least three month duration prior enrollment , require treatment period control intraocular inflammatory disease avoid sightthreatening complication due inflammation , prescribe dose average least 20 mg/day ( great equal 0.25 mg/kg/day ) systemic prednisone ( equivalent ) combination two antiinflammatory treatment uveitis , regimen include one following related compound : cyclophosphamide , cyclosporine , azathioprine , mycophenolate mofetil , methotrexate . Participants anticipate , restrict following condition know cause intermediate posterior uveitis : intermediate uveitis par planitis subtype , sarcoidosis , VogtKoyanagiHarada ( VKH ) syndrome , birdshot retinochoroidopathy , retinal vasculitis sympathetic ophthalmia . Participant 's uveitis consider stable current medication time enrollment . The prescribed dosage ( ) current medication enrollment must increase 6 week prior enrollment , symptoms history 'attacks ' exacerbation intraocular inflammation 6 week period . Participant uveitis bad grade 1+ anterior chamber cell vitreous haze enrollment . Participant bestcorrected distance visual acuity least one eye 20/400 better ( ETDRS logMAR less 1.34 ) . Participant agree undergo elective ocular surgery ( e.g. , cataract extraction ) first 26 week study . Participant currently pregnant lactate . Participant reproductive potential sexually active agrees use acceptable birth control method throughout course study 6 month completion protocol treatment period . ( Acceptable method must discuss participant Investigator , may include use condom , diaphragm , IUDs , progesterone implant injection , double barrier method . ) Participant , parent guardian young 18 year enrollment , able understand sign approve consent form enter study ; minor participant must also sign assent required local Institutional Review Board Independent Ethics Committee ( IRB/IEC ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Participants age 6 year . Participants receive previous treatment IL2 direct monoclonal antibody . Participants currently enrol another clinical trial use therapy nonuveitis condition would likely affect immune response interfere trial logistics , receive investigational therapy within 30 day prior enrollment . Participants history diagnosis Behcet 's disease ( since taper withdrawal concomitant immunosuppressive medication standard care Behcet 's patient ) primary diagnosis anterior uveitis ( e.g. , juvenile rheumatoid arthritis ( JRA ) HLAB27 associate uveitis , ocular condition usually treat local systemic medication ) . Participants significant , systemic infection require medical treatment time enrollment . Participants history cancer ( nonmelanoma skin cancer situ cervical cancer ) diagnose within past 5 year . Participants nonocular , medically significant comorbid condition impair normal activity , require immunosuppression , condition prognosis indicate significant risk disability death condition continue exacerbate study period , medical condition would likely impact participant 's ability comply visit schedule . Such condition may include , example , recent heart attack , significant COPD , brittle diabetes , kidney disease , severe emphysema , organ transplant ( require corticosteroid immunosuppressive medication ) , hepatitis liver disease , uncontrolled psychiatric illness .</criteria>
