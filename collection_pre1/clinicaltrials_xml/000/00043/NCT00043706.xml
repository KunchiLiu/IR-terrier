	<brief_summary>Systemic Sclerosis ( also know Scleroderma ) chronic , autoimmune disease connective tissue generally classify one rheumatic disease . Systemic Sclerosis cause fibrosis ( scar tissue ) form skin internal organ . The fibrosis eventually cause involved skin harden , limit mobility , also damage organ . Excess Transforming Growth Factor Beta-1 ( TGF-beta1 ) activity may result abnormal fibrosis characteristic Systemic Sclerosis . An antibody TGF-beta1 may modify pathologic process characterize inappropriate fibrosis . Genzyme Corporation currently investigate human monoclonal antibody ( CAT-192 ) neutralize active TGF-beta1 . This study conduct U.S. Europe evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics repeat treatment CAT-192 patient early stage diffuse Systemic Sclerosis .</brief_summary>
