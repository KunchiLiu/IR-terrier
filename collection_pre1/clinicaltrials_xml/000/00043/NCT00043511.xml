	<brief_summary>The purpose study see experimental HIV vaccine pGA2/JS2 safe well tolerate two different dos . Another important purpose study observe immune system respond vaccine different dose level . Vaccines give people help body fight infection . The vaccine test study DNA vaccine . The pGA2/JS2 plasmid DNA vaccine instruct body make HIV protein . These HIV protein may trigger immune response . Because many protein HIV need make DNA vaccination , risk get HIV vaccination . This similar DNA vaccine test safety mouse , rabbit , monkey . The vaccine well tolerated dos use study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>DNA vaccination induce immune response animal number viral , bacterial , parasite derive antigen . Early clinical experience HIV DNA vaccine human indicate : 1 ) tolerability short-term safety DNA dose 5000 mcg human excellent ; 2 ) potential immunogenicity . The pGA2/JS2 DNA vaccine part plan prime/boost regimen DNA vaccine prime follow modify vaccinia Ankara ( MVA ) vaccine boost . In study monkey , combination DNA vaccine MVA vaccine protect monkey disease cause monkey virus similar HIV . The current study initial investigation safety immunogenicity DNA vaccine give alone . The pGA2/JS2 DNA vaccine express gag , protease , reverse transcriptase , env , tat , vpu , rev . Participants randomize 1 2 group . People Group A receive either 2 injection low dose ( 300 mcg ) DNA plasmid vaccine placebo control . People Group B receive either 2 injection high dose ( 3000 mcg ) DNA plasmid vaccine control . Group B enrol vaccine find safe well-tolerated initial 2-week evaluation participant Group A . Participants receive vaccination administer Months 0 2 . All vaccination administer intramuscular ( IM ) injection outpatient setting . Participants 10 clinic visit study , include screen injection visit . Participants give blood urine sample study visit . They test HIV enter study 4 time study . Women become pregnant may undergo 3 pregnancy test study period .</detailed_description>
