	<brief_title>Bortezomib Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer Kidney Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic profile PS-341 patient advanced malignancy mild , moderate severe renal insufficiency . II . Evaluate safety , tolerability , maximum tolerate dose PS-341 patient vary degree renal insufficiency . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord recent creatinine clearance ( great 60 mL/min vs 40-59 mL/min v 20-39 mL/min v le 20 mL/min v creatinine clearance undergoing renal dialysis ) . Patients receive bortezomib IV 3-5 second day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos bortezomib maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede least 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Once MTD determine , additional cohort 12 patient treated MTD . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 60-69 patient ( least 12 per stratum ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
