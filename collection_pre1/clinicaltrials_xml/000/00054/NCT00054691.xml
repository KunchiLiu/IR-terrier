	<brief_title>ZD1839 ( Iressa ) Recurrent Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma Skin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ZD1839 new drug may slow stop cell growth human . Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) may involve certain type cancer , include squamous cell carcinoma skin . When EGFR stimulate , series chemical reaction start result tumor `` tell '' grow . ZD1839 try stop reaction block EGFR . This may stop tumor grow . In study , participant take ZD1839 mouth daily . Once treatment start , participant return clinic every treatment cycle ( every 4 week ) first 4 month every 8 week thereafter . At visit , participant physical exam blood test perform . About 2-4 teaspoon blood drawn visit . The doctor also check participant tolerate ZD1839 ( side effect ) . Every 8 week , participant tumor evaluated radiographic scan . This may include either CT MRI chest X-ray . During treatment , participant take medication , include non-prescription drug aspirin herbal product without approval doctor . Participants continue take trial drug tumor grows , severe side effect occur , withdraw consent , study close . The study close 12 month last participant enrol . This investigational study . The FDA approve ZD1839 treatment advance lung cancer , FDA authorize ZD1839 research treatment skin cancer . About 40 participant take part study . All enrol M.D . Anderson .</detailed_description>
