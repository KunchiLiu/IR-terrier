	<brief_title>Perifosine Treating Patients With Recurrent , Refractory , Locally Advanced , Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine objective tumor response rate patient recurrent refractory , locally advanced metastatic breast cancer treat perifosine . - Determine toxicity drug patient . - Determine stable disease rate , time disease progression , objective response duration , duration stable disease patient treat drug . - Correlate potential endpoint , include phosphorylated ERK , PKB , SAPK , phosphorylated PKC alpha , beta , gamma isoforms , p21 ^WAF1 ; activate capase-3 tumor biopsy , clinical outcome patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive load dose oral perifosine day 1 2 daily day 3-21 course 1 . Patients receive oral perifosine daily day 1-21 subsequent course . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) may receive 2 additional course beyond CR . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 18-35 patient accrue study within 6-12 month .</detailed_description>
