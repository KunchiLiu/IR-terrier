	<brief_title>BAY 59-8862 Treating Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine overall response rate , include partial complete response , patient taxane-resistant non-small cell lung cancer treat BAY 59-8862 . - Determine overall survival patient treated drug . - Determine duration response time progression patient treat drug . - Determine quantitative qualitative toxic effect drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive BAY 59-8862 IV 1 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients respond disease receive 2-4 additional course beyond maximal response . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 14-84 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
