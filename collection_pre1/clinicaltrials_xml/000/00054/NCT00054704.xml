	<detailed_description>The treatment acute unipolar depression extensively research . However , despite availability wide range antidepressant drug , clinical trial indicate 30 % 40 % depressed patient fail respond first-line antidepressant treatment , despite adequate dosage , duration , compliance . Very study examine efficacy somatic treatment acute phase bipolar depression . Thus , clear need develop novel improve therapeutic bipolar depression . Recent preclinical study suggest antidepressant may exert delayed indirect effect glutamatergic system . Clinical data suggest lamotrigine inhibitor glutamate release N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) antagonist ketamine may antidepressant effect . Finally , group recently find two separate study glutamate modulate agent riluzole effective treatment-resistant unipolar bipolar depression ( Zarate et al 2004 ) . Together , data suggest glutamatergic system may play role pathophysiology treatment depression , agent , directly reduce glutamatergic neurotransmission , may represent novel class antidepressant . In study , propose extend finding open-label study riluzole treatment-resistant depression investigate efficacy double-blind placebo-controlled study bipolar depression . Patients , age 18 70 year diagnosis bipolar disorder I II current episode depress ( without psychotic feature ) , randomize double-blind treat receive either riluzole ( 50-200 mg/day ) placebo period 8 week . Acute efficacy determine demonstrate great response rate use specify criterion . Approximately 78 patient acute bipolar depression enrol study .</detailed_description>
