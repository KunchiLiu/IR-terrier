	<brief_title>Radial Artery Versus Saphenous Vein Grafts Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Hypothesis : Radial artery graft high graft patency rate one year coronary artery bypass graft surgery ( CABG ) compare saphenous vein graft . Secondary Hypotheses : Determine differences clinical outcome , cost quality life patient receive radial artery versus saphenous vein graft . Intervention : 1 ) Saphenous vein graft . This standard conduit coronary artery bypass graft area heart except leave anterior descending ( LAD ) artery . 2 ) Radial artery . This experimental conduit . Preference give harvest non-dominant arm . Primary Outcomes : 1-year post CABG surgery patency rate Study Abstract : Although radial artery introduce potential conduit coronary artery bypass graft 1970s , enthusiasm use limit technical difficulty harvest vessel problem perioperative vascular spasm . In spite , surgeon persist base belief arterial conduit would better vein graft , term long-term patency . With development new harvest technique introduction calcium channel blocker prevent vasospasm , use radial artery graft increase recent year . This use radial artery conduit base long-term prospective data regard patency . However , VA leader define long-term efficacy/patency saphenous vein internal mammary graft , appropriate VA investigate radial artery graft . In fact , VA Cooperative Studies Program , probably health care delivery system ability undertake study . Study Design : The study prospective , randomize , unblinded clinical trial . The population consist VA patient coronary artery disease document coronary arteriography agree undergo coronary artery bypass surgery . Medical condition could affect blood flow patient 's arm main exclusion criterion . These include Raynaud 's symptom , positive Allen test , neurologic musculoskeletal disease affect arm patient one arm . Patients eligible agree participate study randomly assign receive one radial artery graft one saphenous vein graft follow vessel : leave anterior descend internal mammary use , circumflex , diagonal , right coronary artery . The surgeon determine subject vessel preoperatively select vessel suitable grafting . The stratification factor participate hospital vessel bypass , leave anterior descend versus vessel . History , physical examination , laboratory test , cardiac catheterization perform baseline one year . Follow-up clinic visit two week , three , six , nine month post CABG . Coronary angiography perform one week one year post surgery . Quality life hand/leg functional status assess baseline , three month , one year . Cost measure capture . Biostatistical Considerations : For trial , sample size 874 randomized patient require . This provide 90 % power detect difference one-year patency rate 92 % radial artery versus 83 % saphenous vein expect one-year catheter completion rate 65 % . This five year study . There four year patient accrual one year follow-up . Nine participate VA medical center expect randomize two patient per month .</detailed_description>
