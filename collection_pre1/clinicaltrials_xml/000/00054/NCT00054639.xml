	<brief_title>Oblimersen Sodium Rituximab Treating Patients With Recurrent B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine therapeutic efficacy toxicity G3139 ( oblimersen sodium ) Rituximab patient recurrent B-cell NHL . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect G3139 Rituximab level Bcl-2 expression . II . The secondary objective study evaluate effect G3139 Rituximab Bcl-2 protein gene expression . OUTLINE : Patients receive oblimersen sodium intravenously ( IV ) continuously day 1-7 , 15-21 , 29-35 rituximab IV 4-6 hour day 3 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 . Patients achieve stable disease objective response may receive one additional course treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
