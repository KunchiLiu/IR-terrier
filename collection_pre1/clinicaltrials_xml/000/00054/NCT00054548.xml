	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) G3139 combination carboplatin paclitaxel . II . To determine quantitative qualitative nature toxicity G3139 carboplatin paclitaxel . III . To measure G3139 activity peripheral blood lymphocyte quantitating Bcl-2/Bax expression transcription , well T-cell function signal . IV . To measure G3139 activity tumor biopsy specimens quantitating Bcl-2/Bax expression transcription . V. To determine pharmacokinetics carboplatin , paclitaxel , G3139 , well intratumoral G3139 level . VI . To screen various signal transduction pathway may affect Bcl-2 down-regulation PBMC tumor biopsy specimens order well understand mechanism G3139 chemosensitization . VII . To seek preliminary evidence antitumor activity combination G3139 , carboplatin , paclitaxel . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study oblimersen . Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously day 1-7 paclitaxel IV 3 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute day 4 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos oblimersen maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede least 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . An additional cohort 12-15 patient receive treatment oblimersen MTD .</detailed_description>
