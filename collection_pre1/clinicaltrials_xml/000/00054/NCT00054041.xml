	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Preventing Cervical Cancer Patients With Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine efficacy SGN-00101 , term complete histologic regression , patient grade III cervical intraepithelial neoplasia . II . Determine toxicity drug patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine change lesion size patient treatment drug . II . Compare histologic response treatment drug patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive SGN-00101 subcutaneously week 1 , 4 , 8 absence disease progression . Arm II : Patients receive standard care . At week 15 , patient undergo large loop excision transformation zone colposcopy . Patients follow 19 week , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 28-84 patient ( 14-42 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 12-48 month .</detailed_description>
