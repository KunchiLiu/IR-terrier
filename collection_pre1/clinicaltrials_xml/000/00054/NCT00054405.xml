	<brief_title>Interleukin-12 Interleukin-2 Treating Patients With Refractory Recurrent Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Define maximum tolerate dose dose-limiting toxicity interleukin-12 without interleukin-2 patient refractory recurrent neuroblastoma . II . Determine , preliminarily , antitumor effect interleukin-12 without interleukin-2 patient . III . Evaluate immunoregulatory activity interleukin-12 without interleukin-2 patient . IV . Evaluate antiangiogenic activity interleukin-12 without interleukin-2 patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients assign 1 2 treatment cohort . COHORT A : Patients receive interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) IV 5-15 second day 1 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 , 12 . COHORT B : Patients receive interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) IV 15 minute twice daily day 1 8 IL-12 IV cohort A . Treatment cohort repeat every 28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Some patient may receive additional course discretion principal investigator . Cohorts 3-6 patient cohort receive escalate dos IL-2 IL-12 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Once MTD determine , additional cohort 8 patient receive IL-12 IL-2 MTD . Patients follow 3 week .</detailed_description>
