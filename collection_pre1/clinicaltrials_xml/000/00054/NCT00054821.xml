	<brief_summary>Joint injury trauma dramatically increase risk develop osteoarthritis ( OA ) . The purpose study determine factor lead decrease pain , improve joint function , repair joint surface post-traumatic OA . Study hypotheses : 1 ) Ankle motion distraction result clinically significant improvement Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale score , SF-36 score , improve cartilage thickness distribution habitually heavily load portion articular surface , compare use distraction without ankle motion . 2a ) Ankles low geometric surface irregularity great range motion good preservation neo-chondroid tissue ( increase normalize cartilage thickness reduce longitudinal compressive strain habitually heavily region articular surface ) high surface irregularity . 2b ) Low geometric surface irregularity great range motion reduce habitual focal regional contact stress elevation . 3 ) Joints well improvement Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale score improve cartilage thickness distribution habitually heavily load portion articular surface improve normalization synovial fluid marker biosynthetic/degradative activity oxidative stress .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Little work do pathogenesis prevention post-traumatic OA . The human ankle joint provide unique opportunity study post-traumatic OA low risk primary OA relatively high risk post-traumatic OA . This study involve multidisciplinary approach utilize laboratory clinical research improve understand OA develop innovative approach prevent treat disease . Mechanical distraction involve operative placement specialize pin rod hold joint place . Some distraction allow limited motion joint , distraction hold joint immobile . The purpose study elucidate mechanical factor lead restoration cartilaginous articular surface , decrease pain , improve joint function mechanical distraction osteoarthritic joint . Participants study randomly assign one two treatment group . Group A treat mechanical distraction motion ; Group B treat mechanical distraction without motion . Participants follow 28 month 11 study visit . Most study visit occur first half study . State-of-the-art technique clinical assessment , articular surface imaging , biomechanical modeling , biochemical testing use study .</detailed_description>
