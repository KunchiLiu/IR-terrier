	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining one drug may kill tumor cell . It yet know whether polyglutamate paclitaxel effective gemcitabine vinorelbine treat non-small cell lung cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness polyglutamate paclitaxel gemcitabine vinorelbine treat patient stage IIIB , stage IV , recurrent non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Polyglutamate Paclitaxel Compared With Gemcitabine Vinorelbine Treating Patients With Advanced Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare efficacy polyglutamate paclitaxel ( CT-2103 ) v gemcitabine vinorelbine , term duration overall survival , patient stage IIIB IV recurrent non-small cell lung cancer performance status 2 . - Compare safety regimens patient . - Compare disease control ( percentage patient disease progression least 12 week ) time progression patient treat regimen . - Compare response rate patient measurable disease treat regimen . - Compare improvement lung cancer symptoms patient treated regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord gender , disease stage ( IV v ) , geographic location ( US vs Western Europe Canada v rest world ) , prior brain metastasis ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive polyglutamate paclitaxel ( CT-2103 ) IV 10 minute day 1 every 21 day . - Arm II : Patients receive gemcitabine IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 every 28 day OR vinorelbine IV 6-10 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 every 21 day . Treatment repeat arm 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 3 week every 8 week thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 370 patient ( 185 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 13 month .</detailed_description>
