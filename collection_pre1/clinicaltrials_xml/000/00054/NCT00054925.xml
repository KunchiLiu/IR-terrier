	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Overweight/obesity second lead cause death US , grow prevalence alarm rate . Control overweight/obesity increasingly recognize high national priority contribution cardiovascular ( CVD ) risk factor ultimately CVD . The short-term success behavioral intervention weight loss repeatedly document . Unfortunately , weight re-gain extremely common , disappointingly , small proportion individual achieve long-term weight control . Of factor associate sustained weight loss , one important continue intervention frequent contact . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study multi-center , randomize , control trial [ Weight Loss Maintenance Trial ( MAINTENANCE ) ] determine effect two innovative behavioral intervention , design maintain frequent contact , compare usual care control group . Overweight obese individual ( 60 % woman , 40 % African Americans ) take medication hypertension , dyslipidemia and/or type 2 diabetes enter 6-month , weight loss program . Those 800 individual lose least 4 kg ( approximately 9 pound ) randomize one three group : Personal Contact ( PC ) Intervention provide monthly personal contact train interventionist , primarily via telephone ; Interactive Technology ( IT ) Intervention provide frequent contact state-of-the-art interactive web-based program supplement communication technology ; Usual Care ( UC ) . The primary outcome weight change end initial weight loss program end 30-month weight maintenance intervention period . Other outcome include weight change subgroup , prevalence CVD risk factor , measure behavior change , cost implementation . For outcome , Personal Contact Interactive Technology intervention compare Usual Care , different Usual Care , . To successfully combat obesity epidemic , clinicians health care system must option effective feasible provide large number individual . Phase II intervention complete : July 2007 Phase III intervention complete : October 2009</detailed_description>
