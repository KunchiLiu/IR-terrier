	<brief_summary>This study evaluate usefulness transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) measure cortical excitability . The cortex out part brain . Patients seizure increase cortical excitability often treat antiepileptic drug reduce excitability . The therapeutic effect antiepileptic drug usually track blood test measure blood level . However , blood test may always correctly reflect effect drug brain . TMS use successfully measure cortical excitability many neurological disease , include epilepsy , may helpful measure drug effect brain directly . For procedure , wire coil hold scalp . A brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . This may cause pull sensation skin coil twitch muscle face , arm , leg . During stimulation , participant may ask tense certain muscle slightly perform simple action . Healthy normal volunteer 18 55 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical neurological examination , electroencephalogram ( EEG ) , blood test . On first day study , participant baseline TMS randomly assign take one two antiepileptic drug : group A take carbamazepine ; group B take lamotrigine . If wish , participant may admit NIH Clinical Center first 5 day drug administration proper dosage determine . They discharge continue take drug total 36 day . During time , daily blood test TMS day 2 5 , day 12 36 . Group A additional blood sample TMS day 37 , 39 , 44 , 53 ; Group B blood test TMS day 38 , 40 , 45 , 53 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives . Epilepsy condition characterize abnormally increased cortical excitability , antiepileptic drug ( AEDs ) control epilepsy reduce cortical excitability . Serum blood level presently represent standard measure utilized track therapeutic effect AEDs . However , peripheral blood level always reflect brain level , provide direct information cortical excitability . Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) non-invasive technique allow accurate measure parameter . The purpose protocol test hypothesis TMS measure cortical excitability correlate serum blood level AEDs , reflect clinical effect cortical function directly healthy volunteer . This information crucial reach ultimate goal develop reliable quantitative measurement central physiological effect AEDs epileptic patient . Study Population . 40 normal volunteer age 18 55 year recruit study . Design . Subjects assign either two group , group receive one follow drug ; carbamazepine ( CBZ ) , lamotrigine ( LTG ) . Measures cortical excitability perform use TMS various drug treatment phase : baseline ( drug intake ) ; AED induction period ( day first 5 day ) , 12 day drug intake maximum dose steady state ; 3 , 7 , 14 half-lives , finally three week abrupt drug withdrawal . Blood sample drug level perform TMS study . Outcome Measures . The primary outcome variable MEP size , measure recruitment curve . MEP size difference baseline compare serum drug level drug .</detailed_description>
