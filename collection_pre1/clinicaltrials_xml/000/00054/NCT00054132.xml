	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well erlotinib hydrochloride bevacizumab work treat patient stage IV breast cancer . Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Giving erlotinib hydrochloride bevacizumab may effective treatment breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib Hydrochloride Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Stage IV Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine efficacy bevacizumab combination OSI-774 ( erlotinib hydrochloride ) patient previously treat metastatic breast cancer , measure objective response rate . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine toxicity bevacizumab combination OSI-774 patient previously treat metastatic breast cancer . II . To evaluate efficacy bevacizumab combination OSI-774 patient previously treat metastatic breast cancer , measure time disease progression , duration response proportion patient stabilization disease &gt; = 6 month . III . To determine molecular profile patient 's primary breast tumor , explore relationship molecular characteristic response treatment . IV . To explore change biological marker pre- post-treatment tumor tissue subset patient accessible site disease . V. To explore pre- post-treatment analysis circulate endothelial cell relationship analysis serum marker angiogenesis well response treatment . VI . To obtain serial measurement circulate epithelial cell explore relationship cell circulate endothelial cell , marker angiogenesis , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) expression . OUTLINE : Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 bevacizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
