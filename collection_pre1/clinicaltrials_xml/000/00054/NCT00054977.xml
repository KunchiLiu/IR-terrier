	<brief_summary>This Phase I , multi-center study GM-CT-01 , show increase anti-tumor activity 5-fluorouracil mouse . The primary reason study determine safety GM-CT-01 give alone combination therapeutical dosage 5-Fluorouracil , patient advance cancer measure CT scan .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety GM-CT-01 With Without 5-Fluorouracil Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>5-Fluorouracil chemotherapy drug commonly use cancer patient . Patients different type solid tumor fail standard , approve treatment enrol study . Escalated dose GM-CT-01 give alone Cycle 1 , combination 5-fluorouracil cycle 2 . Patients study approximately 60 day determination safety . However , patient consent treatment continue disease progression determine CT scan . The study secondary reason determine whether treatment stabilize tumor change size ( get big , small stay ) Cycle 2 additional cycle treatment .</detailed_description>
