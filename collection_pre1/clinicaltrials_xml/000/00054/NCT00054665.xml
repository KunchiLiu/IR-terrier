	<brief_summary>This study examine safety effectiveness experimental drug call Bortezomib ( PS-341 ) , give alone combination chemotherapy regimen call Etoposide , Prednisone , Vincristine , Cyclophosphamide , Doxorubicin Filgrastim ( EPOCH ) , treat non-Hodgkin 's B-cell lymphoma . In laboratory , PS-341 kill lymphoma cell make sensitive chemotherapy . The EPOCH treatment regimen include drug doxorubicin , etoposide , vincristine , cyclophosphamide , prednisone , filgrastim . Patients 18 year age older aggressive non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma relapse treatment respond chemotherapy may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination . Other test may require include blood urine test ; lung function study ; image test magnetic resonance imaging , compute tomography x-ray ; biopsy ( surgical removal small tissue sample ) tumor , bone marrow , tissue . Upon enter study , participant receive PS-341 . The drug give 3- 5-second intravenous ( vein ) injection twice week 2 week . This follow 1-week rest . Each 3-week period comprise one treatment cycle . The number cycle patient receives depend well responds drug . Patients complete remission whose tumor grow therapy offer PS-341 combination six cycle EPOCH chemotherapy . The treatment patient take PS-341 plus EPOCH follow : - PS-341 , give 3- 5-second intravenous ( IV ) injection day 1 4 cycle . - Doxorubicin , etoposide , vincristine , give continuous IV infusion 4 day , begin day 1 end day 5 cycle . The drug deliver lightweight portable infusion pump indwell IV catheter ( plastic tube ) vein . - Cyclophosphamide , give IV infusion 15 minute day 5 cycle . - Prednisone , give mouth ( pill ) twice day day 1 5 cycle . - Filgrastim , give injection skin start day 6 cycle continue white blood cell count increase day 19 cycle . Patients also take combination antibiotic 3 day week EPOCH prevent infection resistance lower chemotherapy . Etoposide , doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide dos adjust need , base white blood cell count previous cycle . The first patient study receive low dose PS-341 . The dose increase subsequent small group patient long precede dose well tolerate . Drug therapy patient candidate bone marrow transplant tailor permit transplantation . Patients eligible choose bone marrow transplant follow National Institutes Health ( NIH ) every 3 month first year , every 4 month second year , every 6 month third year , year disease progress study end . Patients may tumor bone marrow biopsy , blood draw , compute tomography ( CT ) scan periodically evaluate disease status drug side effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) molecularly sub-classified germinal center like B-cell ( GCB ) activate B-cell like ( ABC ) DLBCL . Clinically , ABC subtype significantly high rate drug resistance low survival . The ABC subtype overexpression nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kB ) transcriptional activation B cell lymphoma 2 ( bcl-2 ) , may account drug resistance . The ability NF-kB inhibit response cancer therapeutic agent may also contribute refractory clinical behavior ABC subtype , inhibition NF-kB synergize chemotherapy kill tumor cell . This protocol aim study affect NF-kB inhibition , proteasome inhibition PS-341 , response PS-341 PS-341 EPOCH chemotherapy DLBCL . It also assess affect PS-341 NF-kB BCL-2 tumor expression microarray , provide information specificity PS-341 .</detailed_description>
