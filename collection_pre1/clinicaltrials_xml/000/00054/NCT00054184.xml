	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . It yet know whether polyglutamate paclitaxel effective docetaxel treat non-small cell lung cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness polyglutamate paclitaxel docetaxel treat patient progressive non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Polyglutamate Paclitaxel Compared With Docetaxel Treating Patients With Progressive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare efficacy polyglutamate paclitaxel ( CT-2103 ) v docetaxel second-line therapy , term duration overall survival , patient progressive non-small cell lung cancer . - Compare safety toxicity regimens patient . - Compare disease control ( stable disease maintain least 12 week , partial response , complete response ) progression-free survival patient treat regimen . - Compare improvement lung cancer symptoms patient treated regimen . - Compare frequency grade 3 4 neurotoxicity , edema , alopecia , side effect related corticosteroid patient treat regimen . - Determine percentage patient receive least 4 course study treatment . - Compare response rate patient measurable disease treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord stage ( IV v ) , performance status ( 0 1 v 2 ) , start front-line chemotherapy randomization ( le 16 week vs least 16 week ) , gender , prior taxane therapy ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive polyglutamate paclitaxel ( CT-2103 ) IV 10 minute day 1 . - Arm II : Patients receive docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 . In arm , course repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 3 week every 8 week thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 840 patient ( 420 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 18 month .</detailed_description>
