	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Tipifarnib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary tumor cell growth . Monoclonal antibody trastuzumab locate tumor cell either kill deliver tumor-killing substance without harm normal cell . Combining tipifarnib trastuzumab may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combine tipifarnib trastuzumab treat patient metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tipifarnib Plus Trastuzumab Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine antitumor activity tipifarnib trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) patient metastatic breast cancer . - Determine safety tolerability regimen patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily day 1-21 trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 2 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 18-40 patient accrue study within 9-20 month .</detailed_description>
