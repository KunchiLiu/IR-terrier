	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best way give radiation therapy give together topotecan cisplatin treat patient locally advanced cervical cancer . This trial also study best dose topotecan give regimen . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , topotecan cisplatin , use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining radiation therapy chemotherapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety tolerability pelvic radiotherapy , cisplatin , topotecan patient locally advanced cervical cancer . II . Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) topotecan administer regimen patient population . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine site recurrence ( local v distant ) patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study topotecan . Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 day week 6 week . Patients receive cisplatin IV topotecan IV 30 minute weekly total 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos topotecan maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose 1 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Once MTD determine , additional cohort 20 patient receive treatment MTD . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
