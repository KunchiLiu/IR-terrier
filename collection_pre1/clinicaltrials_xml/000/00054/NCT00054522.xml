	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Calcitriol may help tumor cell develop normal cell . Dexamethasone may increase effectiveness calcitriol make tumor cell sensitive drug . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combine calcitriol dexamethasone treat patient prostate cancer undergone surgery radiation therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Calcitriol Dexamethasone Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer Who Have Undergone Surgery Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine whether calcitriol dexamethasone slow rise prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) level patient early , recurrent prostate cancer prior radical prostatectomy radiotherapy . - Determine safety regimen patient . - Determine utility serum PSA monitoring therapeutic effect calcitriol patient . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord prior therapy ( radical prostatectomy v radiotherapy ) . Patients receive oral calcitriol daily day 1-3 alone week 1 . Beginning week 3 , patient receive calcitriol week 1 oral dexamethasone day 0-4 . Courses repeat every 2 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 56 patient ( 28 per stratum ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
