	<brief_title>Karenitecin Treating Patients With Persistent Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine antitumor activity karenitecin patient persistent recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian epithelial primary peritoneal cancer . II . Determine toxicity drug patient . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive karenitecin IV 1 hour day 1-5 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
