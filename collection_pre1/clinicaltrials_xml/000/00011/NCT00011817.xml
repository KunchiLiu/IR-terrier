	<brief_summary>This study offer evaluation treatment patient inherit ( genetic ) eye disease . The protocol design test new treatment ; rather , patient receive current standard care treatment . The purpose study twofold : 1 ) allow National Eye ( NEI ) Institute physicians increase knowledge various genetic eye disease , identify possible new avenue research area , maintain clinical skill ; 2 ) establish pool patient may eligible new study develop . ( Participants protocol require join new study ; decision voluntary . ) Children adults genetic eye disease may eligible study . Candidates screen medical family history , thorough eye examination blood test . The eye examination include measurement eye pressure visual acuity ( ability see vision chart ) dilation pupil eye drop examine lens retina ( back part eye ) . Patients may also undergo additional diagnostic test need determine eligibility NEI study , include routine laboratory testing , imaging , questionnaire , physical examination , standard specialize test procedure need . In addition , patient special photographs take eye document clarity opacity eye lens . They also undergo procedure call electroretinography ass eye 's response bright light . For procedure , eye numb anesthetic drop contact lens place eye . The patient look inside large , hollow sphere see flash light , first darkness light . The contact lenses sense small electrical signal generate retina . Patients need medical care give appropriate standard medical treatment . Those find eligible research study recommend participation study take one . Participants follow least 3 year . Follow-up visit schedule accord standard care individual patient 's eye problem . Patients protocol probably 1 3 follow-up visit per year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This `` Evaluation Treatment Protocol '' allow geneticist ophthalmic genetic specialist NEI identify , follow provide `` standard care '' treatment patient genetic eye disease . The primary purpose protocol accumulate cohort patient genetic eye disease possible participation NEI study . A secondary purpose provide long-term follow-up treatment variety genetic eye disease genetic specialist NEI well able identify research hypotheses diseases addition maintain clinical skill . The availability cohorts patient spectrum genetic disorder valuable training fellow ophthalmic genetics , important mission NEI . Finally , ability provide long-term follow-up care also facilitate referral effort new NEI protocol . The genetic specialist National Eye Institute free choose genetic condition interest . However , total number patient enrol protocol restrict . This protocol design test new treatment . Any evaluation treatment protocol base current standard care genetic condition . Participants patient evaluation treatment protocol evaluate potential eligibility new NEI clinical study develop . If eligible , patient may ask participate new protocol . However , require enter protocol decision participate entirely voluntary . No 150 patient accept `` Evaluation Treatment Protocol . ''</detailed_description>
