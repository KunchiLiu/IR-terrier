	<brief_summary>This study examine 1 ) whether possible collect enough stem cell ( cell produce bone marrow mature white red blood cell platelet ) patient aplastic anemia use future treatment , 2 ) whether patient treat successfully relapse benefit autologous stem cell transfusion ( transfusion stem cell ) . Patients 12 year age old aplastic anemia successfully treat immunosuppressive drug remission may eligible study . Participants undergo complete history physical examination , bone marrow biopsy ( removal small sample bone marrow hip bone ) blood test , plus procedure collect stem cell , follow : - G-CSF ( Filgrastim ) administration - G-CSF give injection skin daily 10 day . This drug cause stem cell move marrow blood collect easily . - Apheresis - Stem cell collect apheresis , usually start 5th 6th day Filgrastim injection . For procedure , whole blood collect needle arm vein . The blood circulates cell separator machine white cell stem cell remove . The red cell , platelet plasma return body second needle arm . The procedure take 5 hour . Up five procedure , do consecutive day , may require collect enough cell transplantation . If enough cell collect , purify ( treat remove white blood cell ) use experimental device . Removing lymphocyte may reduce chance relapse aplastic anemia follow stem cell transplant . The stem cell freeze later use , need . - Follow-up - Participants follow NIH 6-month interval .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Immune mechanisms responsible hematopoietic failure case acquire aplastic anemia ( AA ) , disease characterize hypocellular bone marrow pancytopenia . In aplastic anemia , much experimental data point toward immune-mediated pathophysiology destruction hematopoietic progenitor stem cell . Clinically , immunosuppressive therapy , usually anti-thymocyte globulin ( ATG ) cyclosporine ( CsA ) , show effective large proportion patient severe AA . However , 2 year initial treatment many 35 % patient initially good response normal blood count relapse require repeat cycle intense immunosuppression and/or chronic immunosuppressive regimen . Although relapse previously immunosuppression-responsive patient generally good prognosis , increase risk complication treatment-related toxicity . The outlook patient fail respond repeat intensive immunosuppression poor . While likely treatment failure occur conventional immunosuppressive regimen ( presentation relapse patient ) may due inability suppress autoimmune process lead bone marrow failure , intense therapy cyclophosphamide high complication rate due prolong dose-related myelosuppression . In protocol , propose patient severe AA show good response initial round immunosuppression undergo stem cell mobilization , collection , cryopreservation . This pilot study 20 patient design evaluate : 1 ) CD34+ cell mobilization response administration standard dose granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) 2 ) potential collect stem cell patient history severe AA give G-CSF . Outcome parameter monitor mobilization response G-CSF , safety profile tolerance G-CSF leukapheresis . Effectiveness gauge historical comparison parameter normal healthy age-matched volunteer . It important point therapeutic intent majority protocol direct benefit enrol patient . We plan , however , cryopreserve remainder mobilized cell collect apheresis possible autologous transplantation event patient 's progression leukemia bone marrow failure future .</detailed_description>
