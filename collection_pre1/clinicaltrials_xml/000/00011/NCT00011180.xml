	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) occur frequently among patient hospitalize major surgery hospitalize medical illness primarily due prolonged duration immobilization . However , many patient undergo major surgery without occurrence VTE . Standard prophylactic therapy surgery heparin , reduces risk VTE . However , heparin associate bleeding complication . Thus , would desirable identify patient high risk VTE might benefit heparin therapy . An important focus study look genetic factor might play important role VTE incidence . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study population base , retrospective case case-control investigation genetic environmental determinant venous thromboembolism Rochester Minnesota Olmsted County population . The first five year study three specific aim . The first specific aim update 1966-1995 inception cohort include Olmsted County resident VTE five year period , 1996-2000 . The second aim extend analysis risk factor VTE identify two Olmsted County resident ( control ) without VTE match age gender definite probable case within 1996-2000 cohort , obtain plasma genomic DNA case control perform case-control study . The third specific aim evaluate efficacy anticoagulant therapy prevent VTE recurrence . The study extend March , 2009 investigate trend incidence venous thromboembolism , new risk factor include lipid-lowering , beta-blocker , ACE-inhibitor therapy , introduction low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) therapy .</detailed_description>
