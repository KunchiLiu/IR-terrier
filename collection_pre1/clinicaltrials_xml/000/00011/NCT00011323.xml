	<detailed_description>Primary Hypothesis : Risk factor smoke , alcohol , caffeine associate osteoporosis men . Intervention : None Primary Outcomes : Percent reduction cross-sectional bone mineral density time . Study Abstract : The goal project establish new cohort male veteran describe association potential risk factor baseline bone mineral density ( BMD ) well rate BMD loss . The study two-year observational prospective study 1000 male veteran age 50 older . The subject draw two exist VA cohort , Normative Aging Study ( NAS ) Veterans Health Study ( VHS ) . Examinations perform subject ( baseline two follow-up exam ) include BMD measurement hip , forearm total body , anthropometry , hand grip strength , questionnaires current diet , physical activity , tobacco , alcohol use , sunlight exposure , health relate quality life ( Medical Outcomes Study Short Form ) , depression ( Brief Depression Scale ) , fracture history , medication psychological factor ( PrimeMD , MiniMental ) . Additional data historical exposure risk factor , previously obtain NAS VHS study , also correlate BMD BMD loss . Multivariate linear logistic model control potential confounders use main analysis . Examinations take place Boston VA Outpatient Clinic . Examinations subject include BMD measurement hip , forearm total body , height weight , hand grip strength , leg extensor strength , mobility . Questionnaires current diet , physical activity , tobacco , alcohol use , sunlight exposure , health relate quality life ( Medical Outcomes Study Short Form ) , depression ( Brief Depression Scale ) , fracture history , medication psychological factor ( PrimeMD , MiniMental ) administer . Each subject also contribute nonfasting blood sample 24-hour urine sample . Beginning April , 1999 , two additional measure obtain result 4-year supplemental VA Epidemiology grant award Dr. Miller . These heel ultrasound measure 4-day physical activity level determine ambulatory monitor . Preliminary cross-sectional analysis mean BMD femoral neck , total body forearm BMD suggest percent reduction cross-sectional BMD age 60-69 80-89 approximately 9 % per decade femoral neck , 5 % /decade total body , 8 % /decade forearm . These age-related pattern agree well study BMD old men . The x-ray densitometer instal Boston VA Outpatient Clinic April , 1998 study technician certify bone density measurement three-day training session follow . A precision study conduct follow month . In vivo reproducibility determine perform 5 repeat scan three site 5 volunteer range age 21 50 year . Subjects reposition scan . The coefficient variation ( CV ) femoral neck BMD laboratory 0.92 % ; whole body BMD , 0.72 % ; distal radius BMD , 1.04 % . An aluminum spine phantom know density ( 1.254 gm/cm2 ) scan every two week DPX-IQ . The mean ? standard deviation 15 measurement 1.250 ? 0.0058 , coefficient variation = 0.46 % . There detectable drift phantom value study start-up phase . When complete , study one large US study risk factor osteoporosis men , historically understudied group relation osteoporosis . Several hypothesize risk factor ( smoking , alcohol , caffeine , example ) amenable change represent potential area intervention . Thus , VA make valuable contribution further understanding osteoporosis men general , strategy may identify reduce morbidity well reduce health care cost associate fracture elderly .</detailed_description>
