	<brief_summary>This study examine safety new genetically engineer antibody call hLL2 ( epratuzumab ) patient systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) . It also evaluate whether hLL2 lessen overall disease activity SLE kidney damage patient lupus nephritis . Patients 18 year age old mild moderately active SLE may eligible study . Candidates screen blood urine test , chest X-ray , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , tuberculin skin test , screen test certain cancer . All participant receive weekly infusion hLL2 4 week . The drug give catheter ( small plastic tube ) place needle arm vein . Each infusion take 2 hour , patient observe clinic 1 2 hour discharge clinic . The first 3 patient study receive low three different dos use study . If dose well tolerate , next 5 patient receive high dose . If second dose tolerate , last 5 patient give high dose . If serious problem encounter dose , patient next group receive either low dose advance next level . Patients first group continue take prednisone regular dose . All patient prednisone taper gradually , condition permit . Patients disease flare may prednisone increase 2 week , follow gradual taper . If flare severe respond increase prednisone , patient take study treat control disease . Patients evaluate various interval 8 week last dose . Several screen test repeat throughout study . No 500 ml blood-the equivalent single blood donation-will collect 2-month period . Participants may also ask undergo follow optional procedure start treatment , 1 week last dose 8 week last treatment dose : - Bone marrow aspiration - collect cell bone marrow . The hip area anesthetize special needle use draw bone marrow hipbone . - Tonsil biopsy - The area biopsied numbed local anesthetic small piece tissue remove special type forceps . ( The procedure may do general anesthetic . ) - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) abdomen - The patient lie table within metal cylinder ( MRI scanner ) 30 40 minute image obtain use strong magnetic field radio wave .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This pilot study evaluate safety tolerance hLL2 ( epratuzumab ) , humanize anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody , patient systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) . B-lymphocytes play major role initiate maintain underlying immunopathological mechanism SLE . In addition produce autoantibody , also serve antigen present cell able disrupt peripheral T lymphocyte tolerance . Furthermore , B lymphocyte depletion ameliorate disease activity animal model SLE . Therefore , target depletion B-lymphocytes may therapeutic benefit human SLE . hLL2 ( epratuzumab ) humanize monoclonal antibody bind CD22 , surface antigen express exclusively B-lymphocytes . Clinical study patient B cell lymphomas show epratuzumab safe well tolerate across wide range dos . Although exact mechanism unknown , indirect evidence suggest antibody deplete target B lymphocytes . Epratuzumab make available Immunomedics , Inc. , use investigator ( NIH ) -initiated IND . In open-label , Phase I study , 20 patient moderately active SLE may enrol . Patients treat weekly infusion hLL2 one three different dose group [ ( 240 mg/m ( 2 ) , 360 mg/m ( 2 ) , 480 mg/m ( 2 ) ] 4 week , follow 8 week last dose . The primary objective determine safety tolerability hLL2 patient SLE . In addition safety data , clinical laboratory data also collect preliminary evaluation effectiveness hLL2 SLE ass effect hLL2 B T lymphocytes lymphoid organ peripheral blood . If treatment safe preliminary evidence efficacy , regimen could use control trial future .</detailed_description>
