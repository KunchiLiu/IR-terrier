	<detailed_description>Stroke third lead cause disability United States . To date , conventional rehabilitation able restore normal , safe , gait many individual stroke . We identify nine gait component deficit respond FNS-IM intervention . This study test refine treatment protocol 3 month duration restore volitional gait restore nine gait component simultaneously . In addition , incorporate treatment protocol promise non-invasive technique partial body weight-supported ( BWS ) gait train treadmill . BWS FNS-IM potential provide additive effect patient restore volitional gait quickly completely would otherwise possible one technique alone . Therefore , first hypothesis HYPOTHESIS I : BWS combine FNS-IM , simultaneously apply nine critical gait component , restore volitional normal , safe gait patient chronic stroke within 3 month . An advantage BWS gait train non-invasive . Consequently , must demonstrate additive advantage FNS-IM technique alone . Therefore second hypothesis : HYPOTHESIS II : FNS-IM plus BWS restore volitional gait quickly completely patient chronic stroke compare BWS alone . A total thirty six chronic stroke patient randomly divide two treatment group ( 1 ) FNS-IM plus BWS ; ( 2 ) BWS alone . Outcome measure hypothesis test threefold : 1 ) Gait normality ( kinematics nine gait component ) ; 2 ) Safety ( number fall ) ; 3 ) Functionality ( gait speed , walk endurance , CHART , handicap measure mobility activity level ) . Data collect every four week three month treatment . Maintenance gain monitor two additional data collection six month one year follow end treatment period . Results study potential provide follow clinically applicable information : 1 . For patient stroke , refine treatment protocol 3 month duration restoration normal , safe , volitional gait practical within current healthcare milieu . 2 . A definitive recommendation regard effective treatment chronic stroke patient : ( 1 ) BWS plus FNS-IM ( 2 ) BWS alone . RESEARCH OBJECTIVES 1 . Build stimulators electrode . 2 . Obtain measure pre post intervention two group ( FNS-IM + BWS ; BWS alone ) detect gain : ) gait pattern ; b ) safety ; c ) functional capability ; ) quality life . 3 . Analyze data group receive FNS-IM + BWS , order test Hypothesis I . 4 . Produce therapy protocols FNS-IM BWS intervention , treatment progression . 5 . Test Hypothesis II compare two treatment group ( BWS vs BWS + FNS-IM ) .</detailed_description>
