	<brief_summary>This project examine reproductive effect exposure certain compound suspect act endocrine system , e.g . may act like interfere hormone estrogen . The study conduct among Laotian woman , suspect may higher exposure compound interest ( pesticide PCBs ) homeland consumption fish catch San Francisco Bay . Fifty Laotian immigrant recruit community worker collect urine daily 3 menstrual cycle measurement steroid hormone ( estrogen progesterone ) . Additionally , provide blood sample measure exposure level , complete 2 interview native language . These measured level , well self-reported data number factor include fish consumption , examine possible effect hormone level menstrual function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We conduct study examine whether woman expose chlorinated pesticide PCBs alteration ovarian function measure frequency menstrual cycle disturbance . Such disturbance may impact frequency infertility sub-fertility , well hormone-dependent illness breast cancer osteoporosis . The target population group Laotian immigrant frequent consumer fish catch locally San Francisco Bay . Contaminant level health protective advisory document Bay fish shellfish number substance . Immigration Asia , well consumption contaminate fish , show associate high organochlorine pesticide body burden . Exposure determine measure serum level panel pesticide metabolite , include DDT , chlordane , hepatochlor others , well PCB congener . In addition , mercury level measure blood . Menstrual function assess measure urinary metabolite steroid hormone daily three menstrual cycle 50 Laotian woman reproductive age . The participant also ask complete two detailed in-person interview various factor , include fish consumption . We previously conduct study menstrual function group 400 woman develop algorithms determine ovulatory status , day ovulation menstrual cycle disturbance short luteal phase also apply new sample . This previously collect sample ( Asians therein ) serve baseline comparison group current sample . In addition , provide source data effect lifestyle ( smoke alcohol consumption ) demographic ( age ethnicity ) factor menstrual function , allow efficient examination small group expose woman current study . In addition serum organochlorine level , questionnaire measure exposure ( e.g . species-specific fish consumption , occupational exposure previous residence ) examine relation ovarian function define continuous measure ( e.g . cycle length , steroid conjugate level ) dichotomous abnormality ( e.g . short luteal phase anovulation ) . At time data collection complete , hormone measure analysis begin . In work refugee , low socioeconomic status community adopt model participatory research . Steps take develop partnership various community organization . Staff speak one three prominent dialect ( Mien , Lao , Khmu ) hire local community provide training present information reproductive environmental health community . Participants compensate time , well provide educational material reproductive health , safe consumption seafood result .</detailed_description>
