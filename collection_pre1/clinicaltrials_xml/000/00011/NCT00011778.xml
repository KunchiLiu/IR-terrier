	<brief_summary>This study test safety effect experimental drug PS-341 plus radiation therapy patient head neck cancer . PS-341 slow halt growth cancer cell grown culture mouse . In addition , drug appear enhance effectiveness radiation treatment . Patients 18 year age old head neck cancer treat adequately surgery cured standard radiation chemotherapy may eligible study . Patients whose cancer spread brain may participate . Before treatment begin participant evaluate CT MRI scan head , neck chest area determine extent cancer ; electrocardiogram blood test ; neurocardiovascular evaluation include measure blood pressure different body position involve injection phenylephrine nitroglycerine . Some patient may undergo procedure tube insert larynx ( voice box ) , bronchus ( breathe tube ) esophagus ( food tube ) tissue sample remove . This procedure do general anesthesia operating room . Patients receive radiation treatment Monday Friday injections PS-341 twice week radiation therapy . After 3 week treatment , PS-341 injection stop 2 week . Some patient continue receive radiation treatment 2-week break , others , depend upon enter trial . The total duration radiation treatment vary 6 8 week , depend whether patient receive radiation region head neck cancer enter study . Patients blood sample drawn new PS-341 injection measure drug action blood see strong long effect blood last . They see clinic least week history physical examination . A blood sample collect visit look toxic effect PS-341 . Near end treatment , neurocardiovascular evaluation repeat , result abnormal , repeat 3 month treatment complete . X-rays MRI scan do 12 week radiation therapy end every month determine extent disease . Patients whose tumor accessible ask undergo biopsy ( removal small piece tumor tissue ) first second day receive first PS-341 dose examine effect drug tumor . The PS-341 dose increase successive group least 3 patient high dose give safely radiation reach . Patients develop severe side effect drug temporarily stop take allow side effect improve . If need , dose may decrease . Radiation therapy may also stop temporarily patient develop severe effect mouth , throat skin . Side effect may treat increased fluid ( mouth , stomach tube , vein ) , anti-nausea anti-diarrhea medication , pain medication medication boost red white cell count platelet . The drug Florinef may give help regulate body fluid blood pressure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway regulate degradation important regulatory protein transcription factor control cell cycle cell death . Proteasome inhibition lead block different phase cell cycle , block expression gene prevent cell death induce radiation cytotoxic therapeutic agent . - In preclinical study , proteasome inhibitor PS-341 demonstrate cytotoxic , radiosensitizing , anti-tumor activity squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) . Objectives : - The primary objective phase I dose escalation clinical study determine maximum tolerate dose PS-341 give concomitant radiation patient recurrent metastatic squamous cell carcinoma head neck . - Secondary objective include detection 20S proteasome inhibition , cell cycle block , apoptosis inhibition transcription factor NF-kappaB activation tumor tissue biopsy follow PS-341 radiation . Eligibility : - Persistent recurrent SCCHN , - Eligible local primary re-irradiation , - ECOG performance less equal 2 , life expectancy &gt; 3 month , - Adequate organ function ( PLT &gt; 100 , 000/microL , neutrophil &gt; 1500/mciroL , serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) , serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 time ULN , serum transaminase &lt; 2.5 time ULN ) - No systemic chemotherapy within past 4 week recover chemotherapy toxicity , - &gt; 6 month since prior radiation . Design : - Phase I dose escalation , standard 3+3 statistical design , 51 subject , - PS-341 give escalate dos 0.6 , 0.9 1.2 mg/m ( 2 ) cohort 3 patient IV bolus M , Th ( T , F ) , radiation give 1.8 Gy fraction M-F 60 Gy previously radiate 72Gy previously unirradiated patient . - Radiation and/or drug give two course split two week rest allow recovery combine modality therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Patients must meet follow inclusion criterion : Patients histologically confirm SCCHN persistent recurrent unresectable ; patient present develop distant metastasis follow standard curative measure , local regional disease amenable radiation reirradiation therapy eligible . Patients history treatment prior malignancy eligible , provide remain diseasefree 2 year initial treatment , treat nonmelanoma skin cancer , situ cervical cancer . Because great potential acute toxicity previously irradiate patient , patient stratify base whether receive prior radiation . Stratum A : Prior radiation therapy ( great 6 month ) without prior surgery chemotherapy . Stratum B : No prior radiation therapy , great equal 4 week surgery chemotherapy . Age great 18 year age . Because dose toxicity data currently available use PS341 patient less 18 year age , child include study . Further , SCCHN patient less 18 year age exceedingly rare . ECOG performance status less equal 2 ( Karnofsky great 50 % ) . Life expectancy great 3 month . Patients must adequate organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count great 1,500/microliter platelet great 100,000/microliter total bilirubin le 1.5 time ULN AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less 2.5 time ULN serum creatinine le 1.5 time ULN &lt; TAB &gt; creatinine clearance great 60 mL/min/1.73 ( 2 ) patient creatinine level equal great 1.5 time ULN . The effect PS341 gametogenesis develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason , men woman childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( barrier method birth control ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating spouse enrol study , inform treat physician immediately . Because potential risk toxicity nursing infant secondary PS341 treatment mother unknown may harmful , breastfeed discontinue mother treated PS341 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients surgery , chemotherapy , immunotherapy within 4 week , radiotherapy head neck within 6 month prior enter study . For palliative radiation site , least one month must elapse end radiation begin therapy protocol toxicity must resolve . Patients undergo therapy investigational agent . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic toxicity . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within past 6 month , unstable angina pectoris , unstable cardiac arrhythmia , require assessment clinical intervention . Pregnant nursing woman exclude study PS341 investigational agent unknown effect fetus nurse infant . HIVpositive patient exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction medication necessary control HIV complication owe uncertain interaction PS341 immune function . Patients postural hypotentsion due severe baroreceptor dysfunction previous radiation and/or surgery define ) postural hypotension correct volume repetition systolic blood pressure great 100 mm Hg absence orthostatic change symptoms ; b ) postural hypotension correct volume repletion systolic blood pressure great 120 mm Hg orthostatic change absence symptom . Patients hyponatremia correctable great equal 130 mEq/L exclude .</criteria>
