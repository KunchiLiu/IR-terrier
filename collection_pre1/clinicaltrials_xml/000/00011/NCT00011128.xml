	<brief_summary>The purpose study test another way control amount HIV blood ( viral load ) . Studies show stop anti-HIV drug time switch new anti-HIV drug may improve response individual fail treatment . Other study suggest benefit drug-resistance test use select new anti-HIV drug treatment . This study test effect stop anti-HIV drug time switch anti-HIV drug select use drug-resistance test result .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Virologic failure occur large proportion individual receive treatment combination antiretroviral therapy . Studies suggest treatment interruption prior initiation multiple-drug rescue regimen may improve virologic response individual fail several prior antiretroviral regimen . Other study suggest virologic benefit derive use genotypic phenotypic resistance test select salvage therapy regimens patient fail antiretroviral therapy . This study test hypothesis salvage regimens select basis HIV-1 resistance genotype , phenotype [ AS PER AMENDMENT 02/19/02 : virtual phenotype ] , treatment history effective period treatment interruption initiate regimen . Patients continue antiretroviral therapy randomization . Based result pre-entry genotype phenotype [ AS PER AMENDMENT 02/19/02 : virtual phenotype ] test treatment history , individualized salvage therapy regimen ( provide study ) select site investigator ( ) . Additionally , patient start continue maintenance therapy ( provide study ) opportunistic infection ( OIs ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . In Arm A , patient antiretroviral treatment interruption period 16 week ( Step 1 ) , follow initiation [ AS PER AMENDMENT 02/19/02 : best available ] salvage therapy regimen ( Step 2 ) . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 02/19/02 : Patients Arm A placed immediately individualized salvage regimen end 16-week period treatment interruption CD4 count fall define threshold , develop new OI ] . In Arm B , patient switch immediately salvage therapy regimen . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 02/15/01 : Patients become pregnant Step 1 Arm A must advise begin select , individualized salvage therapy regimen modify salvage regimen . Patients become pregnant Step 2 Arm A Arm B therapy evaluate undergo change require pregnancy . ] Patients arm monitor plasma HIV-1 RNA level , CD4+ CD8+ cell count , HIV drug resistance genotype phenotypes duration 64 week randomization . Patients Arm A also monitor immune reactivation measurement T-cell subset plasma cytokine treatment interruption . Patients may participate virology substudy ( A5100s ) immunology substudy ( A5104s ) . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 02/19/02 : Patients volunteer participate substudies must register main study time register substudy . ]</detailed_description>
