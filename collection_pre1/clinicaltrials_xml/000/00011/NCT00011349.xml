	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : Evaluate risk factor predict transformation early stage clinically aggressive disease . Intervention : None Study Abstract : Environmental factor diet cigarette smoking may play role predict progression early stage prostate cancer advance disease . The goal project establish observational cohort patient early stage prostate cancer elect undergo radical prostatectomy radiation therapy evaluate risk factor predict transformation early stage clinically aggressive disease . A total 1,000 US male veteran early stage prostate cancer recruit participate study . In order maximize African-American participation , VA medical center serve large minority population utilized recruitment . Eligible participant must early stage prostate cancer diagnosis ( T0-T2 ) know involved lymph node metastasis , prior history cancer ( exception nonmelanoma skin cancer ) major illness would preclude long term participation . Individuals willing participate administer lifestyle questionnaire dietary assessment . The lifestyle survey ascertain baseline demographic , mode cancer diagnosis , medical history , smoking , family history prostate cancer , alcohol use , level physical activity , potential risk factor prostate cancer progression . Nutritional parameter measure self-administered , semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire . A blood specimen also collect genetic biochemical research . Participants follow annually additional lifestyle dietary questionnaire . Both survey currently test pilot project population prostate cancer survivor assess feasibility collect diet lifestyle data veteran refine study method recruitment strategy ( current version survey include ) . A pilot study conduct test different survey type mail technique . The result pilot project help improve survey methodology refine survey research tool accurately assess dietary lifestyle factor . Lifestyle survey create ascertain baseline demographic potential risk factor prostate cancer survival progression . Two version generate test participant response vary survey length ( short form vs. long form ) . The initial mailing lifestyle dietary survey direct 836 veteran diagnosed prostate cancer Boston VA Healthcare Network ( ICD-9 code patient treatment file ) . Surveys send 132 African-American veteran , 342 white veteran , 362 veteran know race . An Access database develop track survey response blood collection site establish VA health facility Boston area . A phone track system establish answer participant question survey . A total 251 ( 30 % ) veteran complete survey 72 % agree provide blood sample . The response rate 11 % African-Americans , 28 % white , 27 % unknown race . Follow-up mailing currently send veteran n't respond initial survey request . A telephone survey design target African-American non-responders improve survey response cohort . Prostate cancer commonly diagnose cancer men second common cause cancer death among men United States . Counseling patient early stage disease treatment option extremely difficult since relative benefit different approach know . The evidence date indicate clear benefit invasive intervention watchful wait . In addition , little know risk factor predict transformation early stage prostate cancer clinically aggressive disease . This particular concern VA since third veteran age 65 . The ability differentiate individual early stage prostate cancer disease become clinically aggressive would enormous benefit . It would help allay anxiety indolent disease potentially reduce morbidity mortality disease likely become clinically aggressive .</detailed_description>
