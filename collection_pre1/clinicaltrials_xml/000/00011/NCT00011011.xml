	<brief_summary>Long-term control HIV depend improvement individual 's immune system . The purpose study see either stop anti-HIV drug short period time and/or add vaccine anti-HIV drug take help good control HIV infection . The study test whether treatment approach safe . The HIV vaccine study test people HIV infection improve way immune system work . This study evaluate whether immune system change happen people HIV , , change occur , assess whether change help improve control HIV patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine ( ALVAC-HIV vCP1452 ) Use Intermittent Withdrawal Anti-HIV Drugs Patients With HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The best hope long-term control HIV infection individual likely rest resumption effective HIV-specific immune response . Intermittent antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) withdrawal , attempt `` immunize '' subject his/her active viral quasi-species population , represent alternative approach traditional immunization strategy . This study hop determine whether intermittent ART withdrawal serf stimulate HIV-specific immune response control viral replication . This approach compare vaccination ALVAC-HIV vCP1452 . In addition , conceivable intermittent ART withdrawal could boost broaden prime response exogenous vaccine ; also study . Patients continue receive potent ART ( provide study ) randomly assign one four treatment strategy follow : Arm A : ALVAC placebo potent ART 92 week single 12- 20-week therapy withdrawal period ; Arm B : ALVAC placebo potent ART 84 week 4- 6-week therapy withdrawal period , 4-week therapy withdrawal period , 12- 20-week therapy withdrawal period ; Arm C : ALVAC vCP1452 vaccine potent ART 92 week single 12- 20-week therapy withdrawal period ; Arm D : ALVAC vCP1452 vaccine potent ART 84 week 4- 6-week therapy withdrawal period , 4-week therapy withdrawal period , 12- 20-week therapy withdrawal period . Immunizations placebo vaccine wil administer 3 separate set 3 injection per set ( 9 total ) immunization schedule patient , undergoing intermittent therapy withdrawal ( Arms B D ) ( Arms A C ) . This multiple-step study . Patients Arms B D receive 4-week period potent ART therapy along first set immunization ( Step 1 ) follow therapy withdrawal 4 6 week ( Step 2 ) . Alternating period therapy resumption ( Step 3 , consist 16 week potent ART second set vaccine administration ) , second therapy withdrawal ( Step 4 4 week ) , another therapy resumption ( Step 5 , consist 16 week potent ART third set vaccine administration ) follow . Patients Arms A C remain Step 1 first 44 week study . After 44 46 week study , patient arm therapy withdrawn 12 20 week ( Step 6 ) . Following completion Step 6 , patient whose viral load 10,000 copies/ml encourage remain potent ART ( Step 7 ) completion study , long CD4 T-cell level remain 50 percent baseline level . Participants successfully complete Step 7 invite enter Step 9 , 48-week optional protocol extension . Otherwise , patient restart potent ART regimen ( Step 8 ) receive virologic CD4 T-cell monitoring completion study . All patient monitor regular clinic visit . Viral load CD4 T-cell count measure visit . Patients arm may participate substudy A5101s ( Male Genital Secretions ) substudy A5137s ( Female Genital Secretions ) , patient Arms B D may participate substudy A5111s ( Latent Infected T-Cell Clearance ) .</detailed_description>
