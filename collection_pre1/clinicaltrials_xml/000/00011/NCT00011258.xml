	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : Atherosclerosis carotid artery common cause stroke . The prevalence progression carotid atherosclerosis believe influence genetically inherit variation lipoprotein metabolism . This study investigate specific role paraoxonase , enzyme think detoxify atherogenic oxidize low-density lipoprotein . This study compare veteran significant carotid atherosclerosis ultrasound examination control without carotid atherosclerosis . Both paraoxonase activity genotype determine compare group . The result may eventually make possible screen paraoxonase allele confers high risk atherosclerosis , diminish risk early treatment . Study Abstract : The general aim propose research evaluate contribution mechanism paraoxonase ( PON1 ) genotypic phenotypic variation ( PON1 status ) risk progression carotid artery disease ( CAAD ) . We propose study moderately affected individual currently enrol longitudinal , 3-year magnetic resonance imaging ( MR ) study evaluate component MR image predictor CAAD progression . We study role PON1 CAAD progression cohort . We also collect age- , sex- , race- , hospital- matched control , test hypothesis relate presence absence CAAD . We plan consider complex genetic architecture vascular disease PON1 effect vascular disease . In addition evaluate know paraoxonase ( PON1 ) polymorphism , evaluate PON1 hydrolysis phenotype . We show intervene phenotype superior know genotype CAAD prediction . We also evaluate PON1 polymorphism recently detect show affect PON1 expression , well consider haplotype effect . The specific aim : 1 ) test PON1 effect CAAD progression evaluate 3 year magnetic resonance image follow-up percent lumen stenosis ; 2 ) test PON1 effect moderate CAAD vs. control prediction , include independence PON1 traditional cardiovascular risk factor ; 3 ) evaluate possible mechanism PON1 's association carotid artery disease , specifically PON1 's relationship susceptibility LDL oxidation variation LDL density . Two paraoxonase ( PON1 ) polymorphism , PON1-Q192R PON1-L55M inconsistently associate vascular disease . However , plasma PON1 activity phenotype vary markedly within genotype . Thus , activity expect add informativeness genotype predict vascular disease . The case-control study include 212 age race match men mean age 66.4 yr. ( range 49-82 yr. ) ; 95 % Caucasian . The 106 carotid artery disease ( CAAD ) case &gt; 80 % carotid stenosis 106 control &lt; 15 % stenosis . Two PON1 substrate hydrolysis rate ( paraoxon , POase ; diazoxon , DZOase ) significantly low case control significant predictor CAAD use logistic regression ( POase , p=0.005 , 25 % reduce ; DZOase , p=0.019 , 16 % reduce ) . POase DZOase significant include model . DZOase predict vascular disease independently lipoprotein profile , HDL subfractions , apoAI , smoking . The marginal effect PON1-192 ( p=0.75 ) PON1-55 ( p=0.83 ) genotypes haplotype ( 0.70 ) predict case-control status . However , phenotype include predictor PON1-192 PON1-55 genotype haplotypes significant predictor 0.05 level . The common methodology examine PON1-192 and/or PON1-55 genotype alone may lead erroneous conclusion PON1 role CAAD . This may broad implication utility `` genotype '' approach . These result support benefit `` level crossing '' approach include intervene phenotype study complexly inherit disease</detailed_description>
