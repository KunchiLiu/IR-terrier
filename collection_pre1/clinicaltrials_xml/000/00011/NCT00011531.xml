	<detailed_description>Many spinal cord injury ( SCI ) otherwise debilitated patient develop pressure ulcer course injury disease . Despite enhance wound care management , many pressure ulcer heal completely require surgical myocutaneous rotational flap coverage . Even often recur . HYPOTHESIS : Subatmospheric pressure dressing ( SPD ) treatment applied pressure ulcer either completely close , heal point allow skin graft coverage , often 0.9 % normal saline wet-to-moist dressing ( WTMD ) treatment . OBJECTIVES : The objective study : ( 1 ) conduct control comparative study effectiveness subatmospheric pressure dressing ( SPD ) heal pressure ulcer versus conventional saline wet-to-moist dressing technique ; ( 2 ) establish indication contra-indications use SPD In treat pressure ulcer ; ( 3 ) develop noninvasive , clinically usable optical digitizer associate software measurement wound geometry standardize quantitative assessment longitudinal monitoring wound heal . RESEARCH METHODS : 120 patient stage III IV pressure ulcer meeting project selection criterion recruit project . Patients randomly assign 3:1 ( SPD WTMD ) ratio either control group receive 0.9 % normal saline wet-to-moist wound dress treatment , subatmospheric pressure dress group . All subject select stratify accord degree wound severity , nutritional status , evidence wound infection . The WTMD group receive 0.9 % NS moisten gauze apply wound , change every 8 hour . The SPD group receive SPD dress VACTM system set constant subatmospheric pressure negative 125 mmHg . The SPD device dress leave place change every Monday , Wednesday , Friday . The subject ' pressure ulcer measure day 0 weekly basis . Ulcer surface shape , area , coloration record digital camera also trace ulcer perimeter flexible translucent plastic film grid overlaid wound . In addition , optical laser scanner use record ulcer shape , area , coloration , body/limb segmental volume region wound . Volume also measure use alginate wound impression form RTV silicone mold fluid displacement measurement . The mold wound also optically digitize wound perimeter , topical surface area , total 3-D surface area , volume calculate use computer image processing , planimetry , volumetry software develop project . Local body/limb segment volume also calculate monitor edematous fluctuation . Based measurement , wound response score describe Table 2 one month time patient 's withdrawal study . The association response level treatment type analyze use Chi-square test association . Mantel-Haenszel Chi-square logistic regression use control prognostic variable .</detailed_description>
