	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The primary goal Dose-Response Exercise Women age 45-75 Years ( DREW ) investigate effect different amount exercise cardiorespiratory fitness risk factor cardiovascular disease . Participants sedentary , overweight obese , postmenopausal woman high normal blood pressure Stage I hypertension , thus moderately high risk cardiovascular disease . A total 464 woman ( 35 % recruited minority group ) randomly assign control group ( N = 102 ) 1 3 exercise group ( N = 155 low exercise dose 104 8-kcal/kg group 103 12-kcal/kg exercise group ) . Women assign exercise group exercise 6 month energy expenditures 4 , 8 , 12 kcal ·kg-1 · week-1 . These exercise dose represent consensus public health recommendation physical activity recently publish guideline U.S. Public Health Service , American Heart Association , American College Sports Medicine ( 8 kcal ·kg-1 · week-1 ) dose 50 % ( 4 kcal ·kg-1 · week-1 ) 50 % ( 12 kcal ·kg-1 · week-1 ) consensus dose . All woman exercise 50 % V02 max . The exercise session take place exercise laboratory , individual supervision session strict control frequency , duration , intensity . This provide thorough documentation exact amount exercise complete . Primary outcome measure VO2 max rest systolic blood pressure . Other cardiovascular disease risk factor , psychosocial variable , health-related quality life , body composition , fat distribution secondary outcome . Other secondary analysis include focus extent observe dose-response effect modify baseline level fitness , ethnicity , risk factor , age . Assessments take place baseline 6 month . The research provide information ( 1 ) pattern change outcomes produce several exercise dos , ( 2 ) whether perform exercise le current consensus dose benefit , ( 3 ) whether perform exercise consensus dose great ( proportionally great ) health benefit , ( 4 ) characteristic sedentary woman likely benefit various exercise dos . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A total 464 sedentary , postmenopausal woman moderate risk cardiovascular disease randomly assign receive exercise train one three dos ( 4 , 8 , 12 kcal/kg/wk ) exercise six month duration . The specific aim determine : ( ) woman exercise group increase aerobic power ( VO2max ) six month compare exercise group ; ( b ) woman exercise group great reduction rest systolic blood pressure exercise group ; , ( c ) dose-response gradient across three exercise group change aerobic power systolic blood pressure . Secondary aim include evaluate effect exercise dose fast blood lipid lipoprotein , glucose , insulin , anthropometry , self-reported quality life , cardiovascular risk determine multiple logistic risk function . Covariates control include dietary intake , physical activity ( outside exercise program ) , smoke , alcohol intake , sleep habit , medication use ( include hormone replacement therapy ) , demographic , menstrual history , personal family medical history .</detailed_description>
