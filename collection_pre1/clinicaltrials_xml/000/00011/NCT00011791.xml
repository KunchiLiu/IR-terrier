	<brief_summary>This study examine compare effect intense exercise release catecholamines patient congenital adrenal hyperplasia ( CAH ) healthy person . Catecholamines hormone ( adrenaline noradrenaline ) produce adrenal gland release blood stream stress , trauma , illness , intense exercise , low blood sugar . The study also assess exercise tolerance patient CAH , compare healthy person . Patients CAH age 10 40 year manage well standard treatment ( glucocorticoid , mineralocorticoid ) may eligible study . Healthy volunteer match enrol patient age , sex , race body fat recruit control subject . All candidate screen medical history , physical examination electrocardiogram ( EKG ) . Body fat measure use instrument call Bod Pod . The body fat measurement two part : first , subject sits quietly large egg-shaped capsule 2 3 minute ; subject breathes plastic tube one minute , follow three quick pant breath . Women urine pregnancy test ; pregnant woman participate study . Participants undergo three exercise session separate consecutive morning fast overnight . Before test , patient ( healthy volunteer ) take either additional morning dose hydrocortisone placebo ( lookalike pill active ingredient ) . Before test thin catheter ( plastic tube ) place arm vein needle . A numbing cream apply make needle stick hurt less . Blood drawn intravenous ( IV ) line , exercise test . The first test maximal exercise test determine individual 's maximum exercise fitness capacity . The second two third test standardize exercise test . Before two standardized test , patient ( healthy volunteer ) take either additional morning dose hydrocortisone placebo ( lookalike pill active ingredient ) . All test do stationary bicycle . Maximal Exercise Test - The subject pedal stationary bicycle 10 minute . After 3-minute warm-up , workload increase continuously either subject long continue physician stop test medical reason . During exercise , heart rate heart activity monitor EKG , subject wear nose clip mouthpiece connect breathe tube measure oxygen use . Blood drawn test , total 2 tablespoon . Standardized Exercise Test - The subject pedal stationary bicycle 20 minute , wear nose clip mouthpiece measure oxygen use . For first 5 minute , subject pedal speed elicits 50 percent maximal effort ( determine maximal exercise test ) ; next 10 minute 70 percent maximal effort ; last 5 minute 90 percent . Blood sample drawn , ( 15 20 minute ) exercise ( 30 , 40 60 minute ) total less 1/2 cup . Heart rate heart activity monitor test EKG , temperature measure end test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Catecholamine Reserve Exercise Tolerance Healthy Volunteers Patients With Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Congenital adrenal hyperplasia ( CAH ) denote family inherit disorder defect cortisol biosynthesis . CAH traditionally consider disease restrict adrenal cortex . However , recently observe abnormal adrenomedullary structure three adrenalectomized patient classic CAH , well low baseline urinary plasma epinephrine level child CAH suggest condition associate marked morphological functional abnormality adrenal medulla . The adrenal medulla synthesize secretes catecholamine , mainly epinephrine . Catecholamines influence virtually tissue . Yet , clinical implication epinephrine deficiency human clear . Short-term intense exercise natural , quantifiable stimulus adrenal cortex medulla well sympathetic nervous system . We would like employ standard cycle ergometer exercise protocol study adrenomedullary systemic sympathetic function patient CAH . This protocol run Clinical Center Rehabilitation Medicine Department ( RMD ) 10 year . No serious adverse effect observe report adult child healthy cardiovascular system . The goal protocol evaluate adrenomedullary systemic sympathetic function exercise tolerance patient CAH appropriately match healthy control use standardized cycle ergometer test . Subjects CAH exercise without double morning dose hydrocortisone evaluate whether impairment - present - correct `` stress dose '' hydrocortisone . We hypothesize subject CAH reduce epinephrine reserve impair exercise tolerance , least partially , correct increase exogenous hydrocortisone . We also determine whether systemic sympathetic nervous system compensate adrenomedullary deficiency observe state acquire adrenal insufficiency . The result study increase understand physiologic interaction adrenal cortex adrenal medulla .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Age : 940 year . CAH patient conventional therapy ( glucocorticoid , mineralocorticoid ) good clinical management define follow criterion : 1 . 17OHprogesterone level 100 1500 ng/dL ; 2 . Plasma renin activity normal ; 3 . Growth rate within 2 SD age ( child ) ; 4 . No new sign symptom virilization ( clitoral growth , voice deepen ) female . Healthy volunteer match age , sex , race body fat . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Inability understand comply instruction relate study ( judged investigator ) . Chronic medical condition congenital adrenal hyperplasia except mild condition ( e.g . allergic rhinitis , migraine headache ) exclude provided subject acutely ill require medication condition study . Acute medical condition include intercurrent infection fever precede 7 day . Positive pregnancy test . CAH patient flutamide . Tylenol acetaminophencontaining medicine ( e.g . overthecounter cold medicine ) within 5 day test period . Caffeine , alcohol strenuous exercise within 24 h test period . Current smoker .</criteria>
