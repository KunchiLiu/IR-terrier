	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Ovarian Epithelial Cancer Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Compare efficacy paclitaxel carboplatin without gemcitabine , doxorubicin HCl liposome , topotecan , term overall progression-free survival , patient stage III IV ovarian epithelial serous primary peritoneal carcinoma . Determine response rate patient measurable disease treat regimen . Compare toxic effect regimens patient . Compare complication patient treat regimen . Determine dose-intensity cumulative dose delivery regimens patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify 1 3 stratum accord extent residual disease plan interval cytoreductive surgery : Stratum A : Optimal ( microscopic macroscopic ) residual disease without plan surgery Stratum B : Suboptimal residual disease without plan surgery Stratum C : Suboptimal residual disease plan surgeryPatients randomize 1 5 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment continue every 3 week 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Arm II : Patients receive chemotherapy arm I gemcitabine IV 30 minute day 1 8 . Treatment continue arm I . Arm III : Patients receive chemotherapy arm I course 1-8 doxorubicin HCl liposome IV 1 hour day 1 course 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . Treatment continue arm I . Arm IV : Patients receive topotecan IV 30 minute day 1-3 carboplatin IV 30 minute day 3 . Treatment continue every 3 week 4 course . Patients receive 4 course arm I chemotherapy . Arm V : Patients receive gemcitabine IV 30 minute day 1 8 carboplatin IV 30 minute day 8 . Treatment continue every 3 week 4 course . Patients receive 4 course arm I chemotherapy . Patients initial unresectable suboptimal residual disease ( 1 cm ) may undergo interval cytoreductive surgery course 4 5 chemotherapy . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 4,000-5,000 patient ( 800-1,000 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 3.5-5 year .</detailed_description>
