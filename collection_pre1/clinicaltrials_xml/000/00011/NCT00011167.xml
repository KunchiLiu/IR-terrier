	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Blood vessel retina eye provide valuable window evaluate quantitatively small vessel arteriosclerosis ( arteriolar narrowing , arterio-venous nick arterio-to-venule ratio ( AVR ) ) . Previous study suggest optic fundus vascular parameter may useful measure generalize vascular disease may important prognostic implication . This study address issue quantitative way use establish cohort previously acquire fundic photograph . The study address important public health problem finding may identify at-risk patient would benefit early intervention . The establish cohort Beaver Dam Eye Study cohort , well-characterized population predominantly white person age 43-86 year baseline 1988-1990 . The cohort originally evaluate 1988-1990 routine clinical laboratory evaluation plus high-quality optic fundus photo . The population follow 10-year period identify death ischemic heart disease stroke . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This population-based case-cohort study determine whether retinal arteriolar change ( generalized narrowing , focal narrow arterio-venous nicking ) retinopathy associate 10-year stroke-and ischemic heart disease-related mortality . The study population select participant Beaver Dam Eye Study , well-characterized population predominantly white person age 43-86 year baseline examination 1988-90 . Cases define participant die either stroke ischemic heart disease since baseline examination . Three participant per case select cohort baseline control , match gender 5-year age interval case . Focal arteriolar narrowing , arteriovenous nick retinopathy grade baseline use standardized photographic grade protocol . To evaluate generalized arteriolar narrowing , method modify Atherosclerosis Risk Communities study use . Retinal photograph digitize process use high-resolution scanner . Retinal arteriole venule width measure help computer program base pixel density contrast vessel background retina . Finally , average width arteriole summarize retinal arteriole venule ratio ( AVR ) . Standard case-control methodology apply calculate relative odds association generalize retinal arteriolar narrowing ( use different category AVR ) change stroke-and ischemic heart disease-related mortality . Logistic regression model control potential confounders ( e.g. , blood pressure , serum lipid level ) employ evaluate independent association retinal arteriolar characteristic stroke- ischemic heart disease mortality .</detailed_description>
