	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate relationship environmental agent reproductive health . Environmental agent interest include exposure chemical polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , flame retardant , dioxin , bisphenol A , phthalates , pesticide , metal like lead cadmium . We also interest relationship reproductive health lifestyle risk factor , exposure environmental tobacco smoke . Enrollees ask participate study partner patient MGH Fertility Center , try get pregnant , either naturally undergoing Intrauterine Insemination ( IUI ) and/or In Vitro Fertilization ( IVF ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim # 1 : To determine association mixture paternal urinary concentration phthalate metabolite , BPA parabens primary outcome implantation failure live birth , secondary outcomes chemical pregnancy ( subsequent clinical pregnancy ) spontaneous abortion . Hypothesis 1 : Higher paternal urinary concentration mixture anti-androgenic phthalate metabolite DEHP , DBP , DiBP , BBzP , DiNP associate increase risk implantation failure reduce live birth rate , increase risk chemical pregnancy spontaneous abortion . Hypothesis 2 : Higher paternal urinary concentration mixture estrogenic chemical ( BPA parabens ) associate increase risk implantation failure reduce live birth rate , increase risk chemical pregnancy spontaneous abortion . Specific Aim # 2 : To determine association mixture maternal urinary concentration phthalate metabolite , BPA parabens implantation failure live birth rate , secondary outcomes chemical pregnancy spontaneous abortion . Hypothesis 2 : Higher maternal urinary concentration mixture anti-androgenic phthalate metabolite DEHP , DBP , DiBP , BBzP , DiNP associate increase risk implantation failure reduce live birth rate , increase risk chemical pregnancy spontaneous abortion . Hypothesis 3 : Higher maternal urinary concentration mixture estrogenic BPA parabens associate increase risk implantation failure reduce live birth rate , increase risk chemical pregnancy spontaneous abortion . Specific Aim # 3 : To determine joint effect maternal paternal urinary concentration phthalate metabolite , BPA parabens primary outcome interest include implantation failure live birth rate , secondary outcomes chemical pregnancy spontaneous abortion .</detailed_description>
