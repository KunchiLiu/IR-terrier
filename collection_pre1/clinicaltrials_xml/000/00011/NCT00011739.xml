	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : Low back pain frequent cause disability common reason outpatient care veteran . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) low back often reveal abnormality , may use justify expensive invasive therapy , surgery . Yet link MRI abnormality risk develop clinically significant back pain far clear . This longitudinal study determine prevalence incidence MRI abnormalities among veteran determine extent specific MRI abnormality predict future development back pain . The result help clinician use MR image efficiently , may ultimately help reduce frequency unnecessary back surgery . Study Abstract : Low back pain second common symptomatic reason physician visit U.S. result $ 24 billion annually direct health care cost . A survey primary care patient Seattle VA reveal one-quarter experience back pain severe enough require visit health care practitioner . Imaging play vital role valuation patient back pain . However , causal relationship image abnormality back pain yet clearly establish . Abnormalities lumbar spine magnetic resonance ( MR ) image common increase age point nearly ubiquitous age 50 . Despite , image abnormality often use justify various therapy low back pain , include expensive invasive therapy , surgery . Prior study examine prevalence imaging abnormality , study investigate either degree risk image abnormality impart development low back pain incidence image abnormality . The goal examine natural history magnetic resonance image lumbar spine asymptomatic subject . We want determine relationship image abnormality development low back pain comparing patient normal image abnormal imaging</detailed_description>
