	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety , tolerability , effect drug Rolipram multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . It examine whether Rolipram dampen part immune response believe lead MS reduce disease activity . Patient multiple sclerosis age 18 65 may eligible study . Candidates screen complete neurological medical evaluation . Participants complete three study phases-baseline , treatment follow-up , follow : Baseline ( 3 month ) - Approximately four magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan obtain assess MS activity . Participants MS activity certain level continue treatment phase . Treatment ( 8 month ) - Patients take Rolipram tablet increase dos every 2 3 day first month phase individual maximum tolerate dose establish . Dosing continue level rest treatment phase . Dosing morning , midday evening . Patients see monthly clinic examination MRI scan . Follow-up - Participants monthly exam MRIs 3 month follow treatment phase , participation study end . Patients ' monthly visit treatment follow-up include neurological examination ass disease status ; MRI ass brain change ; blood urine collection monitor liver , kidney function . In addition , lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) do last month baseline phase one month treatment end study change spinal fluid surround brain spinal cord , leukapheresis do last month baseline phase last month treatment collect white blood cell study . These procedure involve follow : MRI us strong magnetic field radio wave instead X-rays produce image show structural chemical change tissue . The patient lie table narrow cylinder ( scanner ) contain magnetic field image take . A contrast agent call gadolinium inject vein last set image help identify new lesion . Magnetic resonance spectroscopy , similar MRI , also do baseline phase , 4 month 8 month measure brain chemical . For spinal tap , local anesthetic give needle inserted space bone ( vertebra ) low back . About 2 tablespoon fluid collect needle . For leukapheresis , whole blood collect needle place arm vein . The blood circulates machine separate component . The white cell remove red cell , platelet plasma return body second needle place arm . Patients may also study measure level Rolipram blood . These do study day 1 29 month 2 , 4 , 6 . For day 1 29 , catheter place arm vein 4 ml . blood drawn immediately morning dose several interval 20 minute 6 hour dose . For test , single 4-ml sample collect noon dose .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rolipram phosphodiesterase ( PDE ) type 4 inhibitor originally develop Schering AG , Berlin , Germany , antidepressant , others laboratory documented immunomodulatory property drug . In current trial , Rolipram first time test novel immunomodulatory therapy multiple sclerosis patient . The protocol involve stage I find high individually well-tolerated drug dose , stage II , 8 month treatment period individually well-tolerated dose , conduct . The trial shall document safety , tolerability efficacy respect inhibition central nervous inflammation multiple sclerosis patient . Magnetic resonance image clinical examination use study parameter , immunological study conduct parallel trial , address mechanism action Rolipram MS .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Inclusion Criteria PreTreatment Screening : Stage I : Between age 18 65 year , inclusive . Subjects clinically definite relapsingremitting secondary progressive multiple sclerosis accord pubished criterion . EDSS score 4.0 6.5 . Patients either failed standard treatment ( interferon beta , glatiramer acetate ) clinical measure and/or eligible ay standard treatment available opted start continue treatment . Stage II : Same Stage I exceptiom EDSS 1.5 6.5 . Eligibility Criteria For Initiating Therapy : Stage I : Subjects must average 2 Gdenhancing lesion per month 3 month pretreatment baseline period ( i.e . 4 MRI scan ) . Stage II : Subjects must average least 0.5 Gdenhancing lesion per month 4 month pretreatment baseline period . Stage I &amp; II : Subjects must relapse 30 day initiation treatment . If relapse occur last 30 day pretreatment baseline period eligibility MRI criterion fulfil , begin treatment ( day 1 ) delay least many day treatment start earlier 30 day relapse early 60 day case i.v . corticosteroid give . Similarly , baseline need prolong corticosteroid treatment become necessary three month . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients exclude study entry follow exclusion criterion exist time enrollment . If washout period previous treatment becomes necessary , criterion assess begin MRI baseline period . An additional assessment exclusion criterion follow day 0 6 month treatment phase . Medical History : Blood test exceed limit define lead exclusion study : ALT ( SGPT ) AST ( SGOT ) great three time upper limit normal ; total white blood cell count le 3,000/mm ( 3 ) , neutrophils less 2,000 ; platelet count less 85 , 000/mm ( 3 ) ; creatinine great 1.5 mg/dl ; serology indicate HIV infection active hepatitis A , B , C infection ; postive pregnancy test breastfeed female ; nausea/vomiting frequent complaint ; fast prolactin level great 20 micrograms/L ; history sign immunodeficiency ; history galactorrhea and/or history prolactinsecreting tumor , history pituitary tumor adenomas , history mammary tumor ; clinically relevant arrhythmia ECG abnormality . Clinically significant ( determined investigator ) cardiac , immunological , pulmonary , neurological , renal , and/or major disease include ECG , echocardiogram , chest xray examination . Patients mental impairment would compromise understand judge consent exclude study thus able give inform consent exclude fromthe study . Other neurocognitive deficit physical disability exclusion criterion . Treatment History : If prior treatment recieved , subject must treatment required period prior enrollment . Miscellaneous : History alcohol drug abuse within 5 year prior enrollment ; female subject postmenopausal surgically sterile use acceptable method contraception ; male subject practice adequate contraception ; breastfeed patient ; unwillingness inability comply requirement protocol include presence condition ( physical , mental , social ) likely affect subject 's returing followup visit schedule ; previous participation study ; inability understand/give informed consent .</criteria>
