	<brief_summary>White blood cell cause liver damage inappropriately accumulate liver large number . Such event occur individual 's blood expose endotoxin , substance release cell wall many specie bacteria . The purpose study isolate neutrophil , important white blood cell , blood normal volunteer , put tissue culture isolate liver cell . The experiment determine endotoxin increase ability neutrophils damage liver cell . All study support grant do isolated cell tissue culture . This experimental model reveal possible mechanisms future evaluate human disease bacterial sepsis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neutrophils isolate normal human volunteer place cell culture isolate hepatocytes C3A cell ( hepatoblastoma cell line exhibit many characteristic normal hepatocytes ) . These experiment evaluate mechanism neutrophil adhere surface hepatocytes , mechanism attach neutrophils damage kill hepatocytes . Mechanisms adhesion involve understand chemokines release hepatocytes stimulate neutrophil adhesiveness , cytokine activate hepatocytes express chemokines adhesion molecule , adhesion receptor neutrophil surface able recognize adhesion molecule hepatocyte surface , ability adhesion enhance focus cytotoxic chemical come stimulate neutrophil . In addition , role endotoxin play sequence event study , specific cytotoxic mechanism release neutrophil study . As noted brief summary , grant support use human cell vitro ( i.e. , experiment do tissue culture ) . The purpose working experimental model define mechanisms future experiment evaluate patient endotoxin induced disease .</detailed_description>
