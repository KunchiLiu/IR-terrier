	<brief_title>N2001-03 : CEP-701 Treating Young Patients With Recurrent Refractory High-Risk Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine maximum tolerate dose CEP-701 pediatric patient recurrent refractory high-risk neuroblastoma . - Determine dose-limiting toxicity drug patient . - Determine pharmacokinetic behavior drug patient . Secondary - Determine degree TrkB tyrosine kinase inhibition activity present serum patient treat drug . - Correlate degree TrkB tyrosine kinase inhibition activity patient dose level , pharmacokinetics , antitumor activity data drug . - Determine antitumor activity drug patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients receive oral CEP-701 twice daily* day 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 , 22-26 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *On day 1 course 1 , patient receive oral CEP-701 instead twice . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos CEP-701 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Once MTD determine , dose level expand 9 patient . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 60 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
