	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate Treating Patients With Locally Recurrent Metastatic Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess response rate ( confirmed complete confirm partial response ) patient locally advance metastatic dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans ( DFSP ) treat imatinib . II . To estimate one-year progression-free survival probability population treat imatinib . III . To evaluate frequency severity toxicity associate treatment . IV . To measure presence PDGFB gene rearrangement DFSP detectable RT-PCR ( COL1A1-PDGFB fusion ) and/or FISH ( PDGFB rearrangement unknown partner ) explore relationship measure survival tumor response preliminary manner . V. To investigate preliminary fashion correlation plasma level imatinib 1 month treatment response DFSP . VI . To obtain tumor material additional future correlative study activity intracellular kinase , cDNA microarray analyse PDGFB receptor gene sequence analysis . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate daily day 1-56 . Treatment repeat every 56 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients document tumor progression serious side effect may continue therapy high dose another 6 course . Patients follow every 6 month 2 year annually 3 year .</detailed_description>
