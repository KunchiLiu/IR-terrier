	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Estrogen stimulate growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use letrozole may fight breast cancer reduce production estrogen . Giving letrozole surgery may shrink tumor remove . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well neoadjuvant letrozole work treat postmenopausal woman undergo surgery estrogen-receptor positive progesterone-receptor positive stage II , stage IIIA , stage IIIB breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Letrozole Treating Postmenopausal Women With Estrogen-Receptor Positive and/or Progesterone-Receptor Positive Stage II , Stage IIIA , Stage IIIB Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Develop predictive model response ( base gene expression profile ) postmenopausal woman estrogen- and/or progesterone-receptor positive stage II , IIIA , IIIB breast cancer treat neoadjuvant letrozole . Secondary - Determine response rate patient treat drug . - Determine change Ki67 proliferation rate patient treated drug . - Determine rate improvement surgical outcome patient treated drug . - Determine long-term outcome patient treated drug . - Determine safety drug patient . - Determine mechanism resistance drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive neoadjuvant oral letrozole daily 16 week absence disease progression . Patients undergo breast surgery one day last dose letrozole . Patients partial response 16 week may continue receive letrozole additional 8 week undergo breast surgery . Patients follow within 4 week definitive surgery annually 10 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 150 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
