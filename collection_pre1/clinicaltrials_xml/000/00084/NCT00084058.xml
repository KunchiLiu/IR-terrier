	<detailed_description>Since current drug cure HIV infection , lifelong therapy require . Development drug resistance common , 30 % 80 % patient initial viral load decrease follow potent anti-HIV regimen experience regimen failure within first year therapy . Dose intensification ( increase dose treatment medication ) use successfully pediatric oncology . Dose intensification HIV infect patient may overcome resistance , similarly observed cancer , may result great rate viral inhibition , maximize degree durability viral suppression . This study evaluate dose intensification HIV infect child adolescent fail current antiretroviral regimen significant genotypic phenotypic resistance . Participants 3-step study previously undergone genotypic resistance test part regular clinical care . Participants phenotypic resistance test do screen within 6 month prior study entry . Participants study either genotypic profile least 4 required protease mutation phenotypic resistance LPV least fivefold great wild type fail regimen within 6 month study screen . In Step 1 , Group 1 participant randomly assign either drug regimen without nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) drug regimen NNRTI Group 2 participant . Participants doctor work study investigator select best treatment regimen possible . All participant study receive LPV/r part drug regimen . Participants Group 1 take high dose LPV/r participant Group 2 NNRTIs low LPV/r level blood . At Week 2 , participant undergo 12-hour pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test evaluate drug level blood . If LPV/r level high enough control HIV participant swallow tablet , hard gel capsule , content hard gel capsule food milk , participant begin take SQV part drug regimen enter Step 2 . After two week take SQV , participant undergo PK test Week 6 . Based test result , dose SQV increase , decrease , maintain . Participants add SQV regimen continue take LPV/r remainder study stay Step 1 . If PK test indicate SQV blood concentration sufficient , participant remain Step 2 . If PK test indicate SQV blood concentration low , SQV dose increase participant enter Step 3 . After 2 week take elevated dos SQV , participant undergo PK test Week 10 . If PK test indicate SQV blood concentration high , SQV dose decrease . At Week 14 , participant receive reduce SQV dose undergo PK test verify SQV blood concentration optimal . Participants study visit Weeks 2 , 4 , 6 , 7 , 8 , every 4 week end study Week 48 . Study visit include physical exam , health history assessment , blood collection . Blood collection PK study occur select visit . Study visit Weeks 2 12 include electrocardiogram ( ECG EKG ) .</detailed_description>
