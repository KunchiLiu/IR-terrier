	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose capecitabine give together GTI-2040 oxaliplatin treat patient locally advance metastatic colorectal cancer solid tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , oxaliplatin capecitabine , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . GTI-2040 may increase effectiveness chemotherapy make tumor cell sensitive drug . Giving GTI-2040 together oxaliplatin capecitabine may kill tumor cell</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish maximum tolerated ( MTD ) 21 day cycle capecitabine give orally twice daily 14 day combination oxaliplatin give intravenously day 1 GTI-2040 give continuous infusion 14 day patient advanced metastatic solid tumor . II . To describe toxicity dose level study . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate pharmacokinetics GTI-2040 , capecitabine , oxaliplatin give combination . II . To evaluate level ribonucleotide reductase -M2 subunit ( RR-M2 ) mRNA level use TaqMan RT-PCR peripheral blood mononuclear cell tumor sample ( available ) . TRF support require sought . III . To quantitate change dCTP level peripheral blood mononuclear cell treatment surrogate marker RR inhibition . TRF support require sought . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study capecitabine . Patients receive GTI-2040 IV continuously day 1-14 , oral capecitabine twice daily day 2-15 , oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 2 first course . In subsequent course , capecitabine administer day 1-14 , oxaliplatin administer day 1 , GTI-2040 administer course 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos capecitabine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity .</detailed_description>
