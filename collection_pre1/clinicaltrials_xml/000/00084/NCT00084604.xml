	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give irinotecan cisplatin together bevacizumab work treat patient unresectable metastatic gastric ( stomach ) gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma ( cancer ) . Drugs use chemotherapy , irinotecan cisplatin , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Monoclonal antibody bevacizumab locate tumor cell either kill deliver tumor-killing substance without harm normal cell . Giving chemotherapy together monoclonal antibody may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine efficacy irinotecan , cisplatin , bevacizumab , term time progression , patient unresectable metastatic gastric gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine measure efficacy , include response rate median 1-year survival , patient treat regimen . II . Determine toxicity regimen patient . III . Correlate CT perfusion image result efficacy regimen , term time progression , objective response , survival , patient . IV . Determine feasibility serial serum proteomic assay predict response therapy , term time progression , objective response , survival , patient treat regimen . V. To bank paraffin store tumor biopsy material future plan immunohistochemistry study correlate sensitivity bevacizumab base combination chemotherapy . OUTLINE : This open-label , non-randomized , multicenter study . Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Patients also receive cisplatin IV 30 minute follow irinotecan IV 30 minute day 1 8 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
