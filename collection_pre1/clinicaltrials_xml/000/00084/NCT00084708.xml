	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Gefitinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary growth . Calcitriol may help tumor cell develop normal cell . Dexamethasone may increase effectiveness decrease side effect gefitinib calcitriol . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose calcitriol give together gefitinib give together gefitinib dexamethasone treat patient advance solid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Calcitriol Gefitinib With Without Dexamethasone Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , toxic effect , tolerability calcitriol alone combination gefitinib without dexamethasone patient advance solid tumor . Secondary - Determine pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics regimens patient . - Determine tumor response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study calcitriol . - Stage 1 : Patients receive calcitriol IV 1 hour day 1 , 15 , 22 oral gefitinib daily day 8-28 course 1 . For subsequent course , patient receive calcitriol IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 oral gefitinib daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos calcitriol fix dose gefitinib maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . - Stage 2 : Patients receive calcitriol ( begin 1 dose level MTD determine stage 1 ) gefitinib stage 1 . Patients also receive oral dexamethasone day twice day dose calcitriol . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos calcitriol fix dos gefitinib dexamethasone MTD determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 21-36 patient accrue study within 1 year .</detailed_description>
