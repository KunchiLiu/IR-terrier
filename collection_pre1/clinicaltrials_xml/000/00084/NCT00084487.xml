	<brief_title>Rebeccamycin Analog Second-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Limited-Stage Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer That Relapsed After Previous First-Line Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective response rate patient limit extensive stage small cell lung cancer relapse prior first-line chemotherapy treat rebeccamycin analogue second-line therapy . II . Determine duration remission survival patient treated drug . III . Determine toxicity drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive rebeccamycin analogue IV 1 hour day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow annually . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-39 patient accrue study within 15 month .</detailed_description>
