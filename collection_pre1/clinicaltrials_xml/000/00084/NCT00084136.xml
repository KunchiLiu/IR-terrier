	<brief_summary>This study compare 3 different three-drug combination HIV infect individual start first HIV treatment regimen . Participants recruit resource-limited area Africa , Asia , South America , Haiti , also United States . The study hypothesis daily combination ( PI base , NNRTI base ) would inferior efficacy compare twice daily NNRTI base combination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Evaluation Anti-retroviral Combinations Treatment Naive , HIV Infected Persons Resource-limited Settings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In developed country , standard effective antiretroviral ( ARV ) therapy treatment-naive HIV infected people include three-drug combination two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) either protease inhibitor ( PI ) non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) . However , direct comparison ARV efficacy person closely reflect worldwide demographic HIV-1 infection need . &gt; &gt; Trial participant recruit Africa ( Malawi , South Africa , Zimbabwe ) , Asia ( India , Thailand ) , South America ( Brazil , Peru ) , Haiti , United States . &gt; &gt; All participant randomly assign one three arm , random allocation stratify 2 factor : country , screen plasma HIV-1 RNA level ( &lt; 100,000 copies/mL versus &gt; = 100,000 copies/mL ) . Participants assign ZDV/3TC+EFV arm receive lamivudine/zidovudine twice daily efavirenz daily . Participants assign ddI+FTC+ATV arm receive emtricitabine , atazanavir , enteric-coated didanosine daily . Participants assign TDF/FTC+EFV arm receive emtricitabine , tenofovir disoproxil fumarate , efavirenz daily . &gt; &gt; &gt; Physical exam blood collection occur entry study visit . Participants experience virologic failure offer switch another regimen . &gt; &gt; On May 23 , 2008 , ddI+FTC+ATV close follow plan interim review study 's independent Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) . The DSMB recommendation base upon compel evidence arm significantly virologic failure ( therefore inferior ) compare ZDV/3TC+EFV arm . Participants still receive ddI+FTC+ATV offer alternative medication , participant continue follow . &gt; &gt; On November 3 , 2009 , DSMB recommend study close follow-up May 31 , 2010 , design termination ( base 30 % participant meet primary outcome ) meet . The board observe recent accumulation primary efficacy event ( i.e . regimen failure ) slow . Therefore , study continue another 1-2 year , precision gain treatment comparison would likely small .</detailed_description>
