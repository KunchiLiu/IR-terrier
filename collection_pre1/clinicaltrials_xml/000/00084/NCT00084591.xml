	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( radiation direct tumor precisely standard radiation therapy ) incorporate boost ( increase amount radiation give treatment ) may cause less damage normal tissue . Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Giving radiation therapy together chemotherapy surgery may shrink tumor remove . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose neoadjuvant intensity-modulated radiation therapy incorporate boost give together capecitabine treat patient locally advanced rectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy With Incorporated Boost Capecitabine Before Surgery Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine maximum tolerate dose neoadjuvant boost intensity-modulated radiotherapy combine capecitabine surgery patient locally advanced rectal cancer . Secondary - Determine pathologic tumor response patient treat regimen . - Determine quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study boost intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) . Patients undergo neoadjuvant IMRT incorporate boost daily 5 day week 5 week . Beginning first day radiotherapy , patient receive oral capecitabine twice daily 7 day week 5 week . Patients undergo surgical resection 4-8 week completion chemoradiotherapy . Cohorts 3-6 patient undergo escalate dos boost IMRT maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 3 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Quality life assess baseline , week 5 chemoradiotherapy , surgery , 1 , 3 , 12 month surgery . Patients follow 1 , 3 , 12 month surgery . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 3-15 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
