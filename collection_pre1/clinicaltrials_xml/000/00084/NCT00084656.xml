	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody locate tumor cell either kill deliver tumor-killing substance without harm normal cell . Vaccines may make body build immune response kill tumor cell . Combining vaccine Montanide ISA-51 may cause strong immune response kill tumor cell . Giving monoclonal antibody therapy together vaccine therapy may effective treatment stage III stage IV melanoma . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give monoclonal antibody therapy together vaccine therapy work treat patient resect stage III stage IV melanoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Achieve least 40 % autoimmune breakthrough event rate , define induction grade 1 , grade 2 , acceptable grade 3 drug-related autoimmune adverse event , patient resect stage III IV melanoma treat anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody ( MDX-010 ) peptide vaccine comprising tyrosinase , gp100 antigen , MART-1 antigen emulsify Montanide ISA-51 . Secondary - Determine incidence drug-related autoimmune adverse event grade patient treat regimen . - Determine time disease relapse patient treat regimen . - Determine immunologic response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody ( MDX-010 ) IV 90 minute day 1 week 1 , 9 , 17 , 25 , 33 , 41 , 53 peptide vaccine comprise tyrosinase , gp100 antigen , MART-1 antigen emulsify Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously day 1 week 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 17 , 21 , 25 , 33 , 41 , 53 . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 25 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
