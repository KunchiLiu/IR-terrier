	<brief_summary>This study examine depression may influence way brain regulate heart function . Some researcher believe depression may risk factor form heart disease . Right-handed healthy volunteer patient major depressive disorder 18 50 year age may eligible study . Female candidate must premenopausal . Patients must currently experience major depressive episode . All candidate screen medical history physical examination , electrocardiogram , blood urine test . They interview psychiatric medical history , current emotional state sleep pattern , family history psychiatric disorder . They complete symptom rating scale depression , anxiety , negative thinking ; history alcohol tobacco use ; level physical activity ; socioeconomic status ; overall level functioning ; , depress patient , depression type . Women candidate menstrual phase determine time recent menstrual cycle may undergo test determine time ovulation . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - 12-minute walk/run test - This test measure subject 's general level cardiorespiratory fitness . In gymnasium NIH Clinical Center , subject walk run far 12 minute . Blood pressure measure exercise test , heart rate measure exercise monitor wear around chest . - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) - A brain MRI scan do obtain picture brain anatomy . Electrocardiogram lead place subject 's chest measure electrical activity heart scan session . The subject lie narrow bed scanner , narrow metal cylinder 6 foot long . The scan session take 90 minute . - Positron emission tomography ( PET ) - PET scan produce image brain 's blood flow . The subject inject radiotracer ( small amount drug label radioactive substance ) detect special camera trace blood flow . During scan session , subject lie still table . EKG leas place subject 's chest measure electrical activity heart scan . A mask hole eye , ear , mouth place subject 's face keep head f ...</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neurocardiac Control Major Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The presence major depression , without pre-existing coronary artery disease , predicts increase mortality myocardial infarction ( MI ) sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) . Decreased parasympathetic vagal outflow , especially presence elevate cardiac sympathetic tone , propose mechanism increase risk SCD . Multiple line evidence suggest fronto-limbic area actively engage robust optimization autonomic balance sympathetic parasympathetic cardiac outflow broad range cognitive physical demand . We propose dysfunction forebrain neurocardiac network MDD mediate maladaptive cardiac autonomic control increase risk cardiovascular mortality . In model , neurocardiac control network exhibit systemic bias toward increase sympathetic relative parasympathetic outflow . Increased amygdalar activity MDD promote imbalance . Additionally , dysfunction posterior orbitofrontal cortex ( OFC ) ventral anterior cingulated cortex ( ACC ) , area associate abnormal histopathological change MDD , lead reduce capacity generate adaptive level cardioinhibitory , parasympathetic tone . This reduced capacity depressive evidence abnormally large withdrawal parasympathetic outflow , compare healthy control , cognitive physical demand increase . This dynamic model potentially consistent functional neuroimaging post mortem histopathological finding MDD knowledge gain test protocol may ultimately elucidate brain dysfunction MDD mediate significantly increase clinical risk spontaneous ventricular arrhythmia sudden cardiac death . We propose combine H ( 2 ) ( 15 ) O positron emission tomography ( PET ) analysis heart rate variability ( HRV ) order study vivo neural structure underlie normal forebrain control cardiac autonomic function . We aim show whether regional functional abnormality amygdala , ventral anterior cingulate cortex , orbitofrontal cortex-areas functional abnormality identify previous neuroimaging study major depressives-are associate impaired modulation cardiac autonomic function major depression .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Two group righthanded subject , male premenopausal female , drugnaive receive psychotropic drug least 3 week ( 8 week fluoxetine ) , recruit study protocol : unipolar depressive healthy control individually match depressive age , gender smoking status . Because effective treatment discontinue purpose protocol , subject patient group identify never treat discontinue medication due lack efficacy , noncompliance , physician order reason prior study entry . The presence inclusion exclusion criterion establish use unstructured clinical interview psychiatrist Structure Clinical Interview DSMIV ( SCID ) . Family history mental illness obtain use Family Interview Genetic Studies . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects exclude : serious suicidal ideation behavior ; inability provide inform consent ; medical neurological illness likely affect physiology anatomy ; history drug alcohol abuse within 1 year lifetime history alcohol drug dependence ( DSMIV criterion ) ; current past history axis I disorder precede onset MDD ; current pregnancy ( documented pregnancy test prior scanning ) ; current breast feeding ; general MRI exclusion criterion ; vision and/or hear problem severe enough interfere test . Exposure within two week medication likely affect cerebral blood glow heart rate . Any condition may prevent subject perform run/walk test , Irregular menstrual cycle menstrual phase reliably determine , Any ECG finding would contraindicate PET scan run/walk test ( e.g . nonsinus rhythm , significant tachycardia , ST segment elevation depression , Q wave ) arrhythmia would obviate accurate calculation HRV index . Cardiology consultation obtain abnormal ECG finding unless unequivocally clear judgment study physician consultation medically unnecessary . Subjects beyond age 50 either postmenopausal perimenopausal exclude reduce biological heterogeneity autonomic function may associate difference menstrual status .</criteria>
