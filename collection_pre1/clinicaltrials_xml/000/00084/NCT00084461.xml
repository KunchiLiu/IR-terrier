	<brief_title>Romidepsin Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Neuroendocrine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective response rate patient locally advance metastatic neuroendocrine tumor treat FR901288 ( romidepsin ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine toxicity drug patient . II . To measure serum tumor marker ( pancreastatin , gastrin , pancreatic polypeptide , glucagon , substance-P , neurotensin , calcitonin , somatostatin , vasoactive intestinal peptide , gastrin release polypeptide , ACTH ) depend tumor type pre- , during- , post-treatment . III . To perform nuclear medicine functional imaging scan ( octreoscan ) evaluate disease status pre- , during- , post-treatment . IV . To perform histone acetylation assay cytospins peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) correlate disease response immunologic parameter . V. To quantify gene expression Real Time PCR type 1 type 2 cytokine , co-stimulatory molecule , adhesion molecule PBMCs obtain pre- , during- , post-treatment blood sample . VI . To perform multicolor flow cytometric analysis fresh blood ass activation lymphocyte subset presence co-stimulatory adhesion molecule . VII . To perform vitro functional assay innate well antigen-specific T cell immune response PBMCs obtain pre- , during- , post-treatment blood sample . OUTLINE : Patients receive romidepsin IV 4 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete remission ( CR ) receive 2 additional course beyond CR . Patients follow 2-4 week .</detailed_description>
