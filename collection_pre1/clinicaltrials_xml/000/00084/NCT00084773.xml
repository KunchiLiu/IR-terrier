	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody cetuximab locate tumor cell either kill deliver tumor-killing substance without harm normal cell . Drugs use chemotherapy fluorouracil work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Giving cetuximab fluorouracil radiation therapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine safety profile neoadjuvant cetuximab , fluorouracil , pelvic irradiation patient locally advance locally recurrent rectal cancer . Secondary - Determine activity regimen , term pathological complete response rate , patient . OUTLINE : This non-randomized , open-label , pilot study . Patients receive cetuximab IV 1-2 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 , 43 , 50 , 57 , 64 fluorouracil IV continuously day 1-42 . Patients undergo whole-pelvic radiotherapy daily day 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 , 22-26 , 29-33 , 36-40 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Approximately 1-3 week completion study treatment , patient undergo surgical resection follow adjuvant chemotherapy off-study . Patients follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
