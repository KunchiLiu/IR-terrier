	<brief_summary>Long-term side effect , expense medication , difficulty take medication continuously long periods time problem complicate anti-HIV drug regimen . The purpose study determine whether two drug , atazanavir ( ATV ) ritonavir ( RTV ) , control HIV infection take together without anti-HIV drug 48 week viral suppression . Hypothesis : Simplified maintenance therapy ATV RTV alone virologic suppression markedly increase risk virologic failure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Atazanavir/Ritonavir Maintenance Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The expense , difficulty , long-term adverse event associate sustained adherence combination antiretroviral therapy emphasize need simpler , alternative treatment strategy HIV infection . Studies show single protease inhibitor ( PI ) maintenance therapy may provide sufficient virologic suppression reduce risk nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI ) -associated metabolic complication . However , know whether ritonavir-boosted atazanavir ( ATV/RTV ) maintenance therapy would effective control HIV replication genital compartment whether viral load test blood collection would effective detecting elevate level HIV genital compartment . This study determine whether simplify maintenance therapy ATV/RTV 48-week virologic suppression increase likelihood virologic failure . This study last 54 week . Participants undergo electrocardiogram ( EKG ) screening . At study start , participant switch current PIs ATV/RTV stay current NRTIs Week 6 , discontinue NRTIs remain maintenance regimen ATV/RTV alone duration study . Study visit take place Weeks 3 6 , every 4 week Week 30 , every 8 week end study Week 54 . Medication assessment , physical exam , blood work occur study visit . At Week 30 , viral load measure genital secretion male female study participant .</detailed_description>
