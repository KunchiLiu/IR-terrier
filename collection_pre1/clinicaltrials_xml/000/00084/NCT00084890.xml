	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel carboplatin , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining docetaxel carboplatin may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose docetaxel give together carboplatin see well work treat patient recurrent stage IVB squamous cell carcinoma ( cancer ) cervix .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel Carboplatin Treating Patients With Recurrent Stage IVB Squamous Cell Carcinoma ( Cancer ) Cervix</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine maximum tolerate dose docetaxel administer carboplatin patient recurrent stage IVB squamous cell carcinoma cervix . - Determine response rate time progression patient treat regimen . Secondary - Determine toxicity regimen patient . - Determine quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study docetaxel follow phase II study . - Phase I : Patients receive docetaxel IV 30 minute carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day least 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients demonstrate continue tumor shrinkage 6 course receive 2 additional course beyond best response . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos docetaxel maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . - Phase II : Patients receive docetaxel carboplatin phase I MTD determine phase I . Quality life assess baseline , every course treatment , end study treatment . Patients follow every 2 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 3-64 patient ( 3-24 phase I 16-40 phase II ) accrue study within 2 year .</detailed_description>
