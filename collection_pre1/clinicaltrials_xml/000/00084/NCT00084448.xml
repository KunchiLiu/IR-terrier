	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Celecoxib may stop growth cancer stop blood flow tumor may increase effectiveness paclitaxel make tumor cell sensitive drug . Giving celecoxib together paclitaxel may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give paclitaxel together celecoxib work treat patient recurrent persistent platinum-resistant ovarian epithelial primary peritoneal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Celecoxib Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Platinum-Resistant Ovarian Epithelial Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine antitumor activity paclitaxel celecoxib patient recurrent persistent platinum-resistant ovarian epithelial primary peritoneal cancer . - Determine nature degree toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive paclitaxel IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 oral celecoxib twice daily day 2-6 , 9-13 , 16-27 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 19-51 patient accrue study within 11-22 month .</detailed_description>
