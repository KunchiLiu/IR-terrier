	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose irinotecan 3-AP treating patient metastatic unresectable solid tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy irinotecan work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . 3-AP may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary growth may help irinotecan kill tumor cell make sensitive drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To find maximal tolerate dose combination irinotecan Triapine® patient refractory solid tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To find severity frequency toxicity associate combination observe record antitumor activity . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate effect Triapine®/irinotecan ribonucleotide reductase tyrosyl radical vivo Electron Paramagnetic Spectroscopy ( EPR ) buccal mucosal cell , peripheral blood lymphocyte tumor biopsy . Formation low molecular weight iron-Triapine® chelate also assess EPR . II . To evaluate effect Triapine® /irinotecan cell cycle vivo measure S-phase arrest buccal mucosal cell . III . To evaluate effect Triapine® /irinotecan MDR gene expression polymorphism blood . IV . To evaluate effect Triapine® /irinotecan ribonucleotide reductase R2 mRNA Immunohistochemistry . V. To evaluate pharmacokinetic profile combination . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive irinotecan IV 1 hour day 1 3-AP ( Triapine® ) IV 2 hour day 1-3 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos irinotecan 3-AP ( Triapine® ) maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Once MTD determine , 6 additional patient treat dose . Patients follow disease progression .</detailed_description>
