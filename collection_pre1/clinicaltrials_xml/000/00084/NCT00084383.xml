	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines make gene-modified pancreatic cancer cell may make body build immune response kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , fluorouracil , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Giving vaccine therapy together chemotherapy radiation therapy surgery may kill remain tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give vaccine therapy together adjuvant chemoradiotherapy work treat patient resected stage I stage II adenocarcinoma ( cancer ) pancreas .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Combined With Adjuvant Chemoradiotherapy Treating Patients With Resected Stage I Stage II Adenocarcinoma ( Cancer ) Pancreas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine overall disease-free survival patient resect stage I II adenocarcinoma pancreas treat adjuvant chemoradiotherapy combination GVAX pancreatic cancer vaccine . Secondary - Correlate specific vivo parameter immune response ( post-vaccination delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction autologous tumor , mesothelin-specific T-cell response , degree local eosinophil , macrophage , T-cell infiltration vaccine site ) clinical response patient treat regimen . - Determine toxic effect associate intradermal injection vaccine patient . OUTLINE : This open-label study . - Post surgery vaccination : Within 8-10 week pancreaticoduodenectomy , patient receive GVAX pancreatic cancer vaccine intradermally ( ID ) day 0 . - Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy : Within 16-28 day first vaccination , patient receive fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) IV continuously 3 week . Approximately 1-2 week completion 5-FU , patient receive chemoradiotherapy comprise radiotherapy daily 5-FU IV continuously 26-28 week . Approximately 3-5 week completion chemoradiotherapy , patient receive 5-FU IV continuously 4 week . 5-FU repeat every 6 week 2 course . - Post chemoradiotherapy vaccination : Within 4-8 week completion chemoradiotherapy , patient receive GVAX pancreatic cancer vaccine ID day 0 , 28 , 56 , 196 . Treatment continue absence unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 60 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
