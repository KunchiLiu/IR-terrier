	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody Therapy Treating Patients With Progressive Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine targeting , tissue distribution , pharmacokinetics monoclonal antibody Hu3S193 patient progressive small cell lung cancer . Secondary - Determine immunogenicity drug patient . - Determine tumor response patient treated drug . - Determine safety drug patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , pilot study . Patients receive monoclonal antibody Hu3S193 ( MOAB Hu3S193 ) IV 30 minute day 1 week 1-4 . Patients also receive indium In III MOAB Hu3S193 IV 30 minute day 1 week 1 4 undergo gamma camera imaging . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 1 4 week , every 3 month 1 year , every 6-12 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 10 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
