	<brief_title>Depsipeptide Unresectable Recurrent Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate rate disease control ( i.e. , achievement complete response , partial response , stable disease ) single agent depsipeptide patient unresectable recurrent metastatic squamous cell carcinoma head neck . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate duration response , time progression , overall survival patient incurable head neck cancer treat depsipeptide . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine extent histone hyperacetylation peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) readout depsipeptide activity depsipeptide administration , correlate activity observe histone hyperacetylation tumor mucosal cell , correlate extent depsipeptide activity tumor response . II . To determine depsipeptide-induced change gene expression profile tumor cell biopsy accessible tumor tissue mucosal cell transepithelial oral brush biopsy use cDNA microarrays contain 28,000 clone , correlate change extent histone hyperacetylation observe PBMCs tumor tissue . III . To determine depsipeptide-induced change methylation candidate gene tumor cell oral mucosa epithelium . IV . To demonstrate altered expression signal cell cycle-related protein tumor tissue response depsipeptide . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive FR901228 ( depsipeptide ) IV 4 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
