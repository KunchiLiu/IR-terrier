	<brief_summary>Cyclosporine A ( CsA ) common long-term treatment use inhibit immune response transplant patient receive donor organ . CsA may also help people HIV . The purpose study determine safety immune response CsA give abacavir sulfate , lamivudine , zidovudine ( ABC/3TC/AZT ) lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ) HIV infect adult early stage infection . Study hypothesis : The combination CsA LPV/r give acutely infected individual result low level proviral DNA latent infectious virus 48 week compare acute infected individual treat LPV/r alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Immune Response Cyclosporine A Combination With Abacavir Sulfate , Lamivudine , Zidovudine Lopinavir/Ritonavir Adults With Acute HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During early stage HIV infection , HIV replicate unchecked , massive number CD4 T cell infect destroyed , CD4 cell become infected enter latent phase . This latent pool infect CD4 cell pose difficult challenge eliminate HIV infection early stage infection cell persist long period , even highly active effective antiretroviral therapy , may later become active . CsA popularly use lifelong immunosuppressant organ transplant patient . CsA inhibit cellular activation , include CD4 cell activation proliferation . By reduce CD4 cell activation acute HIV infection , few CD4 cell may infect die ; importantly , may fewer latent cell potential become active late disease . However , CsA many potential toxic effect , include renal damage , may affect neurologic , endocrine , hepatic organ system . In previous small study adult acute HIV infection , short 8-week course CsA well tolerate , think 4-week course CsA may result substantial reduction viral load T cell activation , outweigh potential toxic effect sustain one month treatment . This study evaluate safety immune response 4-week course CsA ABC/3TC/AZT LPV/r compare ABC/3TC/AZT LPV/r alone patient acute HIV infection . This 48-week study randomly assign patient one two arm . During first 4 week study , Arm A receive one tablet ABC/3TC/AZT twice daily , 3 capsule 2 tablet LPV/r twice daily , liquid CsA ( dose determine weight ) twice daily . At Week 5 , Arm A patient stop CsA continue ABC/3TC/AZT LPV/r . Arm B receive one tablet ABC/3TC/AZT twice daily 3 capsule 2 tablet LPV/r twice daily 48 week . On case-by-case basis , investigator may wish prescribe ABC/3TC rather ABC/3TC/AZT initial therapy . Participants ABC hypersensitivity give 3TC/AZT instead ABC/3TC/AZT . A complete physical exam medical history assessment occur study entry Week 48 . Study visit occur every week Week 4 , every 4 week end study . Blood urine collection clinical assessment occur study visit . Additionally , patient Arm A undergo CsA level monitoring Day 3 Weeks 1 , 2 , 3 ; CsA dosage may adjust necessary .</detailed_description>
