	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : New diagnostic procedure compute tomographic colonography may improve ability detect colorectal cancer may provide less invasive method detection . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study well compute tomographic colonography work screen healthy participant colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Computed Tomographic Colonography Screening Healthy Participants Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare sensitivity compute tomographic colonography ( CTC ) v colonoscopy detect significantly large lesion ( â‰¥ 10 mm diameter ) asymptomatic participant , term specificity , area ROC curve , predictive value detect clinically significant colorectal neoplasia . Secondary - Determine interobserver variation accuracy interpret CTC examination participant , include benefit primary 3-dimensional read and/or independent second interpretation . - Determine effect different colon preparation accuracy CTC participant . - Compare participant acceptance willingness repeat examination CTC v colonoscopy . - Determine accuracy CTC detect flat lesion colon participant . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Participants receive oral laxative , oral bisacodyl , three dos oral barium sulphate 24 hour image . After cathartic cleansing , participant undergo compute tomographic colonography follow colonoscopy . Participants follow approximately 4 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 2,607 participant accrue study .</detailed_description>
