	<brief_summary>People recently infect HIV treat anti-HIV medication may develop strong immune system responses HIV may able control virus without continue take medication . The purpose study see give anti-HIV medication people soon infect HIV help control HIV . The study also see immune system control amount HIV virus blood ( viral load ) even person stop take medication . The study evaluate three different schedule stop start anti-HIV medication see schedule best able boost patient 's immune system control HIV viral load . Hypothesis : Combination therapy start primary HIV infection , conjunction structure treatment interruption , result great control viremia treatment induction therapy alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anti-HIV Medications Structured Treatment Interruptions People Recently Infected With HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Initiation treatment acute HIV infection seem result great suppression viral replication note chronic infection well recovery certain CD4 subpopulation . However , difficult patient treat acute infection maintain long-term continuous antiretroviral ( ARV ) treatment difficulty adhere complicate medication regimen , drug-related toxicity , cost medication . Acutely infected patient undergo early initiation treatment follow structured treatment interruption ( STIs ) appear low off-treatment viral load historical control . This study evaluate whether effective ARV treatment acute early HIV infection follow STI result lower viral setpoints would otherwise expect . This trial 2 step last maximum 104 week . Participants either enter Step 1 continue Step 2 enter Step 2 directly . During Step 1 , participant acute early HIV infection give 24 week ARV therapy . Participants may take combination FDA-approved ARV medication doctor select . Participants study visit study entry Weeks 1 , 4 , 8 , 20 . After 24 week Step 1 , participant may enroll Step 2 . Participants Step 1 people early acute HIV infection begin ARV treatment within 21 day diagnosis 1 year treatment may enroll Step 2 . During Step 2 , participant randomly assign one two study arm : - Arm 1 : Participants continue take ARV therapy 16 week stop ARVs 64 week . - Arm 2 : Participants stop ARVs 4 week , take ARVs 8 week , stop ARVs 4 week , take ARVs 8 week , stop ARVs 56 week . Participants study arm restart ARVs regardless STI duration viral load 50,000 copies/ml , progress CDC category C disease , CD4 count fall 350 cells/mm3 decline 50 % last on-treatment CD4 level . Step 2 last 80 week . For first year , participant study visit every 1 4 week , depend whether take ARVs . During second year , participant study visit every 8 week . Study visit include brief medical history , blood pregnancy test , voluntary behavioral questionnaire .</detailed_description>
