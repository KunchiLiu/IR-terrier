	<brief_summary>Drugs use chemotherapy , oxaliplatin , irinotecan , capecitabine , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Giving one chemotherapy drug may kill tumor cell . This phase II trial study well give oxaliplatin together irinotecan capecitabine work treat patient metastatic inoperable locally advanced gastric cancer gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma ( cancer ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Oxaliplatin , Irinotecan , Capecitabine Advanced Gastric/Gastroesophageal Junction Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess total response rate oxaliplatin , irinotecan capecitabine drug combination advance gastric/esophageal junction carcinoma . II . To assess duration total response oxaliplatin , irinotecan capecitabine drug combination advance gastric/esophageal junction carcinoma . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour irinotecan IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 , 22-26 . Courses repeat every 42 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow annually . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 40-80 patient accrue study within 18 month .</detailed_description>
