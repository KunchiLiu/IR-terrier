	<brief_title>Replagal Enzyme Replacement Therapy Children With Fabry Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TKT029 open label multi-center study assess safety enzyme replacement therapy Replagal ( agalsidase alfa ) child Fabry disease , complete 6 month agalsidase alfa therapy study TKT023 ( Cohort 1 ) treatment-na√Øve ( Cohort 2 ) meet inclusion/exclusion criterion study . The study consist every week treatment Replagal 52 week , periodic reassessment Shire HGT continuation study beyond 52 week . A decision part study sponsor terminate study may make time . In Cohort 1 , safety clinical measurement assessment perform Week 25 26 Study TKT023 serve baseline assessment TKT029 . Patients Cohort 1 begin treatment Replagal manufacture use roller bottle process ( Replagal RB ) ; portion treatment denote Cohort 1 , Phase 1 . Safety evaluation visit Cohort 1 , Phase 1 perform Weeks 13 , 25 , 55 , every 26 week thereafter patient discontinue study transition treatment Replagal manufacture use bioreactor process ( Replagal AF ) . The transition Replagal AF mark restart study clock denote Cohort 1 , Phase 2 . Safety evaluation visit Cohort 1 , Phase 2 perform Weeks 1 , 13 , 25 , 55 , every 26 week thereafter patient discontinues sponsor terminates study . Patients Cohort 2 receive treatment Replagal AF ; therefore 1 study phase patient . Screening assessment perform Week -1 serve baseline assessment study . Safety evaluation visit Cohort 2 perform Weeks 13 , 25 , 37 , 55 every 26 week thereafter patient discontinues sponsor terminates study . The final study visit cohort follow 30 day study study drug infusion , time final safety evaluation perform . Patients complete study interview telephone 30 day last study infusion resolution outstanding adverse event ( AEs ) concomitant medication change . Any patient withdraws early study final study visit 30 day last study drug infusion , time final safety evaluation perform .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1a . For Cohort 1 ( phase ) : Patients must complete study requirement assessment Study TKT023 le 30 ( +/7 ) day prior enrol Study TKT029 must safety medical issue contraindicate participation . OR 1b . For Cohort 2 : The patient 7 17 year age time informed consent , inclusive . The patient must ERTnaive . The patient hemizygous male Fabry disease confirm deficiency alphagalactosidase A activity measure serum , leukocytes , fibroblast . Male patient already documented deficiency alphagalactosidase A activity provide blood sample screen determination alphagalactosidase A activity level serum . OR The patient heterozygous female hemizygous male Fabry disease confirm mutation alphagalactosidase A gene . Patients already document mutation alphagalactosidase A gene provide blood sample screen genotyping . 2 . Adequate general health ( determined Investigators ) undergo specify phlebotomy regimen protocolrelated procedure safety medical contraindication participation . 3 . The minor child must assent participate protocol parent ( ) legally authorize guardian ( ) must voluntarily sign Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee ( IRB/IEC ) approve informed concent form relevant aspect study explain discuss child child 's parent ( ) legal guardian ( ) . Patients meet follow criterion eligible study : Patient and/or patient 's parent ( ) legal guardian ( ) unable understand nature , scope , possible consequence study . Patient unable comply protocol , e.g. , uncooperative protocol schedule , refusal agree study procedure , inability return safety evaluation , otherwise unlikely complete study , determine Investigator medical monitor .</criteria>
