	<brief_title>Metabolic Abnormalities HIV Infected Uninfected Young Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) regimens develop potentially deleterious metabolic effect , include insulin resistance , dyslipidemia , osteopenia osteoporosis , hyperlactatemia . Changes body fat distribution bone metabolism also document . There considerable evidence protease inhibitor ( PI ) induce insulin resistance increase triglyceride cholesterol level . It also clear metabolic change fat distribution abnormality occur PI-naive patient treat nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) . In addition class specific effect , emerge evidence difference within class drug nature magnitude metabolic effect . This study examine metabolic effect HAART young woman . Adolescent woman age 12 24 year recruit 5 treatment stratum : Stratum 1 - HIV uninfected ; Stratum 2 - HIV infect never HAART ; Stratum 3 - HIV infect NNRTI regimen 3 month less 2 week PI therapy ; Stratum 4 - HIV infect PI regimen 3 month less 2 week NNRTI therapy ; Stratum 5 - HIV infect NRTI-only regimen 3 month less 2 week PI NNRTI therapy . Participants study one study visit conduct 1 2 day . The study visit include survey questionnaire , DEXA scanning , anthropometric measurement , blood test examine lactate , glucose , lipid metabolism .</detailed_description>
