	<brief_summary>Of four million trauma case year require hospitalization , 200,000 classify severe trauma . During hospital stay , malnutrition major complication 50 % patient population . The result muscle waste major risk factor increase morbidity mortality . In study postulate supplementation beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate ( HMB ) , arginine glutamine ( HMB/Arg/Gln ) HMB alone severely traumatized patient stem loss muscle tissue whole body nitrogen turn decrease morbidity mortality . This hypothesis base two recent study show nutritional mixture HMB/Arg/Gln reverse muscle waste associated AIDS Cancer . The hypermetabolic state see AIDS cancer similar multifactorial etiology see trauma . There increase mobilization fat muscle , increase normal metabolic rate , increase protein breakdown , increase normal glucose turnover . In addition , HMB alone show reduce nitrogen loss , decrease muscle proteolysis muscle damage within first 48 hour three week initiate supplementation strenuous exercise program . Male female patient ( n=100 ) recruit time admittance Trauma ICU ISS great 18 . Patients meet inclusion/exclusion criterion randomize receive either 1 ) standard tube feed plus HMB/Arg/Gln , 2 ) standard tube feed plus HMB alone , 3 ) standard tube feed ( control ) double-blinded fashion . Clinical outcome measure assess hospital stay outpatient basis week 4 12 . Muscle proteolysis nitrogen economy evaluate daily basis hospital 4 week patient basis . If expect , Phase I result confirm effectiveness nutrient mixture trauma patient , expand multicenter study propose Phase II .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : To compare effectiveness immediate nutritional intervention either HMB , arginine , glutamine HMB alone placebo supplement critically ill trauma patient : - decrease muscle protein turnover nitrogen loss - improve nutritional status , - improve clinical outcome , - prevent total body weight skeletal muscle loss - improve immune status OUTLINE : This double blind , placebo-controlled randomize clinical study . After receive informed consent participation study next kin , patient randomly assign one 3 treatment arm : Arm 1 : Standard tube feed plus nutritional supplement supply 3 gram HMB , 14 gram arginine 14 gram glutamine per day . The supplement divide two equal dosage one dose give morning one dose give even . Arm 2 : Standard tube feed plus nutritional supplement supply 3 gram HMB . This nutritional supplement contain gelatin non-essential amino acid isonitrogenous supplement Arm 1 . The supplement also divide two equal dosage one dose give morning one dose give even . Arm 3 : Standard tube feed plus nutritional supplement supply mixture gelatin amino acid isonitrogenous supplement Arm 1 . The supplement divide two equal dosage one dose give morning one dose give even . Patients receive nutritional supplement period 4 week . If patient leave hospital ICU time and/or discontinues enteral nutrition support , supplement continue orally full 4-week period . Several clinical outcome measure follow hospital length stay , ICU length stay , mortality , number ventilator day , incidence infectious complication . Clinical outcome assess hospital stay 4 12 week . Muscle protein metabolism measure hospital stay 4 week . Nutritional status hospitalize assessed serum pre-albumin level day 0,1 , 3 , 7 , 14 . White blood count , number confirm infection C-Reactive Protein level serve proxy immune status .</detailed_description>
