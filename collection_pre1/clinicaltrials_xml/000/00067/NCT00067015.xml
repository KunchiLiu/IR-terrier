	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Giving radiation therapy different way may cause less damage normal tissue may improve quality life help patient live comfortably . Androgens stimulate growth prostate cancer cell . Drugs goserelin bicalutamide may fight cancer stop production androgen . It yet know whether radiation therapy effective without goserelin bicalutamide treat prostate cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness high-dose radiation therapy without bicalutamide goserelin treat patient prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy With Without Bicalutamide Goserelin Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare quality life patient high-grade intermediate-risk unfavorable-risk adenocarcinoma prostate treat high-dose intensity-modulated radiotherapy alone versus androgen deprivation comprise bicalutamide goserelin . - Compare prostate-specific antigen relapse-free , distant metastases-free , overall survival patient treat regimen . - Compare toxicity regimens patient . - Compare local control patient treat regimen , base post-treatment sextant biopsy perform 4 year study completion . OUTLINE : This randomize study . Patients stratify accord prostate-specific antigen level , Gleason score , clinical stage . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo high-dose intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) 4-5 time per week 10 week ( total 48 treatment ) . - Arm II : Patients receive oral bicalutamide daily 18.5 week . Three seven day initiation bicalutamide , patient also receive goserelin subcutaneously monthly 2 year . Beginning 10 week hormonal therapy , patient undergo concurrent high-dose IMRT 4-5 time per week 8.5 week ( total 42 treatment ) . Patients discontinue bicalutamide near end radiotherapy . In arm , treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline , every 3 month 1.5 year completion radiotherapy , 6 month later , annually 2 year . Patients follow every 6-8 month 4 year annually 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 400 patient ( 200 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 4-5 year .</detailed_description>
