	<brief_summary>HIV find blood genital tract . This study compare level type HIV find blood level type HIV find female genital tract . Study hypotheses : 1 ) In presence antiretroviral therapy , viral replication within female genital tract may lead development drug resistance different virus blood plasma . 2 ) Antiretroviral drug level female genital tract may often lower blood plasma difference drug exposure may associate difference virus replication selection resistant HIV variant drug failure . 3 ) HIV recover vitro cell female genital tract successful therapy , may genetically different HIV variant recover blood cell latent reservoir visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Approximately 42 million adult living HIV/AIDS . The predominant mode HIV transmission worldwide heterosexual contact . While many behavioral biologic factor associate sexual transmission HIV , viral load identify chief predictor risk sexual transmission . Research show strong correlation blood plasma viral load genital tract viral load . Antiretroviral medication reduce blood plasma genital tract HIV RNA level , antiretrovirals also lead drug resistant HIV . In United States Europe , 2 % 27 % newly infect patient infected drug resistant HIV . There report resistant genotypic variant genital tract differ variant find blood . Understanding dynamic HIV genital tract great importance strategy control transmission HIV . This study evaluate level variant HIV blood genital tract woman take antiretroviral medication . Both woman fail current antiretroviral regimen ( Group 1 ) fully suppress antiretroviral therapy ( Group 2 ) enrol study . Women Group 1 study visit study entry , 2 week change medication , every 4 week amount HIV blood genital tract undetectable . Drug level blood genital tract also measure first visit change medication . Once level HIV undetectable , woman see every 3 month 36 month . Women Group 1 follow 42 month . Women Group 2 study visit blood genital tract collection study entry every 4 week 12 month .</detailed_description>
