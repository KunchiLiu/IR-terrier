	<brief_summary>This study test whether Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) team train benchmarking -- compare care practice different NICUs see practice prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) -- quality improvement would change practice improve rate survival without BPD inborn neonate birth weight &lt; 1250 gram . Benchmarking method involve detailed comparison process similar organization . For study , three NRN center lowest rate BPD identify Benchmark center . During 6-month pre-intervention period , detail care practice management style center carefully assess . Based practice Benchmarking site , develop quality improvement program . For study , 14 NRN site randomize either implement benchmarking intervention ( intervention site ) continue usual care practice ( control sit ) . After 1-year intervention period , compare change rate survival without BPD 36 week correct age intervention control sit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Benchmarking Initiative Reduce Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 1998 , 55 % Very Low Birth Weight ( VBLW ) infant ( bear &lt; 1,250g ) bear center National Institute Child Health Human Development ( NICHD ) Neonatal Research Network ( NRN ) either die develop BPD . Previous study within NICHD Neonatal Research Network show substantial difference incidence BPD center . These difference explain birth weight , gestational age , race , frequency antenatal steroid use , incidence respiratory distress syndrome . Practice difference may contribute BPD incidence variation . This study evaluate efficacy Benchmarking Initiative modify clinical care practice decrease incidence BPD VLBW infant . This study test whether Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) team train benchmarking -- compare care practice different NICUs see practice prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) -- quality improvement would change practice improve rate survival without BPD inborn neonate birth weight &lt; 1250 gram . Benchmarking method involve detailed comparison process similar organization . For study , three NRN center lowest rate BPD identify Benchmark center . During 6-month pre-intervention period , detail care practice management style center carefully assess . Based practice Benchmarking site , develop quality improvement program . For study , 14 NRN site randomize either implement benchmarking intervention ( intervention site ) continue usual care practice ( control sit ) . After 1-year intervention period , compare change rate survival without BPD 36 week correct age intervention control sit .</detailed_description>
