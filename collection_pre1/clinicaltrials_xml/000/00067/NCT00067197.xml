	<brief_summary>No universally successful therapy exist promotes recovery motor function stroke , main cause long-term disability among adult . The purpose study develop strategy improve recovery lose motor function . It combine motor skill train brain-stimulating technique call transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) . Healthy adult volunteer adult stroke patient enrol study . Participants come NIH clinical neurological exam , , necessary , MRI [ magnetic resonance image ] examination . Participants return 4 session ; last approximately 3 hour . The first practice session participant become familiar motor skill require study , perform finger movement keyboard , pinching , tap , make wrist movement , lift small item . In session 2 3 , participant perform motor skill practice session 1 receiving tDCS . During session 4 , receive tDCS , performance motor skill . During tDCS , investigator place electrode gel participant ' head pass tDCS current two electrode . tDCS painless procedure . Participants receive $ 420 compensation involvement study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Motor Learning Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There universally accept strategy promote recovery motor function chronic stroke , main cause long-term disability among adult . It desirable develop strategy accelerate motor learn patient group . Previous study healthy volunteer demonstrate cortical stimulation association train lead improvement motor learn use-dependent plasticity . The purpose protocol apply painless stimulation technique motor cortex affect hemisphere patient subcortical stroke ( transcranial DC stimulation , tDCS ) test hypothesis tDCS motor cortex affect hemisphere association motor train improve motor learn finger sequence paretic hand . Furthermore , recent study demonstrate unaffected hemisphere exerts abnormally high inhibitory influence affect hemisphere . This abnormality might adversely influence motor recovery . Therefore purpose study apply tDCS unaffected hemisphere test hypothesis reduction inhibitory influence unaffected hemisphere affect association motor train improve motor learning . This technique far apply several hundred subject worldwide absence undesirable side effect report date . We plan study patient chronic stroke healthy age- gender match normal volunteer . Primary outcome measure number correct keyboard piano sequence play specific time-period ( 30 second ) . Secondary outcome measure speed tap one finger ; simple reaction time ; pinch force ; functional measure activity daily life ( ADL ) : Jebsen-Tailor-Test . To good understand mechanism underlie propose behavioral gain , use TMS identify change corticomotor excitability .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : We include patient thromboembolic nonhemorrhagic hemispheric lesion least 3 month stroke . We choose Patients initially severe motor paresis ( MRC grade 2 ) , subsequently recover point residual motor deficit perform require task . Assessment initial functional state take either patient report medical record . As control group , include age gender match Normal Volunteers match nondominant/dominant hand ( affected hand stroke patient ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients one stroke medical cerebral artery territory . Patients bilateral motor impairment . Patients cerebellar brainstem lesion . Patients Normal Volunteers unable perform task ( wrist elbow flexion least MRC grade 2 ) . Patients Normal Volunteers severe alcohol drug abuse , psychiatric illness like severe depression , poor motivational capacity , severe language disturbance , particularly receptive nature serious cognitive deficit ( define equivalent minimental state exam score 23 less ) . Patients Normal Volunteers history severe uncontrolled medical problem ( e.g . cardiovascular disease , severe rheumatoid arthritis , active joint deformity arthritic origin , active cancer renal disease , kind endstage pulmonary cardiovascular disease , deteriorate condition due age , uncontrolled epilepsy others ) . Patients Normal Volunteers increase intracranial pressure evaluate clinical mean . Patients Normal Volunteers unstable cardiac arrhythmia . Patients Normal Volunteers h/o hyperthyroidism individual receive drug act primarily central nervous system . Patients Normal Volunteers moderate severe microangiopathy , polyneuropathy , diabetes mellitus , ischemic peripheral disease . Patients Normal Volunteers professional piano player . Pregnancy .</criteria>
