	<detailed_description>TMD widespread chronic pain condition . Successful psychosocial treatment TMD develop , mechanisms treatment achieve effect well know . The goal project evaluate possible mechanism responsible treatment gain TMD treatment . Men woman ( N=106 ) complaints chronic facial pain least 3 month ' duration recruit University Dental Clinics community via advertisement randomly assign either Standard Conservative Treatment ( STD ) employ intraoral splint plus anti-inflammatory agent , Standard Treatment + Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment Program ( STD+CBT ) , include standard treatment also focus change self-efficacy decrease catastrophization .

This do minimize retrospective bias may hamper early study treatment process . Dependent variable self-report measure distress , pain , interference activity , well blood plasma level cortisol select cytokine , measured end 6-week treatment period , follow-up point thereafter 12-month follow-up . It expect STD+CBT treatment result measurable change construct self-efficacy catastrophization , change relate improved outcome compare STD control . It also expect outcome difference group associate change inflammatory mediator ( cytokine level ) . Finally , suggest change situational treatment process variable associate change cytokine level . The result may indicate true active mechanism successful TMD treatment . If mechanism successfully identify would important implication development effective treatment program .</detailed_description>
