	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find best safe dose 2 different drug combination . For purpose , participant either receive combination clofarabine plus idarubicin clofarabine plus idarubicin ara-C. Once best safe dose drug combination find , next goal compare drug combination clofarabine/idarubicin/ara-C , clofarabine/ara-C , clofarabine/idarubicin treatment patient Acute Myeloid Leukemia , high-grade MDS , myeloid blast phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia relapse follow initial therapy . In current extension part study , receive clofarabine/idarubicin/ara-C combination . The activity safety treatment study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clofarabine Combinations Relapsed/Refractory AML , MDS Myeloid Blast Phase CML</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clofarabine new drug design help treat leukemia . Ara-C idarubicin drug commonly use help treat leukemia . Before treatment start , ask question medical history complete physical exam . You blood sample ( 1 tablespoon ) collect routine lab test . You either echocardiogram MUGA scan check function heart . You sample bone marrow collect check status disease . To collect bone marrow sample , area hip chest bone numb anesthetic small amount bone marrow withdrawn large needle . Women able child must negative blood urine pregnancy test . The first group participant enter study take part Phase I portion study . The goal Phase I portion find best safe dose drug combination clofarabine plus idarubicin clofarabine plus idarubicin ara-C . If take part Phase I portion study , assign one two group . Participants first group receive combination clofarabine idarubicin . Participants second group receive combination clofarabine , idarubicin , ara-C. For participant clofarabine/idarubicin group , clofarabine give vein 1 hour day 5 day row . Idarubicin give vein 30 minute , around one hour clofarabine , first 3 day . This 5 day period call cycle chemotherapy . For participant clofarabine/idarubicin/ara-C group , clofarabine give vein 1 hour day 5 day row , Days 2 6 cycle . Idarubicin give vein 30 minute 3 day row , Days 1 3 cycle . Ara-C give vein 2 hour 5 day row , Days 1 5 cycle . Idarubicin usually start around 1 hour completion clofarabine , ara-C 4 hour start clofarabine infusion . This 6 day period call cycle chemotherapy . For participant group , cycle therapy , receive next cycle chemotherapy blood count recover possible side effect go away ( around 3 6 week ) . If disease get bad side effect become severe , treatment stop . You must stay Houston first 4 6 week ( average ) treatment require return Houston receive additional cycle chemotherapy ( 6 day cycle ) . The first participant enter Phase I portion study receive low dose study drug . The next participant receive slightly high dose drug . This continue best safe dose 2 combination drug find . If take part Phase I portion study , receive least 1 cycle therapy . If 1-2 cycle therapy find disease respond therapy , may continue receive therapy 4 additional course `` consolidation therapy '' . During `` consolidation therapy '' also give treatment course ara-C alone . When ara-C give alone give continuous infusion , 24 hour day , 5 day row . You give portable pump treatment do outpatient . The combination drug course ara-C course alternate ( ara-C alone , combination , ara-C alone , combination ) total 4 course . If find disease respond chemotherapy , take study doctor discus treatment option . Once best safe dose drug combination find , next group participant enter study take part Phase II portion study . The goal part study compare effect drug combination clofarabine/idarubicin/ara-C , clofarabine/ara-C , clofarabine/idarubicin treatment AML , MDS , CML . If take part Phase II portion study , assign receive treatment clofarabine plus idarubicin ara-C. For participant clofarabine/idarubicin/ara-C group , clofarabine give vein 1 hour day 5 day row , Days 2 6 cycle . Idarubicin give vein 30 minute 3 day row , Days 1 3 cycle . Ara-C give vein 2 hour 5 day row , Days 1 5 cycle . Idarubicin usually start around 1 hour completion clofarabine , ara-C 4 hour start clofarabine infusion . This 6 day period call cycle chemotherapy . If take part Phase II portion study , receive least 1 cycle therapy . If 1 2 cycle therapy find disease respond therapy , may continue receive therapy 4 additional course `` consolidation therapy '' . During `` consolidation therapy '' also give treatment course ara-C alone . When ara-C give alone give continuous infusion , 24 hour day , 5 day row . You give portable pump treatment do outpatient . The combination drug course ara-C course alternate ( ara-C alone , combination , ara-C alone , combination ) total 4 course . If find disease respond chemotherapy , take study doctor discus treatment option . The check-up visit participant Phase I Phase II portion study . Before receive dose drug ( ) , complete physical exam . During treatment , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) collect least week first 2 course therapy , every 2-4 week . Bone marrow sample collect every week treatment check status disease . The blood bone marrow sample may collect often doctor feel necessary . If , time , disease get bad experience intolerable side effect , take study doctor discus treatment option . After last course treatment , follow-up visit schedule . At visit , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) collect routine test . You sample bone marrow collect check status disease . You also repeat echocardiogram MUGA scan check function heart . This investigational study . Clofarabine authorize FDA use research . Idarubicin ara-C FDA approve commercially available . A total 44 patient enrolled Phase I part study , complete . Up 120 participant take part phase II part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
