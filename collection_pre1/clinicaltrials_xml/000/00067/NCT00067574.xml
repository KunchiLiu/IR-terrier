	<brief_summary>This study attempt stimulate immune system HIV infect adolescent young adult well control HIV infection . When anti-HIV drug stop period time , virus `` grow back . '' This may stimulate immune system , may effective control virus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Plan Decrease Drug Exposure HIV Infected Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The focus study use Structured Treatment Interruption ( STI ) approach auto-immunization . The STI management schema base current understanding HIV-1 viral dynamic , pharmacology available antiretroviral medication , HIV-specific host response . This Phase II trial provide preliminary data feasibility possible efficacy use STI enhance immune-based control HIV-1 replication . A steady state HIV-1 viral load determine historical test prior initiate highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) compare steady state viral load post-STI . HIV-1 specific CD4 CD8 cell response measure period STI management HIV-1 specific CD8 cell maturational phenotype assess correlated ability control viral replication . Adolescents young adult either sustained viral suppression HAART least 2 year sustain viral suppression 3 6 month eligible study . Participants 12 week HAART follow 2 4 week treatment interruption . Participants undergo three round regimen . After third STI , participants additional 12 week HAART stop therapy . Participants monitor HAART 20 week . During time , evidence HIV progression ( two consecutive viral load exceed 10,000 copies/ml ; two consecutive CD4 cell count 350 cells/microL ; two consecutive CD4 percentages less 15 % ; two consecutive CD4 cell count less 50 % baseline ) , standard continuous antiretroviral therapy reinstituted . Plasma HIV RNA test monthly therapy weekly subject treatment . Immunologic study monthly throughout study . Participants involve study approximately 2 year .</detailed_description>
