	<detailed_description>Uric acid natural inhibitor certain chemistry associate peroxynitrite , product inflammation . In animal model multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , chemical reaction associate breakdown blood-brain barrier CNS tissue damage . In addition , MS patient serum uric acid level low age- sex- match healthy individual . The primary purpose study determine whether raise low serum uric acid level daily oral administration precursor inosine effect cumulative number newly active lesion magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) evaluate safety tolerability inosine patient diagnose relapse remit secondary progressive MS .</detailed_description>
