	<detailed_description>Renal transplant loss due chronic allograft nephropathy ( CAN ) widely acknowledge major problem increase relative importance incidence early graft loss acute rejection decline . Studies various center , include University Minnesota , suggest , exclude patient die function graft , many 80 % patient return dialysis CAN . At present time therapeutic option clinical manifestation CAN develop . Testing measure prevent CAN address . The overall purpose project investigate role renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ( RAAS ) development CAN . This system play important role progression many experimental clinical renal disease . Furthermore , blockade system angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor angiotensin II receptor blocker yield beneficial result retard injury progression numerous intrinsic renal disease . This study specifically investigate long term benefit angiotensin II receptor blocker , losartan , prevention cortical interstitial volume expansion ( accurate predictor long term graft function ) graft loss biopsy prove CAN 5 year , randomize , double mask , placebo control study kidney transplant recipient . This clinical trial directly test hypothesis blockade renin angiotensin aldosterone system provide substantial benefit blood pressure lower independent mechanism , namely , interruption fibrogenic pathway , anti-proteinuric action , amelioration hyperfiltration possibly immunomodulatory effect . The propose study also characterize interstitial ultrastructural compositional change occur renal allograft CAN , effect treatment change provide complete description incidence predictor development transplant glomerulopathy . These study also determine impact angiotensin II receptor blockade rate decline glomerular filtration rate , well impact glomerular size rate graft loss CAN , incidence progression post transplant proteinuria , nature permselectivity defect responsible proteinuria also explore association proteinuria graft loss CAN . This trial also help construct profile RAAS transplant recipient explore relationship two gene polymorphism , ACE TGF-Beta , CAN . These study help describe natural history , nature pathogenesis CAN , elucidate early marker predictor important disorder , perhaps , define safe useful preventative strategy .</detailed_description>
