	<brief_summary>This study child young adult compare two type image , positron emission tomography ( [ ( 18 ) F ] -DG PET ) proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( ( 1 ) H-MRSI ) , determine activity brain tumor abnormal tissue brain follow treatment brain tumor . Children brain tumor generally follow magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan evaluate response treatment . However , MRI provide information structure brain , may difficult tell abnormal finding due tumor , swell , scar tissue , dead tissue . ( 1 ) H-MRSI [ ( 18 ) F ] -DG PET , hand , provide information metabolic activity brain lesion . These two method compare evaluated ability provide important additional information childhood brain tumor . Patients 1 21 year age brain tumor brain tissue abnormality follow treatment brain tumor may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , pregnancy test woman able become pregnant , blood test glucose . Participants undergo follow procedure : ( 1 ) H-MRSI - This test similar MRI do scan machine . In MRI , scan brain obtain apply strong magnetic field collect signal release water magnetic field change . Pictures brain obtain computer analysis signal . In ( 1 ) H-MRSI , computer block signal water get information brain chemical indicate whether abnormality tumor dead tissue . Both MRI MRI ( 1 ) H-MRSI do study . For test , child lie stretcher move scanner - narrow metal cylinder strong magnetic field . The child 's head place headrest prevent movement scan . He hear loud thumping noise cause electrical switching magnetic field . A contrast agent give intravenous ( IV ) catheter ( plastic tube place arm vein ) central line one place . The contrast material brightens image provide clear picture abnormality . Children difficulty hold still scan machine give medication anesthesiologist make sleep procedure . Children awake procedure communicate MRI technician time ask remove scanner time . The MRI ( 1 ) H-MRSI take 1-1/2 2 hour complete . [ ( 18 ) F ] -DG PET - For test , [ ( 18 ) F ] -DG ( radioactive form glucose ) inject patient 's arm vein catheter , follow PET scan , similar open MRI scan without noise . The PET scan tell active patient 's tumor track radioactive glucose . All cell use glucose , cell increase metabolism , cancer cell , use glucose normal cell . After glucose injection , patient lie quietly darken room 30 minute , ask urinate help reduce dose radiation bladder . Then , scan begin . When scan finish ( 1 hour ) , child ask urinate every 3 4 hour rest day . Patients remain study 2 year unless withdraw , become pregnant , require sedation longer use anesthetic . MRI 1H-MRSI scan may repeat every month study period , necessary . Only one PET scan do year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison PET Proton MRS Imaging Evaluate Pediatric Brain Tumor Activity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Children brain tumor generally follow response progression image study , CT MRI . - While image study help delineate anatomical location extent tumor within CNS , give information regard biologic metabolic activity lesion . - Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging ( ( 1 ) H-MRSI ) non-invasive method detect measure cellular metabolite vivo , provide biochemical information conjunction spatial information obtain MRI . - Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) technique also provide data metabolic activity brain lesion . - A comparison two method determine lesion metabolic activity report child brain tumor . Objective : - To compare ( 1 ) H-MRSI [ ( 18 ) F- ] -FDG PET scan percentage ( % ) agreement supratentorial infratentorial tumor , brainstem cerebellum intratentorial tumor . - To correlate result ( 1 ) H-MRSI ( 18 ) F-FDG PET image outcome . - To use [ ( 18 ) F- ] -FDG PET , ( 1 ) H-MRSI various MR sequence evaluate change time primary brain tumor result natural history lesion therapeutic effect . Eligibility : - Age : great equal 1 year less 21 year - Patients must brain tumor measurable evaluable standard MRI CT. Design : - Patients refer study ( 1 ) H-MRSI ( 18 ) F-FDG PET image perform within 2 week NCI - Patients remain study 5 year one off-study criterion meet ( whichever occurs first )</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Age : great equal 1 year less equal 21 year . 2 . Radiographic diagnosis : Patients must brain tumor ( include , limited high grade glioma , lowgrade glioma , primitive neuroectodermal tumor , ependymomas ) residual abnormality ( e.g . postoperatively postradiation ) measurable evaluable standard MRI CT. 3 . All patient legal guardian ( patient le 18 year age ) must sign document inform consent indicate awareness investigational nature risk study . When appropriate , minor patient ask oral assent . The parent guardian sign consent form designate line attest fact minor give assent . 4 . Durable Power Attorney ( DPA ) : A DPA offer patient 1821 year age . 5 . Prior treatment : Patients eligible study regardless prior treatment , long meet eligibility criterion . Therefore , patient newly diagnose , postoperative , postradiation postchemotherapy eligible . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patients age 18 year weigh great 70 kg exclude would exceed standard allowable dosimetry pediatric patient ( i.e . Effective Dose great 0.5 REM/year ) . In addition , patient weigh great 136 kg exclude , maximum weight allowable PET scanner table . 2 . Pregnant woman exclude effect magnet fetus unknown . In addition , gadolinium approve use pregnant woman , teratogenic effect study wish avoid radiation exposure fetus . 3 . Any patient unable ( either physical psychological factor ) undergo image study without sedation consider anesthesia candidate . 4 . Any patient metallic MRI incompatible implant , include cardiac pacemaker , neural pacemaker , aneurysmal clip , shrapnel , cochlear implant ferrous surgical clip . 5 . Any patient history severe reaction ( CTC v.4 Grade great equal 2 ) Gadolinium contrast agent . 6 . Any patient Diabetes mellitus steroidinduced hyperglycemia ( fast glucose great 150 ) may interfere interpretation [ ( 18 ) F ] FDG PET scan . 7 . Any patient permanent brace , permanent retainer nonferrous implant , judgment Principal Investigator , would interfere obtain spectroscopy area tumor .</criteria>
