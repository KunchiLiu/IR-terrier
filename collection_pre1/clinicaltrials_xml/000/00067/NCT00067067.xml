	<brief_summary>Recent study suggest cell bone marrow-endothelial precursor cell ( EPCs ) -can provide blood supply cancerous tumor . The purpose study collect brain tumor blood sample look EPCs sample analyze growth signal may help blood vessel grow tumor . Researchers study follow sample : 1 ) number blood vessel tumor ; 2 ) level growth factor tumor blood ; 3 ) level circulate EPCs blood ; 4 ) change gene protein blood tumor influence growth factor level . Participants 18 year age old evidence brain tumor require surgery . From surgery donate blood tumor sample . Participants follow-up visit 4 8 week surgery , 3-month interval two-and-one-half year , 6-month interval thereafter . At visit , participant undergo physical exam , brain scan , blood work .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Angiogenesis , development new blood vessel , appear one key tumor survival . Areas new blood vessel growth , neovascularization , trauma tissue ischemia , appear release factor stimulate production endothelial cell progenitor stem cell locate bone marrow . Endothelial cell inside line blood vessel important formation viable functional blood vessel conduit . Recent work suggest tumors-including primary brain tumors-secrete many stimulatory growth factor normally incite endothelial cell produce turned circulation . Initial evidence suggest circulate endothelial progenitor cell ( EPCs ) play role impressive neovascularization see tumor . In study , wish investigate interaction glioma EPCs elucidate potential role EPCs tumor formation , response therapy , progression , overall survival , well , identify potential new target anti-tumor and/or anti-angiogenic therapy use genomic proteomic technique . Patients suspect , prior biopsy proof , WHO grade II-IV central nervous system ( CNS ) glial tumor ( ) see Surgical Neurology Branch , NINDS , consider entry study . Tissue sample tumor resect part standard care collect surgery preserve research . Blood sample also collect . Blood also collect anonymous normal volunteer donate blood NIH Blood Bank ; anonymous donor serve control .</detailed_description>
