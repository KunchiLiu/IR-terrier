	<brief_summary>Doctors use cool brain help stop seizure . This procedure usually accomplish surgery . Cooling face scalp may also cool brain , avoid need surgery . The purpose study ass head-neck cooling device patient wear . Researchers determine whether device change frequency seizures people epilepsy . Study participant must 21 year age old must experience seizure occur week regular basis . Participants ask keep detailed seizure diary 12-week period date first cool session . For four cooling session , participant admit hospital overnight . They undergo physical neurological exam EEG ( electroencephalogram ) . They also swallow temperature-sensor pill . Participants one 60-minute cooling session week 4 week . Investigators paste temperature-sensing electrode scalp , forearm , abdomen , leg . Participants fit cool unit session begin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reducing Seizure Frequency Using Cooling Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous experimental well clinical report clearly show cool brain inhibitory effect epileptiform discharge seizure . We hypothesize mild cool brain anti-epileptic effect epileptic patient either identifiable seizure focus , multiple focus , frequent localization-related seizure refractory antiepileptic drug . We study feasibility safety head-neck cool device 10 adult normal volunteer , find head-neck cooling feasible safe , without significant complaint problem voice subject . Overall , slight reduction core temperature show . Since cool twice-a-week basis well tolerate normal volunteer , would like extend study patient epilepsy learn optimal duration frequency head-neck cooling term reduce seizure frequency . This pilot study , direct PIRC IRB , evaluate 60 minute cool perform week 4 week 5 epileptic patient . We report result PIRC IRB proceed study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : A minimum one document seizure type per 1week period . 21 year old , able cooperate cooling procedure . On stable antiepileptic drug ( AED ) regimen , determine history AED plasma level measure CC OPD . The ability maintain daily seizure calendar , either independently help family member . No history intestinal problem history intestinal surgery . Must able swallow medication capsule form . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Female patient pregnant . Those patient 21 year age . Those patient may difficulty swallow large capsule , describe feeling experience related cooling session . Those patient history intestinal problem intestinal surgery Those patient progressive neurological disorder Those sensitive coldness History severe 'icecream ' headache</criteria>
