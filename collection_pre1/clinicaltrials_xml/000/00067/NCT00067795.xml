	<brief_summary>Some people 's immune system able control HIV infection without anti-HIV drug . Other people HIV must take drug prevent virus destroy immune system . There many different laboratory test measure immune function people HIV . This study compare test see consistently measure difference people control HIV without anti-HIV drug must take drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The efficiency immune response HIV antigens critical feature allow individual chronic HIV infection maintain low level viremia ( less 3000 copies/ml ) . The fundamental measurement response steady state level viremia absence antiretroviral drug . However , use clinical endpoint vaccine drug trial time-consuming . Several laboratory assay HIV T cell function develop measure key characteristic efficient immune response . This study evaluate assay two distinct patient population . Two patient cohort follow study . Cohort A enroll patient stable highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) . These patient HAART regimen least 9 month prior study entry . Cohort B enroll patient chronic HIV infection efficient immune control . These patient antiretroviral drug least 6 month viral load le 3,000 copies/ml . Participants cohorts blood drawn study entry Weeks 12 24 . Blood sample use CD4/CD8 cell count , plasma HIV-1 RNA , immunologic assay .</detailed_description>
