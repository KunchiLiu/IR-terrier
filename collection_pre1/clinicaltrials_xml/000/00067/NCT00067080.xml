	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine new orally active iron chelator , ICL670 , safe deferoxamine prevent accumulation iron body patient undergoing repeat blood transfusion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety ICL670 vs. Deferoxamine Sickle Cell Disease Patients With Iron Overload Due Blood Transfusions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients require repeat blood transfusion accumulate iron body blood cell contain iron natural body mechanism eliminate . After iron level get high enough toxic body . The current therapy choice deferoxamine good job remove excess iron , difficult administer . Deferoxamine require subcutaneous ( skin ) infusions 4 8 hour nightly 3 7 night per week . In addition need wear infusion pump nightly , adverse reaction around site injection frequent .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age great equal 2 year Sickle cell disease patient already treat suitable treatment deferoxamine 20 40 mg/kg/day Serum ferritin great 1000 mg/ml Liver iron content great 2 mg iron/g dw assess mean superconducting quantum interference device ( SQUID ) patient receive simple transfusion great 5 mg iron/ g dw patient receive exchange transfusion history intermittent blood transfusion . Regular transfusion aim maintain % Hb A 50 % previous history simple transfusion recipient least 20 unit pack red blood cell . Chronic anemia sickle cell disease Documented toxicity deferoxamine Elevated liver enzyme year preceeding enrollment Active hepatitis B hepatitis C HIV seropositivity Elevated serum creatinine significant proteinuria History nephrotic syndrome Uncontrolled systemic hypertension Fever signs/symptoms infection within 10 day prior start study Presence clinically relevant cataract previous history clinically relevant ocular toxicity relate iron chelation Second third degree AV block , clinically relevant QT interval prolongation , patient require digoxin drug prolong QT interval ( betaadrenergic receptor block agent ) . Diseases ( cardiovascular , renal , hepatic , etc . ) would prevent patient undergoing treatment option Psychiatric addictive disorder would prevent patient give informed consent History drug alcohol abuse within 12 month prior study Pregnant breast feeding patient Patients treated systemic investigational drug within 4 week topical investigational drug within 7 day start study Patients require concomitant therapy hydroxyurea Any surgical medical condition might significantly alter absorption , distribution , metabolism excretion drug , gastrointestinal disease major surgery , renal disease , difficulty void urinary obstruction , impaired pancreatic function Noncompliant unreliable patient Patients unable undergo study procedure hear eye test , liver echocardiography Patients unable undergo SQUID examination</criteria>
