	<brief_summary>This study collect specimens volunteer use study NIAID 's Vaccine Research Center . A number different type specimen sample collect , include blood , urine , body fluids secretion , skin swab , skin biopsy . The sample use medical research , include study HIV , hepatitis , diseases ; immune system response , response vaccination infection ; research vaccine development . Blood sample may collect either ordinary blood drawing ( phlebotomy ) apheresis , procedure collect large quantity blood cell plasma would possible simple blood drawing . For procedure , subject lie recliner couch . Blood remove needle vein one arm spun machine separate desire component ( plasma white blood cell ) . The remainder blood return either needle needle arm . The procedure take 1 3 hour . Volunteers 18 year age old , include participant NIH research protocol , may eligible . Individuals condition research staff consider reason make sample donation exclude study . Participants may one sample collect may ask undergo repetitive sample collection procedure , depend upon requirement particular research project sample collect . Each individual 's enrollment 1-year period , extend .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Apheresis Specimen Collection Procedures Obtain Plasma , Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells ( PBMCs ) Other Specimens Research Studies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Protocol Design : This protocol design perform collection human specimens , blood , mucosal secretion , skin swab , skin biopsy , body fluid support research study . These sample use laboratory research work development vaccine HIV infectious disease , study correlate immunity relate infectious disease laboratory work relate development and/or validation immunological assay . In order carry research study , often necessary obtain large quantity plasma mononuclea cell safely obtain simple phlebotomy . These component safely obtain use apheresis procedure Apheresis Clinic Clinical Center Department Transfusion Medicine ( DTM ) . The aphereses perform protocol conform requirement DTM Apheresis Clinic . Subjects : Volunteers , least 18 year old , ( include participant NIH research study ) agree donate specimen research purpose . Protocol Plan : Subjects receive information study procedure , willing participate , sign inform consent . The informed consent use long one year . If ongoing willingness donate sample subject must sign new consent eligibility confirm least per year . Duration : Individual subject may donate sample often permit protocol . The protocol undergo continue review IRB annually remain open approve continue need plasma PBMC sample obtain apheresis type specimens support research study . Endpoints : This protocol analysis plan rather conduct accordance Good Clinical Practices human research solely purpose obtain sample research laboratory . Samples identify protocol identification number . Subject data , demographic information , aspects medical history , laboratory parameter , recent immunization medication , HLA type , genetic test medical information may provide ( identify study number , subject name ) researcher need support objective laboratory research .</detailed_description>
