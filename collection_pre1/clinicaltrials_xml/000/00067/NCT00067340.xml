	<brief_title>Caries Transmission Prevention Alaska Native Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alaska Native child disproportionately affect early childhood caries , compare U.S child . Dental care need adults child rural Alaska far exceed acute care prevention resource available . As result , high level dental morbidity present among adult likely contributes early transmission mutans streptococci ( MS ) adult caregiver infant household . Furthermore , cultural practice pre-mastication solid food infant feeding amplifies transmission oral secretion adult child . The prevention early MS acquisition subsequent caries infant toddler require effort start birth . Since Alaska Natives rural population high risk caries , interruption vertical transmission MS use combination improve oral hygiene practice , topical antimicrobial bacteriostatic agent may ideal prevention strategy childhood caries . Chlorhexidine xylitol two agent show reduce dental decay MS count . The specific aim proposal conduct community base , randomize blind trial determine serial use chlorhexidine xylitol reduce vertical transmission caries Alaska Native mother infant . We hypothesize two week period twice-daily chlorhexidine mouthwash use prior delivery , follow subsequent two year period maternal xylitol gum use , lead significant reduction age-specific prevalence early childhood caries 12 24 month age among offspring mother intervention group , compare control group mother . We also hypothesize , compare control , mother child intervention group significant reduction oral MS count follow-up interval . If prove successful , intervention could significant impact prevalence caries among young Alaska Native child population group high risk childhood caries .</detailed_description>
