	<brief_summary>This study , conduct Walter Reed Army Medical Center , National Rehabilitation Hospital , National Institutes Health , examine whether drug Modafinil decrease fatigue patient post-polio syndrome . Many people polio develop weakness severe fatigue several year recovery acute disease . Modafinil approve Food Drug Administration improve wakefulness patient narcolepsy ( disease patient excessive daytime sleepiness ) use treat patient fatigue related medical condition , multiple sclerosis . This study compare effect two dos Modafinil placebo ( pill active ingredient ) fatigue patient post-polio syndrome . Patients develop fatigue , weakness , muscle pain atrophy , functional loss least 15 year recover polio whose symptom attribute another cause may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical neurological examination , fatigue rating scale , electrocardiogram , blood urine test , drowsiness depression evaluation , electroymogram ( EMG ) diagnose nerve muscle problem . For EMG , electrode ( small metal disc ) tap skin needle inserted muscle record electrical activity . Candidates also undergo sleep study exclude abnormal sleep pattern cause fatigue . For study , patient stay overnight NIH hospital . Electrodes place throat , finger , chest ( electrocardiogram ) , respiratory belt place around chest-abdomen area . During sleep ( 10:30 p.m. 6 a.m. ) , brain wave , eye leg movement , muscle tone , respiration , heart rate record . Beginning 8 a.m. follow morning , patient take 20-minute nap measure level daytime sleepiness , use record technique similar all-night study . When five nap complete , sleep study end . Candidates may also undergo lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) check certain chemical spinal fluid might relate fatigue look possible cause post-polio syndrome . This procedure optional . For lumbar puncture , local anesthetic give needle inserted space bone low back cerebrospinal fluid circulate spinal cord . A small amount fluid collect needle . Patients enrol study complete sleep diary entire study period . They randomly assign one two treatment groups-Modafinil placebo-for 6 week , follow 2-week washout period medication , crossover phase , patient take Modafinil first 6 week take placebo , take placebo take Modafinil . At first study visit , patient give supply study medication blood drawn . They take one pill twice day study phase . In study phase , evaluation do 3 6 week start medication . The evaluation include fill form complete screen visit , review drug side effect , review medical problem since last study visit . At 6-week visit , blood also drawn .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main objective study determine drug Modafinil effective treatment fatigue patient post-polio syndrome ( PPS ) . PPS motor neuron disease experience 400,000 Americans , characterize new weakness intense fatigue . The cause fatigue , common disabiling symptom patient , unknown effective treatment . In present study , select PPS patient randomize receive two different dos Modafinil placebo . After six week , patient enter two-week wash period , crossed arm . The sample size power reflect significant difference scale fatigue . Secondary exploratory study include investigation sleep pattern cause contribute fatigue search upregulation fatigue-associated cytokine patient 's serum CSF .</detailed_description>
