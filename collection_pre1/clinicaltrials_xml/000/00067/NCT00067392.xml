	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine difference success place implant immediately extraction site compare delay implant placement extraction site heal . In addition , level bone around implant compare determine one method lead good result time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Implants Placed Immediately Delayed Into Extraction Sites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This revise application clinical trial design evaluate crestal bone level change implant place extraction site immediately provisionalized . Extraction maxillary incisor teeth common procedure documented school clinic . Traditional treatment tooth extract include period heal follow placement implant . Our preliminary data indicate delayed approach result labial bone loss resultant horizontal deficiency 50 % case , require hard soft tissue graft achieve functional result . Additional preliminary data indicate graft extraction site and/or immediate implant placement provisionalization result functional restoration , without need additional adjunctive grafting procedure . It unclear crestal bone level change heal extraction site prior implant placement , contrast immediate implant placement , immediate provisionalization crown . We hypothesize difference crestal bone level ( primary endpoint ) , difference soft tissue level index ( secondary endpoint ) implant immediately temporize , place either delay immediately tooth extraction , bone loss immediate placement group ( experimental ) compare delayed placement group ( control ) . The long-term goal determine crestal bone remodel tooth extraction apical position implant determine final level crestal bone . Two group 45 patient evaluate . All subject single root maxillary tooth extract . One group socket graft mineralized bone allow four month prior implant placement . The crestal bone group remodel four month heal prior implant placement . The second group implant place immediately tooth extraction , thus crestal bone remodel presence implant immediately place temporary restoration , one-stage procedure . For group , implant immediately temporize crown implant placement . Standardized hard soft tissue data collect pre-extraction baseline , prospectively least two year trial , compare method contrast effectiveness propose immediate restoration therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patient willing present examination two time year least three year , well maintenance cleaning twice year 3 month prior data collection visit . All patient free uncontrolled diabetes ( type ) , exist malignancy , receive therapy suppresses immune system , radiation , chemotherapy , chronic steroid usage Need extraction single root maxillary central lateral incisor , canine , premolar , sign acute infection ( purulent exudate , erythema , pain , swell ) . Patients bone present surface tooth within 3 mm gingival margin plan restoration , order provide sufficient bone circumferentially cover implant . All patient adequate space satisfactory restoration edentulous space . Each patient 's dentition free active periodontal disease exhibit controllable periodontal disease teeth clinically nonmobile probe depth le 3 mm . All prospective site least 2mm attached keratinize gingiva . The crestal bone width enough accommodate either 3.75 diameter implant central incisor , canine , premolar site , 3.25 mm diameter implant lateral incisor tooth site . Bone height least 14 mm accommodation implant . Patients labial dehiscence defect great 3 mm propose gingival margin plan restoration exclude study . Patients come follow due conflict schedule accept study . Patients advance cardiovascular , pulmonary , renal , liver disease place ASA III IV rating exclude . Postmenopausal woman know osteoporosis determine medical internist , exclude . Patients know alcohol abuse exclude .</criteria>
