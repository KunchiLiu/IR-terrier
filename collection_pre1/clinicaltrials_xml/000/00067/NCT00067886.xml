	<brief_summary>Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) family protein-degrading enzyme involve breakdown remodel many tissue organ . Abnormal activity enzymes implicate many disease process include rheumatoid arthritis , dental disease metastatic cancer . Recent study also suggest elevation blood sugar may abnormally effect MMP enzyme activity . Decreased activity MMP enzymes may partial cause abnormal enlargement kidney ( renal hypertrophy ) see start diabetic kidney disease ( nephropathy ) . Preliminary clinical data laboratory confirm child newly diagnose type 1 diabetes mellitus ( DM ) low blood level enzymes time high blood sugar reading . However , enzyme level become normal blood sugar level improve insulin treatment . In present study , propose investigate hypothesis MMPs involve cause diabetic kidney disease measure concentration specific MMPs related protein blood urine patient type 1 DM age 14-40 year . We enroll patient recently diagnose diabetes , diabetes several year , without sign kidney disease , long-term diabetes various degree kidney disease . Continuous Subcutaneous Glucose Monitoring , conduct 3-4 day , also provide part study , determine different level blood sugar control might relate different level MMP enzyme activity blood . We anticipate study help establish link abnormal MMP activity cause nephropathy type 1 DM , allow scientist design good therapy prevention treatment diabetes-related kidney problem .</brief_summary>
