	<brief_title>Study Three Different Schedules Low-Dose Decitabine Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment : Methylation change occur Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) effect gene usage human cell . Abnormal methylation common leukemia . Decitabine new drug block DNA methylation . Before treatment start , physical exam , blood test ( 4-6 tablespoon ) , bone marrow study do . To collect bone marrow sample , area hip chest bone numb anesthetic small amount bone marrow withdrawn large needle . Women able child must negative blood urine pregnancy test . When study begin , participant randomly assign ( toss coin ) one 3 treatment group . The assignment one 3 schedule adjust accord well patient respond treatment . About 17 patient assign group first 50 patient . Participants first group receive decitabine intravenously ( IV -- needle vein ) one hour , day , 10 day . Treatment give every 4 8 week depend well blood count recover . Participants second group receive decitabine IV infusion one hour , day , 5 day . Treatment give every 4 8 week . Participants receive decitabine vein get total dose per course . Participants third group receive decitabine subcutaneous ( SQ ) injection ( injection give skin ) twice day 5 day . As first second group , treatment give every 4 8 week . After 65 patient enrol study , decide 5-day IV schedule best 3 schedule . The study continue new patient receive 5 -day IV decitabine treatment . If enrol study , place treatment group , instead randomly assign treatment group . Participants already study receive 5-day SQ schedule 10-day IV schedule , give option change 5-day IV schedule start next course study drug treatment , since consider new `` standard '' schedule particular study . If choose take part study begin receive study treatment describe , response treatment check complete 8 week therapy . If response treatment good , treatment decitabine continue . Decitabine treatment may continue 24 course , long judged best control leukemia . During study , need visit doctor physical exam vital sign . The frequency doctor visit vary depend physical condition , require least month . Blood test ( 2 teaspoon ) do every week first 6-8 week treatment , every 1 2 week length study . The blood sample use routine lab test . Periodic bone marrow sample also take check cell related disease , , completion study . Patients take study disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . This investigational study . Decitabine yet Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approved.Up 133 participant treat study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
