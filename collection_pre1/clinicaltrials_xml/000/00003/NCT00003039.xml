	<brief_title>Flavopiridol Treating Patients With Recurrent Intermediate-Grade High-Grade Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective response rate flavopiridol patient previously treat intermediate high grade non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma mantle cell lymphoma . II . Determine toxicity flavopiridol administer continuous infusion every 2 week patient . III . Study pharmacokinetics flavopiridol patient . OUTLINE : This open label , multi-institutional study . Patients receive treatment outpatient basis . Flavopiridol administer continuous infusion 72 hour every 2 week . Patients receive minimum 4 cycle therapy unless unacceptable toxicity disease progression occur . Patients follow death .</detailed_description>
