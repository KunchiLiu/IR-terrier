	<brief_title>Biological Therapy Previously Treated Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response rate median duration response interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) patient previously treat non-small cell lung cancer . II . Determine median survival patient treat IL-2 . III . Further delineate toxicity IL-2 patient . OUTLINE : This open label study . Patients receive bolus interleukin-2 day 1-5 8-12 . The cycle repeat every 3 week . Patient response evaluate 2 cycle . Patients stable disease , partial , complete response may treat maintenance IL-2 4 additional cycle . Patient evaluation perform every 2 cycle . At point , patient stable respond disease may treat IL-2 every 6 week disease progression , intolerable toxic effect , 2 cycle beyond complete response . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A maximum 30 patient accrue .</detailed_description>
