	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Antineoplastons naturally occur substance may also make laboratory . Antineoplastons may inhibit growth cancer cell . It yet know whether give antineoplastons chemotherapy effective chemotherapy alone treat woman refractory breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study methotrexate alone see well work campared methotrexate antineoplaston therapy treat postmenopausal woman advance refractory breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Methotrexate With Without Antineoplaston Therapy Treating Postmenopausal Women With Advanced Refractory Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare antitumor activity antineoplaston A10 methotrexate v methotrexate alone , term objective tumor response , woman advance breast cancer . - Compare adverse effect tolerance regimens patient . OUTLINE : This randomize study . - Arm I : Patients receive gradually escalate dos oral antineoplaston A10 capsule 7 time daily maximum tolerate dose reach , follow oral methotrexate capsule 2 3 time per day five day five day course . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive oral methotrexate alone schedule arm I. Tumors measure every 4 month 2 year , every 6 month year 3 4 , annually year 5 6 . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30-70 patient accrue study within least 12 month .</detailed_description>
