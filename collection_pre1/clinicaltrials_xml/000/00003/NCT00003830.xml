	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Removing sentinel lymph node examine microscope may help plan effective surgery breast cancer . It yet know surgery remove sentinel lymph node effective without removal lymph node armpit treat breast cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness surgery remove sentinel lymph node without removal lymph node armpit treat woman breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgery Remove Sentinel Lymph Nodes With Without Removing Lymph Nodes Armpit Treating Women With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare long term control regional disease sentinel node resection v sentinel node resection follow conventional axillary dissection woman breast cancer clinically node negative pathologically sentinel node negative . - Compare effect two regimen overall disease-free survival patient . - Compare morbidity associate two regimen patient . - Compare prognostic value two regimens patient sentinel node negative positive pathology . - Determine whether detailed pathology investigation identify group patient potentially increase risk systemic recurrence node negative pathology . - Determine technical success rate sentinel node dissection variability technical success rate broad population surgeon . - Determine sensitivity sentinel node determine presence nodal metastases patient . Objectives quality life questionnaire sentinel node-negative patient : - Compare severity self-assessed symptom activity limitation patient treat two regimen . - Compare severity self-assessed symptom activity limitation breast cancer surgery patient whose surgery dominant side v patient whose surgery non-dominant side . - Compare impact arm edema , range motion , sensory neuropathy self-assessed measure daily functioning , symptom , overall quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize study . Patients stratify accord surgical treatment plan ( lumpectomy v mastectomy ) , age ( 49 vs 50 ) , clinical tumor size ( great 2.0 cm vs 2.1-4.0 cm v least 4.1 cm ) . Patients randomize one two surgery arm . All patient receive technetium ( Tc 99m ) sulfur colloid inject normal breast tissue within 1 cm primary tumor biopsy cavity intradermal injection technetium ( Tc 99m ) sulfur colloid , approximately 0.5-8 hour surgery . Patients also receive injection isosulfan blue dye around tumor biopsy cavity hot spot identify gamma detector . If hot spot identify , blue dye inject saline bolus injection . - Arm I : Patients undergo sentinel node resection immediately follow conventional axillary dissection . - Arm II : Patients undergo sentinel node resection intraoperative examination sentinel node . Patients positive sentinel node undergo axillary dissection sentinel node resection . Patients cytologically negative sentinel node undergo axillary dissection . Patients cytologically negative histologically positive sentinel node return surgery axillary dissection . Patients histologically positive sentinel node sentinel node identify undergo axillary dissection sentinel node resection . Patients pathologically positive , nonaxillary sentinel node undergo axillary dissection sentinel node resection . Patients evidence tumor remain surgery undergo total mastectomy . Quality life assess baseline , week 1-3 , every 6 month 3 year recurrence . Patients follow 1 3 week , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 5,400 patient accrue study within 4 year .</detailed_description>
