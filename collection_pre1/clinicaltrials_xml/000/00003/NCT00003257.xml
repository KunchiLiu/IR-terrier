	<brief_title>Gene Therapy Treating Patients With Recurrent Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate objective response rate Ad5CMV-p53 patient recurrent squamous cell carcinoma head neck . II . Evaluate duration response , time disease progression , overall survival patient treatment . III . Evaluate effectiveness Ad5CMV-p53 reduce cancer morbidity ( pain assessment , analgesic consumption , Karnofsky performance status ) . IV . Assess quality life patient receive treatment . OUTLINE : This multicenter , open label study . All patient receive direct intratumoral injection Ad5CMV-p53 day 1 , 2 , 3 4-week treatment course . Patients treat least 2 course bar local disease progression unacceptable adverse event ; patient respond stable disease receive maximum 12 course . Patients evaluate safety 4 week completion last treatment . Quality life assess , , treatment . Patients follow every 2 month 18 month death . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A maximum 39 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
