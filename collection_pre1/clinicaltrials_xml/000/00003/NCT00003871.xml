	<brief_title>PSA Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate effect prime boost strategy use recombinant fowlpox prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) vaccine recombinant vaccinia PSA vaccine biochemical PSA progression patient stage D0 prostate cancer complete local treatment . II . Assess tolerability toxicity prime boost treatment regimens patient . III . Evaluate effect prime boost treatment regimens cellular immunity patient . OUTLINE : This randomize study . Patients stratify accord HLA-2 typing ( positive v negative v unknown ) . Patients randomize one three treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive intramuscular fowlpox prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) vaccine week 0 , 6 , 12 , 18 . Arm II : Patients receive intramuscular fowlpox PSA vaccine week 0 , 6 , 12 intradermal vaccinia PSA vaccine week 18 . Arm III : Patients receive intradermal vaccinia PSA vaccine week 0 intramuscular fowlpox PSA vaccine week 6 , 12 , 18 . Patients follow week 24 , every 3 month year 2 , every 6 month year 5 , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 60 patient ( 20 per treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
