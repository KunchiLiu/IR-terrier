	<brief_title>MG98 Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine maximum tolerate dose MG98 patient advance solid tumor . - Assess safety , toxicity , pharmacokinetics treatment regimen patient population . - Evaluate effectiveness treatment regimen patient . OUTLINE : This dose escalation , multicenter study . Patients receive MG98 IV 2 hour twice weekly 3 week . Courses repeat every 4 week . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . The dose MG98 escalate cohort 1-6 patient maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose limit toxicity . Patients follow week 4 , least every 3 month relapse disease . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 20 patient accrue study within 10-12 month .</detailed_description>
