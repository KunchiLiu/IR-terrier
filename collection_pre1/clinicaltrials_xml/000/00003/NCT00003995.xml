	<brief_summary>Phase II trial study effectiveness monoclonal antibody trastuzumab chemotherapy irinotecan treating patient stage IV colorectal cancer overexpresses HER2 . Monoclonal antibody locate tumor cell either kill deliver tumor-killing substance without harm normal cell . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining monoclonal antibody therapy chemotherapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective response rate irinotecan trastuzumab patient stage IV colorectal cancer p185 HER2 overexpression . II . Evaluate safety toxic effect treatment regimen patient . III . Determine overall survival time progression patient response treatment regimen . IV . Determine pharmacokinetics trastuzumab combination irinotecan antibody trastuzumab patient . V. Determine expression HER2/neu patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive load dose trastuzumab IV 90 minute week 1 , 30-90 minute weekly thereafter . Patients receive irinotecan IV 90 minute follow trastuzumab weekly 4 week . Courses repeat every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
