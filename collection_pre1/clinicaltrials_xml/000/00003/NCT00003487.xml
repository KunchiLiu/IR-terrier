	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Antineoplastons naturally occur substance may also make laboratory . Antineoplastons may inhibit growth cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well antineoplaston therapy work treat patient cancer esophagus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antineoplaston Therapy Treating Patients With Cancer Esophagus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Provide antineoplastons A10 AS2-1 treatment patient incurable adenocarcinoma esophagus . - Describe response , tolerance , side effect regimen patient . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive gradually escalate dos antineoplaston A10 antineoplaston AS2-1 intravenous injection 6 time daily maximum tolerate dose reach . Treatment continue least 2 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) continue treatment least 8 month beyond CR . Patients achieve partial response stable disease continue treatment disease progression . Tumors measure every 2 month 1 year every 3 month second year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 20-40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
