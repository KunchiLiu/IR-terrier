	<brief_summary>The variety cancerous disease blood bone marrow potentially cure bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) . Diseases like leukemia , lymphoma , multiple myeloma among condition treat BMT . Some patient disease treat medical chemotherapy alone . However , patient relapse follow chemotherapy usually curable additional chemotherapy treatment . The option know provide potential cure occur BMT . Allogenic transplant cell collect relative patient . The transplant require additional high intensity chemotherapy radiation order destroy cancerous cell . In process , many normal bone marrow cell also destroy . This reason transplant stem cell . The stem cell help build new function bone marrow , red cell , white cell , platelet . In addition , immune cell donor implanted recipient body help fight infection kill remain cancerous cell . Unfortunately , powerful dos chemotherapy radiation therapy associate allogenic BMT toxic side effect often make BMTs dangerous attempt many patient . In order reduce complication BMT , make safer available option patient cancer blood bone marrow , researcher develop new approach BMT . In study researcher plan use stem cell collect blood stream patient relatives rather bone marrow ( blood progenitor/stem cell transplant ) . In addition , researcher plan use low dos chemotherapy radiation therapy reduce side effect . The majority cancer kill effect responsibility stem cell transplant rather chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients malignant non-malignant hematologic disease include severe aplastic anemia ( SAA ) , paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ( PNH ) , myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , acute chronic leukemia , Hodgkin 's non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma multiple myeloma ( MM ) cure allogeneic bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) . This curative effect ascribe use high dose chemo-radiotherapy anti-tumor anti-bone marrow effect allograft . Dose intensification conditioning regimens attempt reduce disease recurrence largely unsuccessful increase toxicity mortality . Indeed , evidence point donor-derived T-cells principal modality lead complete eradication malignant non-malignant host hematopoietic cell . The assumption successful allogeneic BMT rely myeloablative effect intensive hazardous chemo-radiotherapy largely restrict therapeutic modality patient malignant life-threatening hematologic disorder age 55 year . Treatment-related mortality increase substantially age , prior intensive treatment chemo-radiotherapy , worsen performance status , co-morbid medical condition . An unacceptable risk death conventional BMT render many patient ineligible may otherwise curative therapy . Several vitro study demonstrate existence donor-derived CD4 CD8 positive lymphocyte specific reactivity patient leukemia . These cell provide potent graft-versus-leukemia ( GVL ) effect . This GVL effect best see patient CML relapse BMT , single infusion donor lymphocytes show induce complete remission . In addition potent anti-leukemia effect cell , strong evidence donor T-cells capable completely eradicate residual host hematopoietic cell non-myeloablative transplant setting ( graft-versus-marrow ) lead successful complete donor hematopoietic engraftment . Non-myeloablative allogenic peripheral blood stem cell transplant currently investigate phase I/II trial assess engraftment efficacy toxicity number transplant center . Preliminary data , include experience great 150 patient undergoing type procedure , show high rate complete donor engraftment low toxicity profile . Two recent study investigate non-myeloablative allo-transplantation standard risk patient reveal extremely low rate transplant-related complication mortality . The decreased risk transplant-related complication associate non-myeloablative transplant expand eligibility transplant candidate well open possibility evaluate non-myeloablative regimen patient high risk complication standard transplantation . Besides hematologic malignancy , allogeneic BMT show curative number debilitate hematologic disease may behave relatively indolent fashion , paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ( PNH ) refractory anemia ( RA ) refractory anemia ring sideroblast ( RARS ) . However , 30 % risk treatment-related mortality ( TRM ) standard myeloablative allotransplantation usually preclude patient potentially curative therapy , concern shorten life patient disorder . In protocol investigate non-myeloablative allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) transplantation two group subject standard allogeneic transplantation consider unacceptable toxicity . Group A : Subjects hematologic malignancy factor put high risk transplant related complication mortality , include prior intensive chemo-radiotherapy co-morbid disease . Group B : Subjects hematologic disease ( clonal non-clonal ) associate reasonable longevity currently consider allogeneic BMT prohibitive procedural mortality conventional BMT ( enrollment close October 2010 ) . In protocol , eligible subject treat allogeneic PBSC transplant HLA identical single HLA antigen-mismatched family donor , use intensive immunosuppressive regimen without myeloablation attempt decrease transplant related toxicity preserve anti-malignancy and/or anti-host marrow effect graft . The low intensity non-myeloablative conditioning regimen provide adequate immunosuppression allow stem cell lymphocyte engraftment . T-cell replete , donor-derived , granulocyte colony stimulate factor ( G-CSF ) -mobilized PBSCs use establish hematopoietic lymphoid reconstitution . We add back lymphocytes recipient less 100 % donor T-cell chimerism attempt prevent graft rejection enhance graft-versus-malignancy effect . The primary endpoint study transplant relate mortality ( 200 day survival ) . Other end point include engraftment , degree donor-host chimerism , incidence acute chronic graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) , transplant relate morbidity well disease-free overall survival .</detailed_description>
