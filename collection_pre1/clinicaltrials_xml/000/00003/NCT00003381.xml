	<brief_title>Quality Life Assessment Patients Receiving Treatment Esophageal Cancer Companion CALGB-9781</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate quality life patient esophageal cancer randomize protocol CALGB C9781 treatment surgery alone vs trimodal therapy combine preoperative chemotherapy radiation therapy addition surgery . II . Examine incremental cost cost effectiveness preoperative chemotherapy radiation therapy treatment esophageal cancer . III . Examine incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year ( QALY ) preoperative chemotherapy radiation therapy treatment esophageal cancer . OUTLINE : This companion study CALGB C9781 , phase III randomize study . Prior treatment CALGB C9781 , patient complete form assess quality life , psychological functioning , specific area dysfunction , resource use , time lose work ; subsequent assessment complete telephone interview 1 , 2 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month initiation study treatment , regardless disease status ( patient hear impairment speak translatable foreign language may mail response ) . Patients also keep diary medical resource utilization sit treat institution .</detailed_description>
