	<brief_title>Irofulven Treating Children With Recurrent Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose dose limit toxicity 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene ( MGI-114 ) pediatric patient recurrent refractory solid tumor . II . Determine incidence severity toxic effect MGI-114 . III . Determine safe tolerable dose MGI-114 use phase II study . IV . Determine pharmacokinetics MGI-114 patient . V. Determine preliminary evidence antitumor activity MGI-114 recurrent refractory pediatric solid tumor . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study . If dose limit toxicity myelosuppression stratum 1 , stratum 1 close stratum 2 open . Stratum 2 consist follow : patient receive 2 prior chemotherapy regimen ; patient receive prior central axis radiation bone marrow transplantation ; patient know bone marrow involvement . Patients receive intravenous 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene 10 minute daily 5 day . The course repeat every 28 day unless disease progression unacceptable toxic effect observe . Patients stable respond disease may receive 1 year therapy . If dose limit toxicity occur 2 6 patient give dose level , dose escalation cease next low dose declare maximum tolerated dose . Dose escalation occur patient within cohort observe 28 day day 1 therapy . Patients follow death .</detailed_description>
