	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define toxicity administration gp100 : 209-217 ( 210M ) ( gp100:209-217 [ 210M ] peptide vaccine ) human papillomavirus ( HPV ) 16 E7 ( 12-20 ) peptide ( HPV16E7:12-20 peptide vaccine ) , adjuvant Montanide ISA-51 ( incomplete Freund 's adjuvant ) , patient present primary melanoma &gt; 1 mm thick . II . To measure T-cell response modify self-gp100 : 209-217 ( 210M ) peptide unmodified parental glycoprotein 100 ( gp100 ) peptide . III . To measure T-cell response control human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) -A2.1 restrict cytotoxic T-lymphocyte ( CTL ) epitope papilloma virus HPV16E7:12-20 . IV . To determine whether analysis antigen-specific T-cells use specific HLA-A2/peptide tetramers effective method monitor immune response patient undergoing peptide vaccination compare enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot ( ELISPOT ) , limit dilution analysis ( LDA ) measurement intracellular cytokine production ( fastimmune ) . V. To determine whether difference induction primary peptide-specific T-cell immune response self gp100 peptide versus foreign E7 peptide . VI . To compare immune response induce vaccinate every 2 week 6 month ( total 13 vaccination ) vs. every 3 week 6 month ( total 9 vaccination ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive gp100:209-217 ( 210M ) peptide vaccine HPV16E7:12-20 peptide vaccine mixed incomplete Freund 's adjuvant subcutaneously ( SC ) every 2 week 6 month . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : Patients receive gp100:209-217 ( 210M ) peptide vaccine HPV16E7:12-20 peptide vaccine mixed incomplete Freund 's adjuvant SC every 3 week 6 month . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . In arm , patient undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy approximately 10 day second vaccination . Patients positive lymph node undergo complete lymph node dissection resume vaccination . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 3 year , yearly thereafter .</detailed_description>
