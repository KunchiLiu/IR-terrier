	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining one drug may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase I/II trial study effectiveness combination chemotherapy consist estramustine , paclitaxel , carboplatin treat patient advanced prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safe weekly dose intravenous estramustine ( EM ) combination paclitaxel ( TAX ) carboplatin ( CBDCA ) patient advanced prostate cancer . II . Determine safety efficacy combination androgen dependent v androgen independent disease patient . III . Evaluate pharmacokinetics weekly intravenous EM TAX combination CBDCA patient . OUTLINE : Phase I dose escalation study estramustine . Phase II two stage design study , patient stratify accord androgen dependence ( androgen dependent disease v androgen independent disease ) . In phase I , patient receive estramustine IV 1 hour via permanent venous access device day 1 week 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , follow paclitaxel ( TAX ) IV 1 hour . Carboplatin IV administer 30 minute completion TAX week 1 . Courses repeat every 4 week disease progression excessive toxicity 24 week . Patients locally advance androgen dependent prostate cancer may consider radical prostatectomy radiotherapy 4 course . Androgen dependent patient already primary hormone therapy GnRH analog receive goserelin leuprolide injection skin every 3 month study , begin first second week therapy . Three patient enter dose level must complete one course therapy . If patient experience dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) , 3 patient treat next high dose level . If 1 patient experience DLT , 3 patient treat dose level . If 2 6 patient experience DLT , dose declare maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . In phase II , two stage design apply patient population . Fourteen patient enrol first stage . If response observe , trial stop . If least 1 response observe , 11 additional patient enrol onto study . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 6-18 patient accrued phase I ; phase II accrue 50 patient within 3 year .</detailed_description>
