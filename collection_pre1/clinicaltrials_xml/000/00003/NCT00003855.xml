	<brief_title>Lymph Node Removal Treating Women Who Have Stage I Stage IIA Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary objective : Long term : To assess whether overall survival patient randomize Arm 2 ( immediate ALND ) essentially equivalent ( well ) patient assign Arm 1 ( completion ALND ) . Short term : To quantify compare surgical morbidity associate SLND plus ALND versus SLND alone . OUTLINE : This randomize study . After segmental mastectomy sentinel lymph node dissection , patient stratify accord age ( 50 vs 50 ) , estrogen receptor status ( positive v negative ) , tumor size ( great 1 cm v great 1 cm great 2 cm v great 2 cm ) . Patients randomize one two treatment arm .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>PLEASE NOTE : Patients register study may undergo intraoperative postÂ¬operative randomization . 1 . Patient must female . 2 . Patient must least 18 year age . 3 . Patient 's clinical stage must document tumor size le 5 cm , palpable node evidence metastatic disease ( T1 T2 N0 M0 ; see appendix stag criterion ) tumor document amenable lumpectomy . 4 . Patient must tissue diagnosis invasive breast carcinoma . Note : A patient register study cytologic diagnosis suggestive carcinoma fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) palpable nonpalpable breast lesion investigator believe breast lesion clinically suspicious invasive breast carcinoma . 5 . Date patient 's first tissue diagnosis invasive breast carcinoma cytologic diagnosis carcinoma must 60 day prior SLND . 6 . The patient BCT ( segmental mastectomy ) perform previously , refer local investigator SLND , eligible BCT le equal 60 day prior SLND . NOTE : Copies operative pathology report must submit part registration process . 7 . Patient must ECOG/Zubrod status =2 , document patient 's medical record . 8 . Patient must available followup . 9 . Patient childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 14 day begin study intervention . 10 . Patient must access radiation therapy . 11 . A sentinel lymph node must identify contains metastatic breast cancer document frozen section , touch prep , H &amp; E stain permanent section . NOTE : Patients metastatic breast cancer identify immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) eligible . 12 . Patient randomize ALND must undergo ALND within 42 day SLND . 13 . A patient history previous malignancy eligible study long patient meet follow criterion cancer survivor . A cancer survivor eligible provide follow criterion meet : 1 . The patient undergone potentially curative therapy prior malignancy , 2 . There evidence prior malignancy least five year evidence recurrence ( except effectively treat basal cell squamous carcinoma skin , carcinoma situ cervix effectively treat surgery alone , lobular carcinoma insitu ipsilateral contralateral breast treat surgery alone ) , 3 . The patient deem treat physician low risk recurrence prior malignancy . 14 . Patient patient 's legally acceptable representative must provide sign dated write informed consent prior registration studyrelated procedure . 15 . Patient must provide write authorization allow use disclosure protect health information . NOTE : This may obtain either studyspecific informed consent separate authorization form must obtain patient prior study registration . 1 . Patient lactating ( breastfeed ) . 2 . Patient previously treat chemotherapy , estrogen receptor antagonist ( i.e. , Tamoxifen ) selective estrogen receptor modulators ( SERMs , i.e. , Raloxifene ) invasive breast cancer . 3 . Patient previously place prepectoral breast implant . NOTE : A subpectoral implant allow . 4 . Patient concurrent invasive bilateral breast malignancy . 5 . Patient clinically radiologically identify multicentric disease amenable single lumpectomy . 6 . Patient previous ipsilateral axillary surgery excisional biopsy lymph node ( ) , treatment hidradenitis . 7 . Patient medical contraindication ALND consider poor surgical risk due nonmalignant systemic disease ( cardiovascular , renal , etc . ) would preclude treatment option . 8 . Patient note matted node gross extranodal disease time SLND . 9 . Patient three positive sentinel node frozen section , touch prep , H &amp; E stain permanent section .</criteria>
