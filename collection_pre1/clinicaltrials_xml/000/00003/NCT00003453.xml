	<brief_title>Antineoplaston Therapy Treating Patients With Stage IV Adrenal Gland Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety possible effectiveness antineoplastons A10 AS2-1 patient stage IV adrenal gland carcinoma . - Determine tolerance side effect regimen patient . - Determine response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : Patients receive gradually escalate dos antineoplaston A10 antineoplaston AS2-1 IV minimum 1 hour 6 time daily maximum tolerate dose reach . Treatment continue least 3 month absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) continue treatment additional 8 month reach CR . Patients follow every 2 month first year every 3 month second year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
