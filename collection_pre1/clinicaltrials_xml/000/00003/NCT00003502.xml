	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Antineoplastons naturally-occurring substance may also make laboratory . Antineoplastons may inhibit growth cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well antineoplaston therapy work treat patient stage II , stage III , stage IV mantle cell lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antineoplaston Therapy Treating Patients With Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety possible effectiveness antineoplastons A10 AS2-1 patient serious immediately life-threatening stage II , III , IV mantle cell lymphoma . - Evaluate response , tolerance , side effect regimen patient . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive gradually escalate dos antineoplaston A10 antineoplaston AS2-1 intravenously 6 time daily maximum tolerate dose reach . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Tumors measure every 8 week 6 month , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month third fourth year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
