	<brief_title>Antineoplaston Therapy Treating Children With Recurrent Refractory High-Grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine antitumor activity antineoplastons A10 AS2-1 child high-grade glioma determine proportion patient experience objective tumor response . - Evaluate adverse effect tolerance regimen patient . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive gradually escalate dos intravenous antineoplaston A10 antineoplaston AS2-1 6 time per day maximum tolerate dose reach . Treatment continue least 12 month absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . After 12 month , patient respond stable disease may continue treatment . Tumors measure every 8 week 2 year , every 3 month third fourth year , every 6 month fifth sixth year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
