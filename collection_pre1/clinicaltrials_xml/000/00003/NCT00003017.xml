	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response rate , duration response , survival woman advance , recurrent , inoperable cervical cancer treat interleukin-12 . II . Determine toxic effect systemic interleukin-12 patient . III . Correlate response therapy survival presence absence human papilloma virus ( HPV ) , specific subtype HPV , patient . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord prior chemotherapy ( yes v ) . Patients receive induction interleukin-12 IV 5-20 second day -13 daily day 1-5 . Treatment continue every 21 day absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 78 patient ( 39 per stratum ) accrue study within 26 month .</detailed_description>
