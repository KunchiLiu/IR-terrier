	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Testosterone stimulate growth prostate cancer cell . Hormone therapy use leuprolide flutamide may fight prostate cancer reduce production testosterone . It yet know whether receive leuprolide flutamide effective receive therapy . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial determine effectiveness hormone therapy treat patient stage I stage II prostate cancer high risk recurrence already undergone surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine effect one year adjuvant hormonal ablation disease-free survival 5 year node-negative radical prostatectomy patient high risk progression . - Determine effect treatment incidence androgen independent prostate cancer disease specific overall survival . - Determine impact one year total androgen ablation quality life serum testosterone level . - Assess difference quality life wife patient androgen ablation condition compare wive patient control condition . - Obtain blood sample patient high risk failure post-prostatectomy evaluate serum marker prognosis . OUTLINE : This randomize study . Patients randomize one two treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive leuprolide intramuscularly every 3 month oral flutamide three time daily 1 year . - Arm II : Patients receive initial treatment . Quality life assess every 6 month 5 year . Quality life wives/partners patient assess every 6 month two year . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 4 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 496 patient ( 248 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 3.5 year .</detailed_description>
