	<brief_title>Methotrexate With Without Cyclophosphamide Treating Patients With Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>LGL leukemia characterize clonal expansion cytotoxic T cell . Prominent clinical feature include neutropenia , anemia , rheumatoid arthritis . The terminal effector memory phenotype ( CD3+/CD8+/CD57+/CD45RA+/CD62L- ) leukemic LGL suggest pivotal chronic antigen drive immune response . LGL survival promote PDGF IL-15 , result global dysregulation apoptosis resistance normal pathway activation-induced death . These pathogenic feature explain treatment LGL leukemia base immunosuppression therapy . However , standard therapy establish due absence large prospective trial . Oral low dose MTX show efficacious treatment neutropenia . However , response MTX slow , require several month neutrophil count increase 500/mm3 . Also , complete clinical remission may achieve one year MTX therapy . Oral Cy primary drug use treatment severe transfusion-dependent anemia . Beneficial clinical effect see despite treatment apparent effect abnormal LGL clone . Normal hematocrit maintain cessation Cy result contrast effect see MTX , clinical remission often associate disappearance clone . This phase II trial undertaken Eastern Cooperative Group ( ECOG ) initiate investigate mechanism treatment response patient LGL leukemia , need treatment anemia neutropenia .</detailed_description>
