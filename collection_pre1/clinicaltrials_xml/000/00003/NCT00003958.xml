	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial compare two different combination chemotherapy regimens see well work treat patient previously untreated rhabdomyosarcoma sarcoma . Drugs use chemotherapy , dactinomycin , cyclophosphamide , vincristine , topotecan , use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . It yet know combination chemotherapy regimen effective treat rhabdomyosarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Rhabdomyosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare early response rate , failure-free survival , survival patient intermediate-risk rhabdomyosarcoma treat surgery , radiotherapy , vincristine , dactinomycin , cyclophosphamide ( VAC ) v VAC alternate vincristine , topotecan , cyclophosphamide . II . Compare acute late effect two treatment regimen patient . III . Determine rate second-look surgery select patient bulk residual tumor diagnosis ( i.e. , Clinical Group III ) proportion render patient tumor free microscopic tumor . IV . Determine rate local failure select patient bulk residual tumor diagnosis ( i.e. , Clinical Group III ) , second-look resection , response-adjusted radiotherapy dose reduction . V. Determine preoperative radiotherapy follow second-look surgery feasible select patient bulk residual disease ( i.e. , Clinical Group III ) respond poorly induction chemotherapy . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord disease ( embryonal histology , stage II III , Clinical Group III vs embryonal histology , Clinical Group IV , less 10 year age vs alveolar undifferentiated sarcoma histology , stage I , Clinical Group I vs alveolar undifferentiated sarcoma histology , stage II III , Clinical Group II III ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive vincristine IV 5-10 minute week week 0-12 , 15 , 18-24 , 27 , 30-36 , 39 . Dactinomycin IV administer 15-20 minute week week 0 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 21 , 24 , 27 , 30 , 33 , 36 , 39 . Cyclophosphamide IV administer 30-60 minute week week 0 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 21 , 24 , 27 , 30 , 33 , 36 , 39 . After initial 12 week chemotherapy , depend tumor shrinkage , patient may undergo surgery . After recovery surgery , patient receive radiotherapy day , 5 day week , week 12-18 . For patient receive radiotherapy week 0-6 , dactinomycin omit week 3 6 administered week 15 18 . For patient receive radiotherapy week 12-18 , dactinomycin omit week 15 18 . Patients show adequate response week 24 continue chemotherapy week 24-39 . Patients Clinical Group III tumor parameningeal site document evidence intracranial extension receive radiotherapy within first 2 week initiation first course chemotherapy ( day 0 ) . Patients Clinical Group II parameningeal tumor Clinical Group III parameningeal tumor base skull erosion and/or cranial nerve palsy without evidence intracranial extension receive radiotherapy week 12 ( day 84 ) immediately thereafter . Patients Clinical Group IV parameningeal tumor distant metastasis receive radiotherapy primary site week 12 ( day 84 ) . Patients distant metastasis confine one site may receive radiotherapy metastatic site concurrently therapy primary site begin within 2 week initiation chemotherapy ( day 0 ) . Arm II : Patients receive treatment arm I , except dactinomycin replace topotecan IV 15-30 minute daily 5 day week 3 , 9 , 21 , 27 , 33 , 39 . All patient receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) subcutaneously begin 24 hour completion course chemotherapy continue 1 year , hematopoietic recovery . Patients follow every 1-2 month 1 year , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
