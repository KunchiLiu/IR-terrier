	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Treating Women With Previously Treated Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate proportion woman previously treat metastatic breast cancer progression free 4 month receive ISIS 5132 ISIS 3521 . II . Determine duration response treatment regimens patient population . III . Evaluate toxicity tolerability treatment regimens patient population . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord number prior therapy metastatic breast cancer ( 1 vs 2 ) . Patients randomize one two treatment arm . ( Arm I close 12/22/99 ) Arm I : Patients receive ISIS 5132 IV continuously 21 day . ( close 12/22/99 ) Arm II : Patients receive ISIS 3521 IV continuously 21 day . Treatment repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After every 2 course , patient evaluate response . Patients follow every 3 month first 2 year , every 6 month next 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A maximum 68 patient ( 34 per arm ) accrue study ( Arm I close 12/22/99 ) .</detailed_description>
