	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Current therapy child visual pathway glioma , amenable respond standard therapy , provide limited benefit patient . The anti-cancer property Antineoplaston therapy suggest may prove beneficial treatment child visual pathway glioma , amenable respond standard therapy . PURPOSE : This study perform determine effect ( good bad ) Antineoplaston therapy child visual pathway glioma , amenable respond standard therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antineoplaston Therapy Treating Children With Visual Pathway Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine efficacy Antineoplaston therapy child visual pathway glioma , amenable respond standard therapy , measure objective response therapy ( complete response , partial response stable disease ) . - To determine safety tolerance Antineoplaston therapy child visual pathway glioma , amenable respond standard therapy . OVERVIEW : This single arm , open-label study child visual pathway glioma , amenable respond standard therapy , receive gradually escalate dos intravenous Antineoplaston therapy ( Atengenal + Astugenal ) maximum tolerate dose reach . Treatment continue least 12 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After 12 month , patient complete partial response stable disease may continue treatment . To determine objective response , tumor size measure utilizing MRI scan , perform every 8 week first two year , every 3 month third fourth year , every 6 month 5th sixth year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 20-40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
