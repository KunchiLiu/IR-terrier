	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine toxicity associate repeated vaccination recombinant vaccinia DF3/MUC1 vaccine ( rV-DF3/MUC1 ) patient metastatic breast cancer . II . Determine maximum tolerate dose rV-DF3/MUC1 , base cellular humoral immunity , patient . III . Determine whether vaccination rV-DF3/MUC1 associate antitumor activity patient . OUTLINE : This open label , dose escalation study . Patients receive recombinant vaccinia DF3/MUC1 vaccine ( rV-DF3/MUC1 ) intradermally . Treatment repeat every month 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts least 6 patient receive escalate dos rV-DF3/MUC1 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) high dose level test reach . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose limit toxicity . Patients follow monthly 6 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 16-28 patient accrue study within 1-2 year .</detailed_description>
