	<brief_title>Gene Therapy Treating Patients With Advanced Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety toxicity adenovirus p53 ( Ad-p53 ) gene therapy patient locally advance metastatic bladder cancer . II . Measure infection Ad-p53 confirm expression p53 infection . III . Characterize clinical response measurable tumor patient . IV . Determine duration effect treatment patient . V. Define time course elimination vector urinary bladder . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study . Group 1 patient receive adenovirus p53 ( Ad-p53 ) intravesically day 1 4 . Treatment continue every 4 week maximum 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3 patient group 1 receive escalating dose Ad-p53 . In absence grade 3 bad toxicity first 3 patient treat , subsequent cohort 3 patient receive escalate dos Ad-p53 schedule . If 1 3 patient experience grade 3 toxicity , additional 3 patient treat dose level dose escalation continue . If 1 3 patient experience grade 4 toxicity 2 3 patient experience grade 3 toxicity , dose escalation cease MTD define previous dose level . Group 2 patient receive Ad-p53 MTD day 1-4 , group 3 patient receive Ad-p53 MTD day 1-4 8-11 . Patients follow day 28 , every 3 month 1 year disease progression . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A maximum 24 patient accrue study ( 3-12 patient group 1 ; 3-6 patient group 2 ; 6 patient group 3 ) .</detailed_description>
