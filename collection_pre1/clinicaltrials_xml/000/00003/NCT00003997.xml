	<brief_title>6-Hydroxymethylacylfulvene Treating Patients With Refractory Myelodysplastic Syndrome , Acute Myeloid Leukemia , Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia , Blastic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene patient refractory myelodysplastic syndrome , acute myeloid leukemia , acute lymphocytic leukemia , blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia . II . Determine qualitative quantitative toxicity treatment patient . III . Determine duration reversibility qualitative quantitative toxicity treatment patient . IV . Evaluate , preliminary manner , antileukemic activity treatment patient . V. Assess relative mRNA level select NER gene ( ERCC1 , ERCC2 , ERCC3 ) tumor tissue patient treat regimen correlate clinical outcome . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study . Patients receive 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene ( HMAF ) IV 5 minute day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 3-4 week least 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3 patient receive escalate dos HMAF . The maximum tolerate dose define dose dose limit toxicity occur least 40 % patient . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
