	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Antineoplastons naturally occur substance may also make laboratory . Antineoplastons may inhibit growth cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study effectiveness antineoplaston therapy treat patient metastatic unresectable colon cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antineoplaston Therapy Treating Patients With Metastatic Unresectable Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine antitumor activity antineoplastons A10 AS2-1 patient adenocarcinoma colon determine proportion patient experience objective tumor response . - Evaluate response , tolerance , side effect regimen patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive gradually escalate dos antineoplaston A10 antineoplaston AS2-1 intravenous injection 6 time daily maximum tolerate dose reach . Treatment continue least 12 month absence disease progression . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) continue treatment least 8 month reach CR . Tumors measure least every 2 month 1 year every 3 month 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
