PURPOSE : Randomized phase II trial study effectiveness vaccine therapy interleukin-2 treating patient metastatic melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy With High-Dose Interleukin-2 Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Define antitumor activity gp100:209-217 ( 210M ) , melanoma peptide derive gp100 mixed Montanide ISA-51 , combination high-dose interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) administer various schedule patient advance melanoma . - Examine effect addition gp100:209-217 ( 210M ) peptide vaccine high-dose IL-2 toxicity treatment patient . - Define induction T-cell responses gp100:209-217 ( 210M ) peptide gp100 ( parent ) protein ELISA interferon gamma production CTL precursor frequency patient initial course treatment . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior therapy ( adjuvant interferon v chemotherapy advance disease v v none ) , ECOG performance status ( 0 vs 1 ) , number organ site involve ( 1 vs 1 ) . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . ( Arm III close accrual 11/30/1998 . ) - Arm I : Patients receive vaccination comprise gp100:209-217 ( 210M ) peptide mixed Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously day 1 , 22 , 43 , 64 . Patients also receive high-dose interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) IV 15 minute every 8 hour day 2-6 16-20 . - Arm II : Patients receive vaccination arm I day 1 , 22 , 43 , 64 . Patients also receive high-dose IL-2 arm I day 44-48 60-64 . Patients demonstrate rapid visible disease progression initial 4 week therapy maintain good performance status may begin high-dose IL-2 day 23 . - Arm III ( close accrual 11/30/1998 ) : Patients receive vaccination arm I day 1 high-dose IL-2 arm I day 2 . Patients nonhematologic toxicity may receive vaccination week 4 , 7 , 10 . Other patient may also receive IL-2 begin day 2 treatment week ( 4 , 7 , 10 ) 14 dos . Patients arm may receive total 3 course treatment . Patients follow death . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 90 patient ( 25 patient arm I II 40 patient arm III [ arm III close accrual 11/30/1998 ] ) accrue study within 12-18 month .</detailed_description>
