	<brief_title>Octreotide With Without Prednisone Treating Patients With Metastatic Recurrent Thymoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective response rate patient metastatic recurrent thymoma treat octreotide . II . Determine duration remission patient . III . Determine toxicity octreotide regimen population . IV . Determine response rate , duration remission , survival toxicity prednisone add octreotide patient stable disease follow octreotide alone . OUTLINE : All patient receive octreotide subcutaneously three time daily 1 month . After two course treatment , patient assess response . Patients experience partial complete response continue octreotide maximum 1 year ( 12 course ) absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Patients stable disease 2 course octreotide receive daily oral prednisone addition octreotide additional 2 course . These patient reevaluate continue octreotide plus prednisone maximum 1 year absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month second year , every 6 month next 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : There 38 patient accrue study approximately 2 year .</detailed_description>
