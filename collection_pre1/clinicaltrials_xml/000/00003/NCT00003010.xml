	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Marimastat may stop growth breast cancer stop blood flow tumor . It know whether chemotherapy effective without marimastat breast cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized double-blinded phase III trial compare effectiveness marimastat therapy treat woman metastatic breast cancer respond stable chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Marimastat No Further Therapy Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer That Is Responding Stable Following Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine whether marimastat prolongs progression-free survival woman metastatic breast cancer respond stable disease receive standard systemic chemotherapy . II . Determine toxic effect marimastat compare placebo patient metastatic breast cancer respond stable disease receive standard systemic chemotherapy . III . Determine whether association trough marimastat concentration time disease progression toxicity . OUTLINE : This randomize , double blind , placebo control study . Patients stratify number involve disease site study entry , prior chemotherapy metastasis , osseous disease study entry , bisphosphonate therapy study entry , concurrent hormonal therapy ( yes v ) . Patients randomize two group . Patients take either marimastat placebo , one capsule orally twice day , approximately every 12 hour ( i.e. , breakfast dinner ) . The drug placebo give development progressive disease prohibitive toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 334 patient accrue study 2 year .</detailed_description>
