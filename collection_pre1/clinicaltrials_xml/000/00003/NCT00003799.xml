	<brief_summary>Phase I trial study effectiveness radiation therapy plus chemotherapy follow surgery additional chemotherapy treat patient advanced nonmetastatic primary cancer rectum . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Combining chemotherapy , radiation therapy , surgery may effective treatment rectal cancer</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) oxaliplatin combine preoperatively concurrent radiation therapy ( XRT ) fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) PVI . II . To evaluate resection rate T4 rectal cancer , pathologic CR rate T3 T4 rectal cancer , expect versus actual type resection ( APR vs. LAR vs. LAR/coloanal anastomosis ) . III . To make preliminary observation patient survival pattern recurrence treatment combination . IV . To evaluate anastomotic sphincter function follow pre-op combined modality therapy . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study preoperative oxaliplatin . Patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously concurrent radiotherapy 5.5 week . Patients also receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 week 1 , 3 , 5 . Cohorts 5 patient receive escalate dos oxaliplatin maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede least 2 5 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Additional patient treat MTD . Patients undergo surgery 6-8 week complete preoperative chemotherapy radiotherapy . The surgical procedure determine extent tumor preoperative therapy . The type operative procedure may abdominoperineal resection , low anterior resection ( LAR ) , LAR/coloanal anastomosis . Postoperative chemotherapy begin within 6 week surgery , comprise leucovorin calcium fluorouracil IV day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course . Patients follow every 3 month 2.5 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually 5 year .</detailed_description>
