	<brief_title>Antineoplaston Therapy Treating Patients With Stage IV Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety possible effectiveness antineoplastons A10 AS2-1 patient incurable adenocarcinoma lung . - Describe response , tolerance , side effect regimen patient . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive gradually escalate dos antineoplaston A10 antineoplaston AS2-1 intravenous injection 6 time daily maximum tolerate dose reach . Treatment continue least 2 month absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Tumors measure every 2 month 1 year every 3 month 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 20-40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
