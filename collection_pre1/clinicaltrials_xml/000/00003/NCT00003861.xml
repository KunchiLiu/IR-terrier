	<brief_summary>This research trial study molecular genetic feature blood tissue sample patient newly diagnose acute lymphoblastic leukemia acute promyelocytic leukemia . Studying sample blood tissue patient acute lymphoblastic leukemia acute promyelocytic leukemia laboratory may help doctor identify learn biomarkers related cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diagnostic Study Patients With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : 1 . To perform quantitative PCR use know leukemia specific marker diagnostic bone marrow specimens patient newly diagnose APL ALL correlative pre-treatment copy number biologic molecular feature , clinical response , treatment outcome . 2 . To evaluate expression novel gene microRNAs implicate disease pathogenesis treatment response pretreatment blood bone marrow specimens patient APL ALL correlate expression level biological feature treatment outcome . 3 . To evaluate clinical significance sequential quantitative MRD measurement use real-time quantitative PCR and/or flow cytometry follow treatment ALL APL correlate finding efficacy novel treatment approach biological clinical prognostic feature . 4 . To compare measurement MRD blood bone marrow specimens sequential remission specimens patient receive treatment ALL APL treatment trial .</detailed_description>
