	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Surgical removal lymph node chest may kill cancer cell spread tumor lung . It yet know whether complete removal lymph node chest effective removal select lymph node treat patient stage I stage II non-small cell lung cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness complete removal lymph node chest select removal lymph node lung cancer surgery treat patient stage I stage II non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare whether complete mediastinal lymph node dissection versus mediastinal lymph node sample improves overall survival patient N0 non-hilar N1 non-small cell lung cancer undergo resection . - Compare two method reference identification occult mediastinal lymph node involvement . - Compare effect two method operative time duration postoperative complication , include chest tube drainage length hospitalization patient . - Compare effect two method local recurrence free survival local regional recurrence free survival patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A patient eligible inclusion study ALL follow criterion apply : Preoperative : 1 . Patient must ≥18 year age . 2 . Patient must ECOG/Zubrod performance status ≤ 3 . 3 . Patient must tissue diagnosis clinically resectable T1 T2 , N0 nonhilar N1 , M0 NSCLC ( squamous cell carcinoma , large cell carcinoma adenocarcinoma include bronchoalveolar carcinoma ) establish prior randomization . NOTE : A patient without preoperative tissue diagnosis , clinically suspect NSCLC fit criterion eligible provide tissue diagnosis confirm intraoperatively . 4 . Patient must preoperative imaging procedure , CT scan chest upper abdomen include liver adrenal gland determine eligibility , within 60 day date pulmonary resection . 5 . Patient mediastinoscopy mediastinal adenopathy CT chest define lymph node &gt; 1 cm shortest axis . 6 . Patient candidate complete resection carcinoma via pneumonectomy , lobectomy , bilobectomy , anatomic segmentectomy without sleeve resection , note surgical plan . 7 . Patient , patient 's legally acceptable representative , must provide sign dated Z0030specific write informed consent prior registration studyrelated procedure . 8 . If patient survivor prior cancer , follow criterion meet : 1 . Patient undergone potentially curative therapy prior malignancy , 2 . No evidence prior malignancy least 5 year evidence recurrence ( except effectively treat basal cell squamous carcinoma skin , carcinoma insitu cervix effectively treat surgery alone , lobular carcinoma insitu ipsilateral contralateral breast treat surgery alone ) , 3 . Patient deem treat physician low risk recurrence prior malignancy . Intraoperative : 1 . Patient rightsided lesion must least nodal station # 2R , 4R , 7 10 R examine . If node find , must sample proven negative frozen section . 2 . Patient leftsided lesion must least nodal station # 5 , 6 , 7 10L examine . If node find , must sample proven negative frozen section . 3 . Any suspicious mediastinal hilar node must sample proven negative frozen section . Levels 2 , 4 7 need resampled sample mediastinoscopy do within 60 day thehoracotomy . A patient NOT eligible inclusion study ANY follow criterion apply : 1 . Patient N2 disease determine preoperative mediastinoscopy sample . 2 . Patient T3 T4 tumor . 3 . Patient wedge resection perform treatment . 4 . Patient receive prior chemotherapy radiotherapy cancer .</criteria>
