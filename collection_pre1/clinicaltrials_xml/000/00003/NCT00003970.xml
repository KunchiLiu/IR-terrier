	<brief_summary>Phase I trial study genetic test effectiveness irinotecan treat patient solid tumor lymphoma . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop cancer cell divide stop grow die . Genetic test specific enzyme may help doctor determine whether side effect response chemotherapy relate person 's genetic makeup</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Testing Plus Irinotecan Treating Patients With Solid Tumors Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I. Classify patient solid tumor lymphoma accord UGT1A1 promoter ( TATA box ) cod region ( Gly71Arg ) mutation , CYP3A4 promoter ( G A ) polymorphism . II . Identify UGT1A1 enzyme glucuronidator irinotecan oxidizer phenotype patient determine correlation two metabolic reaction vivo . III . Determine relationship UGT1A1 genotype ( promoter and/or cod region mutation ) CYP3A4 promoter genotype v gastrointestinal bone marrow toxicity , pharmacokinetics irinotecan patient . IV . Determine pharmacokinetics irinotecan patient . OUTLINE : Patients genotyped UGT1A1 enzyme classify `` Gilbert 's '' ( 7/7 ) , `` heterozygote '' ( 6/7 ) , `` homozygotes allele 6 '' ( 6/6 ) . The DNA analyze UGT1A1 cod region mutation ( Gly71Arg ) CYP3A4 promoter polymorphism . Patients also examine glucuronidator ratio SN-38 , active metabolite irinotecan , classified `` low/slow '' ( low zero SN-38G/SN-38 ratio ) , `` intermediate '' ( less 50 % normal ratio ) , `` normal '' . Patients receive irinotecan IV 90 minute every 3 week . Treatment continue least 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
