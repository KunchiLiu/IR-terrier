	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Vaccines may make body build immune response kill tumor cell . It yet know whether THERATOPE vaccine therapy effective standard vaccine therapy treat metastatic breast cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized double blinded phase III trial compare effectiveness THERATOPE vaccine therapy standard vaccine therapy treat woman metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare time disease progression patient receive THERATOPE vaccine woman receive control vaccine . II . Compare survival patient receive THERATOPE vaccine patient receive control vaccine . III . Document product safety profile patient . IV . Measure anti-STn , anti-OSM , anti-KLH antibody titer . V. Evaluate impact THERATOPE STn-KLH vaccine health-related quality life patient . OUTLINE : The study design prospective , double-blinded , randomize study . Patients complete first-line chemotherapy metastatic breast cancer either nonprogressive disease evidence disease follow completion first-line chemotherapy ( include bone marrow transplant stem cell rescue ) randomize either THERATOPE vaccine control vaccine . Patients stratify entry accord disease status ( i.e. , either evidence disease nonprogressive disease ) whether receive hormonal therapy metastatic disease study . Arm I : Patients receive intravenous cyclophosphamide day -3 , follow 4 subcutaneous vaccination THERATOPE STn-KLH vaccine combine Detox-B Stable Emulsion 0 , 2 , 5 , 9 week . Arm II : Patients receive control treatment intravenous cyclophosphamide day -3 , follow 4 subcutaneous vaccination keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( KLH ) vaccine combine Detox-B Stable Emulsion 0 , 2 , 5 , 9 week . Patients stable respond disease may receive THERATOPE STn-KLH vaccine control without Detox-B Stable Emulsion week 13 , 17 , 21 , 25 . Patients without unacceptable toxic effect disease progression may continue maintenance therapy 3 month interval . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Over 120 site North America , Europe , Australia/New Zealand participate study . A total 950 woman ( 475 per treatment arm ) enrol study .</detailed_description>
