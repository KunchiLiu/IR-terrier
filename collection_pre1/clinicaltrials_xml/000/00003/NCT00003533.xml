	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Provide treatment antineoplastons A10 AS2-1 patient incurable , metastatic , hormone-refractory adenocarcinoma prostate . - Describe response , tolerance , side effect regimen patient . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive gradually escalate dos antineoplaston A10 IV antineoplaston AS2-1 IV 6 time daily maximum tolerate dose reach . Treatment continue least 2 month absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Patients partial response stable disease may continue treatment . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) continue treatment additional 8 month reach CR . Tumors measure every 2 month 1 year every 3 month 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
