	<brief_summary>Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness two regimen combination chemotherapy follow rituximab observation treat patient stage III stage IV low-grade non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop cancer cell divide stop grow die . Combining one drug may kill cancer cell . Monoclonal antibody rituximab locate cancer cell either kill deliver cancer-killing substance without harm normal cell . It yet know regimen combination chemotherapy , without rituximab , effective non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy With Without Monoclonal Antibody Therapy Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Low-Grade Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare response rate , time progression , time treatment failure , survival patient low grade lymphoma treat cyclophosphamide - fludarabine regimen control arm consist standard treatment CVP . II . To determine effect maintenance anti-CD20 ( IDEC C2B8 ) time progression , time treatment failure , survival effect lymphocyte number , subset , quantitative immunoglobulin level time . OUTLINE : This two step , stratify , randomize study . Patients stratify arm I II ( step 1 ) age ( 60 vs 60 ) , tumor burden ( high vs low ) , histology ( follicular v ) , B symptom ( present v absent ) . After arm I II complete , patient stratify arm III IV ( step 2 ) extent residual disease ( minimal v gross ) , histology ( follicular v ) , initial tumor burden . ARM I ( CLOSED AS OF 9/2000 ) : Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV 30-45 minute day 1 fludarabine IV 10-20 minute day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression minimum 4 course maximum 6 course . ARM II : Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV 30-45 minute vincristine IV day 1 , oral prednisone day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression minimum 6 course maximum 8 course . After completion therapy arm I II , patient randomize step 2 study comprise arm III IV . ARM III : Patients receive maintenance therapy rituximab ( IDEC-C2B8 monoclonal antibody ) IV weekly 4 week . Courses repeat every 6 month 2 year . Maintenance therapy begin 4 week last chemotherapy . ARM IV : Patients undergo maintenance therapy observe . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month next 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
