	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Antineoplastons naturally-occurring substance may also make laboratory . Antineoplastons may inhibit growth cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well antineoplaston therapy work treat patient recurrent refractory oligodendroglioma previous chemotherapy , radiation therapy , and/or biological therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antineoplaston Therapy Treating Patients With Recurrent Refractory Oligodendroglioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety possible effectiveness antineoplastons A10 AS2-1 patient recurrent refractory oligodendroglioma . - Describe response , tolerance , side effect regimen patient . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive gradually escalate dos antineoplaston A10 antineoplaston AS2-1 intravenous injection 6 time daily maximum tolerate dose reach . Treatment continue least 3 month absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) continue treatment additional 8 month reach CR . Tumors measure every 2 month 1 year , every 3 month second year , every 3-4 month third fourth year , every 4-6 month fifth year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
