	<brief_title>Interleukin-12 Treating Patients With Previously Treated Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma Hodgkin 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response rate interleukin-12 previously treat patient non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma Hodgkin 's disease . II . To determine vivo regulatory effect interleukin-12 Fas lingand ( FasL ) expression patient ' peripheral blood lymphocyte . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord disease characteristic : low grade non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( follicular small cleave , follicular mixed , small lymphocytic , variant ) versus intermediate grade non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( follicular large , diffuse large , diffuse mixed , immunoblastic , peripheral T-cell , mantle cell ) versus Hodgkin 's disease . Patients receive interleukin-12 subcutaneously twice week . Treatment repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 36-105 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
