	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Antineoplastons naturally occur substance may also make laboratory . Antineoplastons may inhibit growth cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well antineoplaston therapy work treat patient colon cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antineoplaston Therapy Treating Patients With Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine antitumor activity antineoplastons A10 AS2-1 patient adenocarcinoma colon determine proportion patient experience objective tumor response . - Evaluate adverse effect tolerance regimen patient . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive gradually escalate dos oral antineoplaston A10 oral antineoplaston AS2-1 6-7 time day . If patient achieve partial complete response 3-4 month treatment , investigator may discontinue treatment . Patients stable disease may continue receive treatment disease progression unacceptable toxicity observe . Tumors measure every 4 month first 2 year , every 6 month year 3 4 , yearly year 5 6 . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
