	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Giving drug thin space line spinal cord brain may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase I trial study effectiveness intrathecal busulfan treat patient recurrent , refractory , metastatic leptomeningeal tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intrathecal Busulfan Treating Patients With Recurrent , Refractory , Metastatic Leptomeningeal Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine maximum tolerate dose intrathecal busulfan limited escalation dosage schedule patient recurrent refractory leptomeningeal tumor . - Determine cerebrospinal fluid serum pharmacokinetics busulfan administer via intralumbar intraventricular route patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive intrathecal busulfan via intralumbar intraventricular route twice week 2 week ( 4 treatment ) . Any patient objective significant clinical response may continue treatment receive dose week 2 consecutive week , week every week 3 week ( 2 treatment ) , month thereafter disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos intrathecal busulfan maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Patients follow every 12 week 1 year disease progression . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 5-20 patient accrue study within 1-2 year .</detailed_description>
