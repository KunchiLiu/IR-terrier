	<brief_title>Irinotecan Treating Patients With Stage IV Recurrent Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate efficacy irinotecan patient metastatic , recurrent , unresectable locally advance previously treat soft tissue sarcoma . II . Assess clinical laboratory toxic effect patient tolerance regimen patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive irinotecan IV 90 minute weekly 4 week , follow 2 week rest . Treatment continue every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month first two year , every 6 month next two year , every 12 month thereafter death . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 14-27 patient accrue study 18-36 month .</detailed_description>
