	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Epoetin alfa may stimulate red blood cell production treat anemia patient cancer receive chemotherapy . It yet know whether epoetin alfa effective placebo treat anemia patient receive chemotherapy . PURPOSE : Randomized double blinded phase III trial compare effectiveness epoetin alfa placebo treat anemia cancer patient receive chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epoetin Alfa Treating Anemia Patients Who Are Receiving Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine whether epoetin alfa treatment improve quality life anemic patient undergo chemotherapy advance malignancy . II . Determine whether epoetin alfa increase hemoglobin level decrease transfusion requirement patient . III . Validate refute use algorithm use pre- posttreatment epoetin alfa , ferritin , hemoglobin level predict 16 week response response therapeutic dos epoetin alfa set forth patient . IV . Explore whether anemic patient receive platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens experience less nephrotoxicity receive concurrent epoetin alfa compare receive placebo . OUTLINE : This randomize , double blind study . Patients stratify primary malignant disease ( lung v breast v ) , life expectancy ( 4-6 month v great 6 month ) , plan concurrent radiotherapy ( yes v ) , degree anemia ( mild least 9 g/dL v severe less 9 g/dL ) . Patients receive chemotherapy randomize receive epoetin alfa subcutaneously week maximum 16 week ( arm I ) placebo subcutaneously week maximum 16 week ( arm II ) . Quality life assess randomization monthly throughout study . Patients follow every 6 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
