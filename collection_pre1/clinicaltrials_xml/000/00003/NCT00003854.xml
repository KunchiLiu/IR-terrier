	<brief_title>Prognostic Study Sentinel Lymph Node Bone Marrow Metastases Women With Stage I Stage IIA Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Estimate prevalence evaluate prognostic significance sentinel lymph node micrometastases detect immunohistochemistry woman stage I IIA breast cancer . - Estimate prevalence evaluate prognostic significance bone marrow micrometastases detect immunocytochemistry patient . - Evaluate hazard rate regional recurrence woman whose sentinel nod negative hematoxylin eosin ( H &amp; E ) staining . - Provide mechanism identify woman whose sentinel nod contain metastasis detect H &amp; E woman consider candidate ACOSOG-Z0011 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patient must female . 2 . Patient 's clinical stage must I II ( T1 T2 N0 M0 ) tumor must amenable segmental mastectomy ( lumpectomy ) . 3 . Patient must tissue diagnosis invasive breast carcinoma . Note : A patient register study cytologic diagnosis suggestive carcinoma fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) palpable nonpalpable breast lesion investigator believe breast lesion clinically suspicious invasive breast carcinoma . 4 . The date patient 's first tissue diagnosis invasive breast carcinoma cytologic diagnosis breast carcinoma must 60 day prior SLND . 5 . The patient segmental mastectomy ( lumpectomy ) perform previously , refer local investigator SLND , eligible lumpectomy less equal 60 day prior SLND . Copies operative pathology report must submit part registration process . 6 . Patient must ECOG/Zubrod status â‰¤2 , document patient 's medical record . 7 . Patient must available followup . 8 . The patient history previous malignancy eligible study long patient meet follow criterion cancer survivor . A cancer survivor eligible provide follow criterion meet : 1 . The patient undergone potentially curative therapy prior malignancy . 2 . There evidence prior malignancy least five year evidence recurrence ( except effectively treat basal cell squamous carcinoma skin , carcinoma insitu cervix effectively treat surgery alone , lobular carcinoma insitu ipsilateral contralateral breast treat surgery alone ) , 3 . The patient deem treat physician low risk recurrence prior malignancy . 9 . Signed date informed consent obtain prior patient registration . 10 . Patients childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 14 day begin study intervention . 11 . Patient must able physically undergo bilateral anterior iliac crest bone marrow aspiration . 1 . Patient lactating ( breastfeed ) . 2 . Patient previously treat chemotherapy , estrogen receptor antagonist ( i.e . Tamoxifen ) selective estrogen receptor modulators ( SERMs , i.e . Raloxifene ) invasive breast cancer . 3 . Patient previously place prepectoral breast implant . NOTE : A subpectoral implant allow . 4 . Patient consider poor surgical risk due nonmalignant systemic disease ( cardiovascular , renal , etc . ) , would preclude treatment option . 5 . Patient concurrent bilateral invasive breast malignancy . 6 . Patient able undergo access radiation therapy describedin Adjuvant Radiation Therapy Interventions section protocol . Patients active connective tissue disorder live far radiation treatment center , example , would eligible . 7 . Patient clinically radiologically identify multicentric disease amenable single lumpectomy . 8 . Patient previous ipsilateral axillary surgery excisional biopsy lymph node ( ) , treatment hidradenitis .</criteria>
