	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Pancreatic enzyme may help kill cancer cell . It yet know gemcitabine effective pancreatic enzyme therapy plus specialized diet pancreatic cancer . PURPOSE : This clinical trial compare effectiveness gemcitabine pancreatic enzyme therapy plus specialized diet ( Gonzalez regimen ) treat patient stage II , stage III , stage IV pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Compared With Pancreatic Enzyme Therapy Plus Specialized Diet ( Gonzalez Regimen ) Treating Patients Who Have Stage II , Stage III , Stage IV Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare survival patient stage II , III , IV adenocarcinoma pancreas treat gemcitabine versus intensive proteolytic enzyme therapy adjunctive dietary nutritional support . - Compare quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients stratify accord stage ( II III v IV ) , performance status ( 0-1 v 2 ) nutritional status ( well nourish moderately malnourish v severely malnourish ) . Patients enter 1 2 treatment arm choice : - Arm I ( Nutritional Arm ) : Patients receive pancreatic enzyme orally every 4 hour meal daily day 1-16 , follow 5 day rest . Patients receive magnesium citrate Papaya Plus pancreatic enzyme . Additionally , patient receive nutritional supplementation vitamin , mineral , trace element , animal glandular product 4 time per day day 1-16 , follow 5 day rest . Courses repeat every 21 day death despite relapse . Patients consume moderate vegetarian metabolizer diet course therapy , excludes red meat , poultry , white sugar . Coffee enema perform twice day , along skin brush daily , skin cleanse week castor oil first 6 month therapy , salt soda bath week . Patients also undergo complete liver flush clean sweep purge rotate basis month 5 day rest . - Arm II ( Chemotherapy Arm ) : Patients receive gemcitabine-based chemotherapy . Quality life assess 0 , 2 , 6 , 12 month yearly thereafter . Patients follow 1 , 3 , 7 , 12 month yearly thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 72-90 patient accrue study within 3 year .</detailed_description>
