	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Stage III Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare overall disease free survival patient stage III colon cancer treat adjuvant fluorouracil leucovorin calcium without irinotecan . II . Assess prognostic marker correlate expression disease free overall survival patient . III . Assess influence diet , body mass index , physical activity risk cancer recurrence survival patient . IV . Assess influence diet , obesity , physical activity risk toxicity associate adjuvant therapy patient . V. Determine whether pathological feature ( include tumor grade , tumor mitotic ( proliferation ) index , tumor border configuration , host lymphoid response tumor ; lymphatic vessel , venous vessel perineural invasion ) predict outcome patient population . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord lymph node involvement ( 1-3 v 4 ) , histology ( poorly differentiate undifferentiated v well moderately differentiate ) , preoperative serum CEA ( less 5.0 ng/mL v least 5.0 ng/mL v unknown ) . Study therapy must begin within 21-56 day surgery . Patients randomize one two treatment arm : ARM I : Patients receive leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour fluorouracil IV begin 1 hour leucovorin calcium infusion weekly 6 week . Treatment repeat every 8 week 4 course . ARM II : Patients receive irinotecan IV 90 minute , follow leucovorin calcium IV , follow fluorouracil IV weekly 4 week . Treatment repeat every 6 week 5 course . Patients complete food questionnaire begin third course 6 month study therapy . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 4 month 2 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 1260 patient accrue study within 3 year .</detailed_description>
