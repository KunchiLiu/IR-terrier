	<brief_title>Antineoplaston Therapy Treating Patients With Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Assess safety possible effectiveness antineoplastons A10 AS2-1 patient serious immediately life-threatening primary central nervous system lymphoma . - Describe response , tolerance , side effect regimen patient . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive gradually escalate dos intravenous antineoplaston A10 antineoplaston AS2-1 6 time per day maximum tolerate dose reach . Treatment continue least 12 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After 12 month , patient respond stable disease may continue treatment . Tumors measure every 2 month 6 month , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month year 3 4 , annually year 5 6 . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
