	<brief_title>Topotecan Treating Patients With Recurrent Refractory Cancer Uterus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate antitumor activity topotecan patient recurrent refractory carcinosarcoma uterus fail standard therapy . II . Determine nature degree toxic effect topotecan patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive topotecan IV 30 minute daily 5 day . Treatment repeat every 3 week minimum 1 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients complete response , partial response , stable disease continue treatment least three course . Patients follow every 4 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , periodically thereafter death . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 25-40 patient accrue study within 2 year .</detailed_description>
