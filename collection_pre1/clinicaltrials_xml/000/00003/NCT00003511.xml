	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Antineoplastons naturally-occurring substance may also make laboratory . Antineoplastons may inhibit growth cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well antineoplaston therapy work treat patient recurrent progressive multiple myeloma treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antineoplaston Therapy Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety possible effectiveness antineoplastons A10 AS2-1 patient recurrent progress multiple myeloma standard first line therapy . - Describe response , tolerance , side effect regimen patient . OUTLINE : This open label study . Patients receive gradually escalate dos antineoplaston A10 antineoplaston AS2-1 intravenous injection 6 time daily maximum tolerate dose reach . Treatment continue least 3 month absence toxicity disease progression . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) continue treatment additional 8 month reach CR . Tumors measure every 2 month first year every 3 month second year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
