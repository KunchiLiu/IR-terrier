	<brief_summary>Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness hyperthermic isolate limb perfusion melphalan without tumor necrosis factor treat patient locally advance melanoma arm leg . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Heating melphalan several degree body temperature infusing area around tumor may kill tumor cell . It yet know whether combine melphalan tumor necrosis factor effective melphalan alone treat melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Melphalan With Without Tumor Necrosis Factor Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Melanoma Arm Leg</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare hyperthermic isolate limb perfusion melphalan without tumor necrosis factor , term response proportion lesion perfusion field , patient locally advanced extremity melanoma . II . Compare local recurrence-free survival , improvement regional symptom related tumor , overall survival patient treat regimen . III . Compare toxicity regimens patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord tumor burden ( high vs low ) , prior reperfusion ( melphalan v ) , regional nodal site ( yes v ) , participate center . Patients randomize one two treatment arm . ARM I : Patients undergo hyperthermic isolated perfusion low limb either external iliac vessel common femoral vessel . Patients undergo perfusion upper extremity axillary artery vein use infraclavicular/axillary incision . Melphalan introduce perfusion slow injection 5 minute allow remain total 60 minute . ARM II : Patients undergo hyperthermic isolated perfusion arm I. Tumor necrosis factor administer slow injection arterial line allow remain total 90 minute . Melphalan introduce perfusion arm I allow remain total 60 minute . Patients follow within 6 week , 3 , 6 , 12 month , every 6 month 4 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
