	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining chemotherapy peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow doctor give high dos chemotherapy drug kill tumor cell . It yet know whether standard therapy effective high dose chemotherapy breast cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness high dose chemotherapy plus peripheral stem cell transplantation standard therapy treat woman metastatic recurrent breast cancer respond previous chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Dose Chemotherapy Plus Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation Compared With Standard Therapy Treating Women With Metastatic Recurrent Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare overall survival woman metastatic breast cancer receive either high dose chemotherapy autologous peripheral blood stem cell therapy standard therapy follow response anthracycline taxane base chemotherapy . II . Evaluate final response rate two treatment arm . III . Compare two treatment arm respect toxic effect . IV . Assess health relate quality life group patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter , nonblinded , randomize study . Patients stratify type induction chemotherapy , response status , presence visceral disease , receptor status tamoxifen therapy ( ER negative ; ER positive , prior tamoxifen ; ER positive , fail tamoxifen ; receptor status unknown ) . A quality life questionnaire give patient treatment , every 3 month thereafter . Patients assess follow 4 course induction chemotherapy . Those achieve complete remission , partial remission , evaluable disease randomize either treatment arm I arm II . For treatment arm I , stem cell mobilize chemotherapy ( course 5 6 ) plus filgrastim ( G-CSF ) G-CSF alone . Following course 6 , patient receive daily dos IV cyclophosphamide , mitoxantrone , carboplatin day -6 -3 , follow stem cell infusion day 0 G-CSF day 5 . In arm II , patient receive two course standard induction chemotherapy , follow maintenance chemotherapy discretion treat physician . All patient positive receptor status unknown receptor status previously fail tamoxifen therapy , receive tamoxifen completion post peripheral stem cell transplant ( arm I ) induction chemotherapy ( arm II ) . Following hematologic recovery high dose chemotherapy patient arm I limited disease receive consolidate radiation may also receive surgical treatment limited disease . In arm II , patient complete course 5 6 induction chemotherapy receive involve field radiation physician 's discretion . Patients arm II may also receive surgical treatment follow protocol therapy physician 's discretion . Patients follow every 3 month death . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : This study accrue approximately 50 patient per year total 192 patient 3.8 year .</detailed_description>
