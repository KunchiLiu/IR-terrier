	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . It yet know topotecan effective give infusion mouth . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness topotecan give infusion topotecan give mouth treat patient small cell lung cancer relapse follow previous therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topotecan Treating Patients With Relapsed Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare response rate , response duration , time response , time progression , survival patient relapse limited extensive stage small cell lung cancer treat oral vs intravenous topotecan . II . Compare qualitative quantitative toxicity treatment regimens patient population . III . Compare quality life patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord gender , liver metastasis ( yes v ) , duration response prior chemotherapy ( 6 month less vs great 6 month ) . Patients randomize one two treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive topotecan IV 30 minute day 1-5 . Arm II : Patients receive topotecan orally day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 3 week absence unacceptable toxicity . Patients experience complete partial response continue progression least 2 course past maximal response . Patients stable disease receive least 4 course . Quality life assess Patients follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 300 patient ( 150 per treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
