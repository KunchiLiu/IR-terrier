	<brief_title>Irinotecan Treating Patients With Advanced Gallbladder Bile Duct Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate objective tumor response rate patient advance gallbladder bile duct tumor treat irinotecan . II . Evaluate time-to-progression , survival , toxic effect associate irinotecan give weekly 4 week every 6 week patient population . OUTLINE : Patients receive 90 minute continuous infusion irinotecan day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 4 week , follow 2 week rest period . Courses treatment repeat every 42 day . Patients continue treatment absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month next 4 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 22-40 patient accrue study 2-4 year .</detailed_description>
