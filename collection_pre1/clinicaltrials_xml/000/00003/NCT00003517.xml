	<brief_title>Antineoplaston Therapy Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine antitumor activity antineoplastons A10 AS2-1 capsule combination total androgen blockade patient localize , regional metastatic adenocarcinoma prostate determine proportion patient experience objective tumor response . - Evaluate adverse effect tolerance regimen patient . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive gradually escalate dos antineoplastons A10 AS2-1 capsule orally 6-7 time daily maximum tolerate dose reach . Treatment continue least 3 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Concurrently , patient continue hormonal therapy flutamide , leuprolide , bicalutamide dose begin antineoplaston therapy . Tumors measure every 4 month 2 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 50 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
