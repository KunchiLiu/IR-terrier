PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness rituximab treat patient lymphoproliferative disorder associate immunosuppression therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody Therapy Treating Patients With Lymphoproliferative Disorder Associated With Immunosuppression Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate efficacy rituximab patient B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder pharmacologic immune suppression control either allograft rejection autoimmune disease . II . Evaluate safety direct toxicity rituximab patient population , include potential opportunistic infection . III . Evaluate secondary consequence rituximab therapy population , include change requirement immunosuppressive drug , effect graft rejection , graft survival , severity autoimmune disease . OUTLINE : Patients receive rituximab IV several hour . Treatment repeat every week 4 course . Patients follow every month 6 month , every 3 month relapse 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 15 patient accrue study within 1 year .</detailed_description>
