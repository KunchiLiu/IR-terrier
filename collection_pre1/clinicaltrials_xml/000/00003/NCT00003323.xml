	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Male hormone stimulate growth prostate cancer cell . Hormone therapy use flutamide finasteride may fight prostate cancer reduce production male hormone . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness flutamide finasteride treat prostate cancer patient high PSA level previously treat radiation therapy radical prostatectomy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine efficacy finasteride flutamide suppress prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) level patient elevate PSA definitive radiation therapy radical prostatectomy prostate cancer . - Assess sexual function quality life issue therapy . - Estimate response flutamide withdrawal group patient major reduction circulate testosterone level . - Measure response rate hormonal manipulation combine androgen blockade failure therapy . - Obtain data may predict aggressive disease . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive finasteride flutamide mouth three time day . Patients experience recurrence great 4 nu/mL ( 50 % ) increase PSA level discontinue flutamide treatment . Otherwise , patient continue therapy absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Quality life assess prior therapy 3 6 month . Patients follow every 3 month one year every 6 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : This study accrue 100 patient 2 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologic Documentation : Previous histologic evidence adenocarcinoma prostate . 2 . Prior Treatment : 2.1 Definitive Local Therapy : Patients must previous attempt definitive therapy , define previous radical prostatectomy radiation therapy least 5500 cGy prostate . 1 . Patients may radiation therapy prostate surgical resection , give definitive therapy , provide begin radiation therapy within 3 month prostatectomy . Also , brachytherapy alone combination brachytherapy external beam radiation therapy also allow , give single therapy , give rise PSA previous therapy . 2 . The previous treatment must occur least 6 month , 10 year , prior registration . 2.2 Previous Hormonal Therapy Other Treatments : Patients may 6 month hormonal therapy treatment , must hormones use treatment prostate cancer include Megace least 12 month . 1 . No therapy within 2 year finasteride 5 alphareductase inhibitor . 2 . No previous chemotherapy malignancy . 3 . No orchiectomy . 4 . No corticosteroid excess standard replacement dose adrenal failure . 3 . Elevated PSA Criteria : 3.1 Patients must PSA level 1 ng/ml 10 ng/ml , rise least 1 ng/ml nadir produce definitive therapy . The PSA level must repeat least , one month later confirm rise 1 ng/ml nadir . 3.2 After second PSA drawn confirm rise , one additional PSA drawn close start therapy possible . Therefore , total three PSAs must draw prior start therapy . Only last two need draw lab ( ie , second confirmatory PSA PSA drawn prior start trial ) . The nadir PSA initial PSA suggest rise drawn outside laboratory . The combination nadir PSA two PSAs show rise 1.0 ng/ml use determine eligibility . The two elevate PSAs must least one month apart . 4 . No clear evidence local recurrence digital rectal exam . 5 . No metastatic disease CT bone scan . 6 . Performance status 02 7 . Required initial laboratory data 1 . SGOT and/or SGPT ≤2 x upper limit normal 2 . Creatinine ≤2 x upper limit normal 3 . Bilirubin ≤2 x upper limit normal</criteria>
