	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine maximum tolerate dose hu14.18-interleukin-2 fusion protein child refractory recurrent neuroblastoma GD2-positive tumor . - Determine toxicity pharmacokinetics fusion protein patient . - Determine effect fusion protein systemic immune modulation patient . - Quantitate antifusion protein antibodies patient treated fusion protein . - Evaluate antitumor response result fusion protein regimen patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive hu14.18-interleukin-2 ( hu14.18-IL2 ) fusion protein IV 4 hour daily day 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos hu14.18-IL2 fusion protein maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede least 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Patients follow every 2 month 1 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 18-24 patient accrue study within 1 year .</detailed_description>
