	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Current therapy brain stem glioma provide limited benefit patient . The anti-cancer property Antineoplaston therapy suggest may prove beneficial treatment brain stem glioma . PURPOSE : This study perform determine effect ( good bad ) Antineoplaston therapy child ( &gt; 6 month age ) adults newly-diagnosed recurrent brain stem glioma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antineoplaston Therapy Treating Patients With Brain Stem Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine efficacy Antineoplaston therapy patient brain stem glioma , measure objective response therapy ( complete response , partial response stable disease ) . - To determine safety tolerance Antineoplaston therapy patient brain stem glioma . OVERVIEW : This single arm , open-label study patient receive gradually escalate dos intravenous Antineoplaston therapy ( Atengenal + Astugenal ) maximum tolerate dose reach . Treatment continue least 12 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After 12 month , patient complete partial response stable disease may continue treatment . To determine objective response , tumor size measure utilizing MRI scan , perform every 8 week first 2 year , every 3 month 3rd 4th year , every 6 month 5th 6th year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
