	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective response rate bryostatin 1 patient advanced renal cell carcinoma . II . Assess toxicity treatment regimen patient population . III . Determine time disease progression patient receive treatment regimen . IV . Determine overall survival patient population treat regimen . OUTLINE : Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment continue every 4 week absence unacceptable toxicity disease progresssion . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
