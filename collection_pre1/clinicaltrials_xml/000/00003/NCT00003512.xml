	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Antineoplastons naturally-occurring substance may also make laboratory . Antineoplastons may inhibit growth cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study effectiveness antineoplaston therapy treat patient recurrent refractory Waldenstrom 's macroglobulinemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antineoplaston Therapy Treating Patients With Recurrent Refractory Waldenstrom 's Macroglobulinemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety possible effectiveness antineoplastons A10 AS2-1 patient recurrent refractory Waldenstrom 's macroglobulinemia . - Describe response , tolerance , side effect regimen patient . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive gradually escalate dos antineoplastons A10 AS2-1 intravenous injection 6 time daily maximum tolerate dose reach . Treatment continue least 3 month absence toxicity disease progression . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) continue treatment additional 8 month reach CR . Tumors measure every 2 month first year every 3 month second year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 20-40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
