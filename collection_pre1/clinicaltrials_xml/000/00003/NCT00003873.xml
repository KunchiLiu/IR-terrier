	<brief_summary>Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness fluorouracil give infusion fluorouracil plus eniluracil give mouth treat patient metastatic , recurrent , residual advance colorectal cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . It yet know fluorouracil effective without eniluracil advance colorectal cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fluorouracil With Without Eniluracil Treating Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare response rate , response duration , survival patient advanced colorectal cancer treat oral fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) eniluracil protract infusion 5-FU . II . Compare toxicity treatment regimens patient population . OUTLINE : This randomize study . Patients stratify accord performance status ( 0 vs 1-2 ) measurable disease ( yes v ) . Patients randomize one two treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive fluorouracil IV continuous infusion 28 day . ARM II : Patients receive eniluracil/fluorouracil orally twice day 28 day . Treatment continue every 35 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow least every 10 week 1 year .</detailed_description>
