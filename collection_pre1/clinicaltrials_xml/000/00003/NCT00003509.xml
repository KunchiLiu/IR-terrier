	<brief_title>Antineoplaston Therapy Treating Patients With Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety possible effectiveness antineoplastons A10 AS2-1 patient progressive recurrent stage IV melanoma . - Describe response , tolerance , side effect regimen patient . OUTLINE : This open label study . Patients receive gradually escalate dos antineoplaston A10 antineoplaston AS2-1 intravenous injection 6 time daily maximum tolerate dose reach . Treatment continue least 3 month absence toxicity disease progression . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) continue treatment additional 8 month reach CR . Tumors measure every 2 month first year every 3 month second year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
