	<brief_summary>Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness combination chemotherapy without monoclonal antibody therapy treat patient previously untreated HIV-associated non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop cancer cell divide stop grow die . Monoclonal antibody rituximab locate cancer cell either kill deliver cancer-killing substance without harm normal cell . It yet know whether combination chemotherapy plus monoclonal antibody therapy effective combination chemotherapy alone treat HIV-associated non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy With Without Monoclonal Antibody Therapy Treating Patients With Previously Untreated HIV-Associated Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare efficacy CHOP ( cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , prednisone ) without rituximab patient previously untreated HIV-associated non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . II . Determine efficacy rituximab maintenance therapy follow remission induction CHOP patient . III . Determine effect rituximab immune system HIV viral load patient . IV . Determine relationship EBV load presence EBV lymphoma tumor cell patient . V. Compare effect CHOP without rituximab EBV load patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify extent disease ( stage I/II v III/IV ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm : Arm I : Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV , doxorubicin IV , vincristine IV day 3 oral prednisone day 3-7 . Patients receive rituximab day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week minimum 4 course 2 course beyond complete response absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stage I , stage IE ( include bulky ) , nonbulky stage II IIE disease receive 3 course chemotherapy rituximab follow radiotherapy begin 3 week completion third course . Patients achieve partial response minimum 28 day complete response receive maintenance rituximab IV begin day 28 final course chemotherapy . Maintenance rituximab treatment repeat every 4 week 3 course . Arm II : Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV , doxorubicin IV , vincristine IV day 1 oral prednisone day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 3 week minimum 4 course 2 course beyond complete response . Patients stage I , stage IE ( include bulky ) , nonbulky stage II IIE disease receive 3 course chemotherapy . Patients receive radiotherapy begin 3 week completion third course chemotherapy . Both arm : Patients receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously begin day 4 continue day 13 chemotherapy course blood count recover . Patients follow every 4 week 1 year every 2 month death .</detailed_description>
