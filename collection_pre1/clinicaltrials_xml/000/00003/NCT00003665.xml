	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine dose-limiting toxicity , maximum tolerate dose , recommend phase II dose , rate sensitization T cell dose level patient melanoma receive dendritic cell vaccine . II . Determine overall ( complete partial ) response rate , duration response , optimal route administration patient population . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study . Patients randomize one three treatment arm . All patient undergo leukopheresis obtain lymphocyte myeloid origin mononuclear cell fraction preparation dendritic cell ( DC ) vaccine . In arm , cohorts 5 patient receive escalate dos vaccine . The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) define dose precede 2 5 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Randomization cease MTD reach 2 arm , although accrual may continue . Treatment repeat every 2 week total 4 dos . Arm I : Patients receive 3 different dos peptide pulse DC vaccine IV , divide 3 different peptide pulse pool administer 30 minute . Arm II : Patients receive 3 different dos peptide pulse DC vaccine subcutaneously/intradermally sit evidence disease . At low dose , patient receive 3 different peptide pulse pool , administer separate site . At high dos , patient receive 3 injection subdivide 6 administer 6 distinct site . Arm III : Patients receive peptide pulse DC vaccine intranodally groin ancillary lymph node low 2 dos 3 administer arm I II . At low dose , patient receive 3 different peptide pulse pool , administer different node . At high dose , patient receive 3 injection subdivide 6 administer 6 distinct site . Patients follow 2 week monthly 3 month .</detailed_description>
