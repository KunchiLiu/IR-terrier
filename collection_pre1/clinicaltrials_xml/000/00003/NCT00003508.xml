	<brief_title>Antineoplaston Therapy Treating Patients With Advanced Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Provide treatment antineoplastons A10 AS2-1 patient stage IV mesothelioma . - Describe response , tolerance , side effect regimen patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive gradually escalate dos antineoplaston A10 antineoplaston AS2-1 IV six time per day maximum dose reach . Treatment continue least 3 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After 3 month , patient stable respond disease may continue treatment . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) continue treatment least 8 month beyond CR . Patients follow every 2 month 1 year every 3 month second year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 20-40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
