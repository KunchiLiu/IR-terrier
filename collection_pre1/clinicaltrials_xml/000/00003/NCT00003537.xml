	<brief_title>Antineoplaston Therapy Treating Adult Patients With Anaplastic Astrocytoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine efficacy Antineoplaston therapy adult anaplastic astrocytoma measure objective response therapy ( complete response , partial response ) stable disease . - To determine safety tolerance Antineoplaston therapy adult anaplastic astrocytoma . OVERVIEW : This single arm , open-label study adult anaplastic astrocytoma receive gradually escalate dos intravenous Antineoplaston therapy ( Atengenal + Astugenal ) maximum tolerate dose reach . Treatment continue least 12 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After 12 month , patient complete partial response stable disease may continue treatment . To determine objective response , tumor size measure utilizing MRI scan , perform every 8 week first two year , every 3 month third fourth year , every 6 month 5th sixth year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-40 patient accrue study</detailed_description>
