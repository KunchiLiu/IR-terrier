	<brief_title>Bexarotene Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare efficacy oral bexarotene ( LGD1069 ) two different dose level patient advance breast cancer . II . Assess safety tolerability treatment regimen patient population . III . Evaluate efficacy oral bexarotene term induction differentiation decrease aberrant cell proliferation patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior therapy metastatic disease . Patients randomize one two dose level . All patient receive oral bexarotene daily . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every week first month , week 6 8 , monthly thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 84-180 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
