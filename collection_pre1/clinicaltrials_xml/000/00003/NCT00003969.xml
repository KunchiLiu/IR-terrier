	<brief_title>Geldanamycin Analogue Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine maximum tolerate dose geldanamycin analogue , 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin ( AAG ) , patient advance malignancy . - Determine toxic effect dose-limiting toxicity AAG patient population . - Determine safe dose AAG Phase II study . - Measure pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic profile AAG patient . - Assess time tumor progression antitumor activity patient treat AAG . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive geldanamycin analogue , 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin ( AAG ) , IV 15-30 minute every week . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos AAG maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede least 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Patients follow 4 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 20-40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
