	<brief_title>Homoharringtonine Plus Low-Dose Cytarabine Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Chronic Phase</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate hematologic cytogenetic response rate newly diagnose patient BCR/ABL ( + ) chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) treat combined homoharringtonine ( omacetaxine mepesuccinate ) low dose cytarabine . II . To estimate toxicity two drug give combination cooperative group set . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess duration hematological response incidence hematological progression patient . II . To assess duration cytogenetic response patient continue protocol therapy beyond initial nine month . III . To use quantitative Southern blot monitor blood sample monitor molecular response rate patient enter onto CALGB treatment study CML . IV . To compare quantitative Southern blot result blood sample marrow cytogenetics time complete molecular response . V. To use RT-PCR monitor frequency residual disease patient achieve complete blood Southern blot marrow cytogenetic response ( elimination BCR/ABL positivity Southern blot absence Philadelphia chromosome cytogenetics ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive cytarabine homoharringtonine concurrently continuous intravenous infusion 7 day . Courses repeat every 28 day . Patients receive minimum 9 course therapy absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients major cytogenetic responder 9 month may continue therapy switch interferon . Minor cytogenetic responder switch interferon , nonresponders remove therapy give option switch interferon . Patients follow every 6 month 10 year .</detailed_description>
