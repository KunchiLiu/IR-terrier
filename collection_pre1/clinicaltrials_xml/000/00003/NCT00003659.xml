	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop cancer cell divide stop grow die . Combining one drug may kill cancer cell . Monoclonal antibody locate cancer cell either kill deliver cancer-killing substance without harm normal cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness fludarabine plus high-dose cyclophosphamide rituximab treat patient previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fludarabine , Cyclophosphamide , Rituximab Treating Patients Who Have Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine response rate patient chronic lymphocytic leukemia treat sequential fludarabine , high dose cyclophosphamide , rituximab . - Survival 5 year - Utilize flow cytometry polymerase chain reaction sensitive measure minimal residual disease patient . OUTLINE : This open label study . Patients receive fludarabine IV daily 5 day . Treatment repeat every 4 week 3 6 course . Three week later , cyclophosphamide administer intravenously every 2-3 week 3 course . Filgrastim ( G-CSF ) administer day 2-10 . Beginning 4 week last dose cyclophosphamide , patient receive rituximab intravenous infusion weekly 4 week . Patient follow every 3 month death . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : This study accrue 30 patient within 3 year .</detailed_description>
