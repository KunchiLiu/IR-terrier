	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Antineoplastons naturally-occurring substance may also make laboratory . Antineoplastons may inhibit growth cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study effectiveness antineoplaston therapy treat patient metastatic , recurrent , refractory neuroblastoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antineoplaston Therapy Treating Patients With Metastatic , Recurrent , Refractory Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety possible effectiveness antineoplastons A10 AS2-1 patient metastatic , recurrent , refractory neuroblastoma . - Describe response , tolerance , side effect regimen patient . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive gradually escalate dos antineoplaston A10 antineoplaston AS2-1 intravenous injection 6 time day maximum tolerate dose reach . Treatment continue least 2 month absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) continue treatment additional 8 month reach CR . Tumors measure every 2 month 1 year every 3 month 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 20-40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
