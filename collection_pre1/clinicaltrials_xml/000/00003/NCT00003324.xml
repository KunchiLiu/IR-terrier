	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy With Without Surgery Treating Patients Who Have Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Develop prognostic factor patient brain metastasis treat focal treatment without concurrent whole brain irradiation . - Determine whether focal treatment without whole brain radiotherapy produce good long-term outcome patient four less cerebral metastasis . - Assess survival , physical cognitive functioning , quality life patient treat protocol . OUTLINE : Quality life assess use FACT-BR scale , physical function assess use FIM scale , cognition assess use two brief pencil paper test . Patients receive focal therapy cerebral metastasis combination ( 1 ) surgery plus fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy surgical bed , ( 2 ) single fraction stereotactic radiotherapy linear accelerator without radiation sensitizer . Patients follow 2 10 week , every 3 month 18 month , every 6 month 3 year , annually . Quality life assess followup visit . Patients suffer intracerebral relapse offer focal therapy 3 metastasis , 6 lesion consecutive scan , continue life expectancy least 3 month Karnofsky performance status 60-100 % . Otherwise , relapse patient offer whole brain radiotherapy supportive treatment steroid , may also receive stereotactic boost new lesion . Patients receive prior whole brain irradiation offer entry protocol eligible supportive treatment steroid . Patients follow . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : At least 60 patient enrol study .</detailed_description>
