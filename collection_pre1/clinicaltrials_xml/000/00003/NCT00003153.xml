	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : White blood cell donor may able kill cancer cell patient multiple myeloma recur follow bone marrow transplantation . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give donor white blood cell work treat patient recurrent multiple myeloma undergone bone marrow transplantation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biological Therapy Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma That Has Recurred Following Bone Marrow Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Assess response rate patient recurrent multiple myeloma allogeneic marrow transplant genotypically HLA identical sibling donor treat donor lymphocyte infusion salvage therapy . - Evaluate safety toxicity treatment use salvage therapy patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive initial cell dose donor lymphocyte ( CD3+ cell ) IV 15-30 minute . Patients rapidly progressive disease may skip initial cell dose proceed directly dose escalation receive CD3+ cell higher cell dose . Patients achieve complete response initial treatment may receive 2 additional course escalate dos CD3+ cell 8-12 week apart absence unacceptable toxicity . Patients evaluate 4 8 week infusion . Patients disease progression 8 week retreat time . Patients achieve partial response stable disease 8 week re-evaluated 12 week may retreat . Patients follow every 2 week 3 month , month 9 month , every 2 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 22 patient accrue study within 2 year .</detailed_description>
