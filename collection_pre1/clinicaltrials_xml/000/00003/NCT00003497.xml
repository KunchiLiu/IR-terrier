	<brief_title>Antineoplaston Therapy Treating Patients With Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Demonstrate antitumor activity antineoplaston A10 AS2-1 capsule patient non-small cell lung cancer determine proportion patient experience objective tumor response . - Evaluate adverse effect tolerance regimen patient . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive antineoplaston A10 AS2-1 capsule orally six seven time day . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Tumors measure every 4 month 2 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 20-40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
