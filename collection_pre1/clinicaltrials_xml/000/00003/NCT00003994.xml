	<brief_summary>Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining one drug may kill tumor cell . Chemoprotective drug amifostine may protect normal cell side effect chemotherapy . It yet know chemotherapy regimen effective child young adult liver cancer . This randomized phase III trial study give combination chemotherapy together amifostine see well work compare combination chemotherapy alone treat patient liver cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy With Without Amifostine Treating Young Patients With Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate response efficacy amifostine ( amifostine trihydrate ) reduce toxicity associate platinum agent . II . To test whether effect amifostine event-free survival compare outcome treat amifostine treat without study historic control . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate event-free survival patient stage I pure fetal histology treat surgery alone . II . To estimate efficacy amifostine reduce toxicity associate cisplatinum child resect tumor receive treatment 01 randomize receive receive amifostine . III . To collect tumor tissue patient cytogenetic genetic analysis order prospectively analyze biologic feature prognosis patient detailed treatment history , provide resource future biologic study hepatoblastoma . IV . To assess prognostic significance respect event-free survival hepatoblastoma pathologic variant patient stage I tumor treat surgery chemotherapy ( cisplatin + 5FU + vincristine ) . OUTLINE : This randomize study . Patients stratify accord disease stage ( stage I pure fetal histology v stage I histology stage II [ stage II close accrual 11-25-03 ] v stage III IV [ stag III IV close accrual 11-25-03 ] ) . Patients randomize one four treatment arm . ( Arms III IV close accrual 4-5-02 ) ( Arm II close accrual 11-25-03 ) All patient undergo surgical resection attempt resection tumor . Patients pure fetal histology achieve complete tumor resection receive treatment . All patient receive postoperative chemotherapy . Arm I : Patients receive cisplatin IV 4 hour day 1 , vincristine IV day 3 , 10 , 17 , fluorouracil day 3 . Arm II ( closed accrual 11-25-03 ) : Patients receive treatment arm I addition amifostine IV 15 minute prior cisplatin day 1 . Arm III ( closed accrual 4-5-02 ) : Patients receive carboplatin IV 1 hour day 1 cisplatin IV 4 hour day 15 . Arm IV ( closed accrual 4-5-02 ) : Patients receive treatment arm III addition amifostine IV 15 minute prior carboplatin day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 4 course arm I II ( arm II close accrual 11-25-03 ) every 4 week 4 course arm III IV ( arm III IV close accrual 4-5-02 ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stage III IV disease ( stag III IV close accrual 11-25-03 ) undergo second look surgery receive 2 additional course chemotherapy achieve complete response surgery . Patients follow monthly 6 month , every 2 month 2 year , every 3 month 2 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 356 patient accrue study within 5.5 year .</detailed_description>
