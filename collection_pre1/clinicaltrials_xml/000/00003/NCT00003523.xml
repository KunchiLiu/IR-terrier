	<brief_title>Aminocamptothecin Treating Patients With Recurrent Refractory Ovarian Epithelial Cancer Primary Cancer Peritoneum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate antitumor activity aminocamptothecin colloidal dispersion patient platinum-resistant recurrent refractory ovarian cancer primary peritoneal carcinoma fail high priority treatment protocol . II . Determine nature degree toxicity aminocamptothecin colloidal dispersion patient population . OUTLINE : Patients receive aminocamptothecin colloidal dispersion IV 120 hour weekly two every three week . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 23-56 patient accrue study within 5-12 month .</detailed_description>
