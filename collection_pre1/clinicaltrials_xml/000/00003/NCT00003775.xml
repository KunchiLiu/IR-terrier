	<brief_title>Leflunomide Treating Patients With Anaplastic Astrocytoma First Relapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine median time progression , median survival , objective response patient anaplastic astrocytoma anaplastic oligoastrocytoma first relapse treat intravenous leflunomide ( SU101 ) . II . Assess safety SU101 patient . III . Describe health-related quality life patient treat intravenous SU101 . OUTLINE : This open label , multicenter study . Patients receive leflunomide ( SU101 ) IV 6 hour day 1-4 . Patients receive SU101 IV 6 hour weekly 6 week ( begin day 8-12 ) . Patients exhibit complete response , partial response , stable disease may continue treatment year disease progression unacceptable toxicity occurs . Patients continue therapy receive SU101 IV 6 hour every week 7 week , follow 1 week rest . Quality life assess every 8 week end study . Patients follow every 8 week tumor progression . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 60 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
