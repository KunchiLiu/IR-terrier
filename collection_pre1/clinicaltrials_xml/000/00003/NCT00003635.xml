	<brief_title>506U78 Treating Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia That Has Not Responded Fludarabine Alkylating Agents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine anticancer efficacy 506U78 patient chronic lymphocytic leukemia refractory fludarabine alkylator therapy . II . Determine safety ( include incidence infection ) drug patient . III . Evaluate pharmacokinetics 506U78 ara-G , assess intracellular pharmacokinetics ara-GTP patient receive multiple treatment course ( M.D . Anderson Cancer Center ) . IV . Determine response rate , time maximal response , duration response patient treated drug . V. Determine two-year survival progression-free survival patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord cellular type disease ( B cell v T cell ) . Patients receive 506U78 IV 2 hour day 1 , 3 , 5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day maximum 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 28 day every 2 month 2 year disease progression . After disease progression , patient follow every 3 month 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 14-100 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
