	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety toxicity vaccination strategy employ CD80-transfected allogeneic breast cancer cell line ( MDA-MB-231 ) . - Assess immunologic response lymphocyte isolate lymph node drain vaccination site follow single dose CD80-transfected MDA-MB-231 . - Assess development systemic immunity follow multiple injection CD80-transfected MDA-MB-231 . - Observe tumor regression . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive intradermal vaccination contain CD80-transfected cell without sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) without BCG . Vaccinations administer every 2 week 6 week monthly 3 month . Patients may receive 1 2 different dos GM-CSF . GM-CSF administered vaccination , every 12 hour 7 day . Monthly vaccination may continue long response show . Cohorts 5 patient treated dose/combination . Each cohort complete treatment next cohort accrue . Patients follow week 4 8 , every 2 month 6 month , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month disease progression . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 35 patient accrue study within 18 month .</detailed_description>
