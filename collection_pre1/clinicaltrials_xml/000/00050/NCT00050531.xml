	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn give PEG-Alpha Interferon ( PEG-Intron ) Sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) patient receive treatment high dose Gleevec ( imatinib mesylate ) effective treat CML chronic phase therapy imatinib mesylate alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High-Dose Gleevec Alone Combination With Peg-Intron GM-CSF Early Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia ( CML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Imatinib mesylate drug block protein responsible development CML . PEG-Intron natural substance make cell immune system help control CML . GM-CSF hormone help stimulate production white blood cell . During study take 400 mg imatinib mesylate mouth 2 time day ( 800 mg day total ) . Imatinib mesylate take morning even large glass water . You may give `` pill diary '' write ( day time ) take drug . You may also write diary side effect may experience . You may bring diary , unused tablet , empty bottle imatinib mesylate every visit study doctor . Any unused supply must return end study . After complete 6 month imatinib mesylate therapy , randomly assign ( toss coin ) one two group . Patients first group give PEG-Intron GM-CSF addition imatinib mesylate therapy . Patients group continue take imatinib mesylate . If assign group receive PEG-Intron GM-CSF , continue take imatinib mesylate . In addition , PEG-Intron give injection skin week . Sargramostim give injection skin 3 time week . You and/or family member teach give injection . Every 1-2 week first 4 week study , around 2 teaspoon blood drawn routine blood test measure amount imatinib blood . The blood test repeat every 6 8 week ( often doctor feel necessary ) long study . A bone marrow sample also take every 3 month first year every 4 6 month long study check status disease . You ask visit doctor physical exam vital sign measure . These visit schedule least every 3 month study . The visit may schedule often depend status disease . Update : February 2012 : Blood test recommend 2 time per year . Your doctor discus often blood test . Bone marrow do doctor think need check disease . You must return M.D . Anderson least every year . You may need bone marrow test every visit , blood drawn measure amount disease . Treatment group may continue 7-10 year , long doctor feel necessary control leukemia . If disease get bad experience intolerable side effect , take study doctor discus treatment option . This investigational study . All drug use study FDA approve commercially available . However , use study investigational . A total 98 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
