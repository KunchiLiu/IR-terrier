	<brief_title>Comparing Safety , Effectiveness , Tolerability Three Anti-HIV Drug Regimens Treatment-Naive Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Numerous treatment option available HIV infect patient antiretroviral ( ARV ) therapy naive , optimal regimen yet establish . This study compare nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) -based regimen , ritonavir ( RTV ) -enhanced protease inhibitor ( PI ) -based regimen , nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI ) -sparing regimen initial treatment HIV infection . Patients randomly assign one three study arm . In Arm A , patient receive lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ) twice daily efavirenz ( EFV ) daily bed . Arm B patient receive LPV/r twice daily , lamivudine ( 3TC ) daily , plus either stavudine extend release ( d4T XR ) daily , zidovudine ( ZDV ) twice daily , tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) daily . Patients Arm C receive EFV daily bed 3TC plus either d4T XR daily bed , ZDV twice daily , TDF daily bed . Study visit occur every 4 week Week 24 , every 8 week thereafter maximum 96 week . Blood drawn every visit urine sample collect every 8 week . Body measurement take Weeks 24 , 48 , 72 , 96 . Whole body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan do Weeks 48 96 . Patients must fast study visit Weeks 12 , 24 , 48 , 72 , 96 . Women study gynecological assessment every 24 week .</detailed_description>
