	<detailed_description>This Phase III , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multi-center study intravenous OvaRex® MAb-B43.13 post-chemotherapy consolidation epithelial carcinoma ovarian , tubal , peritoneal origin .</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Ovarian Neoplasms</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patients must histological diagnosis epithelial adenocarcinoma ovarian , tubal peritoneal origin , disease classify FIGO Stage III IV . Histological diagnosis must confirm site pathology review slide document site investigator . These slide must make available sponsor review . Patients must elevate serum CA125 level ( per reference lab normal range ) measure prior surgery ( i.e. , later immediate postsurgery period patient surgical recovery room ) . If presurgical CA125 measurement available , patient must : ( ) serum CA125 level ≥100 U/mL , ( b ) tumor tissue demonstrate immunohistochemical method express CA125 . Patients must document serum CA125 level ≤65 U/mL prior third cycle frontline chemotherapy . Patients must microscopic small diameter residual disease follow primary debulking surgical procedure . Patients must receive chemotherapy include platinum compound taxane follow appropriate staging procedure . Frontline treatment include 8 cycle chemotherapy . Patients must complete clinical response frontline surgery chemotherapy . A complete clinical response define one patient normal physical examination , conclusive evidence residual tumor CT abdomen pelvis , normal chest xray , serum CA125 level least 5 U/mL less 35 U/mL measure pretreatment baseline laboratory protocol Central Lab . Patients must undergo one interval debulking procedure . Patients must receive first dose study medication 4 12 week complete last dose frontline chemotherapy . Patients must voluntarily agree participate sign informed consent , willing complete study procedure . Patients receive one prior regimen chemotherapy . A change chemotherapy agent permit patient 's primary therapy provide change consider part initial chemotherapy treatment regimen . Patients known refractory recurrent epithelial adenocarcinoma ovarian , tubal , peritoneal origin require chemotherapy . Patients compromise hematopoietic function ( hemoglobin &lt; 8.0 g/dL ; lymphocyte count &lt; 300 mm³ ; neutrophil count &lt; 1000 mm³ ; platelet count &lt; 100,000 mm³ . Patients hepatic dysfunction define bilirubin &gt; 1.5 time upper normal limit , LDH , SGOT SGPT &gt; 2 time upper limit normal albumin &lt; 3.5 g/dL . Patients severe renal dysfunction define serum creatinine &gt; 1.6 mg/dL . Patients know allergy murine protein document anaphylactic reaction drug , know hypersensitivity diphenhydramine antihistamine similar chemical structure . Patients contraindication use pressor agent . Patients chronically treat immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin , ACTH , systemic corticosteroid . Patients receive immunotherapy ( interferon , tumor necrosis factor , cytokine [ e.g. , interleukins ] biological response modifier , BCG vaccine ) within 6 week receive first dose study medication . Patients receive hemopoietic factor acceptable . Patients splenectomy . Patients uncontrolled disease cancer exclude . Patients chronic disease well control ( e.g. , diabetes mellitus , hypertension ) eligible . Patients concurrent illness chronically take medication , would confound result study , preclude patient complete study , mask adverse reaction . Patients concurrent malignancy ( except nonmelanoma skin , situ carcinoma cervix ) , unless patient receive curative treatment disease free great equal 5 year . Patients receive investigational drug within 30 day enrollment .</criteria>
