	<brief_title>Docetaxel Gemcitabine With Filgrastim-SD/01 Support Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Docetaxel Gemcitabine give day 1 8 21-day schedule substantial activity non-small cell lung cancer . Both first second-line patient response rate comparable well standard combination regimen . Grade 3/4 neutropenia occurs half patient give growth factor support . Studies demonstrate single dose Filgrastim-SF/01 100 mg/kg effectively enhance post chemotherapy neutrophil recovery manner similar daily Filgrastim . This current study design characterize incidence grade 3/4 neutropenia fix dose Filgrastim-SD/01 add well-studied myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimen consist Gemcitabine Docetaxel .</detailed_description>
