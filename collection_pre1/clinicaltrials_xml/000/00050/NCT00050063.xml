	<brief_title>Effects Therapeutic HIV Vaccination Control HIV After Discontinuation Anti-HIV Drugs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study rollover study patient participate A5058s : Augmentation HIV-Specific Helper CTL Responses Through Therapeutic Vaccination Individuals Receiving Potent Suppressive Antiretroviral Therapies . In A5058s , patient receive series therapeutic vaccination elicit HIV-specific immune response . This study examine whether vaccine-induced response control viral load absence antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) . Upon study entry , patient discontinue ART . During first 6 week study , viral load monitor weekly CD4+ T-cell count monitor every week . Viral load CD4+ T-cell count measure every week Week 6 Week 24 , monthly patient restart ART Week 48 . Patients reinitiate ART reason register Step 2 follow 10 week .</detailed_description>
