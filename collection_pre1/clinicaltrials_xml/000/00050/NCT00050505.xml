	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety effect dilute smallpox vaccine , make large number dos case smallpox release environment . A total 927 healthy adult age 32 70 year already vaccinate smallpox ( since 1989 ) volunteer study 34 week receive different strength vaccine . Some subject may participate long choose revaccinated first vaccination take . The vaccine give make small cut skin put vaccine cut . After screen visit , volunteer follow study visit follow phone call . Blood collect study visit look immune system ( body system fights infection ) response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Expanded Dryvax Dilution Study Previously Vaccinated Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose multi-center , double blind randomize dose response study : evaluate safety undiluted Dryvax Dryvax dilute 1:5 1:10 adult age 32 70 year previously vaccinate since 1989 define , high precision ( +/-3 % ) , proportion individual respond `` take '' 6 11 day vaccination undiluted Dryvax vaccine Dryvax dilute 1:5 . A `` take '' define formation lesion site vaccination consistent description successful vaccination describe IB Secondary study objective include define good precision ( +/- 10 % ) , proportion individual respond `` take '' 6 11 day vaccination 1:10 dilution Dryvax vaccine explore correlation `` take '' / no- '' take '' immune response vaccine group ( antibody responses volunteer ; assay cell-mediated immunity convenience sample consist 15 volunteer enrol site ( total N = 105 ) randomly distribute across vaccine group ) . Immunogenicity assay include neutralize antibody vaccinia , vaccinia binding antibody , ELISPOT gamma interferon [ Assays cell-mediated immunity perform convenience sample consist 15 volunteer enrol site ( total N = 105 ) ] intracellular cytokine production . Primary safety endpoint include safety data regard three dos vaccine previously vaccinate subject assessed adverse event report subject and/or investigator change observe schedule clinic visit . Specific attention pay following : local reactogenicity site injection : pain , tenderness , erythema , induration , regional lymphadenopathy , limitation limb movement ; systemic symptom : fever , myalgia , fatigue , headache ; anaphylaxis , hypersensitivity reaction ; reaction : dermatologic , neurologic , gastrointestinal ( nausea/vomiting , diarrhea ) . The primary efficacy endpoint trial proportion vaccinee demonstrate `` take '' 6 11 day first vaccination dose level ( undiluted 1:5 1:10 ) . Secondary endpoint : immune response assess vaccinia neutralize antibody measure subject bind antibody vaccinia subject size lesion observe subject compare across dilution group . Tertiary endpoint 15 volunteer site randomly distribute across vaccine group cellular immune response assess : ELISPOT gamma interferon response vaccinia antigens intracellular cytokine production .</detailed_description>
