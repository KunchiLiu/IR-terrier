	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Comparing Low- High-Dose Alemtuzumab High-Dose Rebif® Patients With Early , Active Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim MS therapy prevent progression disease accumulation long-term disability . The hypothesis underlie study aggressive treatment inflammation brain early course MS would protect participant disease progression accumulate disability . This protocol compare two different dos alemtuzumab high-dose , high frequency SC interferon beta-1a evaluate safety profile respective treatment evaluate efficacy term : - Slowing sustained accumulation disability participant MS ; - Reducing frequency relapse experience participant MS ; - Reducing harmful effect MS brain , assess magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) Participants receive alemtuzumab initial 36-month treatment period may eligible re-treatment alemtuzumab extension study CAMMS03409 ( NCT00930553 ) evaluate : - How long effect prior alemtuzumab treatment last ; - If additional treatment alemtuzumab continue reduce effect MS ; - What kind side effect participant experience upon retreatment alemtuzumab</detailed_description>
