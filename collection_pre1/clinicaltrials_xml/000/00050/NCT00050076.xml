	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Once Twice Daily Doses MCC-135 Subjects With Congestive Heart Failure .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent year usefulness angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor vasodilator well beta-blockers realize treatment heart failure . Multi-center study clinical trial show benefit angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor morbidity mortality heart failure subject , physician also prescribe angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor initial treatment subject leave ventricular dysfunction . Some subject respond angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor intolerance compound also observe . Despite significant reduction mortality observe limited controlled study , 5-year mortality subject congestive heart failure continue high , indicate significant therapeutic gap treatment disease . MCC-135 study assess usefulness supplement replacement current treatment provide subject specific predictable therapy reverse remodel diseased heart markedly improve subject 's survival . The current study exploratory clinical trial determine efficacy two dos two dose regimen MCC-135 compare placebo evaluate improvement subject 's plasma b-type ( brain ) natriuretic peptide level , regular rate ( heart rate ) variability clinical sign symptom .</detailed_description>
