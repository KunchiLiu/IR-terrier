	<brief_title>Study Letrozole Plus Tipifarnib Placebo Treatment Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical study involve two group patient advance breast cancer . One group ( 2/3rds patient ) take tipifarnib combination another anticancer drug call letrozole , group ( 1/3rd patient ) take letrozole plus placebo ( inactive substance give form real drug ) . The assignment one two group chance ( like flip coin ) . Unless need arises , neither patient study staff know whether patient receive tipifarnib letrozole . Comparisons two group make patient achieve confirm Complete Response ( CR ) Partial Response ( PR ) . The interval date randomization early date disease progression also assess . The study include evaluation safety tolerability . Patients expect participation trial last minimum 4 8 week . Their participation could continue several month beyond year , depend disease respond treatment . After complete study treatment , patient ask attend End Treatment visit posttreatment Follow-up visit 4 6 week stop medication . Patients randomly assign treatment either 2.5 mg letrozole daily plus placebo match tipifarnib twice daily , 2.5 mg letrozole daily plus 300 mg tipifarnib twice daily .
