	<brief_summary>This study use transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) electrical stimulation nerve examine brain control muscle movement focal hand dystonia ( writer 's cramp ) . Normally , person move finger , brain 's motor cortex prevent finger move involuntarily . Patients focal hand dystonia difficulty individualize finger movement , possibly due increase excitability motor cortex . Musicians , writer , typist , athletes others whose work involve frequent repetitive movement may develop focal dystonia hand . Healthy normal volunteer patient focal dystonia 18 year age old may eligible study . For TMS procedure , subject seat comfortable chair hand place pillow lap . An insulated wire coil place scalp . A brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . This may cause muscle , hand arm twitching coil near part brain control movement , may induce twitch transient tingle forearm , head face muscle . Subjects ask move finger . Just movement , brief electrical stimulation apply end either second fifth finger . Metal electrodes tap skin muscle computer record electrical activity hand arm muscle activate stimulation . The test last 2-3 hour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate effect sensory afferent input surround inhibition motor cortex dystonia . Surround inhibition cortical phenomenon , function may suppress unwanted movement surround muscle voluntary action . In support , recent study show motor output little finger reduce self-paced , voluntary movement index finger , despite increase spinal excitability . Work also show relaxed muscle , homotopic heterotopic peripheral stimulation result time dependent modulation motor cortical excitability . However , study examine relationship volitional movement sensory input cortical surround inhibition , phenomenon hypothesize defective dystonia . The aim study examine change surround inhibition electrical stimulation apply finger actively move , lead inhibition surround finger ( heterotopic inhibition ) , different time interval prior initiation movement , assess effect heterotopic peripheral stimulation surround inhibition dystonia patient compare normal subject .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Nineteen patient age 18 focal dystonia upper limb ( writer 's cramp ) recruit study . For patient , selection criterion presence focal hand dystonia . Nineteen normal subject age 18 recruit control group . The control dystonia neurological condition . All subject sign inform consent prior participation trial . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Exclusion criterion trial cover normal control dystonia group include concurrent medical surgical condition well neurological psychiatric illness . Exclusion criterion include individual medication potential influence nervous system function ( antidepressant , anxiolytic , anticonvulsant , antipsychotic , antiparkinson , hypnotic , stimulant , antihistamine ) . The exclusion criterion also include patient receive Botulinum toxin injection within 3 month start protocol . Furthermore , individual pacemaker , implant medical pump , metal plate metal object skull eye ( example , brain surgery ) , history seizure disorder exclude trial .</criteria>
