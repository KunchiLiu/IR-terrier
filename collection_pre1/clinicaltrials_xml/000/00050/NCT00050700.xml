	<brief_summary>The purpose study use brain image technology examine role certain brain receptor nervous system chemical acetylcholine major depression . The cholinergic system involve regulation neurotransmitter brain receptor bind . Evidence suggest cholinergic system may play role development depression . Acetylcholine neurotransmitter bind certain brain receptor call muscarinic cholinergic receptor . Cholinomimetic drug ( drug stimulate cholinergic system ) often exacerbate depressive symptom people mood disorder healthy individual . This increase depressive symptom may cause stimulation muscarinic acetylcholine receptor ( mAChRs ) , study need confirm . This study use positron emission tomography ( PET ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) study function mAChRs individual depression . Participants study undergo physical examination , psychiatric interview , neuropsychological test , PET MRI scan , rating scale depression , anxiety , negative thinking symptom . Questions behavior function ask blood sample collect genetic analysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Several path evidence converge implicate role cholinergic system pathophysiology affective illness . In unipolar depressed euthymic bipolar subject , cholinomimetic drug ( i.e. , muscarinic agonist , acetylcholinesterase inhibitor ) exacerbate depressive sign symptom dysphoria , psychomotor retardation , impairment attention memory , hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis hyperactivity sleep EEG abnormality . In healthy subject , acetylcholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine elicit range depressive symptom include dysphoria , anergia , psychomotor slowing , emotional lability , sleep disturbance , memory concentration impairment , high dos , tearfulness depression . These effect show reflect stimulation muscarinic receptor . Cholinomimetics also exacerbate behavioral despair putative animal model depression . Conversely , anticholinergic agent biperidine improve symptom depression placebo control study . Moreover , muscarinic cholinomimetics choline rich nutrient , lecithin ( phosphatidylcholine ) exert antimanic effect bipolar subject . Potentially consistent observation , depressed subject exhibit hypersensitivity cholinomimetic agent . Administration muscarinic cholinergic agonist , ACh release agent acetylcholinesterase inhibitor induce exaggerated effect REM density latency depressed subject healthy control . In addition , manic depress bipolar subject show increased pupillary sensitivity muscarinic cholinergic agonist pilocarpine relative control . Despite data implicate mAChR receptor system mood disorder , direct vivo investigation central mAChR perform depressed subject . A novel PET radioligand , [ ( 18 ) F ] FP-TZTP recently develop Eckelman selective agonist M ( 2 ) receptor . Because M ( 2 ) receptor function predominately presynaptic release-controlling autoreceptor , decreased distribution volume ( V ) receptor could conceivably give rise increase postsynaptic muscarinic receptor sensitivity . This application propose pilot PET study M ( 2 ) receptor distribution volume currently depress subject major depressive disorder ( n=30 ) , currently depress subject bipolar disorder ( n=30 ) , psychiatrically healthy control ( n=30 ) . The propose pilot study test central hypothesis M ( 2 ) receptor V decrease region primarily locate presynaptically depressed subject relative healthy control . The propose study advance knowledge regard pathophysiology depression .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA MDD Depressed Sample : Thirty subject ( age 1845 ) male female select , primary MDD currently depress define DSMIV criterion recurrent MDD current HDRS score moderatelytoseverely depressed range ( great 18 ) first degree relative MDD first degree relative mania , alcoholism , antisocial personality disorder . INCLUSION CRITERIA Bipolar Depressed Sample : Thirty subject ( age 1845 ) male female select meet DSMIV criterion bipolar I II disorder currently depress , HDRS score moderatelytoseverely depressed range ( great 18 ) . Subjects may inpatients outpatient . Because effective treatment discontinue purpose protocol , subject identify never treat discontinue medication due lack efficacy , noncompliance , physician order , reason prior study entry . INCLUSION CRITERIA Healthy , Control Sample : Thirty subject ( age 1845 ) male female meet criterion major psychiatric disorder select . From large sample control subject match depressed subject age , gender , handedness stage menstrual cycle . The control subject know first degree relative mood disorder . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects must take antidepressant medication likely alter monoamine neurochemistry cerebrovascular function least 3 week ( 8 week fluoxetine drug know anticholinergic effect ) prior scan . Because effective medication discontinue purpose study , subject identify never treat discontinue medication due lack efficacy , noncompliance , physician order reason prior study entry . Subjects also exclude : ) serious suidical ideation behavior 1 ) thought suicide within past three month accompany intet harm oneself , serious consideration mean plan attempt suicide , evidence arrange suicide attemp ( e.g . give away prize possession , update ) clear desire commit suicide ; 2 ) suicide attempt within previous one year ; 3 ) current plan inflict self harm physical evidence suspicious engage suicide attempt . Subjects also exclude significant comorbid condition last year , c ) psychosis extent ability provide inform consent doubt , ) history major psychiatric disorder ( target mood disorder ) arise temporally initial mood episode , e ) medical neurological illness ( i.e . seizure disorder , coma past ) likely affect physiology anatomy , f ) history drug alcohol abuse within 1 year lifetime history alcohol drug dependence ( DSM IV criterion ) , g ) HIV positive AIDS , h ) current pregnancy ( documented history pregnancy test prior scanning ) , ) current breast feeding , j ) general MRI exclusion criterion include subject pacemaker significant claustrophobia k ) smoker .</criteria>
