	<brief_summary>This study collect sample blood , stool , bone marrow , tissue patient hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia investigate possible association exposure viruses development aplastic anemia patient . Cells sample obtain may grow laboratory future study . Patients sample may use : - Study abnormality occur hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia ; - Test various virus ; - Test immune function ; - Measure factor related patient disease disease may risk ; - Evaluate effectiveness current therapy , refine treatment approach , identify potential new therapy ; - Identify possible measure disease prevention ; - Identify possible genetic factor associate hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia . Patients 2 year age old severe aplastic anemia develop within 6 month episode hepatitis may eligible study . Participants complete questionnaire provide tissue sample describe . Questionnaires All patient ( another respondent patient ) fill questionnaire include demographic information ( age , gender , race , ethnic group , education level , state residence ) , current symptom , medication , medical history , history possible exposure toxins virus . A second questionnaire , include question related mental health , sexual behavior , alcohol drug use , optional participant age 21 old . These questionnaire design uncover feature hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia possibly reveal common cause disease . Sample Collections - Blood- collect time patient initial evaluation upon enrollment study possibly periodically study .

	<detailed_description>Our laboratory long-standing interest virus affect bone marrow , especially cause bone marrow failure . One specific syndrome , hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia , suggest agent responsible severe sometimes fulminate hepatitis well profound bone marrow failure . This study design collect clinical data , sample patient hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia , order learn clinical feature disease , well collect blood , liver , bone marrow stool sample possible ongoing virological study . For liver bone marrow sample , material obtain liver bone marrow biopsied medical indication , removal liver time transplantation . No additional risk patient result either procedure .</detailed_description>
