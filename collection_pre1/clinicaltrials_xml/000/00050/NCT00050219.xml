	<brief_summary>This study examine role brain chemical dopamine people 's response alcohol consumption . Dopamine think influence whether people strong weak response alcohol pleasurable response . The finding study may shed light people high risk develop problem drinking behavior . Healthy normal volunteer 21 25 year age never serious problem alcohol abuse drug abuse may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , interview smoke drinking behavior . Participants undergo test procedure two separate day , follow : Test Day 1 Upon arrival Clinical Center , participant take breathalyzer test alcohol provide urine sample drug screen . Women also urine pregnancy test . They lie hospital bed two intravenous catheter ( IV line ) place , one arm . One line use collect blood sample test session ; use infuse alcohol bloodstream . The alcohol rapidly increase blood alcohol level 0.06 0.08 gram per deciliter . ( 0.08 g/dL level person charge drive influence alcohol States . ) Before , , infusion , subject ask feeling response alcohol , confusion , elation , level discomfort dizziness , ability concentrate , forth . At 35 60 minute infusion begin , subject take body sway test . This involve stand machine determine alcohol affect sense balance . Subjects relax clinic hour . During time , blood sample collect questionnaire give hourly blood alcohol level go 0.02 g/dL . When alcohol level decline 0.02 g/dL ( usually 3 4 hour infusion ) , subject send home taxi . Test Day 2 Participants take breathalyzer test alcohol provide urine sample drug screen , woman , pregnancy test . Subjects lie hospital bed three IV line insert , one draw blood sample , one infuse alcohol , one give raclopride , radioactive substance use positron emission tomography ( PET ) scanning . For PET , subject lie table scanner mask place head help hold head still scan . After brief scan adjust machine , small amount radioactive water ( O-15 water ) inject IV line series picture take period 1 minute . These image show radioactive water distribute brain , indicate blood flow . After water scan , raclopride give IV line picture brain take next 2 hour . Blood sample collect raclopride scan . During procedure , subject ask question feeling response alcohol early session . After scan , monitor clinic hourly blood test questionnaires blood alcohol concentration decrease 0.02 g/dL send home taxi .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Some person likely develop alcoholism others . Understanding difference person high vs. low risk develop alcoholism could important prevention treatment strategy . Tolerance sedative effect alcohol show young adult predict development alcoholism later life . The basis increase risk unclear . It may persons tolerate alcohol well young adult experience reward effect alcohol ( e.g. , euphoria ) , experience less negative effect alcohol ( e.g. , sedation ) , combination two . Fortunately , brain-imaging tool shed light brain 's reward response mechanism alcohol . Differences reward circuit person experience euphoric response alcohol may help explain people go develop alcoholism others . Both human animal research point toward difference density dopamine receptor striatum alcohol-preferring non alcohol-preferring subject . The following experiment design examine relationship response alcohol , dopamine receptor density striatum , dopamine release response alcohol . We propose classification subject 'low response ' 'high response ' basis level response control alcohol challenge laboratory , use establish method Schuckit et al gather systematic data subject ' response alcohol . Next , baseline level dopamine D2 receptor density mesolimbic reward circuit subject group would assess PET scanner use radioactive dopamine antagonist C-11 raclopride . C-11 raclopride bind D2 receptor , provide signal proportional number D2 receptor present . This allow u measure compare baseline D2 receptor density high low response group . Directly obtain baseline D2 receptor measurement , propose administration control alcohol challenge . Acute alcohol administration cause release dopamine striatum , dislodge portion C-11 raclopride bound D2 receptor . This allow u compare high low response group difference displacement C-11 raclopride induce dopamine release , thereby provide measure dopamine release response alcohol . The data obtain allow u compare response alcohol young adult high vs. low responder . It also permit comparison group term baseline striatal dopamine receptor density striatal dopamine release response alcohol . Results experiment may identify physiological basis increase risk young adult development alcoholism . It may also provide model study relationship response alcohol , risk develop alcoholism , brain reward mechanism .</detailed_description>
