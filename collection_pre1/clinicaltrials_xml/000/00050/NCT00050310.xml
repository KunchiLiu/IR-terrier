	<brief_summary>This study examine pathophysiology immune response anthrax infect exposed individual learn disease symptom , prevention response treatment . In addition , evaluate immune response anthrax vaccine AVA ( Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed ) healthy , non-infected individual . The following individual may eligible study : 1 . People confirm suspected anthrax ( inhalational , cutaneous gastrointestinal , either acute recovering ) ; 2 . People expose anthrax clinical symptom . 3 . Healthy people expose anthrax vaccinate AVA . Those enrolled study undergo follow test procedure . Infected exposed individual : - Symptomatic participant follow clinical procedure medically necessary : - ) blood test cell count , chemistry evidence anthrax bacteria ; - b ) nasal swab test evidence anthrax - c ) chest X-ray ; - ) compute tomography ( CT ) scan ( special X-rays examine lung abdomen ) ; - e ) echocardiogram examine heart - f ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , special image test use magnetic field radio wave examine infect area skin soft tissue patient cutaneous anthrax . - All subject ( without symptom ) follow research procedure : - ) blood test examine immune response anthrax ; - b ) throat swab test evidence anthrax - c ) nasopharyngeal wash test anthrax . Water spray nostril allow drain collection cup ; - ) induce sputum test presence immune response anthrax . A mask saline mist place subject mouth nose , cause subject cough produce sputum lung . The sputum collect cup individual 18 old undergo bronchoscopy , describe . - Participants 18 year age old may follow optional research procedure : - ) leukapheresis plasmapheresis ( see description non-infected , vaccinated individual ) ; - b ) lymph node biopsy . A sample lymph node tissue surgically remove local anesthetic ; - c ) bronchoalveolar lavage . This 15- 30-minute procedure do intensive care unit . The mouth , nasal passage , throat airway numb lidocaine thin flexible tube pass nose lung airway . Samples cell secretion obtain rinse ( lavage ) airways salt water . The fluid analyzed infection , inflammatory cell inflammatory chemical . All infect exposed individual periodic medical history physical exam evaluation offer treatment prophylaxis ( treatment prevent infection ) antibiotic , accord guideline Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) . Patients monitor least 24 month antibiotic treatment , long circumstance warrant . Non-infected , vaccinated individual 1. medical history physical examination 2. blood test -- 10 50 ml ( 2-10 teaspoon ) blood drawn time , 450 ml take 6-week period . Based blood test result , optional research procedure may request 3. leukapheresis collect white blood cell plasmapheresis collect plasma ( liquid part blood ) . For procedure , blood collect needle place arm vein . The blood flow special machine separate component spin . The desired component ( white cell plasma ) remove rest blood return body needle second needle arm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The intentional use Bacillus anthracis 2001 bioterrorism weapon fatal consequence renew interest past epidemiological animal research pathogenesis pose new dilemmas diagnosis treatment . Cases October 2001 US outbreak theoretically expose via one dispersal method : aerosolization Ames strain spore . While develop cutaneous anthrax form , others sustain serious inhalational disease . Inhaled spore know travel alveolar macrophage onto mediastinal lymph node germination bacterium form toxin release think occur . Infective dose , significance dormant spores long-term antibiotic therapy , spectrum disease even precise cause death remain unknown . This observational , prospective natural history study develop 2001 outbreak set follow participant time exposure post-recovery ( great ten year ) . Healthy vaccinate participant include evaluate serum titer cell marker relation dose frequency AVA vaccine .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects age , include pregnant woman , eligible inclusion meet one five criterion list , hemodynamically clinically stable , agree store sample . 1 . Inhalation Anthrax ( acute recover infection ) CONFIRMED : nonspecific febrile illness follow sepsis and/or respiratory failure AND B anthracis isolation ( via culture ) site OR 2 supportive lab test OR SUSPECTED : nonspecific febrile illness follow sepsis and/or respiratory failure alternative diagnosis AND one supportive lab test OR direct epidemiological link confirm environmental exposure 2 . Cutaneous Anthrax ( acute recover infection ) CONFIRMED : characteristic lesion ( papule &gt; vesicular &gt; depress black eschar plus minus edema , erythema , necrosis ulceration ) AND B anthracis isolation ( culture ) site OR 2 supportive lab test SUSPECTED : Characteristic lesion alternative diagnosis AND one supportive lab test OR direct epidemiological link confirm environmental exposure 3 . Gastrointestinal Anthrax ( acute recover infection ) CONFIRMED : Severe abdominal pain often associate bloody vomiting/diarrhea follow fever/septicemia AND B anthracis isolation ( culture ) site OR 2 supportive lab test SUSPECTED : Severe abdominal pain often associate bloody vomiting/diarrhea follow fever/septicemia alternative diagnosis AND 1 supportive lab test OR direct epidemiological link confirm environmental exposure These definition subsequently update CDC 2010 accept clinically compatible symptom plus one following : positive culture , positive immunohistochemical stain antigen , 4fold increase antiPA IgG positive document exposure detection DNA via PCR ( 26 ) . 4 . Exposed individual clinically asymptomatic . 5 . Past imminent vaccination healthy ( nonanthrax expose ) . 6 . Hemodynamically clinically stable time evaluation NIH . Hemodynamically : stable vital sign Clinically : obvious sign disease progression ( e.g . worsen pleural effusion increase cutaneous edema ) acute/newly recovered patient must receive standard antimicrobial therapy 7 . Participant agrees store sample . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Inability sign inform consent lack designate Health Power Attorney .</criteria>
