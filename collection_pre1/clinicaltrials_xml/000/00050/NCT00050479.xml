	<brief_summary>This study compare side effect two laser treatment diabetic macular edema , common condition patient diabetes . In macular edema , blood vessel retina , thin layer tissue line back eye become leaky retina swell . The macula , center part retina responsible fine vision may also swell , cause vision loss . Traditional laser treatment ( argon blue green yellow ) macular swell , edema , cause scar expand possibly lead loss vision . Studies different type laser ( diode ) may less damage . The result study side effect treatment use design large study effectiveness . This study also examine whether celecoxib ( CelebrexÂ® ( Registered Trademark ) ) , anti-arthritis drug reduces inflammation swell , reduce inflammation swell retina . Patients elevate cholesterol level invite participate cholesterol reduction part study compare normal-pace cholesterol reduction accelerate reduction . Patients 18 year age old type 1 type 2 diabetes macular edema require laser treatment may eligible study . Candidates screen follow test procedure : - Medical history : review past medical condition treatment . - Physical examination : measure vital sign ( pulse , blood pressure , temperature , breathe rate ) examine head neck , heart , lung , abdomen , arm legs . - Eye examination : assess visual acuity ( eye chart test ) examine pupil , lens , retina , eye movement . The pupil dilate drops examination . - Blood test : measure cholesterol , blood clotting time , hemoglobin A1C ( measure diabetes control ) , evaluate liver kidney function . - Eye photography : help evaluate status retina change may occur future . Special photographs inside eye take use camera flash bright light eye . From 2 20 picture may take , depend eye condition . - Fluorescein angiography : evaluate eye 's blood vessel . A yellow dye inject arm vein travel blood vessel eye . Pictures retina take use camera flash blue light eye . The picture show dye leak vessel retina , indicate possible blood vessel abnormality . Participants randomly assign take celecoxib placebo ( inactive , look-alike pill ) . Participants elevate cholesterol level may return brief visit 1 month . All patient return follow-up visit 3 , 6 , 12 month . Patients require laser treatment randomly assign one two laser treatment . For procedure , eye drop put eye numb surface contact lens place eye laser beam application . Several visit may require additional laser treatment . The maximum number treatment depend well treatment work . Patients respond well study medication may receive laser treatment . After first year , patient follow every 6 month either patient return 3-year visit , last enrol patient return 1-year visit , patient request leave study . During follow-up visit , patient ' response treatment evaluate repeat test several screen exam .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize pilot study important first step plan large multi-center clinical trial evaluate medical laser approach could improve visual outcome patient diabetic retinopathy . This study provide preliminary safety data therapy well allow assessment performance ocular outcome study design use subsequent trial . If safety concern , result pilot helpful design large multicenter clinical trial provide data estimate expect treatment effect . Using factorial design , study compare ( 1 ) diode ( micropulse ) laser photocoagulation mild ETDRS style focal photocoagulation , ( 2 ) treatment COX-2 inhibitor ( celecoxib ) , placebo prior follow laser photocoagulation . The primary outcome visual acuity drop increase 15 letter baseline year 3 . The secondary outcome significant reduction macular edema , define 50 % reduction thickening measure Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) , two step reduction macular thickness compare standard stereoscopic fundus photograph , 50 % reduction area leakage measure fluorescein angiography . The University Wisconsin Fundus Photography Reading Center grade OCT , photograph , angiograms mask treatment assignment . Other secondary outcome include time first require laser treatment , change visual acuity throughout study , number laser treatment require course study . In addition , adverse event abnormal laboratory value collect tabulate . Specific objective regard safety efficacy follow : Safety Is risk visual loss patient clinically significant diabetic macular edema potentially different across treatment group ? Preliminary Assessment Potential Outcomes Is evidence treatment combination could effective reduce retinal thickening ? Is evidence celecoxib may inhibit induce retinal thickening ? What estimate treatment effect vision ? Is number laser treatment require achieve reduction retinal thickening similar across treatment group ? The tertiary objective study examine effect dramatically reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol patient diabetic macular edema elevate serum lipid level . Change vision retinal thickness compare across three group ; ( 1 ) patient without elevated serum lipid baseline , ( 2 ) patient elevate lipid level baseline receive standard care treatment , ( 3 ) patient elevate lipid level baseline aggressively treat pharmacologically .</detailed_description>

Participants clinically significant macular edema least one eye require laser treatment , opinion Investigator , delay least 3 month . 3 . Best correct visual acuity 20/400 good measure ETDRS chart eye clinically significant macular edema ; eye consider study eye . If eye clinically significant macular edema best correct visual acuity great equal 20/400 , right eye consider study eye , however , eye eligible treatment . 4 . May proliferative diabetic retinopathy scatter photocoagulation must perform four month ago . 5 . Ocular medium sufficiently clear allow quality fundus photography . 6 . If aphakic pseudophakic , lens removal must occur least 6 month prior enrollment . 7 . Documented hemoglobin A1C 12 % less within one month baseline . 8 .
