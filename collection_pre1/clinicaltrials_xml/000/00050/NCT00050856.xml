	<brief_summary>This study determine safety tolerability Fuzeon ( enfuvirtide ) use together treatment HIV infection patient advance HIV disease . Fuzeon antiretroviral drug . Unlike antiretrovirals , however , work virus already cell , Fuzeon prevent virus get healthy cell . Patients 18 year age old advance HIV-1 infection , respond approve antiretroviral therapy , may eligible study . Candidates must CD4 lymphocyte count le 100 cells/mm3 viral load great 10,000 copies/mL . They screen medical history , physical examination , blood test , may also electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , chest x-ray urine test . Patients enrol study re-examined additional blood test begin treatment Fuzeon . They teach self-inject medicine skin take two dos daily ( less 1/4 teaspoon ) , 12 hour apart . After first treatment , participant follow-up visit week 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , every 12 week , necessary , 12 week drug become commercially available . Visits may schedule often problem arises . During follow-up visit , patient blood drawn , blood pressure , pulse rate temperature check . They also report drug side effect experience . Patients may continue take Fuzeon long benefit therapy experience severe side effect treatment . The drug provide participant 12 week sell United States .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fuzeon ( Enfuvirtide ) Early Access Program Patients With HIV-1 Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over last year , unprecedented decrease mortality morbidity associate AIDS achieve attribute use highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) consist three different class drug : Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) , protease inhibitor ( PIs ) , non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTIs ) . However , durability viral suppression often limited treatment combination non-fully suppressive antiretroviral agent . Heavily pretreated patient often possess multiple mutation reverse transcriptase protease gene result multi-drug resistance . Thus , pharmacological agent effective alternate point virus replication cycle would make valuable addition anti-HIV armamentarium . T-20 , enfuvirtide , first drug develop specifically inhibits function gp41 transmembrane glycoprotein HIV-1 . The objective study ass safety tolerability Fuzeon ( Enfuvirtide ) patient limited current commercially available antiretroviral agent agent available via early access compassionate use program per judgment investigator patient advance disease need therapy . This study multicenter , open-label , single-arm , safety study . Each patient receive enfuvirtide 90 mg ( deliverable dose ) via subcutaneous injection twice daily food , combination additional antiretroviral agent . Subjects continue receive enfuvirtide 12 week commercial availability enfuvirtide United States . Laboratory testing , CD4+lymphocyte count , HIV-1 viral load monitor regular continual basis . The main outcome measure one safety tolerability : serious adverse event ( include death , serious AIDS defining event , discontinuation reason ) , injection reconstitution fatigue .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : To eligible trial , patient must fulfill inclusion criterion list : 1 . Male female HIV1 infect adult adolescent ( great equal 16 year age ) . 2 . CD4 lymphocyte count less equal 100 cells/mm ( 3 ) HIV1 RNA viral load great equal 10,000 copies/mL HAART ( late available measurement must within last 90 day ) . 3 . Patients must limit current commercially available antiretroviral agent agent available via Early Access Compassionate Use Programs per judgment investigator OR patient advanced disease need define prior document drug resistance document evidence great 6 month prior experience three class ARV 's . 4 . Patients must able willing provide write informed consent ( patient less 18 year age , parent legal guardian must also sign Informed Consent Form ) . 5 . Women childbearing potential must document negative pregnancy test baseline ensure two reliable form contraception use , include barrier method , duration study , 90 day last dose study medication . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients meet follow exclusion criterion eligible participation trial : 1 . Female patient pregnant , breastfeeding , plan become pregnant breastfeed study . 2 . Any current clinical laboratory parameter ACTG grade 4 . Asymptomatic grade 4 abnormality permit , discretion investigator , potential benefit treatment outweigh potential risk . 3 . Evidence ongoing alcohol and/or drug substance abuse , judgment investigator , would result patient unreliable fulfilling condition protocol . 4 . Prior nonadherence antiretroviral treatment regimen , judgment investigator , result patient 's fail prior regimen would likely result patient unreliable fulfilling condition protocol . 5 . Inability selfinject Fuzeon ( enfuvirtide ) indicate protocol , unless reliable caregiver willing , able , available provide service continuous basis duration study . 6 . Evidence active , untreated opportunistic infection , intercurrent illness , drug toxicity condition , judgment investigator , patient would able continue take prescribed antiretroviral regimen .</criteria>
