	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study determine safety injection prepare donor blood cell fuse patient 's tumor cell use treat advance ( Stage IV ) kidney cancer ( renal cell carcinoma RCC ) . The study also explore effect injection size tumor response patient 's immune system follow administration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety/Efficacy Vaccine Prepared From Dendritic Cells Combined With Tumor Cells Treat Advanced Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 30,000 new case kidney cancer diagnose U.S. 2002 , renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) commonly diagnose type . For patient locally advance metastatic disease , treatment option extremely limited additional option warrant . Although RCC generally consider resistant chemotherapy , spontaneous regression patient metastatic disease lead research involve immune-mediated therapeutic approach . Clinical response observe additional immune-modulating therapeutic study . Several approach use dendritic cell ( DCs ) , know potent antigen present cell . An antigen protein , show immune system right way , trigger cell immune system recognize , remember eliminate cell also display specific antigen . The cancerous cell tumor present antigen way body 's immune system often fail recognize eliminate . It theorize DCs fuse tumor cell result fused cell capable present tumor antigen enhance manner , thus allow body 's immune system recognize tumor antigen cancer . If occurs , patient 's immune system may specifically stimulate , produce clinically meaningful immune response tumor . In study DCs produce healthy volunteer donor ( allogeneic DCs ) fuse patient 's tumor cell ( autologous tumor cell ) , use electrical current . The fused dendritic/tumor cell return patient series vaccine , six week apart . The purpose trial determine whether fuse autologous tumor allogeneic DCs , limit associate toxicity , present tumor antigen way stimulate immune response also show evidence tumor response .</detailed_description>
