	<brief_summary>This study design evaluate ability growth hormone ( GH , also know somatropin ) increase CD4+ cell count patient take anti-HIV drug . The study target toward patient low level HIV continue low CD4+ cell count .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Administration Growth Hormone Increase CD4+ Count Patients Taking Anti-HIV Drugs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After initiation HAART , many HIV infect patient significant improvement CD4+ level . However , patient continue low CD4+ count ( &lt; 350 cells/mm3 ) despite adequate viral suppression . The purpose study determine whether administration GH increase naïve CD4+ production . Further , study ass whether increase naïve CD4+ production lead increase antigen-specific CD4+ CD8+ T cell . Patients enrol study randomize one two group . Patients group continue present HAART regimen duration study . Group A patient receive daily subcutaneous injection GH 48 week . Group B participant receive additional therapy 24 week , receive daily subcutaneous GH injection Weeks 24-28 study . Both group receive immunocyanin ( keyhole-limpet hemocyanin ) injection Weeks 16 20 hepatitis A vaccination Weeks 40 44 . At conclusion Week 48 , patient discontinue GH therapy maintain HAART regimen . Patients follow additional 24 week . Patients may ask participate substudy measure size thymus people take GH . Patients substudy noncontrast CT scan chest begin GH therapy 24 week GH therapy .</detailed_description>
