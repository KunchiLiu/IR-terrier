	<brief_summary>This study investigate cause hereditary leiomyomatosis renal ( kidney ) cell cancer , HLRCC , disease relate development kidney tumor . Leiomyomas benign ( non-cancerous ) tumor arise smooth muscle . HLRCC cause various health problem . Some people develop red bump skin painful time . Some woman HLRCC develop leiomyomas uterus . In family , people HLRCC develop kidney tumor . This study try determine : - What gene change ( mutation ) cause HLRCC - What kind kidney tumor develop HLRCC grow - What chance person HLRCC develop kidney tumor People known suspect HLRCC ( family member age ) may eligible study . This include people family one member skin leiomyoma kidney cancer ; skin leiomyoma uterine leiomyoma ; multiple skin leiomyoma ; kidney cancer uterine leiomyoma , kidney cancer consistent HLRCC , include , limited , collect duct papillary , type II . Candidates screen physical examination , family history , , affect family member , review medical record , include pathology slide compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . Participants undergo test procedure may include follow : - Review medical record , x-ray , tissue slide - Physical examination family history - Skin examination - Gynecological examination woman - Interviews cancer doctor , cancer nurse , kidney surgeon , genetic counselor - Blood test : 1 . Genetic research identify gene responsible HLRCC 2 . Evaluation liver , kidney , heart , pancreas , thyroid function 3 . Complete blood count clot profile 4 . Pregnancy test pre-menopausal woman 5 . PSA test prostate cancer men age 40 - CT MRI scan ( participant 15 year age old ) - Skin biopsy ( surgical removal small sample skin tissue ) - Cheek swab mouth rinse collect cell genetic analysis - Medical photograph lesion - Questionnaire When test complete , participant discuss result doctor possibly genetic nurse genetic counselor . The genetic finding reveal participant mean implication may yet understand . Participants may ask return NIH every 3 month every 3 year , depend condition , follow-up examination test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hereditary Leiomyomatosis Renal Cell Cancer - Study Genetic Cause Predisposition Renal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Hereditary Leiomyomatosis Renal Cell Cancer ( HLRCC ) rare autosomal dominantly inherit disorder confers susceptibility develop cutaneous uterine leiomyomas renal cell carcinoma . - HLRCC cause mutation Krebs cycle enzyme , fumarate hydratase localize chromosome 1q42.3-q43 . Objectives : - Define risk develop renal cancer , cutaneous leiomyoma uterine leiomyoma hereditary cancer syndrome - Define type characteristic ( include pattern growth ) renal cancer associate HLRCC . - Determine incidence characteristic HLRCC-associated fumarate hydratase gene mutation . - Determine genotype/phenotype correlation . - Determine gene cause HLRCC . Eligibility : -An individual family one family member : - Cutaneous leiomyoma kidney cancer . - Cutaneous leiomyoma uterine leiomyoma . - Multiple cutaneous leiomyoma . - Kidney cancer uterine leiomyomata . - Renal tumor histology consistent HLRCC include , limited : Collecting Duct and/ Papillary , Type II . Design : - These rare family recruit genetically confirm diagnosis , determine size location renal tumor , size presentation , growth rate metastatic potential renal tumor . - Genetic testing offer gain appreciation effect mutation relative activity various germline somatic mutation . - We determine relationship mutation disease phenotype .</detailed_description>
