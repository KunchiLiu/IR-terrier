	<brief_summary>This preliminary study evaluate possible use transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , together exercise , rehabilitation chronic stroke patient . It identify optimum stimulation setting ( within limit current safety guideline ) use late rehabilitation study confirm safety procedure setting . Some previous study use TMS treat movement disorder Parkinson 's disease show improvement motor function ; others . The result study may provide information help researcher design good rehabilitation treatment stroke . Stroke patient residual arm function history seizure may eligible study . The stroke must occur least 6 month entry study must affect one side brain . For TMS procedure , subject seat comfortable chair hand place pillow lap . An insulated wire coil place scalp . A brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulates outer part brain , call cortex . This may cause muscle , hand arm twitching coil near part brain control movement , may affect movement reflexes . Subjects ask make movement , simple task , tense muscle . Metal electrodes tap skin muscle computer record electrical activity hand arm muscle activate stimulation . The test last 2-3 hour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stroke survivor often leave permanent physical mental disability create major social economic burden . Many patient receive different therapy attempt improve independence quality life . However , current strategy focus acute stage stroke limited influence improve stroke outcome . One main problem patient suffer stroke difficulty appropriately use hand contralateral lesioned hemisphere ; date successful mean improve hand function chronic stage stroke . This protocol attempt address problem . A promising technique repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) , far , produced effect motor function movement disorder like Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . We hypothesize rTMS beneficial effect motor function chronic stroke patient . Specifically , propose look effect 20 25 Hz stimulation since type stimulation show increase excitability cerebral cortex . The purpose protocol investigate effect repetitive transcranial stimulation ( rTMS ) motor cortex chronic stroke patient motor function . Four different stimulation parameter within limit current safety guideline use . We plan determine ; 1 ) rTMS stimulation parameter induce cortex excitability , 2 ) whether improvement hand motor function rTMS , 3 ) apply stimulation parameter safe chronic stroke patient . The optimal parameter subsequently propose use experimental protocol rehabilitation .</detailed_description>
