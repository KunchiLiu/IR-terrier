Adequately diagnose treat breast cancer define : Patients breast cancer whose tumor remove appropriate surgical procedure mastectomy breast conserving surgery receive appropriate additional local treatment radiotherapy accord best practice . Patients must end local treatment without evidence local residual disease . Patients must clinical radiological evidence distant metastasis . 4 . Hormone receptor positive define : ER and/or PR great equal to1 0 fmol/mg cytosol protein ; great equal 10 % tumor cell positive immunohistochemical evaluation . 5 . Patients baseline lumbar spine total hip BMD Tscore 2.0 SD eligible . 6 . Patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy eligible participation . Adjuvant chemotherapy must complete prior randomization . 7 . The date randomization must follow : 12 week completion surgery ; 12 week completion adjuvant chemotherapy ; 12 week completion surgery radiation therapy ; however patient may randomize receive radiation therapy decision Investigator 's discretion . 12 week completion chemotherapy radiation therapy ; however , patient may randomize receive radiation therapy decision Investigator 's discretion . 8 .
