	<brief_summary>This pilot study examine usefulness new instrument call Dynamic Light Scattering ( DLS ) device document monitoring change cornea , front part eye contact lenses place . The DLS device use low-intensity laser similar use supermarket checkout measure cloudiness cornea . The result study may lead investigation use DLS discover cause corneal cloud develop treatment prevent . Healthy volunteer patient corneal cloud opacification 18 year age old may eligible study . Participants standard eye examination , include check visual acuity eye pressure . The retina also examine photograph cornea may take . For DLS test , subject sits front device look yellow-green target cloudiness cornea measure . Subjects test four time . The entire procedure take less 30 minute .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Corneal disease injury lead cause visit eye care clinic US today . These disease also painful eye disorder . Two important area research cornea 1 ) explore understand molecular basis corneal transparency 2 ) analyze molecular nature corneal inflammation wound heal . We develop new clinical device understand molecular change occur lens , call Dynamic Light Scattering ( DLS ) device . Studies show potential detection early change occur cataract , also show good test retest reproducibility system . We would like apply technique study change occur corneal opacification . In pilot project , would like study normal cornea young old person ( volunteer ) well cloudy , opaque cornea . This allow u determine useful data obtain , , lead study various corneal disorder cause trauma , infection , dystrophy , well cause systemic inherited disorder .</detailed_description>
