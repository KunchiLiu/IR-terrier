	<brief_summary>This study evaluate ability drug rofecoxib bupivacaine prevent pain follow third molar ( wisdom tooth ) extraction . Rofecoxib approve treat pain arthritis menstrual cramp . Bupivacaine local anesthetic similar lidocaine , long act . Healthy normal volunteer 16 35 year age general good health require extraction two low wisdom teeth may eligible study . Participants two low wisdom teeth extract , biopsy ( removal small piece tissue ) take inside cheek around area behind one extraction sit . Ninety minute surgery , patient take dose either rofecoxib , placebo ( pill active ingredient ) mouth . Just surgery , receive injection either lidocaine bupivacaine numb mouth sedative call midazolam ( VersedÂ® ( Registered Trademark ) ) arm vein cause drowsiness . After surgery , small piece tube place one two extraction site . Samples collect tubing measure chemical involve pain inflammation . Patients remain clinic 4 hour surgery monitor pain drug side effect anesthetic wear . During time , complete pain questionnaire every 20 minute . ( Patients whose pain unrelieved hour surgery may request receive acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) codeine . ) The tube remove discharge pain medicine ( Tylenol , codeine study drug ) form record pain rating . They give detailed instruction take medicine record information pain diary . Patients return clinic 48 hour surgery pain diary pain reliever . At visit , another biopsy take local anesthetic ( lidocaine ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Central sensitization refers persistent post-injury change central nervous system result great pain sensitivity . The concept preemptive analgesia define treatment prevents establishment central sensitization provide analgesic coverage perioperative period surgery . Previous acute pain study use oral surgery model show suppression postoperative pain , intra-operative nociceptive barrage , diminishes development sensitization 24 48 hour post-surgery . During intermediate postoperative period , nociceptive input surgical insult inflammation lead central sensitization , yet relative contribution clearly evaluate . The propose study design evaluate relative impact surgical insult subsequent inflammation postoperative pain . The relative contribution nociceptive process provide basis postoperative pain management development preemptive strategy . All subject ( N = 136 ) healthy volunteer schedule third molar extraction . Using double-blinded , randomize , parallel study design , subject randomize four group . All patient receive local anesthesia injection preoperatively ( either 2 % lidocaine 0.5 % bupivacaine ) manage surgical pain conjunction preemptive medication ( either 50 mg rofecoxib placebo ) control postoperative inflammation . The first dose preemptive medication take mouth 90 minute prior conscious sedation extraction , later self-administered day next 48 hour . The analgesic effect drug assess clinic every 20 minute first four hour extraction , self-assessed 24 , 48 hour surgery use two pain intensity assessment instrument : category scale visual analog scale ( VAS ) . Microdialysis perform sample collection concurrent pain report immediate postoperative period four hour . Two biopsy perform : preoperatively , postoperatively 48 hour . The combination regimen bupivacaine rofecoxib predict maximally suppress onset intensity postoperative dental pain great extent group blockade nociceptive input surgery inflammation . It hypothesize preemptive treatment maximally inhibit development central sensitization follow tissue injury manifest hyperalgesia later time point . It also hypothesize administration rofecoxib ( cyclooxygenase-2 selective anti-inflammatory medication ) reduce post-surgical pain experience late time point great extent suppression intra-operative nociceptive barrage alone ( bupivacaine ) , suggest suppression inflammation play pivotal role attenuate nociception due tissue injury diminish central sensitization .</detailed_description>
