	<brief_summary>This study evaluate child mastocytosis , disease excessive mast cell tissue skin bone marrow , identify cause disease describe course . Mast cell release chemical cause itching , blister , flushing , bone pain , abdominal pain . Usually , mastocytosis child involve skin limited duration . This study , however , focus child severe disease closely resemble adult-onset mastocytosis . Patients 21 year age childhood-onset mastocytosis may eligible study . Candidates must one follow abnormality , indicate severe disease : enlarge liver spleen ; diffuse skin involvement ; history gastrointestinal bleeding peptic ulcer ; bone marrow biopsy abnormal mast cell either number shape ; elevate blood level enzyme tryptase ; abnormal hemoglobin , white blood cell , platelet , clot factor . Participants medical history physical examination ; various blood test , include study identify genetic change important growth , development , function human mast cell ; bone marrow aspiration biopsy . For bone marrow procedure , skin hipbone outer surface bone numbed injection local anesthesia . Then , special needle insert hipbone 2 tablespoon bone marrow draw syringe . Another needle insert first needle collect small piece bone marrow . Pain manage accord individual patient need . Additional procedure , gastroenterology consultation , colonoscopy examine colon , computerize axial tomography ( CT ) ultrasound abdomen assess liver spleen , may do medically indicate . Standard medical treatment , include antihistamine itch steroid abdominal cramp diarrhea , recommend appropriate . Patients biologic parent may also enrol provide blood sample genetic analysis bone marrow aspirate biopsy clinical research purpose . Patients return NIH year follow-up evaluation disease stable 5-year study end .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mastocytosis infant child unusual disease characterize excess mast cell tissue . In pediatric onset mastocytosis , disease usually localize skin disease consider limited duration . However , subset child appear develop clinical picture resemble observed adult adult-onset disease . This study focus child severe mastocytosis attempt define pathogenesis , focus mutation polymorphisms gene regulate mast cell proliferation survival determine might contribute disease pattern . If severe pediatric-onset disease fit within exist classification , new criterion diagnosis must propose pediatric age group . This study examine child young adult age birth 21 year pediatric-onset disease previously enrol NIAID mastocytosis protocol , result physician referral , disease consistent adult-onset disease parameter associate increased morbidity . The evaluation may include serum tryptase , blood count , bone marrow biopsy aspirate , morphology mutational analysis . Subjects may ask return 12-24 month assessment . If relevant mutation effect mast cell growth function identify , mutation seek biologic parent appropriate , mutation believe germ line ( somatic ) mutation . This study aid understanding characteristic severe mastocytosis pediatric age group .</detailed_description>
