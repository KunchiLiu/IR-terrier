	<brief_title>Acetyl-L-Carnitine Treatment NRTI-Associated Peripheral Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Distal symmetric peripheral neuropathy ( DSPN ) frequent neurologic complication HIV infection treatment . NRTIs , particularly dideoxy-NRTIs , represent significant risk factor develop neuropathy . To date , effective treatment DSPN . Studies nonneuronal tissue indicate beneficial effect ALC HIV-1 seropositive individual , role ALC level patient DSPN unclear . Despite conflict data , carnitine derivative still commonly use . Patients screen visit visit entry Weeks 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 . Patients require fast ( food drink except water ) 4-12 hour screen visit , entry visit , Weeks 12 24 . Targeted physical examination , blood chemistry , liver function test , HIV-1 RNA , CD4/CD8 cell count , hematology , lactate assessment do . Patients also small skin biopsy entry Week 24 . Patients begin 1 tablet ALC twice daily escalate dosage target dose 3 tablet daily . They remain 3-tablet dose maximum tolerate dose duration study ( 24 week ) .</detailed_description>
