	<brief_summary>This study test safety effectiveness drug Rituximab treat nerve disease call MGUS ( also know neuropathy anti-MAG antibody ) . Patients MGUS abnormal protein call monoclonal IgM immunoglobulin attack myelin sheath ( protective coating ) nerve , cause function properly . The disease affect nerve legs arm , patient numbness , tingle , muscle weakness , unsteady gait . There adequate treatment . Immunosuppressive drug human immunoglobulin infusion produce mild transient improvement , benefit therapy significant . The abnormal immunoglobulin protein MGUS produce white cell call B lymphocyte . Rituximab approve treat B cell lymphoma . Also , drug show promise recent study patient demyelinate neuropathy associate production antibody B lymphocyte direct certain nerve protein . Although number patient treat Rituximab small , drug well tolerate caused significant improvement several patient . Patients 25 year age old MGUS may eligible 2-year study . Candidates screen medical history , physical neurological examination , blood test . Participants randomly assign receive intravenous ( vein ) infusion either Rituximab placebo ( solution look like Rituximab active ingredient ) week 4 consecutive week . In addition , undergo follow test procedure : - Monthly follow-up visit follow Rituximab treatment repeat physical neurological examination , blood test , muscle strength measurement , review sign symptom . - Two session lymphapheresis , one beginning study one year later-to collect lymphocyte . For procedure , whole blood drawn needle arm vein , much like donate unit blood . The blood flow catheter ( plastic tube ) cell separate machine , white blood cell extract remove . The red cell plasma return body needle arm . The procedure take 60 90 minute . - Electrophysiologic study ( electromyography nerve conduction test ) do begin study one year later . For electromyography , small needle inserted muscle patient ask relax contract muscle . The electrical activity muscle cell record analyzed computer . For nerve conduction testing , nerve stimulate small wire electrode attach skin response record analyze . If study indicate Rituximab beneficial MGUS , patient assign receive placebo trial offer treatment Rituximab ( four weekly infusion ) end study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study examine safety , tolerability , efficacy humanize monoclonal antibody Rituximab induce clinical serological remission patient IgM-anti-glycoconjugate antibody-mediated demyelinating neuropathy . Rituximab monoclonal antibody specific common B cell antigen CD20 . Its administration deplete pre-B mature B lymphocytes without alter neutrophil hematopoietic stem cell . In human indolent B cell lymphoma , Rituximab safely administer , well tolerate , promote selective B cell depletion lower serum IgM level . Preliminary experience patient demyelinate polyneuropathy IgM-anti-glycolipid antibody show Rituximab beneficial improve patient 's symptom reduce anti IgM antibody level . In present study examine placebo randomize trial efficacy Rituximab patient polyneuropathy related IgM-anti-glycolipid antibody . Twenty-six patient randomize receive placebo Rituximab give four weekly intravenous infusion 375 mg/M ( 2 ) . The primary outcome base change monthly measurement neuropathy score . The fine specificity IgM antibodies various glycoconjugates difference affinity bind various antigen neural membrane explore treatment . It anticipate study : ) provide new , immune-based target-oriented therapy patient neuropathy b ) examine pathogenic role antibody cause disease .</detailed_description>
