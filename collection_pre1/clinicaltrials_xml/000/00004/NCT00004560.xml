	<brief_summary>To measure survival hospital discharge patient out-of-hospital cardiac arrest community unit ( e.g. , apartment office building , gated community , sport venue , senior center , shop mall ) serve trained non-medical responder use automated external defibrillator ( AEDs ) , approach call Public Access Defibrillation , compare unit receive traditional optimum community standard care ( i.e. , rescuer train recognize cardiac emergency , call 911 , initiate CPR ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Sudden out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OOH-CA ) remain significant cause death , spite recent decline overall mortality cardiovascular disease . Existing method emergency resuscitation inadequate due time delay inherent transport train responder defibrillation capability side OOH-CA victim . Existing Emergency Medical Services ( EMS ) system typically combine paramedic Emergency Medical Technician ( EMT ) service level community involvement , bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) training . Some community include automated external defibrillator ( AEDs ) isolate site mobile police fire vehicle . Such approach typically vary effectiveness , incremental improvement effectiveness see community organize integrate service exist EMS system . However , optimal improvement survival sudden OOH-CA may require program utilizes volunteer non-medical responder ( may traditional duty respond emergency ) successfully train use AEDs . A comprehensive , integrate community approach treatment AEDs would community unit serve volunteer non-medical responder quickly identify treat patient OOH-CA . Such approach term Public Access Defibrillation ( PAD ) . Some observational study suggest support PAD approach . These study target traditional public safety responder police firefighter layperson leadership position train regularly call upon take command emergency ( e.g. , airline flight attendant , security officer Las Vegas casino ) . Other study , randomize observational , trainees spouse family member at-risk patient , suggest layperson effectively utilize AEDs set OOH-CA , even extensive training . This study differs conduct previously focus intermediate group , namely , volunteer non-medical responder ( e.g. , merchant , bank teller , building superintendent , co-worker ) . This study provide result may help develop informed public policy regard use AEDs volunteer non-medical person . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This study comprehensive , integrate community approach volunteer non-medical responder ( lay volunteer without traditional responsibility take charge medical emergency primary job description ) train use automate external defibrillator ( AEDs ) . This approach call Public Access Defibrillation ( PAD ) . The hypothesis investigate PAD would significantly increase survival out-of-hospital cardiac arrest reduce time interval collapse defibrillation . The specific aim randomize , control trial measure survival hospital discharge follow out-of-hospital cardiac arrest community unit train equipped provide public access defibrillation addition optimal standard care , compare community unit train provide optimal standard care ( recognition out-of-hospital cardiac arrest , 911 access , cardiopulmonary resuscitation ) . Secondary aim include comparison use Utstein criterion ( Annals Emergency Medicine 1991 ; 20:861-74 ) , neurological status , quality life , cost , cost-effectiveness two group . Participating research site identify 1,000 unit ( e.g. , public area , gate community , shopping mall , airport terminal , casino , business park ) within service area anticipate least 0.6 treatable out-of-hospital cardiac arrest within 15 month period . Each unit randomize serve either intervention control group , comparative episode data collect 15 month period follow short preliminary data collection period ( approximately 2 month evaluate ability site capture event data ) training . Within site , unit sub-randomized retrain strategy . Performance retraining monitor , strategy modify indicated . Volunteer non-medical responder ( e.g. , office staff , bank teller , merchant , neighborhood volunteer ) intervention control group train provide optimal standard care : ( ) recognize out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ; ( b ) access 911 equivalent ; , ( c ) administer CPR . Volunteers intervention group also teach use AED promptly await arrival first public safety emergency medical team . The criterion number location train volunteer device maximum 3-minute `` walk '' AED patient 's side . Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victim two group compare 15 month intervention period respect : ( ) survival hospital discharge ( primary outcome ) ; ( b ) neurological status ; ( c ) quality life ; , ( ) resource use/costs . The incremental cost-effectiveness volunteer non-medical responder defibrillation calculate .</detailed_description>
