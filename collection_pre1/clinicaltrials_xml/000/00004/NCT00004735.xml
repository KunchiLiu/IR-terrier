	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine number newly form CD4 cell child take anti-HIV drug . The study also evaluate effectiveness new CD4 cell produce immune response hepatitis A tetanus toxoid vaccination . Study hypothesis : 1 ) Immunologic reconstitution individual less 15 % CD4 cell may may associate functional activity . 2 ) The functional immunologic response recall newly experience antigen may different . 3 ) The functional response antigen deliver vaccine format may function CD4 level , viral load , .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HIV damage immune system infect CD4 cell , white blood cell help fight infection protect body disease . As CD4 cell die , immune system become weak . Taking anti-HIV drug slow ability virus multiply kill CD4 cell . HIV infect child take anti-HIV drug significant inhibition HIV growth significant increase CD4 cell count . It known extent CD4 count increase HIV infect child translate functional immune recovery . HIV infect child typically demonstrate poor serological response routine childhood immunization . Participants either begin HAART make change current HAART regimens study entry within 2 week prior study entry . All participant viral load test begin change HAART regimens . Participants second viral load test 4 week . Only participants acceptable decrease viral load continue study . Participants randomly assign one two group . Participants Group 1 receive tetanus toxoid immunization ( know DTaP , DT-pediatric , Td ) Weeks 8 , 16 , 24 hepatitis A vaccination Weeks 32 , 40 , 48 . Participants Group 2 receive hepatitis A vaccination Weeks 8 , 16 , 24 tetanus toxoid immunization Weeks 32 , 40 , 48 . Participants physical exam blood test study entry Weeks 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 24 , 28 , 32 , 36 , 40 , 48 , 52 , 76 , 100 . As May 2005 , participant option receive additional hepatitis A vaccination booster . Those consent reach Week 100 study receive booster vaccination Week 100 , final follow-up visit occur Week 104 . Those participant consent receive hepatitis A vaccination booster last follow-up visit Week 100 .</detailed_description>
