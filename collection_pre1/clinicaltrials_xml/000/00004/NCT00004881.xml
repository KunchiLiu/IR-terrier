	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety , tolerance , maximum tolerate dose TG4010 patient MUC1 positive advance cancer . II . Determine biological immunological effect regimen patient population . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study . Patients receive TG4010 IM weekly 4 week , every week 8 week , every 4 week . Treatment continue every 4 week absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos TG4010 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 3 6 patient experience treatment relate grade 3 toxicity . If patient experience grade 4 toxicity , prior dose level consider MTD . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 10 patient accrue study within 4 month .</detailed_description>
