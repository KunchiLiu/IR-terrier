	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines make person 's white blood cell combine melanoma antigen may make body build immune response tumor cell . Interleukin-2 may stimulate person 's white blood cell kill melanoma cell . Combining vaccine therapy interleukin-2 may effective treatment stage III stage IV melanoma . PURPOSE : Phase I/II trial study effectiveness vaccine therapy without interleukin-2 treating patient stage III stage IV melanoma surgically remove .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy With Without Interleukin-2 Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate safety , dose-limiting toxicity , maximum tolerate dose autologous dendritic cell transduce adenovirus encode MART-1 gp100 melanoma antigens without interleukin-2 patient stage III IV melanoma . II . Evaluate cellular response efficacy regimens patient population . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients sequentially assign one three dose level . Patients receive modify autologous dendritic cell subcutaneously day 1 without interleukin-2 IV day 4-19 . Treatment continue every 21 day total 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos modify dendritic cell without interleukin-2 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) regimen reach . The MTD define dose 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 24-36 patient accrue study within 1 year .</detailed_description>
