	<brief_summary>The goal study develop good method diagnosis , localization , treatment pheochromocytoma . These tumor , usually arise adrenal gland , often difficult detect current method . Pheochromocytomas release chemical call catecholamine , cause high blood pressure . Undetected , tumor lead severe medical consequence , include stroke , heart attack sudden death , situation would normally pose little risk , surgery , general anesthesia childbirth . Patients pheochromocytoma may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , electrocardiogram , blood urine test . Study participant undergo blood , urine , image test , describe , detect pheochromocytoma . If tumor find , patient offer surgery . If surgery feasible ( example , multiple tumor remove ) , evaluation continue follow-up visit . If tumor find , patient offer medical treatment effort detect tumor continue . Main diagnostic research test may include follow : 1 . Blood test - mainly measurement plasma urine catecholamine metanephrines well methoxytyramine . If necessary clonidine suppression test carry . 2 . Standard imaging test - Non-investigational imaging test include compute tomography ( CT ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , sonography , 123I-MIBG scintigraphy FDG ( positron emission tomography ) PET/CT . These scan may do and/or surgical removal pheochromocytoma . 3 . Research PET scan do use injection radioactive compound . Patients may undergo 18F-FDOPA , 18F-DA , well 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT . Each scan take 2 hour . 4 . Genetic test - A small blood sample collect DNA analysis analysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pheochromocytomas paragangliomas rare clinically important chromaffin cell tumor typically arise adrenal gland extra-adrenal paraganglia , respectively constitute surgically correctable cause chronic hypertension . The clinical feature consequence pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma result release catecholamine ( e.g. , norepinephrine epinephrine ) tumor . If pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma undetected , stimulus normally would pose hazard , surgery , childbirth , general anesthesia , evoke catecholamine secretion tumor , clinically significant even catastrophic outcome . The diagnosis pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma localization challenging , measurement plasma level urinary excretion catecholamine metabolites well radio-iodinated metaiodobenzylguanidine ( MIBG ) scan yield false-positive/negative result patient harbor tumor . Computed tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) lack sufficient specificity . The molecular mechanism genotypic change predispose development pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma remain unknown , even patient identify mutation . Moreover , pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas patient hereditary predisposition differ term growth , malignant potential , catecholamine phenotype , responses standard screening test , clonidine suppression test , various image modality , different therapeutic option . This protocol focus developmental , molecular , genetic , epigenetic , proteomic , metabolomics , type study elucidate base predisposition develop pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas expression different neurochemical phenotype malignant potential include therapeutic response . Furthermore , protocol also use new imaging approach , example [ ( 18 ) F ] -6F-dopamine ( [ ( 18 ) F ] -6F-DA ) , [ ( 18 ) F ] -L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine ( [ ( 18F ) ] -DOPA ) , [ ( 68 ) Ga ] -DOTA-Tyr-octreotate ( [ ( 68 ) Ga ] -DOTATATE ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) /CT , well PET/MRI scanning , dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI . Additionally , new biochemical diagnostic criterion exist measurement plasma metanephrines methoxytyramine clinical diagnosis localization tumor . This protocol also evaluate benefit histone deacetylase inhibitor ( e.g . romidepsin ) pretreatment uptake enhancement [ ( 123/131 ) I ] -MIBG pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma tumor .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients adult child age know suspected sporadic familial pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma , basis one following : 1 . New onset hypertension hypertensive episode and/or symptom suggestive pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma ( e.g . limit , sweat , headache , pallor , palpitation , drugresistant hypertension ) . 2 . High level blood urinary catecholamine , metanephrines , methoxytyramine , chromogranin A . 3 . Highly suspect presence pheochromocytoma paraganglioma base image study , even normal biochemistry . 4 . Personal family history pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma genetic mutation know predispose individual develop pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma . Normal volunteer age 18 year old , include normal high blood pressure , use reference value regard biochemical imaging diagnosis pheochromocytoma paraganglioma . Patients normal volunteer study provide blood/urine sample biochemical , proteomic , and/or genetic epigenetic analysis . Signed informed consent require . Patients must willing return NIH followup evaluation . Patients must outside general practitioner endocrinologist . Patients metastatic disease must also outside oncologist . Patients pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma accept clinician self referral . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Potential patient exclude basis one following ; 1 . Pregnant breastfeed woman 2 . Severe cardiac dysfunction 3 . Currently dialysis If previously enrol female becomes pregnant , image study biochemical workup perform delivery conclusion breastfeeding . A pregnancy test perform woman childbearing age ( age 55 ) . In positive pregnancy test , PET MIBG scan contrast CT , DCEMRI vena cava sample clonidine test perform . Patients willing return NIH ( e.g . surgery initial evaluation ) 2 year may remove protocol . SPECIFIC ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR IMAGING STUDIES WITHIN OUR PROTOCOL : In adult patient : Imaging study do patient follow exclusion criterion : Pregnant lactate woman , Patients impair mental capacity precludes inform consent , Patients body weight ( Bullet ) 400 pound due weight limitation PET/CT/MRI scanner patient able enter bore PET/CT/MRI scanner due BMI , Inability lie still entire imaging time ( e.g . cough , severe arthritis , etc . ) , Inability complete need investigational standardofcare image examination due reason ( severe claustrophobia , radiation phobia , etc . ) , Any additional medical condition , serious illness , extenuate circumstance , opinion Principal Investigator , may significantly interfere study compliance . Additionally , DCEMRI do patient acute chronic renal insufficiency since gadolinium chelate injection contraindicate patient . In patient DCEMRI consider , creatinine clearance measurement perform clinically indicate test Department Laboratory Medicine NIH Clinical Center . Patients impaired kidney function undergo DCEMRI . DCEMRI also do patient severe claustrophobia iron metal MRI scan site , patient pacemaker defibrillator , patient allergy gadolinium . In pediatric patient : Inclusion criterion research PET image child Children 10 year old high suspicion sporadic familial pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma ( e.g . presence new onset hypertension hypertensive episode , sweat , headache , pallor , palpitation , drug resistant hypertension , etc . ) family history pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma genetic mutation know predispose individual develop tumor , presence tumor conventional imaging /ultrasounds , CT , MRI . Children must give write informed assent willing return NIH followup . Female patient childbearing age must negative pregnancy test within 24 hour treatment test involve radioactivity radiation exposure . They abstinent use appropriate contraception part study , involve radiation . Exclusion criterion research PET image child Children le 10 year age , Children impair mental capacity precludes inform assent , Pregnant lactate female adolescent , Inability lie still entire imaging time ( e.g . cough , turbulent child , severe claustrophobia , etc . ) .</criteria>
