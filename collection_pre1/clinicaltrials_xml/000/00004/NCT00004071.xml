	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining one drug may kill tumor cell . It yet know mitoxantrone prednisone effective without leflunomide treat prostate cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized phase II/III trial compare effectiveness mitoxantrone prednisone without leflunomide treat patient stage IV prostate cancer respond hormone therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mitoxantrone Prednisone With Without Leflunomide Treating Patients With Stage IV Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare percentage one year survival rate hormone refractory prostate cancer patient treat leflunomide ( SU101 ) , mitoxantrone , prednisone versus mitoxantrone prednisone alone . II . Compare palliative pain response , time treatment failure , time progression , median survival , investigator global response assessment , objective response , time palliative pain response , duration palliation , effect PSA two regimen . III . Assess safety tolerability mitoxantrone combination SU101 patient . IV . Assess health relate quality life patient regimens . OUTLINE : This randomize , open label , multicenter study . Patients stratify performance status ( 70-80 % vs 90-100 % ) , baseline present pain intensity score ( 2.0 v great 2.0 ) , hemoglobin level ( le 12.0 g/dL v least 12.0 g/dL ) . Patients enter one two treatment arm : Arm I : Patients premedicated IV 5-HT3 reuptake inhibitor ( i.e. , odansetron ) receive mitoxantrone IV day 1 . Twice daily oral prednisone therapy begin day 1 continue throughout study treatment . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course . Arm II : Patients premedicated IV 5-HT3 reuptake inhibitor arm I . Patients receive mitoxantrone prednisone therapy arm I. Additionally , begin day 1 patient receive leflunomide ( SU101 ) IV 4-5 hour weekly 12 week . The SU101 infusion shall precede mitoxantrone infusion . Patients receive maximum one year therapy SU101 ; mitoxantrone therapy may administer maximum dose 140/m2 . Quality life assess baseline , day 8 , day 21 , every 3 week thereafter study completion . Patients follow least every 2 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Up 370 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
