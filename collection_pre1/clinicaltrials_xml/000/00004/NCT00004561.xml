Oxygen consumption ( V02 ) peak measure cycle ergometry . Eligible subject randomly assign 18 month participation one three group : 1 ) high intensity endurance training ( 35 minute three times/week heart rate 70-85 percent V02 peak ) , 2 ) moderate intensity endurance training ( 35 minute three times/week heart rate 50-70 V02 peak ) , 3 ) contact control . Enalapril forward back titrate discontinue maintain normal blood pressure . After 12 month participation , medication withdrawn careful supervision subject still take . The trial test hypothesis : 1 ) great number subject undergo either two 18 month exercise training program would able stop anti-hypertensive medication non-exercising control , 2 ) moderate high intensity endurance training equally effective replace drug treatment mild essential hypertension , 3 ) subject successful withdraw anti-hypertensive medication would : great improvement V02 peak , good initial psychological status great improvement psychological status , great compliance exercise training program . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
