	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety feasibility prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) RNA pulse autologous dendritic cell patient metastatic prostate cancer . II . Evaluate presence magnitude cellular immune response PSA surrogate target immune activation patient population . III . Assess presence , frequency , activation status peripheral cytotoxic T lymphocytes prior follow immunotherapy regimen patient . IV . Evaluate humoral immune response evidence circulate peripheral PSA specific antibody patient population . V. Evaluate delay type hypersensitivity reaction irradiate PSA RNA transfected dendritic cell standard recall antigens prior follow immunotherapy patient . VI . Evaluate eventual clinical response evidence clinical biochemical ( PSA ) response criterion . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study . Patients receive prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) RNA pulse autologous dendritic cell IV 2 minute follow PSA RNA dendritic cell intradermally week 0 , 2 , 4 total 3 treatment . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos PSA RNA pulse autologous dendritic cell maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose limit toxicity . Patients follow weekly 3 month , every 3 month 1 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 3-18 patient accrue study within 24 month .</detailed_description>
