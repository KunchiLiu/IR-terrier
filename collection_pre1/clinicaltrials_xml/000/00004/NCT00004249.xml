	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines may make body build immune response kill tumor cell . Biological therapy , QS21 , use different way stimulate immune system stop cancer cell grow . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness vaccine therapy plus QS21 treat patient small cell lung cancer respond initial therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Plus QS21 Treating Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer That Has Responded Initial Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare antibody response immunization polysialic acid keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( PSA-KLH ) conjugate N-propionylated PSA-KLH conjugate plus immunological adjuvant QS21 patient small cell lung cancer . II . Assess clinical toxicity result regimen immune response patient population . OUTLINE : Patients receive polysialic acid keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( PSA-KLH ) conjugate N-propionylated PSA-KLH conjugate plus immunological adjuvant QS21 subcutaneously weekly week 1-4 week 8 16 total 6 vaccination . Patients follow 2 week , every 3 month 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 12 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
