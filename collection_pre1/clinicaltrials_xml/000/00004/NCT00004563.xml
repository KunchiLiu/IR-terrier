	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Systemic sclerosis connective tissue disease unknown etiology characterize microvascular injury excessive fibrosis skin viscera . In United States , 5,000 10,000 new case diagnose annually . Approximately 80 percent person eventually develop degree lung involvement , restrictive lung disease ( interstitial fibrosis ) lead cause morbidity mortality systemic sclerosis . An inflammatory alveolitis think precursor interstitial pulmonary fibrosis systemic sclerosis . An effective treatment SSc interstitial lung disease yet identify . Cyclophosphamide ( CYC ) already widely use rheumatologist desperate something halt rapidly decline lung function SSC patient . Thus , time ripe perform placebo-controlled trial CYC disease . Pulmonary scleroderma strike race prevalent among woman child-bearing , child-rearing , work year . A positive outcome trial , demonstrate oral cyclophosphamide beneficial effect pulmonary fibrosis , would great importance offering scientific basis treatment . Similarly , negative result , demonstrate benefit cyclophosphamide therapy , would also important avoid hazardous expensive therapy use widely . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Multicenter , placebo-controlled , randomize , double-blind . Subjects recruit 12 clinical center randomize 2 mg/kg/day cyclophosphamide placebo . Follow-up visit pulmonary assessment occur every three month two year treatment . If patient fail cyclophosphamide treatment , offer azathioprine remainder 24 month trial . The primary endpoint study change force vital capacity end 12 month treatment . Secondary endpoint include quality life , activity , dyspnea index , carbon monoxide diffuse capacity . Recruitment end December , 2003 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients limited diffuse systemic scleroderma evidence active alveolitis examination bronchoalveolarlavage ( BAL ) fluid ( define neutrophilia ≥3 percent , eosinophilia ≥2 percent , ) thoracic highresolution compute tomography ( CT ) , groundglass opacity , 2 . Onset first symptom scleroderma Raynaud 's phenomenon within previous seven year , 3 . An FVC 45 85 percent predict value 4 . Grade 2 exertional dyspnea accord baseline instrument Mahler Dyspnea Index ( measure use magnitudeoftask component ) . 1 . A singlebreath carbon monoxide diffuse capacity ( DlCO ) less 30 percent predict value , 2 . A history smoking within precede six month , clinically significant pulmonary abnormality , 3 . Clinically significant pulmonary hypertension require drug therapy . 4 . Patients take prednisone dose 10 mg per day , previously treat four week oral cyclophosphamide receive two intravenous dos , 5 . Patients recently receive potentially diseasemodifying medication .</criteria>
