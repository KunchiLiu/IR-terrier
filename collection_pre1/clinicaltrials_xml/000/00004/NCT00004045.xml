	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine antitumor activity DX-8951f measure PSA response patient hormone refractory prostate cancer . II . Determine antitumor activity drug subpopulation patient measurable disease . III . Evaluate quantitative qualitative toxicity drug patient . IV . Evaluate pharmacokinetics drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive DX-8951f IV 30 minute daily 5 day . Courses repeat every 21 day . Treatment continue absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Patients evidence PSA decrease start course 3 receive treatment . Patients follow every 3 month death . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 12-37 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
