	<brief_summary>The overall purpose research develop use blood test well understand quickly viral drug ganciclovir work clear infection CMV virus ( Cytomegalovirus ) occur . This test potentially let doctor know early course therapy virus respond well therapy could therefore resistant drug . The target population study primarily kidney lung transplant patient CMV detect blood , although patient may also include meet criterion . The study divide two phase . Phase I evaluate small number exploratory patient initiate ganciclovir therapy require frequent blood sample obtain detailed information regard kinetic response virus therapy . This information analyze help guide decision regard number frequency blood sample need large phase II portion study . Strains characterize use phenotypic genotypic method determine presence absence mutation potentially responsible resistance .</brief_summary>
