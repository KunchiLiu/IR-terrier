	<brief_summary>The purpose study gain good understand brain 's activity organization development speech disorder . It compare brain activity people normal speech development stutter phonological disorder ( deficit brain process speech sound ) . Stuttering phonological disorder emerge critical period speech development 2.5 12 year age . During period , brain much adaptable speech development puberty . This study examine brain organization speech production perception develop normally critical period normal pattern alter stutter phonological disorder become chronic problem , persist throughout life . Volunteer adult child without speech disorder may participate study . Eligibility screen include brief neurological physical examination test determine normal speech speech disorder . The speech test videotape . The subject speak aloud , describe picture , recall word number , imitate speech sound word , perform listening test . Study participant undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) study brain activity . For procedure , subject lie stretcher move donut-shaped machine strong magnetic field . During MRI scan , subject perform simple task , listen speech sound say nonsense word . The procedure take less 60 minute , usually take 20 40 minute .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Brain Activity During Speech Production Speech Perception</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study two developmental speech production disorder , emerge critical period speech development 2.5 12 year age . During critical period considerably great brain plasticity speech function disappears follow puberty . Our purpose determine normal brain organization speech production perception develop critical period normal pattern alter stutter phonological disorder become chronic problem , persist throughout life span . Functional MRI magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) non-invasive methodology suitable research disorder child . New methodology use fMRI MEG provide first opportunity study speech production normally develop child well child adult stutter and/or phonological disorder . Our hypothesis , development , brain organization speech production become less distributed involve few brain region , phonological processing mechanism become lateralized left hemisphere critical period speech development . This research address whether brain region involve speech diffuse less selective person develop chronic stutter phonological disorder , lead less efficient dynamic system speech production .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : To address 15 hypothesis formulate research , several subject group study . The functional activation pattern normal righthanded adult compare normally develop righthanded child adolescent ( age 617 ) task involve speech segmentation ( phoneme ) speech formulation . All native speaker American English without foreign language use home . Corresponding subject group adult child stutter phonological processing disorder righthanded native speaker American English . Our aim determine brain function speech perception production change completion critical period speech development system differ child disorder speech control phonology continue problem period . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : A subject exclude he/she contraindication MR scan follow : aneurysm clip ; implant neural stimulator ; implant cardiac pacemaker autodefibrillator ; cochlear implant ; ocular implant foreign body ( e.g . metal shaving splinter ) ; insulin pump ; shrapnel , bullet shot wound ; artificial heart valve ; tattooed makeup ; prostheses ferromagnetic material ; surgical metal clip brain , eye blood vessel ; implant drug infusion device . The LSS otolaryngologist , Pamela Kearney , M.D. , LSS nurse practitioner Patti Henshel , C.R.N.P. , screen participant NMR Center Safety Screening Questionnaire , also include additional item intraventricular shunt , transdermal medication patch , wire suture , bone/joint pin , screw , nail , plate , body piercings . Dr. Kearney Ms. Henshel approve disapprove participation study base judgement MR compatibility item , use publish guide include Shellock &amp; Kanal ( 1994 ) Shellock ( 2001 ) . Other exclusion criterion claustrophobia , pregnancy ( determined pregnancy test NIH 's Clinical Center day scan ) ; aphasia dysarthria , language and/or cognitive function low 2 standard deviation ageadjusted mean value screen test , speech reception threshold great dB ; nonnative American English speech development ; developmental exposure language English home , medication affect central nervous system function time fMRI scanning . If potential participant elect withdraw medication , must do care participant 's physician prior participation protocol . Medication withdrawal part study . Additional exclusion criterion developmental stutter include : language and/or cognitive function low 1 standard deviation ageadjusted mean value screen test , lefthandedness Edinburgh handedness questionnaire ; movement disorder ( e.g. , Huntington disease , chorea , myoclonus , Gilles de la Tourette syndrome , Parkinson 's disease , progressive supranuclear palsy , neurolepticinduced syndrome ) , brain tumor , history traumatic brain injury loss consciousness , genetic disease CNS ( e.g. , chromosomal disease , metabolic disorder , diffuse sclerosis ) , chronic infection nervous system ( e.g. , bacterial , vial , parasitic , fungal yeast ) , ataxia ( inherit acquire ) , myopathy ( e.g. , progressive muscular dystrophy , familial periodic paralysis , congenital disorder muscle , myoglobinuria , polymyositis ) , disorder neuromuscular junction ( e.g. , myasthenia gravis ) , demyelinate disease ( e.g. , multiple sclerosis , central pontine myelinolysis ) , brain abnormality , schizophrenia , alcoholism , longlasting drug dependence , major and/or bipolar depression , obsessivecompulsive disorder , vocal fold paralysis paresis , joint abnormality , neoplasm , history swallow disorder , airway obstruction .</criteria>
