	<brief_title>SR-45023A Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose SR-45023A patient locally advance metastatic solid tumor . II . Determine quantitative qualitative toxic effect SR-45023A patient . III . Assess plasma urine pharmacokinetics SR-45023A relate drug effect , possible , patient . IV . Determine preliminary antitumor activity SR-45023A patient . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study . Patients receive oral SR-45023A weekly . Treatment continue every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos SR-45023A maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose limit toxicity . Patients follow 1 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A maximum 36 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
