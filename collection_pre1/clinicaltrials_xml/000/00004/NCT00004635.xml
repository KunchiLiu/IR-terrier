	<brief_summary>This multi-center study evaluate whether thalidomide improve effectiveness drug leuprolide goserelin treat testosterone-dependent prostate cancer . Leuprolide goserelin-both approve treat prostate cancer-reduce testosterone production , , patient , reduces size tumor . Thalidomide , drug use many year treat leprosy , block growth blood vessel may important disease progression . Patients 18 year old testosterone-dependent prostate cancer persist recurred surgery , radiation therapy , cryosurgery , whose disease metastasize ( spread beyond prostate ) may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , include blood test , bone compute tomography ( CT ) scan imaging study . Study participant randomly assign one two treatment group . One group receive leuprolide goserelin follow thalidomide ; receives leuprolide goserelin follow placebo ( look-alike pill active ingredient ) . Patients group receive injection leuprolide goserelin month 6 month . After time take four capsule either thalidomide placebo day remain drug prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) level return begin leuprolide goserelin 5 nanogram per liter , whichever low . ( PSA protein secrete prostate gland . Monitoring change level protein help evaluate tumor progression ) . At point entire procedure begin , start leuprolide goserelin treatment , experimental drug switch ; patient originally treat thalidomide cross placebo , patient originally treat placebo cross thalidomide . Patients monitor periodically follow test procedure : Medical history physical examination . Blood urine test monitor thalidomide PSA level , response treatment , routine laboratory value ( e.g. , cell count kidney liver function ) . Computed tomography ( CT ) bone scan , possibly image test assess tumor . Electromyography ( EMG ) nerve conduction study , need . For electromyography , thin needle inserted muscle patient ask relax contract muscle .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This double-blind randomized phase III study design determine thalidomide improve efficacy luteinizing hormone release hormone ( LHRH ) agonist ( leuprolide goserelin ) hormone-responsive patient rise PSA primary definitive therapy prostate cancer . Patients rise PSA randomized LHRH agonist six month follow oral thalidomide 200 mg per day placebo ( phase A ) . At time PSA progression , LHRH agonist restart six additional month . After six month , patient originally treat thalidomide cross placebo patient originally treat placebo cross thalidomide follow PSA progression development metastatic disease , whichever occur first ( Phase B ) . Additional information obtain change circulate level follow growth factor : basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , transform growth factor beta ( TGFbeta ) . Likewise monitor change testosterone dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) throughout study . Neurological complication primary dose-limiting toxicity anticipate chronic thalidomide administration .</detailed_description>
