	<brief_title>BMS-247550 Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors That Have Not Responded Previous Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose , dose limit toxicity , safety , recommend phase II dose BMS-247550 administer 1 hour infusion every 3 week patient advance solid tumor . II . Evaluate plasma pharmacokinetics drug patient population . III . Determine preliminary evidence antitumor activity drug patient . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study . Patients receive BMS-247550 IV 1 hour every 3 week . Treatment continue minimum 2 course absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos BMS-247550 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose limit toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month death . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 20-40 patient accrue study within 8-12 month .</detailed_description>
