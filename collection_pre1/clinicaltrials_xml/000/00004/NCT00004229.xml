	<brief_title>Endostatin Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine optimal biologic dose endostatin patient advance solid tumor . II . Determine safety tolerability regimen patient . III . Determine extent , frequency , duration tumor response patient regimen . IV . Determine pharmacokinetic profile interpatient pharmacologic variability regimen patient . V. Determine recommend phase II dose schedule regimen . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study . Patients undergo biopsy prestudy second course treatment . Patients receive endostatin IV daily 4 week . Patients dose level 1-6 receive endostatin 20 minute . Patients dose level 7 receive endostatin 40 minute , treatment day 2 first course . Treatment continue every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos endostatin maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose limit toxicity . Patients follow 1 month .</detailed_description>
