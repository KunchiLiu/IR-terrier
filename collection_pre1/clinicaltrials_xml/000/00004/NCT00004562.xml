	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether open occlude infarcted artery 3-28 day acute myocardial infarction high-risk asymptomatic patient reduce composite endpoint mortality , recurrent myocardial infarction , hospitalization class IV congestive heart failure average 2.9-year follow-up extend follow average six year . Long term follow-up patient complete March 2010 . Final collection regulatory documentation complete June 2011 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The benefit establish early coronary reperfusion acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) unequivocally establish . However , current pharmacologic strategy fail achieve effective reperfusion 30 percent patient , many patient occlude infarct artery meet current criterion use agent . Early angioplasty , effective reperfusion method , available small proportion potentially eligible US acute MI patient . Hence substantial number acute MI patient pass time reperfusion therapy document benefit ( 12 - 24 hour ) persistently close infarct vessel . Several line experimental clinical evidence suggest late reperfusion patient could provide clinically significant reduction mortality morbidity . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Multicenter , randomize , control . Patients 217 clinical site United States , Canada Internationally randomly allocate two treatment arm five year . One treatment consist conventional medical management include aspirin , beta blocker , angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor , risk factor modification . The treatment consist conventional medical therapy plus percutaneous coronary intervention coronary stenting . Clinical outcome compare use intention-to-treat analysis . The primary composite endpoint mortality , recurrent myocardial infarction , hospitalization NYHA Class IV congestive heart failure three year follow-up . Individual component study composite primary endpoint compare two treatment arm , medical cost two treatment health-related quality life . The cost-effectiveness percutaneous revascularization assess study population .</detailed_description>
