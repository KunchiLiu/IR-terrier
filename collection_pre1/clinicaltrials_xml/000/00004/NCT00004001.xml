	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy hormone therapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining one drug give drug different way may kill tumor cell . It yet know whether estramustine plus docetaxel effective mitoxantrone plus prednisone prostate cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness estramustine plus docetaxel mitoxantrone plus prednisone treating patient stage IV prostate cancer respond hormone therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare overall survival progression-free survival patient hormone-refractory , metastatic adenocarcinoma prostate treat docetaxel estramustine v mitoxantrone prednisone . - Compare qualitative quantitative toxic effect regimens patient population . - Compare quality life , include palliation metastatic bone pain global quality life , patient treat regimen . - Record prostate-specific antigen value future correlation response survival patient treat regimen . - Compare response patient bidimensionally measurable disease treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord disease status ( measurable evaluable disease progression v rise PSA ) , NCI Common Toxicity Criteria version 2.X pain scale ( grade 2 great v less 2 ) , SWOG performance status ( 0-1 v 2-3 ) . Patients randomize one two treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral estramustine 3 time daily day 1-5 docetaxel IV 1 hour day 2 . - Arm II : Patients receive mitoxantrone IV 30 minute day 1 oral prednisone twice daily day 1-21 . Treatment arm repeat every 3 week maximum 12 course absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Quality life assess baseline , course 4 8 , 1 year randomization . Patients follow every 6 month 2 year annually 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 620 patient ( 310 per arm ) accrue study within 3.5 year .</detailed_description>
