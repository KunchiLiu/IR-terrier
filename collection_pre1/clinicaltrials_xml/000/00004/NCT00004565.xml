	<brief_summary>This study explore whether different form , variant , gene relate person risk develop breast cancer . The gene look clinical significance today , thus impact personal healthcare time . However , result may help researcher well understand people develop breast cancer others . The study try determine : people breast cancer different gene variant people without disease ; genetic difference influence person susceptibility breast cancer expose certain environmental substance , nicotine estrogen ; breast cancer occur family relate group variant . The study also look certain protein , cell , substance fluid aspirate ( use gentle suction ; needle ) nipple might represent pattern , `` fingerprint , '' indicate increase risk breast cancer . Study participant complete questionnaire cancer risk factor , diet , family history . A small blood sample ( 3 tablespoon ) drawn study genetic difference people breast cancer people cancer-free . Nipple aspiration , noninvasive method obtain fluid woman breast , attempt 4 6 time , 4 6 week period . For procedure , subject place warm moist towel breast 20 minute . The breast cleanse rub alcohol pad . The subject compress breast hand small plastic cup invert breast . Suction apply small syringe ( needle ) attach cup 15 second . The procedure may repeat 5 time breast . Any drop fluid obtain nipple collected glass tube .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cancer risk , even among similar environmental exposure uniformly distribute . Although able identify genetic factor whose variant appear significantly alter individual 's risk develop breast cancer ( BRCA1 BRCA2 ) , gene likely involve less 10 % breast cancer case . Perhaps applicable general population gene , directly involve oncogenic process , may variant ( polymorphism ) act indirectly increase risk oncogenic change within cell . It goal proposal look gene , environment , clinical co-factors , , possible , interaction breast cancer . The ultimate objective study establish effective way identify individual great risk cancer . We evaluate risk breast cancer associate polymorphisms gene involve estrogen metabolism action . We also evaluate association breast density polymorphisms gene associate estrogen metabolism action . In addition , also evaluate nipple aspirate fluid breast duct lavage fluid another potential source promise biomarkers risk .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Case Populations : Individuals breast cancer ascertain among patient population National Naval Medical Center ( NNMC ) well refer institution . Individuals Clinical Center may also eligible . There three group participant , include control group , individual document history breast cancer , individual identify high risk develop breast cancer . The purpose high risk group look potential similarity difference cancer control population may start exhibit high risk group . This potentially allow research team identify high risk woman marker risk . After provide informed consent , individual ask donate blood sample , undergo nipple fluid sampling , complete epidemiological , dietary family history questionnaire grant access medical record . The questionnaire complete and/or review research team . 1. . Individuals document history invasive breast cancer . 2. . Individuals document history ductal carcinoma situ . Control High Risk Populations : We use two primary method establish risk status individual affect cancer . 1. . Individuals find harbor mutation BRCA1 BRCA2 face 5085 percent lifetime risk develop breast cancer well increase risk ovarian cancer vary dependent gene involve . Therefore , individual document BRCA1 BRCA2 mutation assign high risk population group . 2. . For participant without history breast cancer document BRCA1 BRCA2 mutation , computerize Pedigree Assessment Tool ( PAT ) use establish control high risk group assignment . The PAT capable identify woman family feature suggest transmission autosomal dominant breast cancer susceptibility allele . The PAT simple point score system assigns point value case breast ovarian cancer within family . Pedigree Assessment Tool Scoring System Diagnosis Points Assigned Breast Cancer age 50 high 3 Breast cancer prior age 50 4 Ovarian Cancer age 5 Male Breast Cancer age 8 Ashkenazi Jewish heritage 4 The PAT score calculate add point assign every family member breast ovarian cancer diagnosis , include 2nd 3rd degree relative . A separate score calculate maternal paternal lineage high 2 score assign participant . Validation data model demonstrate PAT score accurate modify Gail model identify woman hereditary risk breast cancer . Area ROC curve PAT 0.9625 compare 0.389 0.5861 5year lifetime Gail estimate respectively . PAT score great equal 8 provide accurate discrimination `` high risk '' `` high risk '' woman sensitivity 100 percent specificity 93 positive predictive value 63 percent negative predictive value 100 percent . Control Populations : The control participant ascertain among low risk screen population , noncancer clinic practice NNMC must meet following criterion . 1 . Individuals prior history malignancy exclude skin cancer ( except melanoma ) cervical cancer situ . 2 . A PAT score less 8 . 3 . Gail risk less 1.67 . High Risk Population : In order individual highrisk breast cancer group subject must satisfy criterion 1 AND least one criterion 2 6 . 1 . Have prior history malignancy exclude skin cancer ( except melanoma ) cervical cancer situ . 2 . Gail Model estimate risk great 1.66 develop breast cancer next five year . 3 . A documented deleterious mutation BRCA1 BRCA2 . 4 . A PAT score great equal 8 . 5 . History lobular carcinoma situ ( LCIS ) . 6 . History atypical lobular ductal hyperplasia . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Inability give inform consent . Individuals active infection superficial inflammation breast , currently lactate less 6 month postlactation eligible undergo nipple fluid sampling , however may still participate rest study .</criteria>
