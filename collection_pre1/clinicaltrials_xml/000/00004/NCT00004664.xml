	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate effect aerobic exercise progressive resistance plus megestrol acetate lean body mass patient human immunodeficiency virus-related weight loss ( HIV-wasting ) . II . Evaluate whether exercise acutely alter immune function . III . Evaluate whether long-term exercise improve immunocompetence . IV . Evaluate accuracy multifrequency bioelectrical impedance spectral analysis measure body composition . V. Assess impact therapy quality life . VI . Evaluate effect therapy balance energy intake energy expenditure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Placebo-Controlled Study Aerobic Exercise Resistance Training Plus Megestrol Acetate HIV-Wasting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE : Patients randomly assign 1 3 therapy group : megestrol acetate alone , exercise plus megestrol acetate , exercise plus placebo . Therapy continue 12 week . A single dose oral megestrol acetate placebo administer morning . The exercise program consist aerobic exercise resistance training perform 3 time week supervision . Hard aerobic exercise perform 45 minute plus warm-up cool-down period ; patient chooses work 3 5 piece exercise equipment . Exercise intensity adjust heart rate correspond 65 % maximal oxygen consumption . Resistance train do universal gym ; exercise design work 6 major muscle group . Each exercise perform 70 % maximal single repetition resistance . Resistance increase 5 % patient perform 15 repetition without failure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>PROTOCOL ENTRY CRITERIA : Disease Characteristics Human immunodeficiency virus seropositive acquire immune deficiency syndrome Documented weight loss 5 % 15 % ideal weight Prior/Concurrent Therapy No concurrent appetite stimulant At least 6 week since initiation new antiretroviral therapy Patient Characteristics Performance status : Karnofsky 70 % 100 % Hepatic : No ascites Renal : No nephrosis Other : No acute untreated infection within 4 week prior entry No hospitalization within 2 week prior entry No gonadal insufficiency No edema No pleural effusion No uncontrolled diarrhea No physical functional obstruction food intake No physical handicap would prevent resistance aerobic exercise No cardiac abnormality would render aerobic exercise health risk No concurrent regular exercise 3 hour week No mental incompetence</criteria>
