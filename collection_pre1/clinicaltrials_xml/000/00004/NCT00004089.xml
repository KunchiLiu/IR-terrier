	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Combining radiation therapy chemotherapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combination chemotherapy plus radiation therapy treat patient previously untreated anaplastic thyroid cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Plus Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate activity chemotherapy hyperfractionated radiotherapy term complete overall response rate , time progression , pattern failure , incidence second primary tumor , overall survival patient previously untreated anaplastic thyroid cancer . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral hydroxyurea every 12 hour day 0-5 , fluorouracil IV paclitaxel IV continuously day 1-5 , hyperfractionated radiotherapy twice daily day 1-5 . Patients receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously daily day 6-12 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 5 course . Following completion concurrent chemoradiotherapy , patient prior initial modify neck dissection residual macroscopic nodal disease initially stag nodal disease evidence residual disease undergo neck dissection . Patients macroscopic residual disease primary site undergo complete excision disease . Patients progressive disease recurrence disease undergo conventional surgical management . Patients follow 4-6 week , every 3 month 1 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 16-46 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
