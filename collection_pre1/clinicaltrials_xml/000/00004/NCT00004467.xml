	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria This phase III blind study , involve approximately 200 patient . For purpose , acute liver failure define onset mental status alteration coagulopathy ( INR &gt; 1.5 ) within 26 week onset hepatitic illness , evidence underlie chronic liver disease . Eligible patient admit study site hospital intensive care unit acute liver failure evaluate started treatment within first 24 hour hospitalization evolve alter mentation already hospital . All subject 18 70 year . Patients transfer refer hospital study site may consider enrollment , provide specific treatment protocol begin , liver support device ( BAL , ELAD , transgenic pig perfusion ) use contemplate . Use fresh frozen plasma infusion disqualify patient participation . Exclusion Criteria 1 . Patients le age 18 70 year age . 2 . ALF patient acetaminophen mushroom poisoning assess Suspected significant contribute sole cause illness . Both diagnosis require specific antidote therapy , include NAC case acetaminophen , rather randomize nonspecific treatment . 3 . Patients diagnosis shock liver ( ischemic hepatopathy ) , since overall outcome patient largely determine underlying etiology condition lead shock . Heat stroke exclude . 4 . Acute liver failure pregnancy HELLP syndrome ( pregnancy associate hemolysis coagulopathy ) . The effect NAC fetus mother determine ; addition , pregnancyrelated liver disease usually mandate rapid delivery infant . 5 . ALF think secondary intrahepatic malignancy . Patients hepatic malignancy experience ALF 100 % mortality transplant candidate . 6 . Patients exhibit sign cerebral herniation time enrollment . 7 . Patients demonstrate presence intractable arterial hypotension ( arterial systolic blood pressure equal 70 mmHg ) present , require inotropic drug time enrollment . 8 . Severe sepsis ( temperature &gt; 39o C and/or significant bacteremia ) present time enrollment . In general , ALF patient comprise somewhat woman men , preponderance racial group , expect basis geographic difference . No exclusion make basis race , ethnic group gender . Criteria inclusion woman minority establish NIH guideline . Each study site provide review log patient consider NAC study identifier , yield gender age , race reason participate check gender ethnic bias .</criteria>
