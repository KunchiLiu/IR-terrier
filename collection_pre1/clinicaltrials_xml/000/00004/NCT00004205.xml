	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Estrogen stimulate growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use letrozole may fight breast cancer reduce production estrogen . Hormone therapy use tamoxifen may fight breast cancer block uptake estrogen tumor cell . If yet know treatment regimen effective breast cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized double-blind phase III trial compare effectiveness letrozole tamoxifen treat postmenopausal woman breast cancer surgically remove .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Letrozole Tamoxifen Treating Postmenopausal Women With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare adjuvant letrozole v tamoxifen administer 5 year postmenopausal woman operable , hormone receptor-positive breast cancer . - Compare treatment regimen give sequentially vs continuously patient population . - Compare treatment regimens term overall survival , disease-free systemic-free survival , safety , tolerability patient population . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord adjuvant chemotherapy ( prior therapy v prior concurrent therapy v concurrent therapy ) , prior surgery ( modified radical mastectomy v less surgical procedure ) , participate center . Patients randomize one four treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive adjuvant oral tamoxifen daily 5 year . - Arm II : Patients receive adjuvant oral letrozole daily 5 year . - Arm III : Patients receive adjuvant oral tamoxifen daily 2 year follow adjuvant oral letrozole daily 3 year . - Arm IV : Patients receive adjuvant oral letrozole daily 2 year follow adjuvant oral tamoxifen daily 3 year . Patients may receive concurrent radiotherapy . Some patient receive concurrent adjuvant chemotherapy begin within 8 week surgery continue 6 month . Patients follow annually . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 5,180 patient ( 1,295 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 6 year .</detailed_description>
