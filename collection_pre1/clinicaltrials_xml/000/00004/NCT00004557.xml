	<criteria>Subjects include : Patients assign diagnosis probable Alzheimer 's disease meeting NINCDSADRDA DSMIIIR criterion . Patients neuropsychiatric illness ( i.e. , depression , Korsakoff 's disease , Huntington 's disease ) . Normal control . Subjects must major concomitant illness . All patient drugfree least 2 week whenever possible . Concurrent use medication ( i.e. , diuretic antibiotic ) allow careful review investigator . Normal control subject without history present psychiatric neurological illness .</criteria>
