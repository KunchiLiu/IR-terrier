	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate toxicity immune response efficacy PR1 peptide ( PR1 leukemia peptide vaccine ) administer subcutaneously . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate possible clinical efficacy PR1 peptide vaccine preparation Montanide ISA 51 Montanide ISA 51 VG adjuvant , high-risk HLA-A2 positive patient myeloid leukemia . OUTLINE : This phase I dose-escalation study PR1 leukemia peptide vaccine , follow phase II randomize study . Patients receive PR1 leukemia peptide vaccine Montanide ISA-51 ( ISA-51 ) subcutaneously ( SC ) every 3 week 18 week , total 6 vaccination . Patients also receive sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) SC vaccination . Cohorts 3 patient receive escalate dos PR1 leukemia peptide vaccine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Additional patient accrue phase II portion study randomize receive one three dose level PR1 leukemia peptide vaccine ISA-51 . Patients 3 arm receive treatment phase I portion study . Patients achieve clinical response and/or clinical response vaccine whose disease progress within 6-12 month first set vaccination may receive additional vaccine . Patients achieve clinical response immune reaction vaccine follow least monthly death clinical response and/or immune reaction lose . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 3-9 patient accrued phase I dose escalation portion study . A maximum 60 patient ( 20 per arm ) accrue phase II randomize portion study .</detailed_description>
