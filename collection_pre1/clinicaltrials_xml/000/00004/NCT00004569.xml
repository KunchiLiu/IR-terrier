	<brief_summary>The diagnosis treatment sleep disorder breathe come forefront clinical medicine follow recognition high prevalence associate morbidity sleep apnea . The effect quality life well societal cost well document . The NYU Sleep Research Laboratory spend last several year work problem improve diagnosis mild sleep disorder breathing manifest upper airway resistance syndrome . Our approach develop non-invasive technique detect increase upper airway resistance directly analysis airflow signal . A characteristic intermittent change inspiratory flow contour , indicative occurrence flow limitation , correlate well increase airway resistance . Currently respiratory event identify manually total . This time consume subject variability . The objective present project improve upon manual approach implement artificially intelligent system identification quantification sleep disorder breathe base solely non-invasive cardiopulmonary signal collect routine sleep study . The utility report index sleep disorder breathing obtain sleep study evaluate . Successful development automate system identify classify upper airway resistance event simplify , standardize improve diagnosis sleep disorder breathing , greatly facilitate research clinical work area . Using physiological base determination disease allow well assessment treatment responses mild disease .</brief_summary>
