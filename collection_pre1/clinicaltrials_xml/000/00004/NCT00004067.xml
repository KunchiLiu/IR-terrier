	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide , paclitaxel , use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Monoclonal antibody trastuzumab locate tumor cell either kill deliver tumor-killing substance without harm normal cell . It yet know whether combination chemotherapy plus trastuzumab effective combination chemotherapy alone treat breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study well give combination chemotherapy together trastuzumab work compare combination chemotherapy alone treat woman node-positive stage II stage IIIA breast cancer overexpresses HER2 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Doxorubicin Cyclophosphamide Plus Paclitaxel With Without Trastuzumab Treating Women With Node-Positive Breast Cancer That Overexpresses HER2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare cardiotoxicity doxorubicin cyclophosphamide follow paclitaxel without trastuzumab ( Herceptin® ) woman operable , node-positive breast cancer overexpresses HER2 . - Compare effect regimens disease-free overall survival patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord number positive node ( 1-3 v 4-9 v 10 ) , administration hormonal therapy ( tamoxifen v anastrozole v neither ) , surgery/radiotherapy ( lumpectomy plus breast irradiation v lumpectomy plus breast irradiation plus regional irradiation v mastectomy without radiotherapy v mastectomy radiotherapy ) , paclitaxel schedule ( every 3 week vs weekly ) , participate center . Patients randomize one two treatment arm . - Arm 1 : Patients receive doxorubicin IV cyclophosphamide IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course . Approximately 3 week last course , patient receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour every 21 day 4 course OR paclitaxel IV 1 hour weekly 12 week ( 12 dos ) . - Arm 2 : Patients receive chemotherapy arm I trastuzumab ( Herceptin® ) IV 90 minute day 1 first course paclitaxel . Trastuzumab administer IV 30 minute weekly 51 week , begin day 8 . All patient estrogen progesterone receptor-positive tumor receive hormonal therapy* least 5 year , begin within 3-12 week last dose chemotherapy . Patients receive prior tamoxifen prevention may treat additional tamoxifen 5 year discretion principal investigator ( PI ) . NOTE : *Other hormonal therapeutic agent allow sequence alternative tamoxifen therapy . All patient previously treat lumpectomy undergo breast irradiation begin completion chemotherapy concurrently trastuzumab ( arm 2 ) administration . Patients previously treat mastectomy may also receive radiotherapy . Radiotherapy administer daily 5-6 week . Patients follow every 6 month 5 year annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 2,700 patient accrue study within 4.75 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion The patient must life expectancy least 10 year , exclude diagnosis breast cancer . ( Comorbid condition take consideration , diagnosis breast cancer . ) The interval last surgery breast cancer treatment ( lumpectomy , mastectomy , axillary dissection , reexcision lumpectomy margin ) randomization must less equal 84 day . All follow stag criterion must meet : Primary tumor must T13 clinical pathologic evaluation . Ipsilateral node must cN01 clinical evaluation . Ipsilateral node must pN1 , pN2a , pN3a pathologic evaluation . M0 Patients must undergo either total mastectomy axillary dissection lumpectomy axillary dissection . Sentinel node biopsy permit , must follow axillary dissection . The tumor must invasive adenocarcinoma histologic examination . The tumor must determine HER2positive prior randomization . Assays perform use fluorescent situ hybridization ( FISH ) require gene amplification eligible . Assays use immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) must perform NSABPapproved reference laboratory require strongly positive stain score . Patients must analysis estrogen progesterone receptor perform primary tumor prior randomization . `` Marginal , '' `` borderline , '' etc. , result ( i.e. , definitely negative ) also consider positive regardless methodology use . At time randomization , patient must follow : history physical exam , EKG , PA lateral chest xray within past 3 month ; bilateral mammogram ( unilateral patient mastectomy ) pelvic exam ( woman uterus take tamoxifen ) within past year . Within 3 month prior entry , patient must baseline leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) measure MUGA scan equal great low limit normal radiology facility . ( If LVEF &gt; 75 % , investigator consider LVEF determination review prior randomization . Following randomization , LVEF determination may review time postAC MUGA . Please note accurate value obtain review baseline MUGA , correct value must submit NSABP Biostatistical Center postAC MUGA perform . ) At time randomization : The postoperative absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) must ≥ 1500/mm3 ( &lt; 1500/mm3 , opinion investigator , represent ethnic racial variation normal ) . Postoperative platelet count must ≥ 100,000/mm3 . Significant underlying hematologic disorder must exclude platelet count upper limit normal lab . There must postoperative evidence adequate hepatic function , i.e. , total bilirubin must ≤ ULN lab unless patient chronic grade 1 bilirubin elevation ( &gt; ULN ≤1.5 x ULN ) due Gilbert 's disease similar syndrome ; alkaline phosphatase must &lt; 2.5 time ULN lab ; serum glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT [ AST ] ) must &lt; 1.5 time ULN lab . There must postoperative evidence adequate renal function ( serum creatinine within less institution 's normal range ) . Patients must clinical radiologic evidence metastatic disease . Suspicious finding must confirm benign radiologic evaluation biopsy . A patient skeletal pain eligible inclusion study bone scan and/or roentgenological examination fails disclose metastatic disease . Patients history nonbreast malignancy eligible diseasefree 5 year prior randomization deem physician low risk recurrence . Patients follow cancer eligible diagnose treat within past 5 year : carcinoma situ cervix , melanoma situ , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . Prior randomization , investigator must designate whether patient lumpectomy receive local locoregional radiation therapy . For patient mastectomy , investigator must designate whether patient receive radiation therapy . ( Prerandomization discussion and/or consultation radiation oncologist encourage . ) Note : Irradiation internal mammary node prohibit trial . Special condition eligibility lumpectomy patient : irradiation surgery Patients treat lumpectomy axillary node dissection follow breast radiation therapy must meet eligibility criterion addition following : Generally , lumpectomy reserved tumor &lt; 5 cm . However , investigator 's discretion , patient treat lumpectomy tumor ≥ 5 cm eligible . The margin resect specimen must histologically free invasive tumor DCIS determine local pathologist . In patient pathologic examination demonstrate tumor present line resection , additional operative procedure may perform obtain clear margin . This permissible even axillary dissection perform . Patients tumor still present resect margin reexcision ( ) must undergo total mastectomy eligible . Whole breast irradiation require . Irradiation regional lymph node optional , partial breast irradiation irradiation internal mammary node prohibit trial . Intent irradiate axilla regional node group must declare investigator prior randomization stratification purpose . Special condition eligibility mastectomy patient : irradiation . The decision use locoregional irradiation patient undergone total mastectomy axillary node dissection must declare investigator prior randomization stratification purpose .

Sensory/motor neuropathy ≥ grade 2 , define NCI 's Common Toxicity Criteria version 2.0 . Contraindications corticosteroid use , opinion investigator , would preclude participation study . Concurrent treatment investigational agent . Sensitivity benzyl alcohol . Special condition ineligibility lumpectomy patient : irradiation surgery . For patient treated lumpectomy axillary dissection , breast irradiation require . Please see guideline radiation therapy Appendix A . In addition , follow patient also ineligible : Patients diffuse tumor ( demonstrated mammography ) would consider surgically amenable lumpectomy . Patients treat lumpectomy another clinically dominant mass mammographically suspicious abnormality within ipsilateral breast remnant . Such mass must biopsied demonstrate histologically benign prior randomization , malignant , must surgically remove clear margin . Patients margin resect specimen involve invasive tumor ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) . Additional surgical resection obtain free margin allow .
