	<brief_summary>This study evaluate hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection blood donor test positive antibody virus . Most HCV-infected people become ill aware hepatitis past . Some infected people recover completely , whereas others remain chronically infect . The study try define infectivity anti-HCV positive individual , route transmission virus , number HCV-infected person evidence liver disease . Blood donor NIH Clinical Center Central Maryland Chapter American Red Cross test positive HCV may eligible study . Participants physical examination history , include question socioeconomic status current sexual practice . They 100 milliliter ( ml ) ( 6 tablespoon ) blood drawn first visit 50 ml ( 3 tablespoon ) draw 3 , 6 , 9 12 month initial visit . Some participant may undergo plasmapheresis , procedure collect additional plasma ( liquid portion blood ) . For procedure , whole blood collect needle place arm vein . The blood circulates machine separate component . The plasma remove , red white cell platelet return body , either needle use draw blood second needle place arm . In individual , body fluid ( saliva , urine semen ) may also collect . Participants may ask bring household contact sexual partner NIH interview blood test evidence HCV infection liver disease . Although required participation study , would provide additional valuable information . Participants find chronic viral infection see often provide additional blood sample routine medical care . Further medical evaluation may include X-rays liver scan referral specialist additional test therapy . Ten people study recruit participate secondary investigation analyze change level HCV immune response , relate change degree liver damage . In addition blood collect primary study , participant investigation additional 50 ml ( 3 tablespoon ) blood drawn arm vein every week 10 week measure level virus , ALT ( liver enzyme ) , immune response .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At initiation study 1991 , approximately 0.6 % U.S. blood donor identify antibody hepatitis C virus ( anti-HCV ) . This represent 72,000 estimate 12 million annual U.S. blood donation . By investigate cohort anti-HCV positive donor , study aim determine : 1 ) primary route HCV transmission asymptomatic donor population ; 2 ) relationship anti-HCV evidence acute chronic liver disease ; 3 ) infectivity anti-HCV positive individual judge measurement HCV RNA investigation sexual partner prior blood recipient ; 4 ) chronic consequence HCV infection . The study directly provide treatment HCV infection . Enrollment limited person identify anti-HCV positive time blood donation person source find clinical molecular evidence acute hepatitis C virus infection . Although primary goal study investigate HCV infection outcome , occasionally encounter blood donor NIH patient infect HBV HCV-HBV coinfection . We enroll patient well understand HBV infection compare outcomes HCV monoinfected , HBV monoinfected HCV-HBV coinfection .</detailed_description>
