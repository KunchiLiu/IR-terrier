	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody ABX-EGF Treating Patients With Renal ( Kidney ) , Prostate , Pancreatic , Non-Small Cell Lung , Colon Rectal , Esophageal , Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety monoclonal antibody ABX-EGF patient renal , prostate , pancreatic , non-small cell lung , colorectal , esophageal , gastroesophageal junction cancer . - Determine pharmacokinetics dose-response relationship drug patient population . - Evaluate clinical effect drug patient population . OUTLINE : This open-label , dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients receive monoclonal antibody ABX-EGF IV 1 hour weekly week 0-3* ( enrollment weekly dose schedule complete 4/21/03 [ exception patient undergoing full pharmacokinetic analysis , describe ] ) OR every 2 week week 0 , 2 , 4 , 6* OR every 3 week week 0 , 3 , 6 , 9* . Patients undergo full pharmacokinetic analysis receive load dose week 0 subsequent 3 dos week 3-5 . NOTE : *All patient receive total 4 dos . Cohorts 2-8 patient receive escalate dos monoclonal antibody ABX-EGF maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede least 2 3 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Patients follow every 2 week 5 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 76 patient accrue study within approximately 14 month .</detailed_description>
