	<brief_summary>This study establish database fetal movement associate feeding . It use information obtain standard fetal ultrasound procedure identify measure growth baby 's face , lip , tongue , jaw , throat airway . Fetal movement involve breathing , suck swallow record videotape . This study may provide information : increase knowledge swallow develops fetus ; help explain baby difficulty suck swallow birth ; help predict baby increase risk feed problem ; help design good way manage feed difficulty baby . Pregnant woman schedule ultrasound examination National Naval Medical Center Bethesda , Maryland , Georgetown University Hospital Washington , D.C. , eligible study . Mothers fill questionnaire provide general medical health information . For ultrasound procedure , transducer ( small , wand-like device ) move across belly produce image fetus . When baby awake swallowing , image mouth , throat air passage record videotape . The movement associate feeding-breathing , suck , yawn swallowing-will measure document swallow develops . When baby bear , researcher review medical chart finding relevant study . One 2 week delivery , mother interview telephone baby 's feeding skill . Follow-up visit 4 8 week birth include observation baby 's suck swallow ultrasound examination , transducer hold baby 's chin swallowing . Babies show sign slow suck swallow development follow-up examination age 4 8 month . Follow-up visit 4 8 month birth include observation baby 's suck swallow ultrasound examination , transducer hold baby 's chin swallowing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The normal term infant birth able suck-swallow coordinated manner sufficient nutritional intake protection upper airway . The integrity post-natal behavior dependent intrauterine growth function orofacial , pharyngeal laryngeal structure upper aerodigestive system . The integrity structure ensure functional postnatal ingestive skill , also contribute prenatal development gastrointestinal tract , regulation amniotic fluid composition , recirculation solute . This develop system thus importance fetal neonatal well-being . However , biometric biophysical data exist detail normal pattern growth development aerodigestive structure human fetus . Further , factor contribute abnormal fetal neonatal deglutitive response fully know . The purpose study establish first anthropomorphic database development aerodigestive structure fetus , sonographic biophysical profile , examine significance fetal ingestive behavior predictor postnatal feed skill at-risk infant . A detailed cross-sectional study development fetal upper aerodigestive tract analysis progression deglutitive skill course gestation may lead early identification factor contribute neonatal swallow dysfunction developmental delay . These data may provide insight underlie intrauterine condition associate infant feeding difficulty . Resulting two- three-dimensional ultrasonic data structural development upper aerodigestive system , couple biophysical data may useful predictor neonate risk nutritional pulmonary sequela . Further , sequential index normal swallowing-sucking skill may guide post-natal decision feed `` readiness '' advance care premature , at-risk infant .</detailed_description>
