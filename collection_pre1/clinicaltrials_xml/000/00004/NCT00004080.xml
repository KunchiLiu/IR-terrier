	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate efficiency tumor cell transduction adenovirus p53 deliver stereotactically patient recurrent progressive resectable glioblastoma multiforme , anaplastic astrocytoma , anaplastic mixed glioma . II . Determine maximum tolerate dose adenovirus p53 deliver stereotactically craniotomy patient . III . Correlate analysis predelivery tumor specimen p53 gene status postdelivery p53 gene status , clinical status , tumor stag patient treated regimen . IV . Correlate analysis postdelivery tumor specimen p53 gene status local tumor immune response postdelivery clinical status tumor image patient treated regimen . OUTLINE : This dose escalation , multicenter study . Patients receive SCH-58500 via stereotactic injection tumor , follow 24-72 hour later craniotomy . Patients undergo tumor resection , follow injection SCH-58500 tumor bed craniotomy . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos SCH-58500 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose immediately precede 3 3-6 patient experience dose limit toxicity . Patients follow day 28 , every 2 month 1 year , annually thereafter , another therapy begin disease progression document . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 21-42 patient accrue study 14-27 month .</detailed_description>
