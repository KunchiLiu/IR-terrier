	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Although use primarily treat malignant disorder blood , allogeneic stem cell transplantation also cure variety non-cancerous , inherited acquire disorder blood . Unfortunately , conventional approach allogeneic stem cell transplantation risky procedure . For non-cancerous condition , risk procedure outweigh potential benefit . This protocol design test new approach allogeneic stem cell transplantation . It hop approach well suited patient non-cancerous blood bone marrow disorder .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Allogeneic Mixed Chimerism Stem Cell Transplant Using Campath Hemoglobinopathies &amp; Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary Objective ( ) : 1 . Evaluate feasibility term mortality , occurrence acute graft versus host disease , grade 3-4/4 toxicity vivo vitro Campath couple concomitantly administer nonmyeloablative fludarabine , cyclophosphamide total body irradiation ( TBI ) follow Human Leukocyte Antigen ( HLA ) 5-6/6 matched family member allo peripheral blood stem cell transplant ( PBSCT ) . 2 . Evaluate engraftment rate HLA 5-6/6 match family member patient receive vivo Campath follow concomitantly administer fludarabine , cyclophosphamide total body irradiation ( TBI ) condition regimen Campath-treated peripheral blood stem cell ( vitro vivo exposure ) . Secondary Objective ( ) : 1 . Evaluate response rate survival patient receive non-myeloablative conditioning regimen vivo Campath follow concomitantly administer fludarabine , cyclophosphamide total body irradiation ( TBI ) Campath-treated peripheral blood stem cell . 2 . Evaluate recovery immune function post engraftment regimen .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must clinical material review transplanting institution diagnosis confirm Performance status must Cancer Leukemia Group B ( CALGB ) Performance Status ( PS ) 0 , 1 , 2 . Patients must 5/6 6/6 HLA match family member donor evaluate deem able provide PBSCs and/or marrow transplant team . Donor must &lt; 50 % Hemoglobin S ( HgS ) hemoglobin electrophoresis . Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) status donor assess , use exclusion criterion . Patients must meet follow laboratory parameter unless due disease status determine treat physician : 1. bilirubin hepatic transaminase creatinine must review transplantation center deem acceptable . 2 . HIV antibody negative . 3. hematocrit , white cell count , platelet count hematologic status review treat physician patient deem acceptable . Patient must agree use form adequate birth control period receive chemotherapy postchemotherapy medication relate transplant . Patients must also rest multiple gated acquisition scan ( MUGA ) echocardiogram Pulmonary Function Tests ( PFTs ) Diffusing Capacity Lung Carbon Monoxide ( DLCO ) perform transplant . Recommended minimum standard include Ejection Fraction ( EF ) great 40 % DLCO great 40 % less toxic regimen . Appropriate cardiology pulmonary consultation consider patient severe cardiac lung disease initiation therapy . I ) Hemoglobinopathies : ( ) Sickle Cell Anemia history one follow despite treatment standard therapy hydroxyurea : ) 2 episode acute chest syndrome since age 13 year ii ) pulmonary hypertension measure tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity great 2.5m/s iii ) 2 painful crisis per year require medical care analgesia excess need baseline . iv ) history cerebrovascular accident ( b ) Thalassemia major : Those eligible either cardiac hepatic sequela thalassemia document biopsy functional study . For hepatic damage , would increase size 50 % liver double total bilirubin , aspartate transaminase ( AST ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , alkaline phosphatase . To eligible transplant due cardiac damage , must evidence leave ventricular dysfunction measure MUGA scan echocardiography . II ) Bone marrow failure Disorders 1 . Severe Aplastic Anemia : Cytopenia consist least 2 follow 3 : absolute neutrophil count less 500/μL , platelet count less 20,000/μL , reticulocyte count less 50,000/μL . 2 . Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ( PNH ) : Patients must history either lifethreatening thrombosis , cytopenia , transfusion dependence recurrent , debilitate hemolytic crisis 3 . Pure red cell aplasia : Patients must transfusion dependent . pregnant lactate woman , patient major medical psychiatric illness treat transplant physician feel could seriously compromise compliance protocol patient know history allergy murine protein</criteria>
