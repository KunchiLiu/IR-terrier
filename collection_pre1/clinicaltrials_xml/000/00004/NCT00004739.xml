	<brief_summary>The use protease inhibitor increase HIV-infected child treatment result improved body weight , improve immune status less hospitalization . However , recent report suggest drug may also associate negative side-effects , specifically syndrome diabetes fat redistribution . Development fat redistribution/diabetes syndrome recently report HIV-infected child , well adult . Diabetes associated complication increase heart disease , eye disease loss kidney function . Thus development diabetes significant problem could outweigh benefit obtain treat patient protease inhibitor . One major cause diabetes lack normal response insulin ( insulin resistance ) . Insulin resistance tend bad family member one parent diabetes , also bad certain ethnic group . The first major purpose study measure insulin resistance HIV-infected child take protease inhibitor , compare finding patient treat protease inhibitor . We also follow patient newly treat protease inhibitor two year evaluate change insulin sensitivity . These result correlate patient 's family history diabetes ethnicity , help u good predict child `` risk '' development diabetes protease inhibitor therapy . Children HIV infection often problem gain enough weight poor linear growth ( height ) . One likely reason way body use store protein . The second purpose study measure protein turnover correlate finding growth data . We also plan study effect protease inhibitor therapy protein turnover . We believe study provide knowledge help clinician formulate recommendation nutritional medical therapy .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion HIV infect child ) The participant may either antiretroviral treatment naive , experienced . Those individual experience treat least one new drug addition protease inhibitor . The selection new antiretroviral regimen direct review patient 's previous drug treatment history and/or genetic phenotypic characteristic patient 's virus ; b ) We recruit subject CDC category . Disease severity subsequently analyzed covariate ; c ) There height , weight anthropometric inclusion criterion ( factor analyze covariates ) ; ) All subject study acute superinfection least four week . Inclusion criterion control Control volunteer normal healthy child match HIV infected population age , weight race . Normal health nonHIV infect status determine history medical record review . Ethical consideration preclude HIV test normal child . Separate inform consent assent form utilized control HIV population . Exclusion criterion HIV infect child Use Megace @ another progestational agent , use anabolic steroid , acute superinfection Exclusion criterion control Previous medical history chronic disease glucocorticoid use last six week . Adopted child knowledge family history .</criteria>
