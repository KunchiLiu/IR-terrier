	<brief_summary>This study test effectiveness experimental drug call LY300164 improve Parkinson 's disease symptom , movement impairment tremor , well involuntary movement produce long-term treatment levodopa . Patients relatively advanced ( Stage II IV ) Parkinson 's disease 30 75 year age may eligible 8-week study . Participants complete medical history physical examination , include blood test electrocardiogram , possibly brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , CT scan , chest X-ray . Patients stop take anti-parkinsonism medication except levodopa ( Sinemet ) experimental drug study . For first 1 3 day , patient hospital levodopa `` dose-finding '' procedure . For study , levodopa infuse vein 8 hour , symptom monitor frequently determine dos produce two result : 1 ) dose less needed relieve symptom , 2 ) dose relief symptom , may produce dyskinesia . When dose rate determine , patient begin treatment one two group . One take LY300164 3 time day , along levodopa , 3 week . The second group take placebo tablet ( look-alike tablet active ingredient ) levodopa schedule LY300164 group . A brief medical examination routine blood urine test do weekly . The drug dose increase every 3 4 day significant side effect occur maximal dose reach . Patients closely monitor 4 hour every increase . At end 3 week , maximal dose reach , patient readmitted hospital 2 3 day second levodopa dose-finding study , continue LY300164 placebo . After test , patient resume take levodopa experimental drug placebo another 2 week . At end 2-weeks , entire procedure repeat group , treatment switched-that , patient take LY300164 take placebo , patient take placebo take drug . At end second 3 week , levodopa infusion procedure repeat . Throughout study , parkinsonism symptom dyskinesias evaluate blood sample draw periodically measure drug level .</brief_summary>
