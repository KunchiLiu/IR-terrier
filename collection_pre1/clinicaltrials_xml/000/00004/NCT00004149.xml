	<brief_title>Arsenic Trioxide Treating Patients With Stage IV Prostate Cancer That Has Not Responded Previous Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine efficacy arsenic trioxide patient metastatic stage IVA IVB hormone-refractory prostate cancer . - Determine toxicity drug patient population . - Assess , preliminary manner , effect drug pain control patient . - Assess potential value serial quantitative prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) prostate-specific membrane antigen ( PSMA ) mRNA determination RNA peripheral blood mononuclear cell surrogate marker disease response patient treated drug . - Assess pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics drug patient . - Assess feasibility use pretreatment bone marrow evaluation PSA PMSA mRNA level pi class glutathione S-transferase expression ( i.e. , eliminate glutathione level ) potential correlate disease response patient treated drug . OUTLINE : Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV 2 hour day 1-5 8-12 one course . Treatment continue biweekly infusion least 14 additional week absence disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , excessive increase serum prostate-specific antigen . Pain assess baseline biweekly treatment . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 17-37 patient accrue study within 12-24 month .</detailed_description>
