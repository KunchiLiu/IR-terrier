	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Identify family characteristic , personality trait , religious spiritual belief significantly affect individual decision regard mutation test hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer ( HNPCC ) ( recruitment new family HNPCC stop 04-26-06 , recruitment person within family already participate continue ) . - Determine impact negative v positive mutation test result family relationships psychological status . - Assess expectation regard test influence perception risk response risk notification . - Determine impact risk notification frequency screening/prevention activity . - Formulate standard diagnostic algorithm determine microsatellite instability base analysis tumor extensive array marker correlate specific replication error phenotypes germline genotype . OUTLINE : Participants complete baseline assessment knowledge , risk perception , personality trait follow structured pretest education session . Participants offer choice whether undergo genetic test mutation hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer ( HNPCC ) gene . Participants choose undergo genetic test provide blood sample purpose . Participants undergo genetic test receive result counsel ( recruitment new family HNPCC stop 04-26-06 , recruitment person within family already participate continue ) . Available surveillance option discuss participant . Psychological behavioral outcome reassess 6 12 month choose choose genetic testing . Tumors ( available ) analyze mismatch repair deficiency basis microsatellite instability . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 900 participant accrue study , specific target 200 individual experience cancer within family identify hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer ( HNPCC ) mutation ( recruitment new family HNPCC stop 04-26-06 , recruitment person within family already participate continue ) .</detailed_description>
