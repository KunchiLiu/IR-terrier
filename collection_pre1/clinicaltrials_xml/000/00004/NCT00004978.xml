	<brief_summary>The purpose study see effective give HIV positive patient recombinant interleukin-2 ( rIL-2 ) addition anti-HIV therapy . Patients follow minimum 4 year study long-term effect rIL-2 HIV disease progression . Anti-HIV therapy successful treat HIV positive patient keep viral load ( level HIV blood ) low . However , anti-HIV drug completely rid body virus , immune system never completely restored HIV positive patient . Doctors hope give patient recombinant interleukin-2 ( rIL-2 ) addition anti-HIV therapy help improve immune system keep healthy long period time . rIL-2 hormone naturally produce body immune response microbial infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An International Study Evaluate Recombinant Interleukin-2 HIV Positive Patients Taking Anti-retroviral Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Much progress make implement potent antiretroviral therapy able maximally suppress viral replication . However , drug combination result viral eradication , many patient , virologic immunologic control maintain . Even among patient apparent virologic control , `` ceiling effect '' seem exist failure CD4 cell count rise average 100 150 cells/mm^3 , least first 2 year therapy . The incomplete recovery immune function initiation therapy remain obstacle management HIV . Preservation immune function direct expansion CD4 lymphocytes rIL-2 could represent significant additional treatment strategy . It also speculate recently rIL-2 combination potent antiretroviral therapy may useful approach purge HIV latently infect CD4 cell . It hop intervention rIL-2 therapy combination antiretroviral therapy early stage HIV infection prevent CD4 T-cell depletion result few AIDS-defining illness antiretroviral therapy alone . Patients randomize receive subcutaneous ( SC ) rIL-2 therapy rIL-2 therapy . All patient must take regimen combination antiretroviral treatment , choice therapy discretion treat clinician . Antiretroviral medication provide study . Recombinant IL-2 give SC 5 consecutive day every 8 week least 3 cycle unless toxicity contraindication develop . After first three cycle , additional cycle give discretion patient 's physician , general goal maintain patient 's CD4 cell count twice baseline level 1,000 cells/mm^3 long possible . Patients rIL-2 group receive injection . Patients treatment group see every 4 month follow-up data collection monitor viral load CD4 cell count . All patient follow minimum 4 year . During trial , patient SC rIL-2 group give rIL-2 point . However , end study , rIL-2 find effective reduce rate disease progression [ AS PER AMENDMENT 12/15/00 : ( new recurrent event ) ] , include death , patient offer rIL-2 .</detailed_description>
