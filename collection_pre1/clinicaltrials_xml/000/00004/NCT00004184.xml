	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody Therapy Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine toxicity human anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody vaccine ( 4B5 ) plus adjuvant sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) alum patient stage III IV melanoma high risk recurrence follow surgical resection . II . Determine whether 4B5 associate development humoral and/or cellular anti-anti-idiotypic immune response patient . III . Determine whether immune response generate 4B5 also direct melanoma-associated GD2 antigen patient . IV . Determine whether 4B5 plus adjuvant GM-CSF alum elicit immune response GD2 patient . OUTLINE : Patients assign sequentially one two treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive human anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody vaccine ( 4B5 ) sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) subcutaneously ( SQ ) day 0 , 14 , 28 , 42 . Patients receive GM-CSF alone SQ vaccination site day 2 , 3 , 4 follow immunization . Arm II : Patients receive 4B5 plus alum SQ day 0 , 14 , 28 , 42 . Cohorts 5 patient receive treatment every 2 week 4 course absence unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A maximum 50 patient ( 25 per arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
