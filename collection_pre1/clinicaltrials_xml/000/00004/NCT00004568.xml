	<brief_summary>This study design learn natural history inherit neurological disorder role heredity development . It examine genetics , symptom , disease progression , treatment , psychological behavioral impact diseases follow category : hereditary peripheral neuropathy ; hereditary myopathy ; muscular dystrophy ; hereditary motor neuron disorder ; mitochondrial myopathy ; ataxia ; hereditary neurocognitive disorder ; inherit neurological disorder without known diagnosis ; others . Many disease , affect brain , spinal cord , muscle , nerve , rare poorly understood . Children adult age various inherited neurological disorder may eligible study . Participants undergo detailed medical family history , family tree drawn . They also physical neurological examination may include blood test urine test , EEG ( brain wave recording ) , psychological test , speech language rehabilitation evaluation . A blood sample skin biopsy may take genetic testing . Depending individual patient symptom , image test X-rays , CT MRI scan muscle nerve test may also do . Information study may provide good understanding genetic underpinnings disorder , contribute improve diagnosis , treatment , genetic counseling , perhaps lead additional study area .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Neurogenetics Branch ( NGB ) within National Institute Neurological Disorders Stroke ( NINDS ) conduct study evaluate provide genetic diagnosis participant various diagnose undiagnosed neurological condition . OBJECTIVES : The primary objective protocol provide resource patient enrollment new research protocol throughout NGB NIH laboratory . Evaluating diagnose participant allow NGB specialist maintain expertise gain additional knowledge course various neurological disorder . The information obtain allow evaluation diagnosis study neurological disease . This understanding may lead idea future protocol . In case , blood biologic sample ( include urine , saliva , cheek swab ) obtain future laboratory study . STUDY POPULATION The number participant enrol set 2,000 patient neurological disease unaffected relative . DESIGN : This observational diagnostic study multiple neurological disease progression pathophysiology . OUTCOME MEASURES : No formal outcome measure ; however clinical assessment enrol participant use characterize disease manifestation . In addition , DNA sample obtain may use identify verify causative mutation well identify novel gene , may help establish pathogenic mechanism genotype-phenotype correlation .</detailed_description>

There logical limit ; however total number participant enrol protocol restrict . No 2,000 participant either diagnose undiagnosed neurological condition unaffected relative enrol evaluation diagnostic protocol . INCLUSION CRITERIA : Participants eligible : Have either know suspect , inherited neurological disease , OR unaffected relative ( first , second , third , high degree relative ) participant genetic neurological disease . Have ability understand sign inform consent parent/legal guardian minor child legal guardian provide consent adult without consent capacity . Aged 2 year . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Participants eligible : Are unwilling unable follow clinically indicate . Have systemic disease compromise ability provide adequate neurologic examination diagnosis . INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR MALI : Participants eligible : Have either know suspect , inherited neurological disease , OR unaffected relative ( first , second , third , high degree relative ) participant genetic neurological disease . Have ability understand sign inform consent parent/legal guardian minor child legal guardian provide consent adult without consent capacity . Aged 2 year .
