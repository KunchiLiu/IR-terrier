	<brief_summary>Some child certain language disorder may properly process sound hear , result language impairment . The purpose study determine deficit auditory temporal processing way brain analyzes time pattern sound inherited trait . Families auditory temporal processing deficit seek order identify gene responsible auditory temporal processing deficit . Children adults diagnosis history language impairment family family member affect non-affected eligible two-part study . In Part 1 , participant undergo series language test listen test measure various characteristic perceive sound . In Part 2 , interview language disorder , learn disability , medical problem family member . This information use construct pedigree ( family tree diagram ) show pattern inheritance family trait . Study subject whose pedigree indicate language disorder may hereditary family provide either small blood sample ( 1 2 tablespoon ) tissue specimen obtain cheek swab ( rub inside cheek small brush cotton swab ) . The sample use isolate DNA genetic analysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective Recent research implicate auditory process deficit etiology language impairment , standard methodology employ determine whether auditory process deficit heritable trait . We investigate whether auditory processing skill auditory processing disorder ( APDs ) hereditary . Study Population We study same-sex twin ( healthy volunteer ) individual score top bottom 10th percentile auditory processing test first-degree family member . Design : A Two-Phase , Staged Study Our approach use two classical method demonstrate heritability : comparison monozygotic ( MZ ) dizygotic ( DZ ) concordance rate twin measure familial aggregation trait . While variety auditory processing test common use , standard battery test diagnosis APD . Moreover , normal variation performance many test know . We systematically evaluate test auditory process variation general population evidence heritability . Phase 1 Twin study We evaluate variety auditory processing test MZ same-sex DZ twin . This initial phase study design provide data performance MZ twin pair compare performance DZ twin pair . Statistical modeling use estimate relative contribution heredity environment auditory processing skill . In addition , examine variation auditory processing skills general population twin . This allow u identify auditory processing skill test great heritable component , establish normative data test administer . Phase 2 Family aggregation study Based outcome Phase 1 , auditory processing test skills high heritable component select evaluation probands . Those score top bottom 10th percentile eligible participation probands phase study . Variation skills general population , determine twin data ( Phase 1 ) publish norm , available , used determine top bottom 10th percentile . This test set administer probands least two first-degree relative allow u determine whether trait relate auditory processing occur within family rate great chance . Outcome Measures Phase 1 outcome measure individual performance test auditory process skill comparative performance MZ DZ co-twin pair test . Phase II outcome measure performance auditory processing measure probands family member , affectance rate observe families. &lt; TAB &gt;</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 685 year age Native English speaker , English first language Phase 1 Same sex twin ( MZ DZ ) willing able participate test procedure . Phase 2 Score top bottom 10th percentile test auditory process firstdegree relative someone score top bottom 10th percentile willing able participate test procedure . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Hearing loss , define air conduction pure tone threshold ( 2508000 Hz ) exceed 20 dBHL ; airbone gap , even presence normal hearing sensitivity , exceed 10 dBHL ; and/or abnormal tympanometry . History chronic ( fluid middle ear 4 month ) recurrent otitis medium ( 4 episode acute otitis medium one year ) History ear surgery . History diagnosis central nervous system disorder , include limited : Intracranial tumor Cerebrovascular disease Degenerative CNS disorder CNS trauma Encephalitis Meningitis Auditory neuropathy Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) Attention deficit disorder ( ADD ) Currently take medication capable alter CNS function ( e.g . antidepressant , anxiolytic , psychostimulant drug ritalin ) . History treatment ototoxic medication may affect ultrahigh frequency hearing ( e.g . cisplatin , aminoglycoside antibiotic ) . Unable provide consent assent</criteria>
