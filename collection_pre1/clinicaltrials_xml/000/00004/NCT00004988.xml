	<brief_summary>This study examine safety toxicity intravenously administer genetically modify type Salmonella bacteria ( VNP20009 ) impact tumor growth advance metastatic cancer ( cancer spread primary site ) . The first patient study give small dose VNP20009 , enter later receive increasingly large dos . This do determine maximum dose give without serious side effect . Normally , Salmonella bacteria ingest food water cause diarrhea severe illness . The bacteria study alter genetically inject vein circulate blood less likelihood cause side effect . It believe bacteria travel blood tumor infect . In study mouse , tumor growth slow animal whose tumor infect VNP0009 . Patients advance metastatic cancer 18 year age old whose disease respond standard treatment , treatment , may eligible study . Candidates undergo medical history physical examination , include blood test , scan , X-rays , electrocardiogram , urine , stool blood culture . Study participant admit hospital 2 4 day . On day 1 , receive first dose VNP0009 , infuse 30-minute period intravenous catheter ( small plastic tube insert vein ) . Blood drawn every day determine bacteria still body . After discharge , patient return hospital day approximately 1-2 week 4-5 week additional blood test measure level bacteria collection blood , urine stool sample . Patients whose tumor beneath skin may ask one two tumor remove surgically . Patients test approximately 4-5 week , include CTs X-rays , determine size extent tumor . Patients whose tumor remain size small start treatment , whose side effect acceptable offered second treatment cycle . Those whose tumor grow treatment take study . Patients remain study begin second cycle approximately day 36 . Tumor growth evaluate day 64 70 , third cycle offer patient whose tumor remain stable shrunk . Patients may 12 treatment cycle long evaluation continue show tumor stable shrinking . Completing 12 cycle take 13 month . Patients continue evaluate treatment end , agree continue follow-up . Patients must follow health precaution prevent infect others Salmonella bacteria long , , remain infected . These include , example , stringent hand wash practice avoid contact people weaken immune system . All precaution explain study participant . Patients leave study must take antibiotic therapy rid body remain bacteria . They return urine , stool blood culture 30 day start antibiotic , may undergo three type scan look sit infection . Treatment give need .</brief_summary>

EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients one follow criterion eligible study participation : Diagnosis lymphoma hematologic malignancy .
