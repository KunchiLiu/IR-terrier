	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Plus QS21 Treating Patients With Progressive Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine immunization glycosylated MUC-2 antigen keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( KLH ) conjugate plus immunological adjuvant QS21 induce antibody , helper T cell , and/or cytotoxic T cell response glycosylated MUC-2 patient progressive prostate cancer . II . Determine safety treatment regimen patient population . III . Determine effect glycosylated MUC-2 antigen KLH conjugate T cell response MUC-2 skin test patient . IV . Assess post immunization change prostate specific antigen level objective parameter disease include radionuclide bone scan and/or measurable disease patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive vaccination glycosylated MUC-2 antigen keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate subcutaneously ( SQ ) plus immunological adjuvant QS21 SQ week 1-3 , 7 , 15 , 27 total 6 vaccination . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year disease progression . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 3-15 patient accrue study within 1 year .</detailed_description>
