	<brief_summary>This study test effectiveness experimental treatment peritoneal cancer involve surgical removal tumor , perfusion abdomen surgery heated solution drug cisplatin , post-surgery combination chemotherapy abdomen fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) paclitaxel . Patients certain peritoneal cancer whose tumor confine abdomen may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , include blood test , electrocardiogram possibly bone scan , brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , chest , abdomen pelvic CT scan . Participants undergo surgery remove much tumor possible . Part intestine , pancreas , stomach entire spleen may also remove affected . During surgery , tumor remove , two catheter ( thin plastic tube ) place abdomen . A chemotherapy solution contain anti-cancer drug cisplatin heat temperature 108.6 degree ( 10 degree normal body temperature ) deliver abdomen one catheter drain another . During treatment , drug call sodium thiosulfate give vein reduce risk side effect cisplatin , particularly kidney damage . After 90 minute bath abdomen solution , drug rinse abdomen catheter remove . Another small catheter place leave inside abdomen one end come skin . Seven 12 day operation , anti-cancer drug 5-FU paclitaxel give catheter . After complete recovery surgery , catheter remove patient discharge hospital . Clinic visit schedule periodic follow-up examination , imaging , test 3 6 month surgery every 6 month 5 year long disease worsen . Patients whose disease progress take study refer back local physician refer alternative care research study . Patients also ask assess therapy affect general health well . This require fill two quality-of-life ( QOL ) questionnaires surgery follow-up visit surgery . Each questionnaire take 15 minute complete .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Peritoneal Cancer With Surgery , Perfused Heated Cisplatin Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Cytoreductive surgery plus aggressive combination intraperitoneal chemotherapy may significantly alter natural history peritoneal carcinomatosis . The purpose study examine treatment result continuous hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion ( CHPP ) cisplatin plus early postoperative intraperitoneal dwell therapy 5-FU paclitaxel cytoreductive surgery peritoneal carcinomatosis . Objectives : The primary objective study determine response survival continuous hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion cisplatin early postoperative intraperitoneal dwell therapy 5-FU paclitaxel . Response assess measuring time clinical radiographic recurrence disease . The secondary objective include determination pharmacokinetics paclitaxel 5-FU delivered peritoneal cavity impact continuous hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion cisplatin early postoperative intraperitoneal dwell therapy 5-FU paclitaxel patient ' health relate quality life . The evaluation pure population tumor normal mesothelial cell - determine signal transduction pathway distinct tumor versus normal tissue - see specific cell pathway activate inhibited consequence therapy . - validate technology provide informative data event potential surrogate clinical benefit therapy biological behavior tumor . Eligibility : The patient great equal 30 kg must histologically prove peritoneal carcinomatosis one follow histology : 1 ) primary peritoneal mesothelioma ; 2 ) low grade mucinous adenocarcinoma ( include low grade mucinous neoplasm borderline malignant potential ) ; 3 ) adenocarcinoma gastrointestinal tract origin ( low grade mucinous , exclude pancreatic cancer ) , disease confine peritoneal cavity . Patients may treatment disease within previous 30 day recover toxicity . Patients must meet certain safety laboratory criterion may major medical disorder would place unacceptable risk major surgical procedure . Patients may receive prior intraperitoneal platinum therapy . Design : Patients undergo cytoreductive surgery follow CHPP cisplatin . A peritoneal dialysis catheter insert peritoneal cavity time laparotomy . In early postoperative period ( day 2 - 10 ) intraperitoneal dwell chemotherapy paclitaxel ( 125 mg/M^2 ) 5-FU ( 800 mg/M^2 ) administer . Patients see 4 - 6 week discharge physical examination laboratory screen QOL evaluation . Tumor marker include stage . Patients see every 3 month first year surgery every 6 month thereafter . At visit undergo physical examination , laboratory screening ( include tumor marker ) CT scan chest , abdomen pelvis QOL evaluation . The objective pilot study estimate ability peritoneal perfusion achieve potentially tolerable disease free survival patient variety tumor . For class tumor , appropriate , distinct median disease free survival target principal endpoint . The trial conduct set three single-stage phase II study , early stopping rule clearly unacceptable outcome . It expect accrual 59 patient adenocarcinoma gastrointestinal origin ( low grade mucinous ) , 48 patient low grade mucinous adenocarcinoma , 96 patient primary peritoneal mesothelioma ( total accrual 203 ) require approximately 5 -6 year . Results assess following time radiographic clinical recurrence disease survival . Patients stratify entry base histology . This include 3 cohort : 1 ) peritoneal mesothelioma ; 2 ) low grade mucinous adenocarcinoma ( include low grade mucinous neoplasm borderline malignant potential ) ; 3 ) adenocarcinoma gastrointestinal origin ( low grade mucinous ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : The patient must histologically prove peritoneal carcinomatosis follow histology : primary peritoneal mesothelioma ; low grade mucinous adenocarcinoma ( include low grade mucinous neoplasm borderline malignant potential ) ; adenocarcinoma gastrointestinal tract origin ( low grade mucinous , exclude pancreatic cancer ) . Radiologic workup must demonstrate disease confine peritoneal cavity . Radiologic workup prior abdominal exploration must consistent disease debulked residual size le 1 cm diameter per tumor deposit . Patients must Eastern Cooperative Onocology Group ( ECOG ) performance status less equal 2 . Patients must minimum expected duration survival great 8 week . Patients must recover toxicity prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy radiotherapy least 30 day past date last treatment . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients exclude concomitant medical problem would place unacceptable risk major surgical procedure . Patients increase risk coronary artery disease cardiac dysfunction ( e.g. , age great 65 , history hypertension , first degree relative atherosclerotic coronary artery disease ) undergo cardiac evaluation eligible demonstrate significant irreversible ischemia stress thallium study injection fraction le 40 percent . Patients shortness breath minimal exertion risk pulmonary disease ( e.g. , chronic smoker ) undergo pulmonary function test eligible forced expiratory volume 1 ( FEV1 ) less 1.2 liter maximum voluntary ventilation le 50 percent expect . Patients baseline neurological toxicity Grade 3 great exclude potential neurotoxicity associate platinum paclitaxel therapy . Patients ineligible creatinine great 1.5 creatinine clearance le 70 mL/min . Patients ineligible white blood cell ( WBC ) less 3000/microliters platelet less 75,000mL/mm ( 3 ) . Patients must serum aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) within 5 time upper limit normal total serum bilirubin le 3 time upper limit normal , define upper limit grade 2 treatment related toxicity .</criteria>
