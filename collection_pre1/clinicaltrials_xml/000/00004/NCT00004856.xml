	<brief_title>Trastuzumab Treating Patients With Previously Treated , Locally Advanced , Metastatic Cancer Urothelium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response rate patient previously treat , locally advanced metastatic transitional cell carcinoma urothelium treat trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) . II . Determine safety drug patient population . III . Determine overall progression-free survival patient population treat drug . OUTLINE : Patients receive load dose trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) IV 90 minute day 1 week 1 . For subsequent dos , patient receive trastuzumab IV 30 minute weekly . Treatment may continue 1 year absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
