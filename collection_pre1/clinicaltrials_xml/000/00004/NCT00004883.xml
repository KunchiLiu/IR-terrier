	<brief_title>Trastuzumab Treating Patients With Stage IIIB Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer That Overexpresses HER2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine activity trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) patient stage IIIB IV HER2-overexpressing non-small cell lung cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine duration response patient treat regimen . II . Determine toxicity treatment regimen patient population . III . Assess level circulate HER2 correlate HER2 expression patient population . V. Correlate circulate HER2 level non-small cell lung cancer tissue HER2 expression . OUTLINE : Patients receive trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment continue week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 8 week disease progression death . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 84 patient ( 42 per stratum ) accrue study within 17.5 month .</detailed_description>
