	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Biological therapy BCG use different way stimulate immune system stop cancer cell grow . Interferon alfa may interfere growth cancer cell . Combining therapy may effective treatment bladder cancer . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness BCG plus interferon alfa 2b treating patient bladder cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BCG Plus Interferon Alfa 2b Treating Patients With Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare efficacy BCG combine interferon alfa 2b patient superficial bladder cancer . II . Determine relative local systemic toxicity regimen effect quality life patient . III . Evaluate effect BCG dose reduction therapy symptom tolerance ability maintain extend treatment plan patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior BCG exposure BCG tolerance ( prior BCG exposure v prior BCG exposure , BCG tolerant v prior BCG interferon alfa treatment failure , BCG intolerant ) . Patients receive induction therapy consist vary strength BCG plus interferon alfa intravesically weekly 6 week . Patients disease recurrence resectable and/or amenable intravesical therapy follow first induction course may receive additional course induction therapy . At 3 month , patient undergo evaluatory cystoscopy cytology . At 4 month , patient evidence disease receive vary strength maintenance therapy consist BCG interferon alfa intravesically weekly 3 week . Treatment repeat every 6 month 3 course . Quality life assess within 1 week follow last induction maintenance treatment prior cystoscopy . Patients follow every 3 month 6 month , every 6 month 1.5 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 660 patient accrue study within 2.5 year .</detailed_description>
