	<brief_summary>This study compare anti-HIV drug combination protease inhibitor plus nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) one include three nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) plus NNRTI . NNRTIs , NRTIs , protease inhibitor type anti-HIV drug block virus way . This study try find treatment regimen contain protease inhibitor plus NNRTI different effect rise CD4 cell compare treatment make three NRTIs plus NNRTI . CD4 cell cell immune system fight infection . This study also try see combination drug use study safe use HIV-positive patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study design define dynamic mechanisms CD4 cell rise see follow administration potent antiretroviral therapy . It ascertain treatment regimen contain nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) different effect CD4 dynamic regimen compose protease inhibitor NNRTI . Patients randomize one two treatment arm list . They stratify base CD4 count whether choose participate substudy A5036s . Arm A ( protease inhibitor plus NNRTI regimen ) : At Day 0 ( entry ) , patient begin take LPV/RTV . At Day 3 , patient add NVP , daily 2 week twice daily remainder study . Arm B ( triple reverse transcriptase inhibitor plus NNRTI regimen ) : At Day 0 ( entry ) , patient begin take 3TC plus d4T plus ABC . At Day 3 , patient add NVP , daily 2 week twice daily remainder study . HIV RNA analysis perform Weeks 4 5 . If mean least 1.0 log10 low baseline HIV RNA , patient may continue study treatment . If mean least 1.0 log10 low , however , patient discontinue study later Week 8 . After 8 week treatment , patient may change antiretroviral medication permission protocol chair vice chair . Regular clinical evaluation conduct . Blood drawn determine HIV RNA quantification , absolute CD4 CD8 count , immunological evaluation , telomere assay , part store future testing . Skin test return visit delayed-type hypersensitivity standard recall antigens do three occasion . Patients remain study 48 week . Substudy A5036s evaluate viral dynamic study treatment . Serial plasma sample collect first 24 hour treatment Day 3 Week 4 . Plasma HIV measurement perform differentiate infectious non-infectious particle production .</detailed_description>
