	<brief_title>Irinotecan Treating Children With Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine efficacy irinotecan child refractory CNS solid tumor . II . Assess toxicity , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics regimen patient population . III . Determine patient UGT1A1 genotype correlate genotype toxicity pharmacokinetic parameter regimen patient . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord type solid tumor ( Ewings/PNET v neuroblastoma v osteosarcoma v rhabdomyosarcoma v solid tumor exclude lymphoma brain tumor ) brain tumor ( medulloblastoma/PNET v brain stem glioma v ependymoma v CNS tumor ) . Patients receive irinotecan IV 60 minute day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 3 week least 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 6 month 4 year annually thereafter death patient enter another POG study .</detailed_description>
