	<brief_title>STI571 Treating Patients With Recurrent Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine maximum tolerate dose dose-limiting toxicity imatinib mesylate patient recurrent Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia . - Characterize pharmacokinetic behavior drug patient population . - Determine preliminarily antileukemic activity drug patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate ( STI571 ) daily 28 day . Treatment continue absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos STI571 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede least 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Patients follow every 6 month 4 year annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A maximum 32 patient accrue study within 3.5 year .</detailed_description>
