	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Diagnostic procedure , PET CT scan , may improve ability detect extent locally advance primary rectal cancer may also help measure patient 's response treatment . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study well PET CT scan detect residual metastatic disease patient locally advance primary rectal cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PET CT Scans Patients With Locally Advanced Primary Rectal Cancer That Can Be Removed During Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET ) superior CT scan monitoring rectal cancer response radiation chemotherapy identify residual rectal cancer rectal wall pelvic lymph node order optimize selection patient suitable sphincter preserve rectal cancer resection local excision . - Determine accuracy FDG-PET detecting extrapelvic metastatic disease primary rectal cancer patient consider operable basis currently accept diagnostic work-up , include abdominal CT scan chest x-ray . OUTLINE : This diagnostic study conduct concurrently multimodality management . Within 1-2 week prior start preoperative radiotherapy/chemotherapy , patient undergo baseline positron emission tomography ( PET ) image thorax , abdomen , pelvis . Patients receive fludeoxyglucose F 18 ( FDG ) IV follow 45 minute later PET image . Patients also undergo baseline CT image abdomen pelvis . A CT scan chest obtain prestudy chest x-ray abnormal . Patients receive preoperative radiotherapy/chemotherapy . Within 4-6 week completion radiotherapy/chemotherapy , patient undergo repeat FDG-PET imaging CT scan . Patients undergo surgical resection 1-2 week later . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 125 patient accrue study within 3 year .</detailed_description>
