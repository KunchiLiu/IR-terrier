	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining one drug may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase I/II trial study effectiveness combine topotecan paclitaxel treat patient advance non-small cell lung cancer advance solid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topotecan Paclitaxel Treating Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Other Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Phase I : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) oral topotecan combine fix dose paclitaxel patient advance non-small lung cancer ( NSCLC ) advance solid tumor . II . Determine response rate NSCLC patient treat MTD oral topotecan combine intravenous paclitaxel . III . Determine dose limit toxicity drug combination patient population . Phase II : IV . Determine toxicity regimen MTD patient NSCLC . V. Determine time response , response duration , survival , time progression , rate stable disease patient NSCLC treat regimen MTD . VI . Assess change well-being patient NSCLC treat regimen MTD . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study topotecan . Patients receive oral topotecan day 1-5 paclitaxel IV 3 hour day 1 . Treatment continue every 21 day absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos topotecan maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose limit toxicity . Once MTD determine , additional patient non-small cell lung cancer accrue receive treatment topotecan paclitaxel recommend phase II dose . Quality life assess phase II portion study baseline , treatment course , end study . Patients follow 3 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 3-24 patient accrued phase I dose escalation portion study . A total 14-40 additional non-small cell lung cancer patient accrue phase II portion study .</detailed_description>
