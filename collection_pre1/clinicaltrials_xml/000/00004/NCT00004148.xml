	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Unresectable Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose rV-B7.1 vaccine elicit host immune response associate acceptable toxicity patient malignant metastatic melanoma . II . Determine clinical toxicity associate regimen patient population . III . Determine safety regimen patient population . IV . Assess evidence host antimelanoma immune reactivity follow regimen . V. Determine effect regimen T-cell immunity . VI . Assess clinical response patient population receive regimen . VII . Evaluate quality life patient regimen . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study . Patients receive rV-B7.1 intralesionally every 4 week 8 week ( week 0 , 4 , 8 ) . Treatment continue every 12 week absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression 2 course . Cohorts 6-8 patient receive escalate dos vaccine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 3 8 patient experience dose limit toxicity . Quality life assess treatment , every 4 week , end treatment . Patients follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
