	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation Treating Patients With Stage III Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety feasibility multiple course high dose carboplatin , paclitaxel , topotecan initial chemotherapy combine autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation patient optimally debulked stage III ovarian primary peritoneal carcinoma . II . Determine pathological complete response rate , disease free survival , overall survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Mobilization harvest : Within 8 week surgical debulking , patient receive cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour , follow 4 hour later paclitaxel IV 24 hour . Patients receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously ( SQ ) daily begin 24 hour completion paclitaxel infusion continue blood count recover autologous peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) harvest select CD34+ cell . High dose chemotherapy transplantation ( 3 week PBSC harvest ) : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 24 hour begin day 1 , immediately follow carboplatin IV 2 hour , immediately follow topotecan IV 24 hour . Patients receive G-CSF sub-cutaneously ( SQ ) daily begin 24 hour completion topotecan infusion continue blood count recover 2 day . One quarter PBSC reinfused begin 2 day completion topotecan infusion . Treatment repeat every 4 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients radiographic biochemical complete response undergo laparoscopy second look surgery within 8 week last course chemotherapy . If evidence disease find laparoscopy , exploratory laparotomy must also perform . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter time recurrence death .</detailed_description>
