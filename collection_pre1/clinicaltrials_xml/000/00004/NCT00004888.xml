	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy With Without Trastuzumab Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety feasibility combination liposomal doxorubicin ( Doxil ) Taxotere ( Taxotere ) ± trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) , particularly respect cardiotoxicity . II . To evaluate overall objective response rate , response duration , time treatment failure , median survival patient metastatic breast cancer treat Doxil Taxotere ± Herceptin . III . To determine overall toxicity Doxil Taxotere ± Herceptin patient advance breast cancer . IV . To determine whether association trough plasma level cTnT ( cardiac troponin T ) NT-proBNP ( brain natriuretic peptide ) cardiac event ( CHF LVEF decrease ) . V. To determine tissue plasma level HER2 use several assay explore potential correlation protocol treatment toxicity and/or response . OUTLINE : Patients assign one two treatment arm accord HER2 overexpression status . Arm I ( HER2 nonoverexpressed ) : Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome IV 30 minute follow docetaxel IV 1 hour . Treatment repeat every 3 week 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may receive maintenance therapy docetaxel IV 1 hour either weekly every 3 week . Maintenance continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Arm II ( HER2 overexpressed ) : Patients receive trastuzumab IV 90 minute day 1 , subsequent dose 30 minute . Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV 30 minute follow docetaxel IV 1 hour day 2 course 1 , follow subsequent dos day 1 course . Antibody therapy continue weekly chemotherapy every 3 week 8 course . Patients may receive maintenance therapy trastuzumab IV 30 minute weekly follow docetaxel IV 1 hour weekly every 3 week . Maintenance continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 89 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
