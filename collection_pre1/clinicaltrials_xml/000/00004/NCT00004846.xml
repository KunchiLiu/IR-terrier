	<brief_summary>This study evaluate accuracy experimental test method call nucleic acid amplification technology ( NAT ) detect human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) . This test amplify nucleic acid virus million-fold , allow early detection minute quantity virus blood . Blood donor National Institutes Health 's Department Transfusion Medicine ( blood bank ) blood screen transcription mediate amplification , type NAT test . Donors whose blood find positive HIV HCV NAT test notify asked participate study . Those agree provide blood sample week 3 month . The sample test additional assay detect evidence HIV HCV infection . If test result confirm positive , blood sample collect . The result test significance explain participant . It anticipate NAT screen reduce risk transfusion-related HIV transmission current 1 650,000 1 million risk HCV transmission current 1 100,000 1 350,000 . It possible test completely eliminate risk transmitting disease blood transfusion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In order narrow infectious period ( window ) time viral exposure time virus serologically detect , blood center throughout United States implement nucleic acid testing ( NAT ) HIV HCV . Early study show NAT test significantly narrow infectious window , particularly HCV . There potential NAT testing could completely eradicate transfusion risk HIV HCV . The test thus likely add substantially safety blood transfusion , although license , implement blood supplier transfusion service United States . NAT test currently use IND mechanism . The IND stipulate blood donor need inform supplemental information packet testing perform find positive may recall additional testing . At time recall , IRB approve study-specific informed consent administer additional test perform verify initial NAT result . The Department Transfusion medicine participate national validation NAT test provide donor sample centralize test statistical reporting FDA . The potential benefit test blood safety great risk donor consider minimal . Not seek subject enrollment .</detailed_description>
