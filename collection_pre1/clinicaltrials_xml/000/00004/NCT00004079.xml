	<brief_title>Sarcosinamide Nitrosourea Treating Patients With Metastatic Unresectable Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) oral formulation SarCNU give every 4th day time three schedule ( day 1 , 5 , 9 ) . II . Establish appropriate oral dose SarCNU phase II clinical trial . III . Identify dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) SarCNU . IV . Determine oral bioavailability SarCNU . V. Characterize plasma pharmacokinetics SarCNU . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine whether SarCNU undergo metabolic N-demethylation generate reactive isocyanate specie implicate BCNU pulmonary toxicity . II . Evaluate response treatment SarCNU patient measurable evaluable disease . III . Attempt establish pharmacodynamic relationship response and/or toxicity . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive oral sarcosinamide nitrosourea ( SarCNU ) day 1 , 5 , 9 . Treatment continue every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos SarCNU maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Patients follow 4-5 week posttreatment .</detailed_description>
