	<brief_title>Letrozole Treating Women With Recurrent Metastatic Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine efficacy letrozole , term objective tumor response time progression , woman recurrent metastatic endometrial cancer . II . Determine toxicity letrozole patient . III . Determine relationship tumor receptor status , histologic grade , tumor aromatase activity , tumor response patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral letrozole tablet daily . Treatment continue patient complete partial response disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable disease may discontinue therapy 24 week . Patients follow 1 month every 3 month death . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Up 30 patient accrue study within 12-18 month .</detailed_description>
