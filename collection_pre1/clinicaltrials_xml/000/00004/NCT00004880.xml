	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Advanced Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate safety multiantigen load dendritic cell ( DC ) vaccine patient advance renal cell carcinoma . II . Evaluate immunologic response regimen patient population . III . Evaluate clinical response regimen patient population . OUTLINE : This sequential cohort study . All patient undergo total nephrectomy harvest primary tumor vaccine preparation . Patients without primary tumor undergo surgical resection accessible metastatic site vaccine preparation . Patients assign 1 4 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive vaccination irradiate autologous tumor lysate ( TuLy ) intradermally ( ID ) day 0 follow vaccination multiantigen liposome load dendritic cell ( DC ) ID day 7 , 14 , 21 . Arm II : Patients receive vaccination arm I , except DC pulse tumor cell . Arm III : Patients receive vaccination irradiate autologous tumor lysate ( TuLy ) IV day 0 follow vaccination multiantigen liposome load DC IV day 7 , 14 , 21 . Arm IV : Patients receive vaccination arm III , except DC treat arm II . Patients follow day 28 , 42 , 70 , 112 . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 24 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
