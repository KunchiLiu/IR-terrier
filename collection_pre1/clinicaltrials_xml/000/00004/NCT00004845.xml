	<detailed_description>Evidence inflammatory mechanism contribute neuronal injury Alzheimer 's disease along number epidemiological study suggest non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) may slow rate cognitive deterioration . We select two drug therapeutic trial : rofecoxib naproxen . The trial employ double-blind parallel design three primary treatment group : rofecoxib , naproxen placebo . A total 320 patient enrolled trial randomize three group . Stable use cholinesterase inhibitor , estrogen , low dose aspirin , vitamin E allow . Patients inflammatory disease might respond study medication exclude . The primary outcome measure one year change cognitive subscale Alzheimer 's Disease Assessment Scale ( ADAScog ) . The attainment significant endpoint examine secondary outcome measure . Other secondary measure include CDR sum-of-boxes , Neuropsychiatric Inventory , Quality Life-AD ADCS pharmacoeconomic scale . The influence HLA-DR ( Human Leukocyte Antigen ) genotype clinical progression response treatment also examine .</detailed_description>
