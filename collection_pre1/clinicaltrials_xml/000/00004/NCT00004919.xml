	<brief_title>Irinotecan Cisplatin With Without Amifostine Treating Children With Solid Tumors That Have Not Responded Previous Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) irinotecan administer cisplatin , without amifostine , child refractory solid tumor . II . Determine dose limit toxicity combination irinotecan cisplatin , without amifostine , patient population . III . Determine pharmacokinetics cisplatin without amifostine patient . IV . Quantify leukocyte DNA-platinum adduct formation , without amifostine , correlate response toxicity patient . V. Determine safety efficacy dose schedule administration use phase II clinical trial . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study irinotecan . Treatment A : Patients receive cisplatin IV 1 hour follow immediately irinotecan IV 90 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 6 week . Treatment continue minimum 2 course absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Treatment B : Patients receive therapy treatment A . In addition , amifostine IV administer 15 minute immediately cisplatin . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos irinotecan maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose limit toxicity . Once MTD treatment A determine , additional patient accrue determine MTD treatment B . If myelosuppression dose limit toxicity treatment A , stratum 1 close stratum 2 opens patient less prior therapy receive treatment A . Treatment B open stratum 3 patient . Patients follow every 6 month 4 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 3-30 patient accrue study within 2.5 year .</detailed_description>
