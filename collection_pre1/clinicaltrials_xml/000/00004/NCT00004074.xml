	<brief_title>Interleukin-12 Trastuzumab Treating Patients With Cancer That Has High Levels HER2/Neu</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) combine trastuzumab patient HER2-Neu overexpressing malignancy . II . Determine safety regimen patient . III . Analyze expression interferon-inducible gene tumor tissue patient receive regimen . IV . Characterize natural killer cytokine production patient treat regimen . V. Determine serum interferon gamma level patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) . Patients receive initial load dose trastuzumab IV 90 minute day 1 first week maintenance dose trastuzumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 subsequent week . Patients receive IL-12 IV day 2 5 begin week 3 . Treatment maintenance trastuzumab IL-12 repeat weekly 14 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable respond disease continue treatment 38 additional week . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos IL-12 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose limit toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month thereafter survival . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 15 patient accrue study within 6 month .</detailed_description>
