	<brief_summary>This study investigate effect drug miconazole blood vessel dilation . Miconazole stop production EDHF , substance cause artery dilate . EDHF produce cell line blood vessel . Normal volunteer age 21 60 may participate study . Candidates screen eligibility medical history , physical examination , electrocardiogram routine laboratory test . Those enrolled injected miconazole study effect blood vessel . Study participant take three aspirin tablet . After administration local anesthetic , small tube insert needle artery vein forearm . These used measure blood pressure draw blood sample study . Forearm blood flow measure use pressure cuff place wrist upper arm , strain gauge ( rubber band device ) place around forearm . When cuff inflate , blood flow arm , stretch strain gauge , flow measurement record . Small dose four drugs-bradykinin , sodium nitroprusside , miconazole , LNMMA-will give arterial catheter . Bradykinin stimulate release EDHF low blood pressure . Sodium nitroprusside cause blood vessel dilate use treat high blood pressure heart failure . Miconazole commonly prescribe treat various infection , include vaginal yeast infection , jock itch athlete 's foot . In much high dos , use treat fungal infection spread lung , brain , kidney , bladder . LNMMA inhibit production nitric oxide , another substance produce line cell blood vessel . Blood flow measure throughout study , last approximately 3 hour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The vascular endothelium synthesizes least three potent vasodilator substance : nitric oxide ( NO ) , prostacyclin endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor ( EDHF ) . EDHF release stimulate receptor-dependent agonist acetylcholine bradykinin ( BK ) , lead hyperpolarization underlie smooth muscle cell presumably open Ca ( 2+ ) -activated K ( + ) channel . Indirect pharmacologic evidence suggest EDHF cytochrome P450-derived arachidonic acid metabolite , presumably epoxide . Numerous inhibitor EDHF define animal tissue . Of , miconazole proven safe administer human topical parenteral antifungal agent . At level attain routine clinical use , rapid onset action high specificity inhibition EDHF animal model . This study design investigate safety efficacy intra-arterial miconazole inhibit BK-mediated forearm vasodilation normal volunteer .</detailed_description>
