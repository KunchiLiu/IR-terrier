	<brief_summary>The purpose investigation develop improve magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) technique hardware study brain function . MRI diagnostic tool provide information brain chemistry physiology . This study evaluate new MRI method monitor blood flow region brain response simple task . The MRI machine use study powerful hospital , permit high visual resolution . Normal healthy volunteer 18 year old may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history questionnaire , neurological examination . Study participant yearly MRI scan . For procedure , subject lie stretcher move donut-shaped machine strong magnetic field . A lightweight circular rectangular coil device improve quality image may place head . The scan time vary 20 minute 3 hour ; scan last 45 90 minute . During scan , subject may perform simple task , listen tape , tap finger , move hand , watch screen , smell fragrance . More complex task may require think tone picture respond press button . Information study use develop well image method , turn , permit great understand normal abnormal brain behavior .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective The goal protocol improve spatial resolution sensitivity MRI study change hemodynamics occur central nervous system ( CNS ) healthy control response sensory , motor , cognitive stimulation . CNS functional change characterize measure blood flow , blood transit time , blood oxygenation . These study require order develop implement new image technique research clinical application 3.0T 7.0T MRI . A secondary goal evaluate feasibility combine brain recording technique , electro-encephalography ( EEG ) Magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) , MRI . Techniques develop anatomical spectroscopic MRI take advantage 7T field strength , extend parallel image strategy 7T realize full gain sensitivity . The aim obtain high resolution anatomical MRI , high temporal spatial resolution blood oxygenation ( BOLD ) blood flow ( perfusion ) image , spectroscopic study metabolites brain . All technique perform normal , healthy volunteer . Study Population Any healthy , male female volunteer 18-65 year age ; subject must capable understanding procedure requirement study willing sign inform consent document . Design The technical development study design develop evaluate new MR pulse sequence hardware perform MRI functional MRI CNS 3.0T 7T high spatial resolution . Outcome Measures The primary outcome study ability acquire anatomical functional image human brain high spatial resolution , i.e . 100-300 micron 750-1000 micron respectively . The relative merit blood flow BOLD fMRI technique , particular signal characteristic establish . In addition , anticipate ability acquire ( proton ) spectroscopic data 5mm resolution . Another outcome ability acquire artifact-free EEG data concurrently functional MRI data .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1865 year age good general health able understand procedure requirement give informed consent EXCLUSION CRITERIA : All Subjects answer NMR safety screen form ( Appendix C ) Healthy volunteer form ( Appendix B ) . A subject exclude he/she : implanted medical device underwent brain surgery , central nervous system illness , neurological lesion history neurological psychiatric disorder ( define DSM5 ) medical problem , diabetes mellitus , hypertension , pulmonary airway disease , heart failure , coronary artery disease , history sleep apnea . diagnosable substance dependence metal body due trauma surgery lie comfortably 120 minute pregnant sustain shrapnel injury work machinist , occupation result metal shaving eye claustrophobia recurrent migraine require medication The contraindication MRI 3.0 T 7T almost identical , except 7T also exclude ferromagnetic dental bridge and/or crown .</criteria>
