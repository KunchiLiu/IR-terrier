	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining one drug may kill tumor cell . It yet know chemotherapy regimen effective ovarian epithelial cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study high-dose chemotherapy see well work compare standard chemotherapy treat patient stage III stage IV ovarian epithelial cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High-Dose Chemotherapy Compared With Standard Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Ovarian Epithelial Cancer That Has Been Removed During Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare two-year progression-free survival patient optimally debulked stage III IV ovarian epithelial cancer undergo high-dose sequential chemotherapy v standard chemotherapy . - Compare overall survival , toxicity , quality life patient population receive two treatment regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive 5 course sequential high-dose chemotherapy follow : - Courses 1 2 : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour cyclophosphamide IV 2 hour day 1 follow peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) collection . Patients receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously ( SC ) begin 24 hour follow chemotherapy continue target number PBSC reach . - Courses 3 4 : Patients receive paclitaxel course 1-2 carboplatin IV 4 hour day 1 . At 72 hour follow completion carboplatin , patient receive PBSC infusion . Beginning one day follow PBSC infusion , patient receive G-CSF SC blood count recover . - Course 5 : Patients receive paclitaxel course 1 2 carboplatin course 3 4 melphalan IV 15 minute day 2 3 . Patients receive PBSC G-CSF course 3 4 . - Treatment repeat every 3-4 week . - Arm II : Patients receive standard chemotherapy consist carboplatin ( cisplatin ) paclitaxel IV 3 hour every 3 week 6 course . Patients may receive doxorubicin epirubicin addition standard chemotherapy every 4 week . Quality life assess prior therapy , 4-6 week follow completion therapy , 3 month , 9 month , 15 month . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 208 patient ( 104 per treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
