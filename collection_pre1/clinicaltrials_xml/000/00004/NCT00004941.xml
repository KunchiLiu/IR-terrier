	<brief_title>Phase III Randomized Study Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Chimeric Monoclonal Antibody ( cA2 ) Patients With Enterocutaneous Fistulae Complication Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL OUTLINE : This randomize , double blind , placebo control , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord investigational site number fistula ( single v multiple ) . Patients randomize one three treatment arm : Arm I : Patients receive infusion chimeric monoclonal antibody ( cA2 ) week 0 , 2 , 6 . Arm II : Patients receive infusion cA2 week 0 2 , infusion placebo week 6 . Arm III : Patients receive infusion placebo day 1 week 0 , 2 , 6 . Patients follow every month 3 month , every 6-12 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
