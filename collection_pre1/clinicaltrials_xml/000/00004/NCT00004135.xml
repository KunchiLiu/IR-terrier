	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Peripheral stem cell transplantation may able replace immune cell destroy chemotherapy use kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness chemotherapy plus peripheral stem cell transplantation treat patient metastatic kidney cancer melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Plus Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation Treating Patients With Melanoma Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Evaluate safety nonmyeloablative chemotherapy follow allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma melanoma . - Determine incidence severity adverse event related treatment regimen patient population . - Determine efficacy treatment regimen term tumor regression , response duration , progression free survival , overall survival patient . - Measure result chimerism immune reconstitution patient treatment regimen correlate clinical response . OUTLINE : Patients receive fludarabine IV 30 minute day -8 -4 cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour day -3 -2 . Immediately follow daily donor leukapheresis , patient receive allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) IV 15 minute begin day 0 continue target cell collect . Patients receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously begin day 5 continue blood count recover . If graft versus host disease develop within 4 week allogeneic PBSC transplantation , patient disease progression recurrence residual donor hematopoiesis chimerism analysis may receive donor T lymphocytes IV 30 minute . Patients may receive additional course donor T lymphocytes investigator 's discretion . Patients follow day 30 100 , every 3 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 10-38 patient accrue study within 2.5 year .</detailed_description>
