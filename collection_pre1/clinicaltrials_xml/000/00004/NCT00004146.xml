	<brief_title>Carboxyamidotriazole + RT Treating Patients Newly Diagnosed Supratentorial GBM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall survival rate patient administer CAI ( carboxyamidotriazole ) radiation therapy adult newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme . II . To determine toxicity CAI combine cranial irradiation . III . To estimate correlation pharmacokinetic parameter , include steady state CAI concentration , toxicity and/or drug activity patient population . IV . To estimate duration disease free progression treatment regime . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive induction therapy consist radiotherapy daily 5 day week plus oral carboxyamidotriazole daily 6 week follow carboxyamidotriazole alone daily 4 week . Patients continue oral carboxyamidotriazole daily maintenance therapy absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow monthly survival . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 54 patient accrue study 1.5 year .</detailed_description>
