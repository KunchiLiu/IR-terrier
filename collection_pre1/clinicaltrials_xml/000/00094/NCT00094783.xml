	<brief_summary>This study examine use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) instead x-rays guide angioplasty patient require treatment treat blockage leg artery . Angioplasty procedure balloon inflate blocked artery improve blood flow . MRI use magnetic field radio wave rather x-rays show picture body tissue organ . MRI show soft tissue , include artery , blood , organ , usual x-ray technique show lumen artery fill dye , vessel wall . Patients 18 year age old require angioplasty without stenting restore blood flow leg may eligible study . Participants undergo usual angioplasty procedure . The skin patient 's groin area numb catheter place groin artery . The patient give blood-thinning medicine , catheter insert measure blood pressure inject contrast dye take picture . Balloon catheter inflate open blockage , need , stent put place maintain opening . When blood thinner wear , catheter remove . Most procedure conduct use MRI instead X-rays visualize artery blockage . The patient move back forth x-ray MRI machine specially design laboratory . If necessary , stenting , placement wire mesh hold open artery , do use conventional x-ray technique . The entire procedure , include MRI , take 4 hour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular interventional procedure minimally-invasive , catheter-based treatment coronary artery angioplasty stenting . These procedure generally conduct awake patient complication , develop alternative conventional open surgery . Conventional cardiovascular interventional procedure conduct physician manipulate medical device inside patient guidance fluoroscopic x-ray . We develop minimally-invasive cardiovascular interventional procedure use real-time magnetic resonance imaging . These procedure advantage excellent image without surgery without ionize radiation exposure toxic contrast agent ( dye ) . Moreover , real time MRI produce excellent image soft tissue , blood , three-dimensional structure , may possible guide minimally-invasive procedure possible even invasive surgery . A state-of-the-art combined X-ray MRI interventional suite construct equipped real-time MRI image reconstruction interventional experiment , patient monitoring transport equipment dual imaging modality , large-mammal preclinical simulation experiment . Preclinical experiment porcine model surgical aortic coarctation show real-time MRI guide percutaneous intervention conduct use entirely commercially-available device approve US Food Drug Administration . The goal protocol test clinical peripheral artery revascularization procedure guide wholly-or part real-time MRI .</detailed_description>
