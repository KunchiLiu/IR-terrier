	<brief_title>A Fish Oil Supplement Maintain Body Weight Patients With Disease-Related Weight Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall goal project evaluate safety efficacy nutritional supplementation fish oil maintain weight patient disease-related weight loss ( cachexia ) . Weight loss commonly result poor prognosis , functional status , quality life . Despite high morbidity mortality associate cachexia , mainstream treatment sustain weight although nutritional supplement commonly use , many test clinical trial . Recent work cachexia reveal mediate pro-inflammatory cytokine . There data suggests fish oil affect underlie pathogenic inflammatory response affect weight maintenance nutritional balance Diseases cachexia common : - Cancer - Chronic Heart Failure ( CHF ) - Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) - Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) Goals Study : - To evaluate safety efficacy fish oil vs. corn oil maintenance weight lean body mass patient disease-related weight loss . - To understand mechanism fish oil effect health maintenance evaluate anti-inflammatory , anti-catabolic , anti-oxidant anabolic action compound - To document effect intervention quality life functional status . Study Outline : Participants randomly assign receive either fish oil supplement corn oil duration 3-month study . Participants five study visit two telephone interview . During study visit , participant undergo laboratory test , physical exam , dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) bone scan . Participants ask keep food diary study . During telephone interview , participant ask health-related question discuss current functional status .</detailed_description>
