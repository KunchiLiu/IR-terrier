	<brief_summary>This trial phase II study patient advance gastrointestinal ( GI ) malignancy assign one 4 cohort ( normal , mild , moderate several renal dysfunction ) base baseline measure creatinine clearance treat FOLFOX4 . Standard bone marrow liver function inclusion exclusion criterion must meet prior study treatment . FOLFOX4 study give every 2 week ( 1 cycle = 2 week ) 12 cycle unless treatment delay allow recovery toxic effect . Dose modification include protocol specify toxicity . After 12 treatment cycle study , patient beneficial disease response may continue oxaliplatin supply study continue treatment regimen disease progression , prohibitive toxicity death . Oxaliplatin pharmacokinetic study ( plasma urine ) plan cycle 1 2 patient . Creatinine clearance assess every 2 cycle disease status assess every 3 cycle treatment study .</brief_summary>
