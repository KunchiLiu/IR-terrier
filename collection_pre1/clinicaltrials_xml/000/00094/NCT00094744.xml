	<brief_summary>The goal study : - To determine whether visual acuity improvement obtain part-time ( 6 hour ) patch equivalent visual acuity improvement obtain full-time patching ( one wake hour ) severe amblyopia . - To develop precise estimate currently available visual acuity improvement occur treatment amblyopia patching . - To identify factor may associate successful treatment amblyopia patching .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Comparing Part-time Versus Full-time Patching Severe Amblyopia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Amblyopia common cause monocular visual impairment child young middle-aged adult . Patching mainstay amblyopia therapy . It generally hold response treatment best institute early age , particularly age two three , poor attempt eight year age . For severe amblyopia , generally accept occlusion patch standard care . Other modality treatment , atropine penalization optical penalization , widely consider insufficient initial treatment severe amblyopia . However , controversy exist regard many hour per day patch prescribe . Advocates full-time patch purport regimen need restore visual acuity rapidly effectively . Advocates part-time patch believe well tolerate child family , therefore produce less stress parent-child relationship produce good result well compliance . Part-time patching may also promote development binocularity patient `` straight-eyes '' , reduce chance straight-eyed patient develop manifest strabismus lose stereopsis , reduce incidence reverse- occlusion-amblyopia . The study randomize trial compare daily patch regime child severe amblyopia . It consist 160 child . Patients severe ( 20/100 20/400 ) group patch part-time ( 6 hour ) full-time ( one wake hour ) day 4 month study period . There least two follow visit 4-month period . Visual acuity major study outcome . It assess 4-month exam .</detailed_description>
