	<brief_summary>The goal study : - To determine whether visual acuity improvement obtain part-time ( 6 hour ) patch equivalent visual acuity improvement obtain minimal patching ( 2 hour ) moderate amblyopia . - To develop precise estimate currently available visual acuity improvement occur treatment amblyopia patching . - To identify factor may associate successful treatment amblyopia patching .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Comparing Part-time Versus Minimal-time Patching Moderate Amblyopia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Amblyopia common cause monocular visual impairment child young middle-aged adult . Patching mainstay amblyopia therapy . It generally hold response treatment best institute early age , particularly age two three , poor attempt eight year age . For moderate amblyopia , patch commonly prescribe treatment although modality atropine penalization also prescribe . There specific patch regimen widely accept treatment moderate amblyopia limit data available favor use one specific regimen ; minimal occlusion ( e.g. , 2 hour per day ) six hour per day patch prescribed clinical practice . The study randomize trial compare daily patch regime child moderate amblyopia . It consist 160 child . Patients moderate ( 20/40-20/80 ) group patch part-time ( 6 hour ) minimal time ( 2 hour ) day 4-month study period . There least two follow visit 4-month period . Visual acuity major study outcome . It assess 4-month exam .</detailed_description>
