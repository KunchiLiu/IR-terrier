	<brief_title>Standard Open Surgery Versus Endovascular Repair Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm ( AAA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Hypothesis : All-cause mortality differ 25 % Endovascular repair ( EVR ) Open repair . Secondary Hypotheses : Procedure failure , short term ( 12-month ) major morbidity , number hospital day , health-related quality life procedure-related abnormality differ two AAA repair strategy . Primary Outcomes : All-cause mortality . Interventions : Patients randomize one repair strategy elective treatment AAA : ( ) Open repair ( b ) Endovascular repair ( use FDA-approved device ) . Study Abstract : Aortic aneurysm tenth lead cause death old men ; AAA account majority death ( 10,000 death per year United States ) . Since one 22 Veterans age 50 AAA one 200 AAA diameter great equal 5.0 cm ( make candidate elective repair ) , AAA major disease VA population . Questions relative safety effectiveness FDA approve EVR device raise remain unanswered . To answer question , multi-center , randomize clinical trial compare EVR standard open surgery propose . Patients elective repair AAA indicate suitable candidate open repair EVR eligible study . The anticipated duration study 9 year propose sample size 900 patient . The first planning meeting take place March 9-10 , 2000 second plan meeting take place November 6-7 , 2000 . The OVER protocol submit review CSEC May 10 , 2001 approve . The kickoff June 12 , 2002 . The first DSMB meeting take place January 6 , 2003 . First annual meeting hold September 30 , 2003 ; second DSMB meeting take place September 29 , 2003 . Third DSMB meeting hold April 19 , 2004 ; second annual meeting hold June 29 , 2004 . Fourth DSMB meeting hold December 6 , 2004 ; third annual meeting hold March 15 , 2005 . The fifth DSMB meeting hold July 19 , 2005 fourth annual meeting hold March 21 , 2006 . The sixth DSMB meeting hold September 12 , 2005 . The seventh DSMB meeting hold March 6 , 2006 . The eighth DSMB meeting hold November 6 , 2006 . At November 6 , 2006 meeting , DSMB discuss approve unblinding study chair prepare short-term follow-up paper specify study protocol . Initially protocol call analysis include one-year follow-up data . After discussion Trial Leadership , DSMB approve use two year follow-up data ( reflect DSMB minute finalize February 20 , 2007 ) . This recommendation subsequently approve CSP March 2007 . The short-term outcome manuscript publish JAMA October 14 , 2009 . The ninth DSMB meeting hold May 14 , 2007 fifth annual meeting hold June 6 , 2007 . The tenth DSMB meeting hold April 7 , 2008 . The eleventh DMC ( name change DSMB DMC ) hold June 22 , 2009 . The twelfth DMC meeting hold May 24 , 2010 . A Site Investigator meet hold Boston , MA June 9 , 2010 . The thirteenth DMC meeting hold June 3 , 2011 study close-out meeting hold June 15 , 2011 Chicago , IL . The study 's patient follow-up phase end October 15 , 2011 .</detailed_description>
