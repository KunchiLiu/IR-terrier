	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether treatment etoposide , doxorubicin , cisplatin mitotane ( EDP/M ) prolongs survival compare streptozotocin mitotane ( Sz/M ) patient advanced adrenocortical carcinoma ( ACC ) whose disease amenable complete surgical resection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Locally Advanced Metastatic Adrenocortical Carcinoma Treatment ( FIRM-ACT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Firm-ACT trial first ever conduct randomize controlled phase III trial adrenocortical carcinoma ( ACC ) , rare malignancy poor prognosis . It provide result lead establishment urgently need gold standard chemotherapy regimen patient locally advance metastatic ACC . To end trial compare two promising drug combination investigate phase II trial , consider `` International Consensus Conference Adrenal Cancer '' ( Ann Arbor/USA , 2003 ) valuable first line treatment advance ACC . The first regimen consist etoposide , doxorubicin , cisplatin plus mitotane ( EDP-M ) , second regiment employ streptozotocin plus mitotane ( Sz-M ) . Over period five year international trial include 300 patient advanced ACC different European country . Blood mitotane concentration monitor , aim drug level 14 - 20 mg/L . Patients respond first line treatment switch alternative regimen . The primary objective trial investigate whether EDP-M give first line treatment prolong survival compare Sz-M . Secondary endpoint quality life , time progression , best overall response rate duration response . In addition , trial evaluates role reach therapeutic mitotane serum concentration survival tumour response assess value two alternative treatment regimen second line therapy advance ACC . Moreover , FIRM-ACT trial generate lasting structural basis successful future trial ACC . In substudy 40 patient detailed analysis pharmacokinetics oral mitotane analyse . Two different mitotane treatment regimen ( `` low dose '' vs. `` high dose '' ) compare .</detailed_description>
