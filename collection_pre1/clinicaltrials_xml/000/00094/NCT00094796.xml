	<brief_summary>This study examine whether anti-diabetes medicine rosiglitazone safely effectively reverse early problem type 2 diabetes delay onset disease people pre-diabetes . The underlying problem people diabetes pre-diabetes insulin resistance ( lowered sensitivity insulin ) result poor glucose ( sugar ) regulation . Rosiglitazone improve body 's sensitivity insulin . Patients 21 year age old type 2 diabetes pre-diabetic ( glucose intolerant/insulin resistant ) may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood test , echocardiography ( heart ultrasound ) , exercise test , brachial artery reactivity test ( see ) , possibly muscle biopsy . Participants take one rosiglitazone tablet daily mouth 2 week . The dose increase two tablet daily another 2 week 4 tablet daily remainder 12-week treatment period . In addition treatment , patient undergo follow test procedure : - Resting exercise metabolic testing : The amount oxygen take carbon dioxide exhale breathing measure patient rest chair exercise stationary bicycle treadmill . Both rest exercise , patient wear facemask measure amount oxygen use . During exercise , heart rate monitor electrode chest , arm , thigh . The exercise test repeat three time , become familiar test , next day measure exercise capacity , 3 day later . The third test less strenuous optional . - Muscle biopsy ( optional ) : A small area skin calf muscle numb local anesthetic 1-inch incision make muscle . A small amount muscle tissue take incision close stitch . - Brachial reactivity study : This ultrasound study test well patient 's artery widen . The subject rest bed 30 minute . An ultrasound measuring device place artery elbow . The size artery blood flow measure inflating pressure cuff around forearm . The pressure cuff stop flow blood arm minute . After 15-minute rest , nitroglycerin tablet ( medicine cause blood vessel relax ) place patient 's tongue . Before 3 minute nitroglycerin give , size artery blood flow measure . - Blood sample : Blood sample collect begin end study study visit . - Study visit : Patients come Clinical Center biweekly monthly follow-up history , physical examination , blood test . At end the3-month treatment period , receive recommendation possible treatment modification best maintain glucose tolerance . Their physician inform blood sugar control . Six month complete study , patient undergo final study evaluation blood test , invite return yearly checkup .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The majority insulin resistant individual ( predominantly individual type 2 diabetes - T2DM ) develop disproportionate incidence cardiovascular disease burden include hypertension , coronary artery disease , peripheral vascular disease heart failure . The underlie pathophysiology multifactorial primarily drive insulin-resistance mediated regulatory event . These include augmented oxidative stress , upregulation pro-inflammatory anti-thrombotic signaling pathway , detrimental effect advanced glycosylation end-products perturbation lipid fatty acid metabolism . Evidence emerge support role perturb mitochondrial respiratory regulation subsequent endothelial dysfunction early event insulin-resistance syndrome . These turn , propose result subsequent development cardiovascular clinical sequela . In last year , pharmacologic compound develop directly modulate insulin resistance/sensitivity . Activation peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( PPAR ) family transcription factor show augment insulin sensitivity . Agents activate numerous PPAR family member , i.e . pan-PPAR agonist PPAR gamma ( PPAR gamma ) specific agonist , promote improve insulin sensitivity . Whether compound modify underlying mitochondrial endothelial pathophysiology , potential preventing progression cardiovascular disease insulin-resistant subject systematically investigate . The hypothesis intrinsic proposal PPAR activation improve mitochondrial respiratory endothelial cell function parallel improve insulin sensitization insulin-resistant T2DM subject . The primary objective study establish effect PPAR gamma agonist ( rosiglitazone ) exercise-modulated cardiopulmonary-metabolic function ( functional measure mitochrondrial respiratory function ) insulin resistant T2DM subject either naive hypoglycemic therapy current therapy establish class anti-diabetic agent without associate cardiovascular disease . As secondary end point evaluate numerous biological assay skeletal muscle mitochondrial function , endothelial function change parameter insulin sensitivity . These include : 1 ) skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration , 2 ) skeletal muscle expression profile gene encode mitochondrial biogenesis program mitochondrial respiratory control , 3 ) brachial artery reactivity , 4 ) endothelial progenitor cell number colony-forming capacity , 5 ) monocyte gene expression profile evaluate insulin inflammatory-mediator regulatory event 6 ) serological evaluation change insulin sensitivity inflammation . The study design phase II clinical trial subject receive rosiglitazone three month duration . Baseline 3 month laboratory study include : 1 ) rest exercise cardiopulmonary metabolic testing ; 2 ) skeletal muscle biopsy mitochondrial function gene expression profile analysis , 3 ) brachial artery reactivity test 4 ) serological blood cell sample determine biochemical , cellular genomic perturbation response insulin-sensitization therapy cohort .</detailed_description>
