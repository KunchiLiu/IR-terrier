	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety effectiveness three different treatment patient Crohns disease respond previous treatment group drug commonly use treat Crohn 's Disease ( 5-ASA ) corticosteroid . Patients receive either infliximab ( drug use treat autoimmune disease ) azathioprine ( immunosuppressant drug use suppress immune system ) combination 34 week . This research study involve approximately 500 patient . The main study involve 34 week ( approximately 8 month ) . A study extension additional 20 week ( approximately 5 month ) optional patient successfully complete main study . A country-specific study extension open label infliximab treatment additional 1 year optional patient successfully complete main study extension .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Comparing Infliximab Infliximab Azathioprine Treatment Patients With Crohn 's Disease naï¿½ve Both Immunomodulators Biologic Therapy ( Study Biologic Immunomodulator Naive Patients Chrohn 's Disease : SONIC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Crohns disease characterize inflammation ( change happen tissue body injure ) ulceration ( open sore ) intestine . Crohns disease treat medication decrease inflammation , reduce diarrhea , abdominal pain symptom Crohns disease . In addition , Crohns disease treat medication suppress immune system ( body system involve inflammation infection ) surgery . This study investigate effectiveness infliximab azathioprine treatment patient moderate-to-severe Crohns disease . Infliximab currently approve FDA treatment Crohns disease rheumatoid arthritis . Azathioprine , investigational drug , approve FDA treatment Crohns disease , well-established therapy use many year treat Crohns disease . This study seek determine whether infliximab , azathioprine , combination drug would appropriate treatment Crohns disease patient respond well certain drug call 5-ASA drug ( e.g . Asacol , Pentasa , sulfasalazine ) and/or require frequent treatment corticosteroid . This research study involve approximately 500 patient . Patients may participate main study 34 week ( approximately 8 month ) . During main study , patient ask visit study center 10 visit . If patient enroll extension study , total time participation may 54 week ( approximately 13 month ) . Patients enrol Study Extension ask visit study center additional 5 visit . A country-specific ( EU Israel ) , prospective , multi-center , open-label extension study evaluate long-term safety efficacy schedule maintenance therapy infliximab patient Crohns Disease . Patients complete treatment Week 50 SONIC main study , opinion investigator , would benefit infliximab treatment may enter open-label extension . Patients randomly assign one three treatment group ( either infliximab plus placebo capsule , infliximab plus azathioprine , azathioprine plus placebo infusion - possibility assign placebo trial - patient receive one medication ) begin study . Oral medication take daily . There 5 infusion ( either infliximab placebo ) visit main study .</detailed_description>
