	<brief_summary>This study examine brain chemical dopamine affect memory , reason , thought process people Parkinson 's disease without dementia healthy control subject . Healthy normal volunteer people Parkinson 's disease 40 85 year age may eligible study . Pregnant woman Parkinson 's disease breastfeeding normal volunteer exclude . Candidates screen physical neurological examination , blood test , brief mental test call Mini Mental Status Examination , test design assess memory , learning , reason , thought process . Patients Parkinson 's disease also undergo thorough mental evaluation call Mattis Dementia Rating Scale . The study require 15 hour 4 5 outpatient visit NIH . Participants undergo two positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan two separate day magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan , follow : PET Scans The two PET procedure do way , except one use radioactive tracer call [ ( 18 ) F ] DOPA one use tracer call [ ( 11 ) C ] NNC-112 . A catheter ( small plastic tube ) place vein subject 's arm injection tracer . The subject lie scanner bed special mask fit head hold place procedure . Just inject tracer , 10-minute `` transmission scan '' do head use tracer call ( 68 ) Ge . Then , series scan use one two study tracer ( [ ( 18 ) F ] DOPA [ ( 11 ) C ] NNC-112 do 90 minute . About 1 hour injection [ ( 18 ) F ] DOPA tracer , subject take 200 mg drug carbidopa mouth help tracer work properly . Blood pressure , breathe heart monitor injection [ ( 11 ) C ] NNC-112 tracer . Patients Parkinson 's disease take Parkinson 's medication night [ ( 18 ) F ] DOPA scan motor function test follow morning scan do , use Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale . Patients resume medication except L-DOPA ( include Sinemet ) movement test , resume L-DOPA PET scan finish . MRI Scan MRI use strong magnetic field radio wave obtain image brain . The subject lie still table slide inside scanner , metal cylinder . They wear ear plug muffle loud knock sound occur scan communicate MRI staff time intercom .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Relationship Dopamine Cognitive Function Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) common neurodegenerative disorder , particularly elderly population . PD characterize primarily motor impairment , cognitive impairment common dementia may occur 30 % patient . The pathological hallmark PD selective degeneration nigrostriatal dopamine neuron appearance intracytoplasmic inclusion know Lewy Bodies . Dopaminergic dysfunction widely demonstrate PD patient . Reductions [ 18F ] FDOPA uptake consistently observe PD , although remains establish whether relative difference PD without dementia , association cognitive function . Furthermore , data relate dopamine D1 receptor PD limit post mortem study image D1 tracer [ 11C ] SCH 23390 , little known role D1 receptor vivo relate clinical phenomenon . The aim current study ass feasibility usefulness image dopamine D1 receptor dopamine terminal function vivo , use PET ( positron emission tomography ) patient PD , without dementia , assess change presynaptic postsynaptic dopaminergic marker PD . The long-term goal present study understanding role dopaminergic system pathogenesis PD relationship cognitive motor deficit PD . Knowledge gain present study may assist development novel therapeutic target PD .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : PD patient must meet diagnosis idiopathic Parkinson 's disease . Diagnosis base upon presence least two four cardinal symptom ( tremor , bradykinesia , rigidity instability ) well positive response dopaminergic agent . Patients stable dopaminergic therapy approximately two week prior enrollment . Control subject must healthy age 40 85 year age gender match PD patient . EXCLUSION CRITERIA CONTROLS : Diagnosis idiopathic Parkinson 's disease . Secondary cause Parkinsonism , e.g . Wilson 's disease , neuroleptic use . Psychiatric disease would , judgment investigator , interfere safe conduct study . Current psychiatric illness . Severe depressive symptom BDI 16+ . Substance abuse , severe systemic disease , poor vision hearing base history physical exam . Incidence Parkinson 's disease two first degree relative . Dementia due PD severe dementia MMSE le 15 . Neurological disorder PD would effect protocol ( e.g . stroke , Alzheimer 's disease ) . Laboratory test clinically significant abnormality . History abnormal MRI . Pregnancy breast feeding . Prior participation research protocols clinical care last year radiation exposure would exceed annual NIH RSC limit . Any condition increase risk MRI ( pacemaker , metallic foreign body , claustrophobia , etc. ) . Any medical condition opinion investigator would interfere safe conduct study . Severe hypertension . The subject may antihypertensive medication . The initial screening must show moderate hypertension i.e . le 160/95 . In addition , subject must normal laboratory value ( e.g. , BUN , creatinine , urinalysis , ECG ) document lack end organ damage . On baseline evaluation day scan ( i.e. , injection tracer ) , subject must asymptomatic ( headache , dizziness , neurological symptom , blur vision ) AND sustain BP less 180/100 . Inability provide consent . Smoking within 6 month prior enrollment study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA PATIENTS : Secondary cause Parkinsonism , e.g . Wilson 's disease , neuroleptic use . Psychiatric disease would , judgment investigator , interfere safe conduct study . Current psychiatric illness except depression . Severe depressive symptom BDI 16+ .
