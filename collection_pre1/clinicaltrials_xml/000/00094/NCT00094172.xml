	<detailed_description>CIS single clinical event indicate temporary disruption normal nerve function . CIS patient may loss vision one eye ; trouble balance ; double vision ; numbness face ; tingle , numbness , weakness arm leg . Some CIS patient may develop MS , others may . Studies show CIS accompany magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) -detected brain lesion consistent see MS , high risk second neurologic event diagnosis MS within several year . This study evaluate efficacy atorvastatin , antihyperlipidemic , prevention MS CIS patient . This study last 18 month . All participant must complete 3- 5-day course corticosteroid least 28 day baseline evaluation . This corticosteroid therapy must initiate within 60 day CIS onset . Participants randomly assign receive 80 mg either atorvastatin placebo mouth daily 12 month . Study visit occur screen every 3 month thereafter end 18-month study . Blood collection occur select visit , additional evaluation perform Months 1 2 . Selected participant undergo MRI brain scan . Participants offer interferon beta-1a ( AvonexÂ® ) , free charge , develop disease activity . Participants instructed report change health status treat physician within 48 hour onset symptom .</detailed_description>
