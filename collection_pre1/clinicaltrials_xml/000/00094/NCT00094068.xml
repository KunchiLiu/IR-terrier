	<brief_summary>This study determine whether sildenafil citrate , commonly know Viagra , cause increase blood flow brain wide range multiple sclerosis ( MS ) patient , include woman . Although people MS reduce blood flow brain part disease process , observe men MS may increase blood flow brain take sildenafil citrate . This study measure brain blood flow blood volume men woman MS take Viagra compare result healthy volunteer effort well understand disease . Healthy volunteer 18 year age old patient MS 18 55 year age may eligible study . Volunteers screen medical history physical examination , patient MS evaluate complete neurological examination screen heart disease , include history chest pain , heart attack , use nitrate . Participants undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) take Viagra . During scan , subject lie still table slide cylindrical metal scanner . Scanning time varies 20 minute 3 hour , scan last 45 90 minute . First , scan obtain carotid artery ( major artery neck supply blood brain ) determine artery narrow , baseline MRI scan measure brain blood flow obtain . The subject come scanner take Viagra pill . After 1 hour , subject return scanner scan obtain determine change brain blood flow blood volume follow Viagra . A catheter ( thin plastic tube ) place subject 's arm enters magnet second time injection contrast agent call gadolinium DTPA , allow brain structure distinguish clearly .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Sildenafil Citrate ( Viagra® ( Registered Trademark ) ) Brain Blood Flow Multiple Sclerosis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advances MR perfusion image provide clinical researcher opportunity quantify regional cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) . It show cerebral perfusion patient multiple sclerosis ( MS ) reduce , particularly grey matter . However , preliminary data small number male secondary progressive ( SP ) MS patient erectile dysfunction suggest sildenafil citrate ( Viagra® ( Registered Trademark ) ) help increase grey matter perfusion . The purpose study extend finding male MS patient without erectile dysfunction female MS patient compare CBF measure MS patient sex , age gender-matched healthy control . CBF measure one hour take sildenafil citrate .</detailed_description>

EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Healthy Controls MS patient exclude contraindication MR scanning , follow : 1. aneurysm clip 2. implanted neural stimulator 3. implanted cardiac pacemaker autodefibrillator 4. cochlear implant 5. ocular foreign body ( e.g. , metal shaving ) 6. insulin pump Healthy control MS patient exclude study follow : 1 . History heart attack 2 . History treatment nitrate heart condition 3 . History carotid artery stenosis evidence great 50 % carotid stenosis screen MR angiogram 4 . History known vascular disease 5 . History stroke 6 . History migraine 7 . Subjects history reaction MR contrast agent specifically gadopentetate dimeglumine exclude participate contrast agent administration part protocol . 8 . Healthy control excluded history alcohol drug abuse . 9 . Healthy control excluded Concurrent , clinically significant ( determined investigator ) gastrointestinal , immunologic , pulmonary , neurologic , renal , and/or major disease . 10 . Healthy control excluded previous know abnormality Brain MRI examination . 11 . Pregnant lactate woman exclude study . 12 . Since certain drug may interfere ability vessel brain respond Viagra , subject take steroid sildenafil ( within 24 hour ) exclude study . MS patient also exclude study entry follow exclusion criterion exist time enrollment : 1 . Pregnant lactate woman MS patient exclude study . 2 . Diagnosis primary progressive MS , define gradual progression disability onset without relapse . 3 . Concurrent , clinically significant ( determined investigator ) immunologic , pulmonary , gastrointestinal , neurologic , renal , and/or major disease MS patient . Treatment History MS patient If prior treatment steroid receive , subject must treatment required period prior enrollment ( see ) . Agent : Corticosteroids Time Required Agent Prior Enrollment : 8 week Unwillingness inability comply requirement protocol include presence condition ( physical , mental , social ) likely affect subject 's return followup visit NINDS , Neuroimmunology Clinic sufficient reason exclude subject .</criteria>
