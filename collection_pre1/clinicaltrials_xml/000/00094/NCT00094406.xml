	<brief_summary>This study examine healthy volunteer breathe carbon monoxide ( CO ) affect lung inflammation . Severe lung inflammation sometimes develop patient pneumonia patient develop serious blood stream infection . Studies laboratory animal show CO decrease lung inflammation . Healthy volunteer 18 40 year age smoke , take medication , asthma , allergic sulfa- penicillin-based drug , pregnant may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood urine test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , chest x-ray . Subjects enrol either pilot study main study . Participants undergo bronchoscopy bronchoalveolar lavage study effect endotoxin ( component bacteria cause inflammation similar patient lung infection ) lung function . Before procedure , small plastic tube ( catheter ) place vein collect blood sample another place artery check blood pressure . For bronchoscopy , mouth nasal airway numb lidocaine , bronchoscope ( thin flexible tube ) pass nose airway lung . A small amount salt water squirt bronchoscope one lung salt water contain endotoxin squirt lung . Following bronchoscopy , subject treat either CO room air ( placebo ) 6 hour . ( Subjects pilot study receive treatment 3 hour ) . The gas deliver cushioned mask place nose mouth . The amount exhale CO measure , , inhalation gas . For measurement , subject take deep breath fill lung slowly exhale mouthpiece connect measure device feel lung empty . After CO treatment , second bronchoscopy do examine lung respond CO room air . This study two way . To sample air , large needle use withdraw air bronchoscope 3 second . Then area lung squirt salt water alone endotoxin salt water rinse ( lavage ) cell secretion collect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) major cause morbidity mortality . Of many potential predisposing factor , sepsis pneumonia represent two main cause ARDS . In spite increase survival recent year mortality patient ARDS still estimate around 30 40 % . In context , development effective preventive strategy patient high risk development ARDS paramount importance . Unfortunately , result study evaluate prophylactic regimen ARDS mostly disappoint . The gaseous molecule carbon monoxide ( CO ) traditionally view toxic metabolic industrial waste . However , recent study demonstrate important physiologic role CO many biological system . Specifically , strong anti-inflammatory , anti-oxidant anti-thrombotic effect CO gas administration heme oxygenase activation ( enzyme generate endogenous CO gas ) demonstrate several animal model . Previous study conduct department demonstrate bronchoscopic instillation endotoxin ( LPS ) healthy volunteer elicits compartmentalize pulmonary inflammatory response , serve excellent model evaluate intervention direct towards suppression lung inflammation early stage . In current single blind , randomize , placebo control study , plan evaluate effect inhale carbon monoxide local pulmonary inflammatory response follow endotoxin administration . Healthy subject undergo local endotoxin instillation , breathe CO room air mask 6 hour , repeat bronchoscopy lavage do 6 hour assess ability CO suppress local inflammation lung .</detailed_description>
