	<brief_summary>The main goal project use image biomarkers identify cognitively normal elderly people increase risk develop mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) . MCI early clinically detectable evidence brain change due Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . The second goal project describe inter-relationships among anatomical biomarkers , cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers , cognition measure elderly people develop MCI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal project use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) biomarkers identify cognitively normal participant show early clinically detectable brain change Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . The major hypothesis study CSF P-tau231 measurement improve accuracy MRI cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) measurement predict mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) . Validation hypothesis lead improve diagnostic tool detect AD early possible . This 5-year longitudinal study involve baseline exam two 18-month followup exam . Participants undergo MRI scan , CSF collection blood sample , neuropsychological performance testing , medical , neurological psychiatric assessment . The screen diagnostic evaluation carry New York University Alzheimer Disease Core Center ( ADCC ) NYU Center Brain Health . This study enroll minimum 80 cognitively normal participant , 60 80 year age , English first language , 12 year formal education , live metropolitan New York City area . All participant receive baseline follow-up evaluation rule confound medical , neurological , psychiatric condition could affect cognition . The study coordinator maintain 6-month telephone contact participant caregiver part project .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Individuals either sex , high school education , age 60 80 year live New York City metropolitan area . Minimum 12 year education . Participants classify within normal limit medical , psychiatric neuropsychological examination ( performance well 1.5 sd NYU norm base WMSR delayed memory index ) . Participants global deterioration scale ( GDS ) =1 2 . Those enrolled HighRisk group GDS=2 score &gt; 25 Memory Complaint Questionnaire ( MCQ ) . In high risk memory loss case , inform family member caregiver interview confirm participant perform specific task . Past history MRI evidence brain damage include significant trauma , stroke , hydrocephalus , lacunar infarct , seizure , mental retardation serious neurological disorder . Significant history alcoholism drug abuse . History psychiatric illness ( e.g. , schizophrenia , mania , PostTraumatic Stress Disorder [ PTSD ] , depression ) . Any focal neurological sign significant neuropathology . A score 4 great Modified Hachinski Ischemia Scale , indicative cerebrovascular disease . A total score 16 Hamilton Depression Scale exclude possible case primary depression . Evidence clinically relevant uncontrolled hypertensive , cardiac , pulmonary , vascular , metabolic hematologic condition . Physical impairment severity adversely affect validity psychological testing . Hostility refusal cooperate . Any prosthetic device ( e.g. , pacemaker surgical clip ) could affect magnetic field employ MRI image . History familial early onset dementia .</criteria>
