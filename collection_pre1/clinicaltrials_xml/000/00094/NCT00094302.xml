	<brief_title>Aldosterone Antagonist Therapy Adults With Heart Failure Preserved Systolic Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Heart failure ( HF ) major cause morbidity mortality , particularly old people . Indeed , common discharge diagnosis patient older 65 year . As United States population age , heart failure continue grow public health concern . Therapeutic trial heart failure deal almost exclusively patient systolic dysfunction . However , emerge awareness nearly half patient heart failure preserve systolic function survival patient adversely affect . This study randomize clinical trial novel therapeutic approach , specifically use spironolactone , aldosterone antagonist , treat patient . While treatment show useful treat heart failure reduce systolic function , study patient preserve systolic function . Patients heart failure preserve systolic function poor prognosis . The annual mortality rate intermediate prognosis without heart failure heart failure reduce systolic function . For instance , Family Health Study participant heart failure preserve systolic function mortality rate 9 % compare 3 % age- gender-matched control . The mortality rate 19 % heart failure patient reduce systolic function heart failure compare 4 % matched control . As heart failure develop , neurohormone release initially improve cardiac output ultimately contribute progression leave ventricular dysfunction . The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system important part compensatory response . Aldosterone level may rise 20 time normal level heart failure aldosterone contribute development myocardial fibrosis . Spironolactone potassium-sparing diuretic act distal tubule , inhibit sodium potassium ion exchange . There several potential beneficial action , include prevention cardiac fibrosis . A recent trial evaluate spironolactone patient systolic dysfunction heart failure . Spironolactone treatment cause 30 % reduction mortality compare placebo ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . The improvement result reduction cause mortality . More recently , Eplerenone Post-Myocardial Infarction ( MI ) study show aldosterone antagonist significantly reduce mortality despite background treatment angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor beta-blocker . Advantages use spironolactone study commercially available , inexpensive , longer patent ( therefore study do industry ) . Also , clear physiologic rationale use , side effect profile well understood . The study enrol subject preserve systolic function heart failure meet clearly define eligibility criterion select make result widely generalizable clinical practice . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled trial aldosterone antagonist therapy ( 15 mg dose spironolactone placebo ; titrate 30 45 mg/day ) 3,445 adult patient heart failure preserve systolic function . Patients recruit August 2006 January 2012 , treat , follow June 2013 . Approximately 270 clinical site six country subcontract clinical trial coordinate center . Subject visit clinical center occur every four six month . Data collect include demographic clinical data , include result history physical exam , laboratory image data , repository specimen special physiology study , genetic study . Additionally , data regard quality life compliance assign treatment also collect assessed .</detailed_description>
