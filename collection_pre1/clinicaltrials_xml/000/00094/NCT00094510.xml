	<brief_summary>This study use magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) drug gabapentin examine role brain chemical gamma-amino-butyric acid ( GABA ) regulate emotion healthy people . Gabapentin , use treat epilepsy , increase GABA concentration brain . MRS , similar magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , diagnostic test use magnetic field radio wave produce image brain . Non-smoking , healthy normal volunteer 18 60 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , psychiatric evaluation , blood urine test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) . At three separate clinic visit , participant give either gabapentin placebo ( inactive look-alike capsule ) . They take placebo one visit , 600 mg gabapentin another visit , 1200 mg gabapentin another visit . One hour take capsule , amount GABA brain measure MRS. For procedure , subject lie table move MRI scanner ( narrow cylinder ) , wear earplug muffle loud knock thump sound occur scan process . The procedure last 45 60 minute , patient ask lie still minute time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) major inhibitory neurotransmitter forebrain structure , GABAergic system find role attentional learning process , recognition aversive stimulus , regulation emotion behavior . Decreases GABA associated seizure , anxiety mood disorder . Enhancement GABA may result anticonvulsive , anxiolytic , mood-stabilizing effect . The GABA system propose target novel antidepressant mood-stabilizing treatment . Recent study suggest GABAergic dysfunction mood anxiety disorder . Specifically , reduce GABA level find occipital cortex patient major depression panic disorder ; therapy selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , increase occipital GABA concentration observe depressed patient healthy volunteer . Gabapentin ( GBP ) relatively novel drug approve treatment epilepsy . The effect GBP brain amino acid neurotransmitter completely understood . GBP significantly increase brain GABA level humans one hour first oral dose , although seem directly affect GABA-specific enzyme , GABA receptor , GABA uptake . In vitro , GBP stimulate enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase involve synthesis GABA . To date , study examine mechanism action GABA enhance compound use magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) measure GABA exclusively occipital cortex due technical limitation . Not surprisingly , association occipital GABA level cognitive measure psychiatric symptom severity find . Thanks novel MRS method develop GE implement NIH , reliable measurement prefrontal GABA level available . The current study design estimate prefrontal GABA level placebo-controlled double-blind study GBP . It aim evaluate novel MRS method estimate prefrontal GABA level . Prefrontal GABA level relate prefrontal function include facial emotion recognition response control . GABA MRS GBP/placebo may use challenge paradigm future study aim elucidate GABAergic dysfunction mood anxiety disorder . 10 healthy medication-free human subject examine GABA magnetic resonance spectroscopy control trial use placebo , 600mg , 1200mg GBP . Given potential role GABA physiologic stress response , protocol include pilot study compare prefrontal GABA level shock/threat-of-shock no-threat condition healthy volunteer . This part study may contribute elucidation role prefrontal GABAergic system process acute stress .</detailed_description>
