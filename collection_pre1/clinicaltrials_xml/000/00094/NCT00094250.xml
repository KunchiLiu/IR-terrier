	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The amount functional skeletal muscle CHF patient able preserve major independent predictor ability maintain physical function . Older patient CHF ( make vast majority CHF patient ) least able . The disease mark loss aerobic muscle fiber , age marked loss glycolytic muscle fiber . Because disease may physiologically different old CHF patient young one ( due loss muscle type old CHF patient ) , need different therapeutic approach . Strategy test aim increase muscle mass resistance strength train systolic failure patient rare , small , generally lack old participant . The study do among young CHF patient show aerobic , combination aerobic strength training increase work capacity , oxidative muscle activity , glycolytic muscle strength . Additionally , combination training improve cardiac measure , include LVEF . DESIGN NARRATIVE : An estimate 200 participant age 65 old Class II III CHF LVEF 20 % 40 % include study . Their work capacity measure watts cycle ergometer exercise stress test ( Time 1 ) . They randomize gender , race , disease severity two exercise group : 1 ) resistance aerobic training ( RA ) ; 2 ) aerobic training ( A ) . Both group exercise three time week 4 month . At end 4 month training , cycle ergometer stress test repeat ( Time 2 ) . By compare change maximum watt achieve Time 1 Time 2 group , assessment make effectiveness exercise program improving work capacity . Secondarily , measure perform compare myocardial remodeling , leg strength , leg muscle oxidative capacity Time 1 Time 2 . The goal study determine follow : 1 . If low resistance frequent repetition resistance training combine aerobic training increase aerobic work capacity pure aerobic training . 2 . If improvement aerobic work capacity due change muscle fiber composition , local blood flow , arterial endothelial function , combination .
