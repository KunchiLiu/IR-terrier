	<brief_summary>This study examine child Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria syndrome , genetic disease cause many change body time , include heart disease , bone change , hair loss , joint skin change . Often call `` premature age '' disease , progeria mimic age completely . This study examine body system affect progeria system affect time order try develop new treatment . Patients progeria 6 month 70 year age able travel NIH Bethesda , Md. , may eligible 5- 10-year study . Participants come NIH Clinical Center evaluation every 2 year . Each 4-5 day visit include follow test procedure : - Medical history physical examination - Blood test analyze cardiovascular risk factor , blood count , blood chemistry , research - Urine test sugar protein - Photographs study growth problem - X-ray study determine bone density body composition , body fat muscle - Electrocardiogram ( EKG ) echocardiogram ( heart ultrasound ) study heart blood vessel - Lung function test measure energy consumption lung capacity - Skin biopsy ( surgical removal small skin sample ) examine cellular change - Hearing test - Eye examination evaluate eyesight , eye pressure structure eye - Physical therapy evaluation stretch exercise measure joint bend straighten - Dental examination , include X-rays - Meeting nutritionist track patient 's food intake take body measurement - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) patient old enough undergo procedure without sedation . This test use magnetic field radio wave examine body organ . For test , patient must lie still scanner , narrow cylindrical tube . Patients provide result medical test . Information patient submit PRF Cell Tissue Bank Peabody , Massachusetts .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hutchison-Gilford Progeria Syndrome ( HGPS ) rare `` premature age '' disease child die severe atherosclerosis average age thirteen year ( range 8-20 year ) . Children HGPS appear healthy birth , within month display sign growth failure , lipodystrophy , hair loss , age skin . Within year exhibit boney abnormality include osteoporosis resorption , coax valga hip dislocation . The final height approximate 3 foot . Mortality cause generalize artherosclerosis lead stroke heart attack . The gene defect cause HGPS recently identify single base mutation gene LMNA , cod nuclear protein Lamin A . The spectrum effect gene defect cellular function , effect culminate HGPS disease phenotype , remain elucidated . Furthermore , in-patient multisubject clinical evaluation child HGPS ever perform , therapy exists complication HGPS . Hence , baseline study critical determine extent organ involvement HGPS , evaluate disease progression , design clinical trial potential treatment . The purpose study longitudinally investigate disease characteristic HGPS use state-of the-art measure cardiovascular function , comprehensive laboratory testing , vitro cell culture study , extensive medical consultation . HGPS patient admit NIH Clinical center inpatient approximately 5 day every two year . The information emanate propose study assist assure appropriate care child HGPS , provide good understanding variation phenotype HGPS , stimulate new research HGPS age disease associate HGPS , atherosclerosis . These study also allow u evaluate new clinical outcome parameter design appropriate therapeutic intervention .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Inclusion criterion consist male female child ethnic group diagnosis HGPS . An individual clinical diagnosis HGPS verify Dr. Gordon eligible protocol . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Exclusion criterion consist patient 6 month 70 year age . Another exclusion inability travel NIH due advance cardiovascular disease , reflect unstable angina , congestive heart failure , serious symptom .</criteria>
