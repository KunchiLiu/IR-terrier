	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Obesity reach epidemic proportion U.S. 50 percent adult population either overweight obese . Obesity study extensively risk factor coronary heart disease stroke , receive less attention risk factor congestive heart failure ( CHF ) . Another area limit investigation study risk factor multi morbidity , i.e . occurrence several morbid event time , common old adult . Other area investigation study possible association heart rate dietary pattern development diabetes . The Chicago Heart Association Detection Project Western Electric study , support National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute , resource study association . Multiple measure obesity available several different time point follow-up data available 30-40 year increase power study . Data use project include baseline data collect 1967-73 39,522 subject Chicago Heart Association Study ( CHA ) baseline annual follow-up data Western Electric Study collect 1957-1966 consist 2107 men , age 40-55 year Chicago area . Mortality follow-up 2 cohort accomplish via National Death Index . Morbidity follow-up accomplish record linkage Medicare file extent followup questionnaires disease outcome although follow-up rate latter approach 60 percent . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study use extensive exist data Chicago Heart Association ( CHA ) [ 20,854 men 16,049 woman age 18-64 baseline ( 1967-73 ) ] Western Electric ( WE ) [ 2,107 men age 40- 55 baseline ( 1957-58 ) ] include four comprehensive source outcome : 1 ) mortality data long-term follow-up ; 2 ) morbidity data Medicare claim 19 year 1984 2000 ; 3 ) multiple health questionnaire ( CHA ) ; 4 ) repeat measure adiposity 8 annual re-examinations baseline ( WE ) . The study address follow specific aim : 1 ) investigate in-depth longitudinal association adiposity assess several index ( body mass index , weight gain , subscapular triceps skinfolds , derive percent body fat ) young adulthood middle age mortality morbidity congestive heart failure later life ; 2 ) delineate relationship adiposity assess earlier life older-age multimorbidity , coexistence multiple pathological condition vary severity -- common under-studied phenomenon among old adult ; 3 ) examine in-depth association heart rate change heart rate incident diabetes , stratify obesity status baseline . As exploratory aim , study ass whether ) high fruit vegetable low sugar intake ; b ) high dairy calcium intake associate low adiposity , small weight gain , low incidence diabetes .</detailed_description>
