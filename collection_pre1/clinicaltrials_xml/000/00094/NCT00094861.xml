	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Palifermin Reduction Dysphagia Patients With Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During acute dysphagia evaluation phase ( period last administration first dose investigational product Week 12 ( Week 16 dysphagia resolve CTCAE v3.0 grade â‰¤ 1 Week 12 ) participant underwent acute dysphagia assessment twice weekly . All participant follow disease progression , second primary tumor , malignancy , overall survival death loss follow-up long term follow-up ( still ongoing ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients histologically cytologically proven diagnosis NSCLC Unresectable ( locally advance ) stage IIIa IIIb disease Initial radiotherapy field treatment encompass great equal 30 % esophagus Life expectancy great equal 6 month Estimated weight loss less equal 10 % 3 month study randomization Measurable disease 18 year age old Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 2 Hemoglobin ( hgb ) great equal 10 g/dL without transfusional support growth factor use 4 week study randomization Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great equal 1.5 x 10^9/L without growth factor use 2 week study randomization Platelet count great equal 100 x 10^9/L Serum bilirubin less equal 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) Serum creatinine less equal 2.0 mg/dL ( Note : Patients serum creatinine great equal 1.4 less equal 2.0 mg/dL must demonstrate 24hour urinary creatinine clearance great equal 50 mL/min ) Females childbearing potential : negative serum urine pregnancy test Patient must give write informed consent participate studyspecific procedure , randomization , receive investigational product . Patients reproductive capability must agree practice adequate contraception method . Metastatic disease ( M1 ) /stage 4 NSCLC Pleural pericardial effusion great 100 ml volume document appropriate imaging ( positron emission tomography [ PET ] , compute tomography [ CT ] scan ultrasound ) . If effusion great 100 ml document cytology free malignancy investigator feels patient capable receive chemo/radiotherapy primary disease/ NSCLC , investigator discus patient study physician Amgen . Effusions small 100 ml would acceptable , unless investigator suspect effusion malignant , case effusion evaluate cytology . Sponsor approval must obtain patient randomize . Plan remove tumor surgically complete protocol chemo/radiotherapy course Shielding part esophagus radiotherapy ( include posterior spinal cord shielding ) Prior chemotherapy , radiotherapy , surgery NSCLC Prior invasive malignancy past 3 year nonmelanomatous skin cancer . Note : Patients prior surgicallycured malignancy [ eg , stage I breast cancer prostate cancer , insitu carcinoma cervix , etc ] exclude ; however , sponsor approval must obtain patient randomize . Presence history dysphagia condition predispose dysphagia ( eg , uncontrolled gastroesophageal reflux disease [ GERD ] , dyspepsia , etc ) History pancreatitis Four week less since completion treatment use investigational product/device another clinical study presence unresolved toxicity previous treatment Previous treatment study fibroblast growth factor Known seropositive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) , hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) Pregnant breastfeed woman Known sensitivity E. coli derive product Compromised ability patient give write informed consent and/or comply study procedure Refusal sign inform consent form participate study , sign hospital information release form , applicable Unwilling unable complete patient report outcome ( PRO ) questionnaires Psychological , social , familial , geographical reason would prevent regular followup</criteria>
