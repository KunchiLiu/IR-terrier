	<brief_summary>This study examine whether nitric oxide ( NO ) gas reduce time take pain go away patient sickle cell crisis . NO important regulate blood vessel dilation , consequently , blood flow . The gas continuously produce cell line blood vessel . It also transport lung hemoglobin red blood cell . Patients 10 year age old sickle cell disease ( know SS , S-beta-thalassemia blood problem cause sickle cell disease ) may eligible study . Patients whose disease due hemoglobin ( Hgb ) SC exclude . Candidates screen blood test chest x-ray look lung heart . Participants admit hospital pain crisis . They evaluate randomly assign receive one two treatment : 1 ) standard treatment plus NO , 2 ) standard treatment plus placebo . The placebo use study nitrogen , gas make air breathe know help sickle cell disease . For first 8 hour study , patient receive placebo NO facemask . The mask may take 5 minute every hour 20 minute eat meal . After first 8 hour , gas deliver nasal cannula ( small plastic tube rest nose ) may take shower use restroom . Patients question severity pain start study every hour hospital . Their vital sign ( temperature , breathe rate , blood pressure ) medicine check . Patients breathe gas maximum 3 day , stay hospitalize patient feel well enough go home . Patients follow 1 month start study return visit hospital phone call .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The object study determine safety efficacy nitric oxide inhalation treatment vaso-occlusive pain crisis ( VOC ) patient sickle cell disease . The study population include patient sickle cell disease ( SS , S-beta-Thalassemia ) present vaso-occlusive pain crisis . Patients administer either placebo inhale nitric oxide see experimental agent , inhale nitric oxide , reduce time take resolution vaso-occlusive crisis .</detailed_description>
