	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Male female subject inflammatory disease great equal 18 year age . Participation NIH study number 94AR0105 ( `` Genetics Pathophysiology FMF Related Disorders '' ) Subjects present active NOMID , MWS , FCAS , FMF , adult Still 's disease base clinical signs/symptoms and/or biochemical marker acute phase reactant ( CRP , SAA ESR ) . Subjects need clinical feature biochemical marker disease enrol . However , clinical laboratory response evaluate subject improvement outcome measure ( even improvement laboratory value find within normal range baseline ) . NOMID , MWS , FCAS : Diagnosis base history classical feature disease include fever , rash , joint involvement , CNS involvement . Approximately half subject clinical syndrome mutation negative ; however , experience principal investigator subject show favorable clinical response IL1 blockade anakinra . Therefore , subject without recognize mutation CIAS1 eligible enroll study . Active disease define either presence aforementioned classical feature , history feature become quiescent set therapy anakinra . However , patient quiescent disease currently take anakinra receive study drug , he/she must fulfill criterion active disease anakinra discontinue . FMF diagnose basis document presence one two mutant allele MEFV well history classical clinical feature FMF periodic fever , rash , arthritis , arthralgia , episodes serositis . Subjects must consider nonresponsive colchicine ( 2 milligram per day ) basis continue symptom flare ( great equal one per month ) elevate acute phase reactant ( ESR , CRP SAA great equal 1.5 time upper limit normal attack ) despite treatment maximally tolerated dos colchicine . Positive genetic test require FMF rule possibility nonresponse colchicine due misdiagnosis . Adult Still 's disease diagnose basis history classical clinical feature fever , evanescent salmonpink rash , arthritis , arthralgia , myalgia . Active disease define presence one feature and/ elevation acute phase reactant ( ESR , CRP SAA great equal 1.5 time upper limit normal ) . Subjects currently treat anakinra may enrol study even though autoinflammatory disease may quiescent . For subject history active autoinflammatory disease prior treatment anakinra sufficient . Subjects must great 48 hour last dose anakinra begin IL1 Trap therapy , take anakinra remainder enrollment study . However , study drug administer subject manifest sign active disease describe Stable dose steroid , NSAIDs , DMARDs , colchicine four week prior enrollment visit . Females childbearing potential ( young woman least one menstrual period regardless age ) must negative urine pregnancy test screen negative serum pregnancy test baseline prior performance radiologic procedure administration study medication . Women childbearing age men able father child , sexually active , agree use form effective birth control , include abstinence . Negative PPD test use 5 T.U . intradermal test per CDC guideline , evidence active TB chest Xray . Subjects latent TB ( positive PPD test ) currently treat adequate therapy initiate least one month prior first dose study medication may include . Full prophylaxis regimen complete . Subjects BCGvaccinated also skintested . Able understand , complete studyrelated questionnaire . Able willing give inform consent abide study procedure . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Treatment live virus vaccine 3 month prior baseline visit . No live vaccine allow throughout course study . Current treatment TNF inhibitor recent discontinuation TNF inhibitor ( use within less 5 halflives TNF inhibitor agent ) . Presence active infection history pulmonary TB infection without documented adequate therapy . Subjects current active TB , recent close exposure individual active TB exclude study . Chest xray read radiologist pleural scar and/or calcify granuloma consistent prior TB . Positive test prior history HIV , Hepatitis B C. History concomitant diagnosis congestive heart failure . History malignancy . Subjects deem cured superficial malignancy cutaneous basal squamous cell carcinoma , situ cervical cancer may enrol . Known hypersensitivity CHO cell derive biologicals component IL 1 Trap . Presence additional rheumatic disease significant systemic disease . For example , major chronic infectious/ inflammatory/ immunologic disease ( inflammatory bowel disease , psoriatic arthritis , spondyloarthropathy , SLE addition autoinflammatory disease ) . Presence follow laboratory abnormality enrollment visit : creatinine great 1.5 time upper limit normal , WBC le 3.6 x 10 ( 9 ) /mm ( 3 ) ; platelet count less 150,000 mm ( 3 ) ; ALT AST great 2.0 x ULN ( ALT/AST great 2.0 x ULN adult Still 's disease patient would prompt hepatology consult prior enrollment unless abnormality consider Principal Investigator reflective underlying Still 's disease ) . Lactating female pregnant female . Subjects asthma adequately control current therapy . Enrollment investigational treatment study use investigational agent , yet complete least 4 week 5 halflives , whichever longer , since end another investigational device drug trial . Subjects concern compliance protocol procedure . Presence severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition , significant laboratory abnormality require investigation may cause undue risk subject 's safety , inhibit protocol participation , interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator would make subject inappropriate entry study .</criteria>
