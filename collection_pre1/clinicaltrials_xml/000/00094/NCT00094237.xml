	<brief_title>Subclinical Thyroid Dysfunction Risk Myocardial Infarction Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Cardiovascular disease , include myocardial infarction ( MI ) stroke , lead cause death woman United States . Subclinical hypothyroidism ( SCH ) , thyroid hormone level normal range thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) elevate , link abnormal lipid profile , atherosclerosis , MI . The literature scant however , evidence constrain small study , many cross-sectional design . Both US Preventive Services Task Force Institute Medicine recently conclude current data insufficient inform clinical decision-making need screen treatment SCH . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This case-cohort study within 93,676-member Observational Study Women 's Health Initiative , include 800 woman experience MI , 750 thrombotic/embolic stroke , randomly select subcohort 3,200 woman density-matched age , race/ethnicity , clinical center . Participants extensive baseline demographic , health , behavioral , physical exam data store serum available . The investigator measure TSH thyroid hormone level order identify SCH entry . Follow-up include annual health status update physical exam third year ; &gt; =5 year pass since enrollment woman . Thus , use new laboratory study exist Women 's Health Initiative ( WHI ) data , able answer primary research question : Among woman without history thyroid disease , MI , stroke : 1 ) Is subclinical hypothyroidism baseline independently associate risk MI ? 2 ) Is subclinical hypothyroidism baseline independently associate risk ischemic stroke ? 3 ) What form association best describes relationship TSH , continuous measure , risk MI stroke ? 4 ) What population correlate ( i.e. , race/ethnicity , body mass index ( BMI ) , hormone therapy , comorbidity ) SCH ? This information - currently unavailable middle-aged old woman - germane public health health care policy define burden illness associate SCH , quantify benefit cost eventual population screen treatment</detailed_description>
