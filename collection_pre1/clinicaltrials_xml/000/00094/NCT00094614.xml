	<brief_summary>The goal study : - To compare visual acuity outcome amblyopic eye 17 week daily use atropine versus weekend-only use atropine . - To compare proportion patient achieve complete treatment response ( define amblyopic eye acuity &gt; 20/25 equal sound eye absence reduction sound eye acuity baseline ) daily atropine versus weekend-only atropine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Comparing Daily Atropine Versus Weekend Atropine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Amblyopia common cause monocular visual impairment child young middle-aged adult . Patching mainstay amblyopia therapy . It generally hold response treatment best institute early age poor attempt eight year age . The study 'Occlusion versus Pharmacologic Therapy Moderate Amblyopia ' , randomize trial 419 child meet entry criterion similar current study , find atropine 1 % ( one drop daily ) patching ( 6 hour full time daily ) produce visual acuity improvement similar magnitude appropriate treatment modality management moderate amblyopia child . Patching potential advantage rapid improvement visual acuity possibly slightly good acuity outcome , whereas atropine potential advantage easy administration low cost . Through cycloplegic effect , atropine prevents accommodation , blur sound eye near fixation . The blur effect augment reduce spectacle correction hyperopia sound eye . The cycloplegic effect last least partially week longer . Therefore , pediatric eye care provider believe daily use atropine unnecessary treatment may effective dosage little week . One advantage le frequent dose potential reduction side effect , include potential adverse effect vision sound eye ( reverse amblyopia ) , ocular alignment , binocularity . The current study ass whether prescribe atropine day produce good visual outcome atropine use two weekend day . In 'Occlusion versus Pharmacologic Therapy Moderate Amblyopia ' study , 6-month outcome data show patient treat atropine reduction visual acuity 1 line sound eye patient treat patch . Visual acuity decrease baseline 1 line 15 % atropine group compare 7 % patch group 2 line 9 % atropine group 1 % patch group . Only one patient ( atropine group ) actively treat presumed treatment-related decrease sound eye acuity , return acuity baseline level . Some case reduce acuity unequivocally due use improper refractive correction sound eye test ( include nine case test do plano lens prescribe therapeutic effect rather proper corrective lens ) . In case , speculate residual cycloplegic effect atropine combine improper refractive correction relate previously latent hyperopia become manifest hyperopia period atropine treatment , although data fully document case . All 47 atropine group patient decrease one line six month subsequent follow-up exam . Acuity subsequent test good baseline 42 47 patient : 22 still atropine treatment ( 11 refractive correction 11 different refractive correction ) 20 atropine discontinue ( 6 refractive correction 14 different refractive correction ) . In five patient , acuity subsequent testing decrease baseline one line ( 3 atropine , 2 atropine ) . Thus , appear long-term safety concern atropine , data inconclusive whether atropine cause actual , though transient , treatment-related decrease sound eye acuity . One objectives current study provide additional data effect atropine sound eye . The study randomize trial compare atropine regime child moderate amblyopia . It consist 160 child . Patients daily atropine group receive atropine 1 % one drop daily sound eye . Patients weekend atropine group receive atropine 1 % twice week ( Saturday Sunday ) sound eye . Visual acuity major study outcome . It measure 17 week treatment either daily weekend atropine .</detailed_description>
