	<criteria>Locally advanced metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma curable surgery amenable radiation therapy curative intent . Histologically cytologically document locally advanced metastatic colorectal cancer . The site primary lesion must confirm endoscopically , radiologically , surgically large bowel . Measurable evaluable disease . ECOG performance status 0 , 1 2 Life expectancy ≥ 12 week All following : ( 1 ) ≥ 4 week must elapse time major surgery subject must recover effect ( e.g. , laparotomy ) ; ( 2 ) ≥ 2 week must elapse time minor surgery subject must recover operation ( insertion vascular access device consider major minor surgery ) ; ( 3 ) ≥ 4 week must elapse time major radiotherapy ( e.g. , chest bone palliative radiation therapy ) . Subjects may receive prior adjuvant therapy one prior chemotherapy regimen metastatic disease provide 30 day elapse last chemotherapy dose . Subject must recover prior chemotherapy complication opinion investigator , subject current status place subject risk entry trial . Subjects prior exposure oxaliplatin irinotecan eligible participate study . However , subject receive prior therapy oxaliplatin , eligible receive FOLFIRI regimen . If subject receive prior therapy irinotecan , eligible receive FOLFOX regimen .
