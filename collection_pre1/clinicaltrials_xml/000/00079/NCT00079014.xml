	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose 3-AP doxorubicin treat patient metastatic refractory solid tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , doxorubicin , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . 3-AP may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary tumor cell growth may help doxorubicin kill cancer cell make sensitive drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To find maximal tolerate dose combination doxorubicin Triapine® patient refractory solid tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To find severity frequency toxicity associate combination observe record antitumor activity . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate effect Triapine®/doxorubicin ribonucleotide reductase tyrosyl radical vivo EPR spectroscopy buccal mucosal cell , peripheral blood lymphocyte tumor biopsy . Formation low molecular weight iron-Triapine® chelate also assess EPR . II . To evaluate effect Triapine®/doxorubicin cell cycle vivo measure S-phase arrest buccal mucosal cell . III . To evaluate effect Triapine®/doxorubicin MDR gene expression polymorphism blood . IV . To evaluate effect Triapine®/doxorubicin ribonucleotide reductase R2 mRNA immunohistochemistry . V. To evaluate pharmacokinetic profile combination . VI . To measure formulation circulate isoprostanes indicator oxidative stress combination . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study 3-AP ( Triapine^® ) . Patients receive doxorubicin IV 15 minute day 1 3-AP ( Triapine® ) IV 2 hour day 1-4 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos 3-AP ( Triapine® ) maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Once MTD determine , additional 6 patient treat dose level . Patients follow disease progression .</detailed_description>
