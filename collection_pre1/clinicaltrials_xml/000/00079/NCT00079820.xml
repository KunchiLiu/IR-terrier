	<brief_summary>The purpose study gather information safety effectiveness investigational vaccine prevention smallpox disease . Smallpox one major cause death sickness first half 20th century , global program smallpox eradication result elimination natural disease . The last case smallpox United States occur 1949 Texas . Today , laboratory worker work smallpox-related virus , military personnel , health care worker vaccinate . Historically , individual US vaccinate product Dryvax速 , contain virus vaccinia family smallpox . This virus could promote immunity smallpox , produce disease . Although effective , vaccine safe use people atopic dermatitis ( eczema , allergic immune response allergen ) , child less 1 year age , people compromise immune system , occur certain disease ( HIV positive individual AIDS ) , follow treatment certain type drug . It important find safe vaccine use protect people receive routine vaccinia-based smallpox vaccine . The vaccine study know Modified Vaccinia Ankara MVA vaccine . It objective study find MVA vaccine safe effective provide immunity smallpox . The effectiveness vaccine measure two way . The first way find specific antibody blood follow MVA vaccination . Antibodies chemical body produce fight smallpox virus . The second way see whether typical skin reaction follow vaccination traditional smallpox vaccine , give three month vaccination MVA vaccine . The typical reaction unvaccinated person smallpox vaccine formation blister `` pox '' occur site vaccination . In person immunity smallpox skin reaction much less , typically consist little swell site vaccination .</brief_summary>
