	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , target tumor cell either kill deliver tumor-killing substance without harm normal cell . Best supportive care use drug treatment improve quality life patient . Combining cetuximab best supportive care may slow growth tumor help patient live long comfortably . It yet know whether cetuximab combine best supportive care effective best supportive care alone treat metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor-positive colorectal cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study cetuximab best supportive care see well work compare best supportive care alone treat patient metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor-positive colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cetuximab Best Supportive Care Compared With Best Supportive Care Alone Treating Patients With Metastatic Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-Positive Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare survival patient metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor-positive colorectal cancer treat cetuximab best supportive care v best supportive care alone . Secondary - Compare time disease progression patient treat regimen . - Compare objective response rate patient treat regimen . - Compare quality life patient treat regimen . - Compare health utility patient treat regimen . - Conduct comparative economic evaluation patient treat regimen . - Determine safety profile cetuximab patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord participate center ECOG performance status ( 0 1 v 2 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive initial load dose cetuximab IV 120 minute day 1 . Patients continue receive maintenance infusion cetuximab IV 60 minute weekly . Patients also receive best supportive care , define measure design provide palliation symptom improve quality life much possible . - Arm II : Patients receive best supportive care arm I . In arm , treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline , 4 , 8 , 16 , 24 week ( deterioration ECOG PS 4 hospitalization end-of-life care ) . Patients follow every 4 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 500 patient ( 250 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 20 month .</detailed_description>
