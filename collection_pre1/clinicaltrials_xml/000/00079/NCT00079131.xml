	<brief_title>Oblimersen Treating Patients With Merkel Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine overall response rate patient Merkel cell carcinoma treat oblimersen . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine time progression patient treat drug . II . Determine response duration patient treat drug . III . Determine safety tolerability drug patient . IV . Determine pharmacodynamic effect drug bcl-2 expression apoptosis tumor biopsy specimens patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously day 1-14 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
