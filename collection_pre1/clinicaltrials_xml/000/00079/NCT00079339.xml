	<brief_title>Tipifarnib Radiation Therapy Treating Young Patients With Brainstem Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) R115777 administer concurrently radiation therapy pediatric patient non-disseminated , diffuse , intrinsic brainstem glioma receive enzyme-inducing anti-convulsant drug ( EIACD ) . II . To assess efficacy R115777 treatment combination radiation therapy patient non-disseminated , diffuse , intrinsic pontine glioma measure progression-free survival survival distribution . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize toxicity associate R115777 treatment combination post radiation therapy . II . To characterize radiographic change brainstem glioma treat radiation R115777 use MRI , perfusion diffusion image PET scan . OUTLINE : This phase I ( close accrual 1/19/06 ) , multicenter , dose-escalation study tipifarnib follow phase II safety efficacy study . PHASE I : Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 day week 6 week . Beginning 0-2 day radiotherapy , patient receive oral tipifarnib twice daily completion radiotherapy . Beginning 2 week completion radiotherapy , patient receive oral tipifarnib twice daily week 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 24 additional course ( total 26 course ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos tipifarnib radiotherapy maximum tolerate dose determine . The MTD define dose level precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . PHASE II : Patients undergo radiotherapy receive tipifarnib MTD phase I ( close accrual 1/19/06 ) . Treatment continue 24 month ( 26 course ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . FOLLOW-UP : Phase I : Participants contribute phase I part follow 90 day completion therapy . Adverse event resolve within 90 day stop treatment follow resolution . Phase II : Participants phase I part treat MTD participant phase II part follow early death three year start treatment . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 3-55 patient ( 3-18 patient phase I [ close accrual 1/19/06 ] total 40 patient phase II [ include 6 patient treat dose-finding portion phase I ( close accrual 1/19/06 ) ] ) accrue study within 2.3 year .</detailed_description>
