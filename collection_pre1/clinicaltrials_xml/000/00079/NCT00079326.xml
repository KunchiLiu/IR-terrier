	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give trastuzumab together ixabepilone work treat woman HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer . Monoclonal antibody , trastuzumab , locate tumor cell either kill deliver tumor-killing substance without harm normal cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , ixabepilone , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining trastuzumab ixabepilone may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trastuzumab Ixabepilone Treating Women With HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Examine response rate HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer combination therapy trastuzumab BMS-247550 two cohort woman : a. woman receive prior chemotherapy trastuzumab metastatic breast cancer ; b. woman receive prior trastuzumab therapy ( either metastatic disease prior adjuvant trastuzumab &lt; 1 year since completion adjuvant trastuzumab therapy ) 2 prior chemotherapeutic regimen metastatic setting . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize safety toxicity profile trastuzumab combination BMS-247550 . II . To determine time-to-disease-progression ( TTP ) time-to-treatment-failure ( TTF ) patient receive trastuzumab combination BMS-247550 cohort . III . Analyze various tissue biomarkers ( e.g . HER2/phospho-HER2 , EGFR/phospho-EGFR , IGRF-I , phospho-MAPK , phospho-P13K , bcl-2 , bcl-xL , MDR-1 , MRP β-tubulin ) blood biomarkers ( HER2-extracellular domain [ ECD ] , circulate tumor cell ) correlate response treatment . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior trastuzumab ( Herceptin® ) therapy ( without chemotherapy ) metastatic breast cancer ( yes v ) . Patients receive trastuzumab IV 30-90 minute ixabepilone IV 3 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
