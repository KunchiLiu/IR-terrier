	<brief_summary>To investigate safety antitumor activity SGN-30 patient Hodgkin 's Disease anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( ALCL ) . As March 22 , 2005 , interim analysis Hodgkin 's Disease ( HD ) arm complete per statistical plan protocol . SG030-0003 close recruitment HD patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study SGN-30 ( Antibody ) Patients With Refractory Recurrent Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SGN-30 chimeric form novel murine monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) , AC-10 , specificity CD30 . The CD30 antigen low expression normal cell , express malignant cell Hodgkins disease anaplastic large cell lymphoma . This study design define toxicity profile antitumor activity SGN-30 patient refractory recurrent Hodgkin 's disease refractory recurrent anaplastic large cell lymphoma . Patients receive 6 weekly intravenous ( IV ) infusions SGN-30 follow 4 week observation period .</detailed_description>
