	<brief_summary>We study investigational drug treatment , compare placebo , evaluate whether effective reduce number MRI lesion minimum number side effect . The investigational drug administer clinic weekly 5 injection ( induction phase ) monthly 8 additional injection ( maintenance phase ) . Approximately 150 male female patient ( 100 active 50 placebo ) , age 18 55 year , relapse MS least one 10 total Gd-enhancing lesion cranial MRI scan run-in phase randomize study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Altered Peptide Ligand ( NBI-5788 ) Patients With Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis ( MS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial qualify patient randomize 2:1 receive active drug placebo . Eligible patient must MS relapse , one relapse prior 2 year , 1-10 gadolinium ( Gd ) -enhancing lesion Run-in MRI , EDSS 6.5 le . There exclusion certain prior MS treatment medical / psychiatric condition . Following 4-week run-in phase patient baseline MRI , patient enter 4 week induction phase , receive injection weekly ( 5 dos ) , 32-week maintenance phase injection monthly ( 8 dos ) . A final follow-up visit conduct 4 week last injection . The primary efficacy parameter summary change score mean number total Gd-enhancing lesion week 36 40 minus mean number two baseline scan . Safety monitor include AE/SAE reporting , physical exam , vital sign , ECG . CXR , laboratory test , neurologic evaluation , systemic hypersensitivity injection site assessment . All study medication administer study personnel patient remain observation minimum 2 hour post-injection . An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board oversee safety trial .</detailed_description>
