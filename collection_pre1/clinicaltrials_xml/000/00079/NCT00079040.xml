	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give cisplatin etoposide together bevacizumab work treat patient previously untreated extensive-stage small cell lung cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin etoposide , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill deliver tumor-killing substance . Giving chemotherapy monoclonal antibody may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cisplatin , Etoposide , Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate combination PE plus concurrent sequential bevacizumab respect six month progression free survival patient previously untreated SCLC . II . To evaluate combination PE plus concurrent sequential bevacizumab respect survival response rate . III . To evaluate toxicity patient extensive small cell lung cancer , treat combination PE plus concurrent sequential bevacizumab receive prior systemic chemotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine pre-treatment level plasma VEGF predict response chemotherapy Etoposide-Cisplatin plus concurrent + sequential bevacizumab . II . To determine pre-treatment plasma VEGF predictive progression free survival overall survival advance SCLC . III . To determine whether elevated plasma level endothelial cell-specific protein ( VCAM , E-selectin ) , reflective chemotherapy bevacizumab induce endothelial damage , useful marker assess response Etoposide/Cisplatin plus concurrent + sequential bevacizumab . IV . To determine whether pre- post-treatment plasma level basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) predictive progression free survival overall survival predictive response therapy . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Chemotherapy : Patients receive cisplatin IV 30-60 minute day 1 etoposide IV 60 minute day 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Bevacizumab therapy : Beginning concurrently chemotherapy , patient receive bevacizumab IV 90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 17 course ( 1 year ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 6 week 3 year study entry .</detailed_description>
