	<brief_summary>This Phase 1 trial investigate safety modify stem cell transplant procedure treat advance breast cancer . Patients cancer sometimes benefit greatly transplant stem cell ( cell produce bone marrow mature blood cell ) . In addition produce new bone marrow restore normal blood production immunity , donate cell fight residual tumor cell might remain body , call `` graft-versus-tumor '' effect . However , severe problem , sometimes even death , may follow transplant result high-dose chemotherapy radiation accompany procedure . Also , donate immune cell call lymphocyte , T cell , sometimes attack healthy tissue reaction call graft-versus-host-disease ( GVHD ) , damage organ liver , intestine skin . This study use follow strategy try reduce risk : - `` Induction chemotherapy '' reduce patient ' immunity attempt prevent rejection donate stem cell - Reduced-intensity conditioning chemotherapy easy body tolerate involve short period complete immune suppression - Removal lymphocytes donor stem cell transfusion small quantity monthly interval follow stem cell transplant reduce risk GVHD - Transplant specific lymphocytes call Th2/Tc2 cell may increase percentage donor stem cell accept patient without significantly increase GVHD Patients 18 75 year age advance ( stage IV ) breast cancer respond standard therapy may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical dental examination , x-ray study bone marrow biopsy evaluate disease status , blood urine test ( include blood test genetic match donor ) , lung heart function test . Participants central venous line ( large plastic tube ) place major vein . This tube stay body entire treatment period infuse donated stem cell T lymphocytes , give medication , include chemotherapy drug , antibiotic , blood transfusion , withdraw blood sample . Treatment start induction chemotherapy , patient receive one two cycle anti-cancer drug fludarabine cyclophosphamide . ( One cycle consist 4 day drug therapy follow 17-day rest period . ) G-CSF , drug boost white cell production , also give reduce risk infection . Several day transplant procedure , patient begin condition chemotherapy high dos cyclophosphamide fludarabine . Three day condition therapy complete , stem cell infuse . To help prevent rejection donor stem cell GVHD , patient receive cyclosporine ( first vein later mouth ) several week transplant . Infusions donor lymphocytes begin 6 week transplant boost immune system enhance graft-versus-tumor effect . Patients may leave hospital able eat drink , fever infection , normal near-normal white cell count . They return follow-up visit twice week first 100 day transplant , every 3 month , 6 month yearly least 5 year post-transplant . The visit include medical history , physical examination , blood draw , well disease stag CT scan every month first 6 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stem Cell Transplant With Th2/Tc2 Cells Treat Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - In CC # 00-C-0119 able demonstrate allogeneic T cell could mediate clinically relevant graft-versus-tumor ( GVT ) effect MBC reduced-intensity , T cell deplete allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( alloHSCT ) . - Responses observed establishment complete lymphoid chimerism , frequently delay require use plan donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) . DLI associate significant incidence graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . - In murine model , vitro generate T cell Th2/Tc2 phenotype facilitate engraftment HLA disparate allograft significantly reduce GVHD compare T cell replete allografts manipulate . In addition , Th2/Tc2 cell provide anti-tumor effect perforin/granzyme pathway . - Allogeneic Th2/Tc2 cell may facilitate rapid allo-engraftment post-transplant reduce GVHD . In addition , perforin-mediated anti-tumor activity Th2/Tc2 cell provide early benefit compare T-cell deplete allograft . Objectives : -To determine safety , define incidence acute graft-versus-host disease , feasibility administer vitro generate donor T cell Th2/Tc2 phenotype augment T cell deplete allograft ( T cell exchange ) reduced-intensity conditioning . Eligibility : - Patients measurable , metastatic breast cancer HLA match sibling donor - Patients must receive treatment taxane , anthracycline , hormonal agent and/or Herceptin , tumor express respective receptor , least one treatment metastatic disease result complete response . Design : - Donors initially lymphocytes collected generate Th2/Tc2 product blood stem cell collect follow mobilization filgrastim . The stem cell product T-cell deplete , T-cell dose adjust 1 x 10 ( 5 ) CD3+ cells/kg . - Patients receive induction ( immune depleting ) chemotherapy goal reduce circulate CD4+ cell le 50/microliter prior proceed alloHSCT . - Patients receive reduced-intensity conditioning regimen consist fludarabine cyclophosphamide . This follow infusion T cell deplete allograft , supplement Th2/Tc2 cell ( i.e . T cell exchange ) . - Cyclosporine discontinue 40 day permit full GVT effect . Patients may receive donor lymphocyte infusion day +42 , +70 , +98 post-transplant potentiate GVT effect . - Patients enrol three cohort , escalate Th2/Tc2 cell dos ( 0.5 - 12.5 x 10 ( 7 ) cells/kg ) give phase-I manner .</detailed_description>

Patients central nervous system CNS metastases eligible CNS metastasis treat remain stable minimum four week completion therapy . 2 . Patients must receive least one prior chemotherapy regimen treatment distant metastases achieve less complete response therapy . 1 . Patients must receive prior therapy taxane ( e.g . paclitaxel ) anthracycline ( e.g . doxorubicin ) part either adjuvant therapy treatment metastatic disease . 2 . Patients whose tumor express estrogen and/or progesterone receptor must receive least one hormonal therapy ( e.g . Tamoxifen ) part either adjuvant therapy treatment metastatic disease . 3 . Patients whose tumor express Her2neu must receive trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) part either adjuvant therapy treatment metastatic disease . 4 . Patients undergone prior autologous stem cell transplantation eligible protocol . 3 . Patients 18 75 year age . The upper age limit choose order discriminatory , provide patient meet eligibility criterion . 4 . ECOG performance status less equal 2 ( Karnofsky performance status great equal 60 % ) . 5 .
