	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial originally design compare three different combination chemotherapy regimens see well work . As September 1 , 2004 , study expand total 6 arm ( original 3 arm ( A , B , C ) 3 additional arm first 3 cetuximab ) treat patient undergone surgery stage III colon cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , irinotecan hydrochloride , fluorouracil , leucovorin calcium , oxaliplatin , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Monoclonal antibody cetuximab locate tumor cell either kill deliver tumor-killing substance without harm normal cell . Combining one chemotherapy drug monoclonal antibody therapy give surgery may kill remain tumor cell . It known time study develop combination chemotherapy regimen effective surgery treat colon cancer . This study several key change , base result phase III trial . As 6/1/2005 , patient longer receive irinotecan study treatment arm B , C , E , F discontinue . Patients arm B C cross arm A . Patients arm E F cross arm D. Patients arm C F gotten irinotecan continue arm A D , respectively . As 8/18/2008 , pre-screening Kirsten rat sarcoma ( KRAS ) status add mutant KRAS ( KRAS evaluable ) patient put arm G wild-type KRAS patient randomize arm A arm D. Patients arm G treat per physician discretion follow disease survival status . KRAS determine central laboratory process patient study . The primary endpoint study modify 8/18/2008 focus patient wild-type KRAS tumor . All modification approve Central Institution Review Board , local Institutional Review Boards , NCI , NCCTG Data Safety Monitoring Board .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Disease-free Survival ( Arms A D : Wild-type KRAS Patients ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Disease-free Survival ( Arms A D : Mutant KRAS Patients ) II . Disease-free Survival III . Overall Survival IV . Toxicity OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord positive lymph node involvement ( 1-3 v 4 ) , histology ( high [ poorly differentiate undifferentiated ] v low [ well moderately differentiate ] ) , clinical T stage ( T1 T2 v T3 v T4 ) . Patients randomize 1 6 treatment arm ( 6/1/2005 , patient randomize treatment arm I IV ; arm II , III , V , VI close accrual ) . As 8/18/2008 , pre-screening KRAS status add mutant KRAS ( KRAS evaluable ) patient put arm G wild-type KRAS patient randomize arm A arm D. ARM A : Patients receive oxaliplatin intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour , fluorouracil IV continuously 46-48 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 12 course absence unacceptable toxicity recurrent disease . ARM B ( close accrual 6/1/2005 -- currently enrolled patient may cross arm I remainder therapy ) : Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV 2 hour day 1 leucovorin calcium fluorouracil arm A . Treatment repeat every 14 day 12 course absence unacceptable toxicity recurrent disease . ARM C ( close accrual 6/1/2005 -- currently enrolled patient may cross arm I remainder therapy ) : Patients receive treatment arm A 6 course follow treatment arm B 6 course ( total 12 course ) . Treatment continue absence unacceptable toxicity recurrent disease . ARM D : Patients receive cetuximab* IV 1 hour day 1 8 oxaliplatin , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil arm A . Treatment repeat every 14 day 12 course absence unacceptable toxicity recurrent disease . ARM E ( close accrual 6/1/2005 -- currently enrolled patient may cross arm D remainder therapy ) : Patients receive cetuximab* arm D irinotecan hydrochloride , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil arm B . Treatment repeat every 14 day 12 course absence unacceptable toxicity recurrent disease . ARM F ( close accrual 6/1/2005 -- currently enrolled patient may cross arm D remainder therapy ) : Patients receive cetuximab* arm D chemotherapy arm C. ARM G ( add 8/18/2008 , mutant KRAS ( KRAS evaluable ) patient ) : Locally direct therapy . NOTE : *Cetuximab administer 2 hour higher dose day 1 course 1 . Quality life ( QOL ) assess baseline , 3 month , end therapy . As 8/18/2008 , QOL discontinue . Patients follow maximum 8 year randomization .</detailed_description>
