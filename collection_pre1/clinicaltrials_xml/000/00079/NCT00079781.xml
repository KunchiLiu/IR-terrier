	<brief_title>RNS® System Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NeuroPace , Inc. sponsor investigational device feasibility study RNS® System , first close loop responsive brain stimulator design treat medically refractory epilepsy . The RNS® System Feasibility study multi-center investigation conduct 12 epilepsy center United States . The first 4 subject site enter open label protocol , subsequent subject site enter randomized , double-blinded , sham-stimulation control protocol . The study design demonstrate safety evidence effectiveness RNS® System support commencement pivotal clinical investigation . The RNS® Neurostimulator ( pacemaker-like device ) NeuroPace® Leads ( tiny wire electrode ) implant head . The Neurostimulator battery power , microprocessor control device detects store record electrographic pattern ( epileptiform , seizure-like , activity ) Leads within brain . When device detects electrographic pattern , respond send electrical stimulation Leads small part patient 's brain interrupt electrographic pattern . This type treatment call responsive stimulation , yet know work treatment epilepsy . Direct brain stimulation therapy already receive approval United States , Europe , Canada , Australia treatment Essential Tremor Parkinson 's disease . Direct brain stimulation approve treatment epilepsy . Subjects participate RNS® System Feasibility study require successfully complete non-significant risk Prospective Seizure Frequency ( PSF ) study , gather baseline ( pre-implant ) seizure frequency data . Subjects must also meet inclusion criterion , include localization epileptogenic region ( ) , prior enrol study . Throughout entire study , subject caregiver must keep seizure diary . Seizure frequency , seizure severity , antiepileptic medication , well physical emotional health monitor record throughout study . Antiepileptic medication continue remain stable 5 month post-implant . Following enrollment , prior RNS® System implant , subject undergo neuropsychological evaluation . During implant procedure , RNS® Neurostimulator cranially implant connected one two NeuroPace® Leads implant brain . The investigational team determines placement Leads base prior localization epileptogenic region , accord standard localization procedure . The Evaluation Period begin subject implant RNS® System continue 4th month . Detection epileptiform activity enable subject within first post-operative month . Responsive stimulation enable optimized subject enrol open label protocol randomize Treatment group . Subjects randomized Sham group undergo simulate stimulation program order maintain treatment blind . Randomized subject know whether responsive stimulation deliver . At begin 5th month , subject transition Follow Period subject may receive responsive stimulation antiepileptic medication may adjust medically require . Subjects follow 2 year post-implant . Throughout study participation , effectiveness safety data monitor continuously , review document study investigator study appointment schedule every 1-3 month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Subject simple partial seizure ( motor sensory ) complex partial seizure ( motor manifestation ) without secondarily generalize seizures 2 . Subject seizure distinct , stereotypical event reliably count , opinion investigator , subject caregiver 3 . Subject seizure severe enough cause injury significantly impair functional ability domains include employment , psychosocial , education mobility 4 . Subject fail treatment minimum two antiseizure medication ( use appropriate dos ) adequate monitor compliance effect treatment 5 . Subject remain antiseizure medication ( ) precede three ( 3 ) month ( independent dose acute , intermittent use benzodiazepine ) 6 . Subject minimum four ( 4 ) countable seizure every month last three ( 3 ) month , report NeuroPace sponsor Prospective Seizure Frequency Clinical Investigation 7 . Subject ≥ 18 year old ≤ 65 year old 8 . Subject undergone diagnostic test establish epileptiform activity onset region ( ) part his/her standard care determine candidacy epilepsy surgery 9 . Subject male , female use reliable method contraception ( hormonal , barrier method , surgical abstention ) , least two year postmenopause 10 . Subject legal guardian able provide appropriate consent participate 11 . Subject reasonably expect maintain seizure diary alone assistance competent individual 12 . Subject able complete regular office visit telephone appointment per protocol requirement 13 . Subject willing implant RNS® System treatment his/her seizures 14 . Subject able tolerate neurosurgical procedure 15 . Subject consider good candidate implant RNS® System Note : 1 month = 28 day 1 . Subject diagnose psychogenic nonepileptic seizure precede year 2 . Subject diagnose primarily generalize seizures 3 . Subject experience unprovoked status epilepticus precede year 4 . In opinion investigator , subject clinically significant unstable medical condition progressive central nervous system disease 5 . Subject diagnose active psychosis , severe depression suicidal ideation precede year 6 . Subject pregnant planning become pregnant next year 7 . Subject ketogenic diet 8 . Subject enrol therapeutic investigational drug device study precede year 9 . Subject implanted Vagus Nerve Stimulator ( VNS ) 10 . Subject therapeutic surgery treat epilepsy precede year 11 . Subject implanted electronic medical device delivers electrical energy head body 12 . Subject chronic anticoagulant , opinion investigator , subject unsuitable candidate cranial surgery reason 13 . Subject cranial neurosurgical procedure previous month 14 . Subject require repeat MRIs 15 . Subject 's seizure onset zone ( ) is/are locate level subthalamic nucleus , opinion investigator , necessary lead placement would present high risk Note : Subjects inactive VNS could enrol long VNS explanted prior time RNS® System implant . Subjects epilepsy surgery ( resective , corpus callosotomy ablation ) great one year ago still eligible .</criteria>
