	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Provide write informed consent initiation studyrelated procedure , Be least 18 year age , Be schedule CABG , CABG single valve surgery , isolate single valve surgery CPB . Patients undergoing repeat ( redo ) CABG also consider eligible study , demonstrate New diagnosis history objectively document HIT/HITTS Type II , define one following : 1 . Positive heparininduced platelet aggregation ( HIPA ) functional assay HIT immunoassay HIT antibody ( ELISA ) , AND/OR 2 . HIT : Thrombocytopenia associate heparin therapy , platelet count decrease 50 % * , OR 3 . HITTS : Thrombocytopenia ( define B ) PLUS evidence arterial venous thrombosis Exclusion Criteria Confirmed pregnancy time enrollment via IVRS ( woman childbearing potential ) ( Urine serum pregnancy test ) Cerebrovascular accident within 6 month , cerebrovascular accident residual neurological deficit . Intracranial neoplasm , arteriovenous malformation aneurysm . Dependency renal dialysis creatinine clearance &lt; 30mL/min . Ongoing treatment warfarin ( oral anticoagulant ) time enrollment . Patients previously treat warfarin may enrol warfarin therapy safely discontinue baseline INR &lt; 1.3 time control absence heparin therapy . Known allergy Angiomax hirudin derive drug , know sensitivity component product . Patients receive clopidogrel ( Plavix® ) within previous 5 day may enrol opinion Investigator benefit surgery outweigh risk associate recent clopidogrel administration . Patients receive glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor within previous 48 hour prior enrollment abciximab ( ReoPro® ) 12 hour eptifibatide ( Integrilin® ) tirofiban ( Aggrastat® ) , may enrol opinion Investigator benefit surgery outweigh risk associate wait 48 12 hour time period prior enrollment . Patients receive lepirudin ( Refludan® ) argatroban within previous 24 hour prior enrollment . Patients currently receive lepirudin argatroban enrol switched Angiomax least 24 hour prior plan cardiac surgery . Patients receive LMWH thrombolytic within previous 12 hour may enrol opinion Investigator benefit surgery outweigh risk associate wait 12 hour time period . Participation clinical research study involve evaluation investigational drug device within 30 day enrollment . Refusal undergo blood transfusion become necessary . Any disease condition , , judgment Investigator , would place patient undue risk enrol trial , cause inability comply trial . Planned surgical procedure proximal anastomosis precede distal anastomosis bypass graft . Planned ( &gt; 1 ) double ( great ) valve repairreplacement ( e.g . : AVRMVR ) surgery .</criteria>
