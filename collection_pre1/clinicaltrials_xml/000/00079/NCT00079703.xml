	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Reduction risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) dietary change considerable potential beneficial impact public health . On population basis , moderation lipid profile blood pressure accomplish readily prudent diet . Nevertheless , individual response dietary impact CVD risk factor varies widely , presumably result genetic difference . In particular , Blacks constitute subpopulation document increase risk morbidity mortality CVD would disproportionately benefit intervention design maximize impact dietary change tailor individual genetic makeup . Therefore , study influence diet CVD risk factor , along enhance understanding genetic component involve , would greatly potentiate chronic disease intervention . The study conduct response Request Applications issue October , 2001 Interaction Genes Environment Shaping Risk Factors Heart , Lung , Blood , Sleep Disorders . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Two-generational family line identify Blacks elevate low density lipoprotein-C ( LDLC ) probands . The population feed control diet contrast establish heart healthy regimen typical American one . Concomitant rigorous genetic , anthropometric , behavioral evaluation provide data analyze individual difference response consistent dietary intake . In Specific Aim 1 , Black , two-generational , family recruit provided interventional diet design reduce ( ) LDL-C blood pressure . In Specific Aim 2 , non-genetic predictor CVD risk factor response identify extensive assessment baseline behavioral characteristic , anthropometric feature , metabolic factor . In Specific Aim 3 , underlying genetic factor predispose response ( lack ) dietary intervention identify examination polymorphism candidate gene identification susceptibility loci linkage analysis . In Specific Aim 4 , interaction diet , CVD risk factor response genetic factor dissect measure potential mediate metabolic pathway .</detailed_description>
