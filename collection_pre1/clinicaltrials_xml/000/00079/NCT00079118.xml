	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , irinotecan docetaxel , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining one chemotherapy drug may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give irinotecan together docetaxel work treat patient refractory metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan Docetaxel Treating Patients With Refractory Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine antitumor activity irinotecan docetaxel , term response rate , patient refractory metastatic breast cancer . Secondary - Determine toxicity profile regimen patient . - Determine progression-free overall survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive docetaxel IV 1 hour follow irinotecan IV 1 hour day 1 8 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 2 additional course beyond CR . Patients follow every 2 month disease progression every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
