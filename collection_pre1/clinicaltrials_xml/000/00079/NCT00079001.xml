	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Zoledronate may prevent decrease skeletal ( bone ) -related event ( pain fracture ) cause bone metastasis androgen deprivation therapy . It yet know whether treatment zoledronate effective prevent bone-related event patient prostate cancer bone metastasis . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study well zoledronate work prevent bone-related event patient receive androgen deprivation therapy prostate cancer bone metastasis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Zoledronic acid decrease risk skeletal related event men prostate cancer metastatic bone disease progression primary hormonal therapy . This study design evaluate whether early treatment zoledronic acid decrease risk skeletal related event . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study follow open-label study . Patients stratify accord ECOG performance status ( 0-1 v 2 ) , prior skeletal-related event ( vs yes ) , serum alkaline phosphatase ( &lt; upper limit normal [ ULN ] v ≥ ULN ) . The primary objective study determine whether treatment zoledronic acid time initiation androgen deprivation therapy metastatic prostate cancer delay time first skeletal related event . The secondary objective study compare effect treatment zoledronic acid placebo overall survival ( OS ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) toxicity men receive androgen deprivation therapy metastatic prostate cancer . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Treatment continue absence disease progression skeletal-related event . All patient receive concurrent androgen deprivation therapy GnRH agonist . Patients also receive oral calcium ( vitamin D ) supplement daily . Patients progress androgen-independent prostate cancer proceed open-label therapy zoledronic acid IV . Treatment continue 3 week absence disease progression first skeletal-related event . Patients follow periodically approximately 10 year entry study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologic Documentation : Histologic documentation prostate adenocarcinoma . Patients small cell , neuroendocrine , transitional cell carcinoma eligible . 2 . Staging : At least one bone metastasis radiographic imaging ( bone scan , magnetic resonance imaging , compute tomography , plain radiograph ) . Indeterminate lesion confirm second imaging method . Imaging document bone metastases complete either within 12 week registration within 12 week initiate androgen deprivation therapy bone metastasis . 3 . Hormone Therapy While study , patient must receive androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) treatment prostate cancer . Androgen deprivation therapy may begin prior enrollment study ; however patient must initiate ADT ≤ 6 month prior enrollment . Androgen deprivation therapy define bilateral orchiectomy gonadotropin release hormone ( GnRH ) agonist without antiandrogen . Patients treat intermittent androgen deprivation therapy eligible except patient concurrently enrol SWOG9346/INT0162/CALGB 9594 , Phase III Study Intermittent Androgen Deprivation Patients Stage D2 Prostate Cancer . 4 . Prior Treatment : Hormone therapy point prior 6 month enrollment prohibit . This include follow treatment : orchiectomy , GnRH agonist ( e. g. , leuprolide , goserelin , triptorelin ) , estrogen therapy , antiandrogen ( e. g. , bicalutamide , flutamide , nilutamide ) , therapy know low testosterone level inhibit testosterone effect . Prior neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant hormone therapy allow provided duration hormone therapy six month le hormone therapy discontinue 6 month prior study entry . No prior treatment bisphosphonate No prior treatment denosumab No prior treatment radiopharmaceutical ≥ 4 week since completion prior radiation therapy least one bone metastasis present NOT radiate . 5 . ECOG ( CTC ) performance status 02 6 . Age : ≥ 18 year 7 . Required Initial Laboratory Data : Calculated Creatinine Clearance ≥ 30 mL/min Corrected serum calcium ≥ 8.0 mg/dL ( 2.00 mmol/L ) &lt; 11.6 mg/dL ( 2.90 mmol/L )</criteria>
