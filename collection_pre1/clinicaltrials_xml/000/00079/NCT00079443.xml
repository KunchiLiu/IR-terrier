	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study best dose FR901228 give together rituximab fludarabine see well FR901228 work alone treating patient relapse refractory low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Drugs use chemotherapy , FR901228 fludarabine , work different way stop cancer cell divide stop grow die . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , locate cancer cell either kill deliver cancer-killing substance without harm normal cell . Rituximab may increase effectiveness chemotherapy drug make cancer cell sensitive drug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FR901228 Alone Combined With Rituximab Fludarabine Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Low-Grade B-Cell Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . For phase 2 : assess clinical efficacy ( complete partial response rate ) single agent depsipeptide . II . For phase 1 : ass feasibility add Depsipeptide regimen Rituximab Fludarabine establish MTD Depsipeptide combination . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To correlate disease response ( clinical outcome ) change histone acetylation assay . II . Study expression death receptor DR4 DR5 treatment depsipeptide . III . Assessment minimal residual disease immune histochemistry . OUTLINE : This multicenter , phase II study single-agent FR901228 follow phase I , dose-escalation study FR901228 . PHASE II : Patients receive FR901228 IV 4 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete partial remission receive 2 additional course ( total 6 course ) . Patients stable disease 4 course progressive disease time 2 course proceed phase I portion study . PHASE I : Patients receive rituximab IV approximately 4-8 hour day 1 ; fludarabine IV 10-30 minute day 2-4 ; FR901228 IV 4 hour day 2 , 9 , 16 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos FR901228 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Patients follow 3 year study entry .</detailed_description>
