	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well CCI-779 work treat patient stage IIIB non small cell lung cancer ( pleural effusion ) stage IV non-small cell lung cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , CCI-779 , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . CCI-779 may also stop growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary growth .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CCI-779 Treating Patients With Stage IIIB ( With Pleural Effusion ) Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary I . Determine response rate patient stage IIIB ( pleural effusion ) IV non-small cell lung cancer treat CCI-779 . II . Determine clinical toxic effect drug patient . Secondary I . Determine 24-week progression-free survival rate patient treat drug . II . Determine time progression overall survival patient treated drug . III . Evaluate predictive marker activity ( e.g. , PTEN mutation phosphoAkt expression ) drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive CCI-779 IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 6 month 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 25-55 patient accrue study within 12 month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) Stage IIIB ( pleural effusion ) IV disease Measurable disease At least 1 lesion ≥ 2.0 cm conventional technique OR ≥ 1.0 cm spiral CT scan The following consider measurable disease : Bone lesion Leptomeningeal disease Ascites Pleural/pericardial effusion Inflammatory breast disease Lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis Cystic lesion Abdominal mass confirm followed imaging technique Blood tissue block available Must accessible tumor ( i.e. , superficial lesion lymph node , subcutaneous nodule ) provide core needle biopsy tissue study treatment No known brain metastasis Performance status ECOG 02 At least 12 week Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm^3 Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm^3 Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL Bilirubin ≤ 2 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST ≤ 3 time ULN ( 5 time ULN hepatic metastasis present ) Creatinine ≤ 1.5 time ULN Serum fast cholesterol ≤ 350 mg/dL Serum fast triglyceride ≤ 400 mg/dL HIV negative No uncontrolled infection No malignancy within past 5 year except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer noninvasive carcinoma No concurrent severe underlying disease would preclude study participation Not pregnant nursing Negative pregnancy test Fertile patient must use effective contraception 3 month study treatment No prior biologic therapy No prior gene therapy No prior immunotherapy No concurrent immunotherapy No concurrent prophylactic growth factor support neutrophil count No prior chemotherapy NSCLC except lowdose cisplatin radiosensitizer No concurrent chemotherapy No concurrent dexamethasone ( 10 mg IV ) No prior radiotherapy 30 % bone marrow Concurrent radiotherapy underlie malignancy nontarget site ( e.g. , painful preexist bony metastasis ) allow No concurrent investigational therapy No concurrent immunosuppressive therapy</criteria>
