	<brief_summary>This study examine safety effectiveness alemtuzumab ( CampathÂ® ( Registered Trademark ) ) improve muscle strength patient sporadic inclusion body myositis ( s-IBM ) . The common inflammatory muscle disease people age 50 , s-IBM progress steadily , lead severe weakness waste muscle arm leg . The cause s-IBM know , may autoimmune disease , body 's immune cell ( white blood cell ) attack destroy part muscle . Alemtuzumab laboratory-made antibody currently approve treat certain leukemia . It also use treat patient autoimmune condition rheumatoid arthritis , vasculitis , multiple sclerosis , tissue rejection associate transplantation . Alemtuzumab destroy white blood cell protein call CD52 surface might among cell attack muscle . Patients s-IBM eligible study . Candidates screen physical neurological examination , blood test , electrocardiogram . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Campath administration : Patients admit NIH Clinical Center 1 1-1/2 week intravenous infusion Campath , give every day total 4 infusion . - Follow-up visit infusion : Patients monitor 1 year periodic blood test , physical neurological examination , medical history , muscle strength measurement , review symptom , include ability perform daily live activity . - Lymphapheresis : Patients undergo procedure collect large number white blood cell twice - begin study 6 month . Blood remove needle arm vein flow machine separate component centrifugation ( spin ) . The white cell plasma remove red cell platelet return patient needle another needle arm . - Muscle biopsy : Muscle biopsy do operate room local anesthetic . A small incision make thigh upper arm small piece muscle remove . Biopsies do begin study 6 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alemtuzumab Treat Sporadic Inclusion Body Myositis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sporadic Inclusion-Body Myositis ( s-IBM ) common muscle disease patient age 50 year . It inflammatory myopathy mediate sensitized , cytotoxic CD8+ T cell clonally expand situ invade MHC-I-expressing muscle fiber . The antigen recognize T cell unknown . The disease progressive , resist currently available immunotherapy lead wheelchair confinement . Applying therapeutic strategy agent deplete T cell clone investigate antigenic specificity endomysial T cell expect enhance understanding cause s-IBM lead clinical improvement . The present study design : ) test pilot study safety , T cell depletion endomysial T cell clinical efficacy monoclonal antibody Alemtuzumab 20 patient s-IBM follow 12 month serial quantitative assessment muscle strength ; b ) explore spectrum antigens recognize T cell extract muscle biopsy specimens search immune dominant peptide use positional scanning synthetic combinational peptide library , therapy ; c ) determine reciprocal relationship clinical response endomysial inflammatory mediator treatment . It anticipate study may lead identification putative antigen trigger disease , clarify significance inflammation amyloid deposit muscle fiber injury provide novel therapy s-IBM patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Only patient currently enrol protocol 02N0121 Study Immune Dysregulation Patients Sporadic Inclusion Body Myositis ( sIBM ) consider enrollment protocol 04N0133 . INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients confirm diagnosis sIBM willing undergo therapy Alemtuzumab . Willingness legal ability give sign inform study consent . Willingness travel Clinical Center plan study treatment require protocol . Men woman reproductive potential must agree use acceptable method birth control six month completion treatment . Availability tissue test . This include muscle peripheral blood lymphocyte isolate routine lymphocytapheresis phlebotomy . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Immunosuppressive drug therapy time 6 month prior enrollment . Specifically , candidate may take Prednisone , cyclosporine , tacrolimus , azathioprine , mycophenolate mofetil , antilymphocyte agent , cyclophosphamide methotrexate , agent whose concomitant use may enhance toxicity Alemtuzumab . Any medical personal difficulty preclude serial followup visit . Any active malignancy . Significant coagulopathy requirement anticoagulation therapy would contraindicate protocol . Platelet count le 100,000/mm ( 3 ) . Hemoglobin le 9.0 mg/dl . Any known immunodeficiency syndrome include HIV infection . Any history cardiac insufficiency , major vascular disease , unstable coronary artery disease . Any history systemic pulmonary edema . Any history previous treatment monoclonal antibody sensitivity study drug ( Alemtuzumab ) , premedication regimen , prophylactic agent . History chronic hypotension ( SBP le 100 mmHg ) .
