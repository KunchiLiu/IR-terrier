	<brief_summary>This study compare change atherosclerotic plaque coronary artery ( vessel surface heart supply blood heart ) change carotid artery ( vessel neck supply blood brain ) patient enrol Pfizer-sponsored treatment trial coronary artery disease . Atherosclerosis buildup fatty deposit ( plaque ) arteries lead blockage vessel , possibly result heart attack stroke . A major question cardiovascular disease closely atherosclerotic change coronary artery correlate change carotid artery occur treatment . substudy Pfizer . Patients enrol Pfizer trial compare effectiveness drug atorvastatin combination atorvastatin CETP inhibitor ( drug increase HDL cholesterol level ) may eligible substudy . Participants undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ultrasound carotid artery measure thickness vessel . The result compare coronary artery image obtain part patient 's evaluation Pfizer trial . MRI MRI scan use powerful magnet advance computer system radio wave produce accurate , detailed picture organ tissue . During scan patient lie table narrow cylinder contain magnetic field , wear earplug muffle loud noise occur electrical switch magnetic field . A medicine call gadolinium contrast may inject vein part scan brighten image . The scan take 30 90 minute . An electrocardiogram ( ECG ) do scan monitor heart 's electrical activity . Patients agree undergo another MRI test also image scanner us strong ( 3 Tesla ) magnet . Ultrasound An echocardiogram ( ultrasound heart ) use sound wave image carotid artery . A gel apply area neck image small handheld ultrasound probe hold neck take picture . Participants return 2 year second set test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Under general hypothesis atherosclerosis systemic disease ; purpose protocol compare coronary artery atherosclerotic abnormality carotid artery abnormality . This NHLBI sponsor sub study Pfizer sponsor trial compare atorvastatin combination atorvastatin/CETP inhibitor treatment patient coronary heart disease . The primary study multicenter , randomize , double blind , active-controlled study use intracoronary ultrasound measure coronary plaque volume course treatment . The scientific value NHLBI sub study comparison atherosclerotic abnormality two different vascular bed , coronary artery carotid artery . This study examine correlation invasive coronary measurement intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) , 2-dimensional measurement wall thickness carotid intimal medial wall thickness ( IMT ) , 3-dimensional measurement carotid wall volume MRI 3D ultrasound . Secondary analysis probe whether carotid plaque characteristic predict atheroma regression . Secondary analysis also assess ability noninvasive carotid measure predict degree coronary regression determine coronary artery IVUS . It important note NHLBI study design remain blinded treatment group subject enrol since sample size single center study small detect conservatively estimate additional benefit combination atorvastatin/CETP inhibitor treatment already effective atorvastatin alone . Thus , NHLBI sub study primarily pathophysiological study correlate carotid coronary atherosclerotic change well technological comparison IVU , carotid IMT , carotid vessel wall volume MRI . If successful , study could provide framework follow treatment trial nature noninvasive tool , either ultrasound MRI , place accurate invasive IVUS .</detailed_description>
