	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Docetaxel Treating Women With Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Correlate baseline change apoptosis proliferation clinical pathological response neoadjuvant docetaxel follow surgery woman newly diagnose breast cancer . Secondary - Correlate baseline change fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography uptake clinical pathological response patient treat regimen . - Correlate baseline change gene expression profile clinical pathological response patient treat regimen . - Correlate baseline change tumor serum proteomic pattern clinical pathological response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This pilot study . - Neoadjuvant chemotherapy : Patients receive docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 pegfilgrastim subcutaneously ( SC ) day 2 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Surgery : Within 2-4 week completion 4 course docetaxel , patient undergo breast-conserving surgery mastectomy discretion treat surgeon . Patients may receive additional chemotherapy prior surgery discretion treat physician . - Adjuvant chemotherapy : Patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy discretion treat physician . - Radiotherapy : Patients undergo radiotherapy completion chemotherapy discretion treat physician . - Hormonal therapy : Patients estrogen- and/or progesterone-positive tumor receive hormonal therapy completion chemotherapy local therapy discretion treat physician . Patients follow every 6 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
