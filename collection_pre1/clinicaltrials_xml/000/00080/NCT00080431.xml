	<brief_summary>This study examine safety effectiveness daclizumab ( also call Zenapax anti-CD25 ) reduce viral replication patient HIV infection . Although HAART , intensive anti-HIV treatment regimen , suppress HIV blood limit detection , completely eradicate virus . This study focus effectiveness daclizumab reduce viral replication patient low viral count . The Food Drug Administration approve daclizumab 1997 prevent kidney transplant rejection , also study people eye infection call uveitis . The drug work bind protein T cell ( white blood cell immune system ) call CD25 . This prevent another protein , call interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) , bind site , thus prevent series event normally result inflammation . Patients 18 65 year age HIV infection stable HIV level less 30,000 copies/mL blood CD4 T cell count high 400 cells/cmm may eligible study . Patients take drug affect immune system , IL-2 interferon , past 5 year may participate . Candidates screen comprehensive medical examination , include physical examination laboratory study . X-rays , consultation , biopsy do medically indicate . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Daclizumab therapy : Patients receive daclizumab 25-minute infusion intravenous catheter ( plastic tube place vein ) NIH Clinical Center outpatient clinic . A total three dos drug give . The first dose give study day 1 , second dose give 2 week later , third dose give 4 week later . Patients observe least 1 hour infusion discharge clinic . - Follow-up visit : Patients return outpatient clinic every 2 week medication every month 3 month final dose evaluate infection status , response therapy , medication side effect . The visit include physical examination , blood draw , possibly x-ray , medically indicate . - Apheresis : Patients undergo apheresis , procedure collect large amount white blood cell , three time study - start daclizumab therapy , 4 week begin therapy , 12 week begin therapy . For apheresis , blood remove needle vein one arm spun machine separate component . The white blood cell plasma remove , red cell platelets re-infused either needle needle vein arm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol evaluate safety tolerability immunosuppressive agent , daclizumab , HIV-infected adult . HIV-infected individual level plasma viremia 30,000 copies/mL receive daclizumab one month . Various immunologic virologic laboratory study address state cellular activation toxicity data collect post-enrollment . The primary study risk include factor associated immunosuppression fluctuation HIV viral level . Subjects compensate participation study . Total enrollment study maximum 10 subject .</detailed_description>
