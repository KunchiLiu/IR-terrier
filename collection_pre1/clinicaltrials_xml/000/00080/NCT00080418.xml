	<brief_title>Liposome Entrapped Paclitaxel Easy Use ( LEP-ETU ) Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>LEP-ETU new formulation anti-cancer agent paclitaxel injection Taxol ( paclitaxel Cremophor EL ) . Paclitaxel drug currently use treat broad range cancer . Paclitaxel think prevent cell divide grow , result cell death . This new formulation consist paclitaxel associate liposome , microscopic membrane-like structure create lipid ( fat ) . It believe LEP-ETU maintain enhance anti-tumor property paclitaxel , offer advantage patient short infusion time , routine premedication require , few side effect similar dos , possibly great effectiveness , especially high dos deliver without increase side effect . This study design determine follow : - The high dose LEP-ETU give safely patient . - The pharmacokinetics paclitaxel follow intravenous infusion LEP-ETU . - Any anti-tumor effect LEP-ETU . Up 8 dose level study . LEP-ETU give patient intravenous infusion 90 minute , every 21 day , disease progress side effect occur require treatment end . Patients evaluate safety well tolerate treatment .</detailed_description>
