	<brief_summary>This study examine compare brain control time movement healthy volunteer people schizophrenia . Previous experiment show people ask look clock report time first decide make movement , report time later first brain wave associate movement appear . When ask report time first initiate movement , report time muscle actually begin move . The study may help determine sense willing initiate action alter schizophrenic patient , people may feel less `` control '' movement . Normal volunteer patient schizophrenia 18 65 year age may eligible study . Control subject must neurological psychological disorder , schizophrenia patient must neurological disorder . All participant medical history , physical examination , test determine level attention . Schizophrenia patient interview symptom complete psychiatric rating scale . In addition , participant undergo follow procedure : Electric shock Participants look clock computer screen whose hand revolve around clock fast . While look clock , give small , non-painful electric shock ask say receive shock , accord clock . The shock repeat 40 time . Arm movement Participants ask lift arm table repeatedly , random time , look computer clock . This exercise repeat total 80 time . Of 80 time , participant ask 10 time row say time first desire move arm , 10 time row time first felt move arm . Electroencephalography ( EEG ) Electromyography ( EMG ) Participants undergo EEG EMG electric shock arm movement experiment measure electrical activity brain ( EEG ) muscle ( EMG ) . For EEG , electrode ( small metal disc ) place scalp cap , paste , glue-like substance brain wave record . For EMG , electrodes taped skin muscle .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives The purpose study determine subjective sense willing initiate action alter schizophrenic patient . One propose explanation characteristic symptom schizophrenia ( `` passivity phenomenon '' ) defect forward model movement brain receives motor signal generate . We propose examine forward model use Libet 's paradigm , normal subject give evidence forward model anticipatory report initiation movement . We intend determine time associate willing ( W ) , initiate ( M ) , electroencephalographic/electromyographic ( EEG/EMG ) measure movement . Study Population We intend study adult patient Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders diagnosis schizophrenia . These patient provide unique population study often sense direct movement author thought ( passivity phenomenon ) . Studies show schizophrenic movement-related cortical potential EEG , know subjective sense initiate movement occur patient . As order mental event time show contribute sense agency , important know time voluntary movement alter schizophrenia . Design We ask patient look fast-rotating clock computer screen note movement will , instigate external agent delusion , initiate . Patients also report time somatosensory stimulus . Surface EMG determine time actual movement , EEG record brain potential associate movement . Eligible patient schizophrenia passivity phenomenon recruit Clinical Brain Disorders Branch , NIMH . Outcome Measures The primary outcome measure study absence time W schizophrenic , latency W schizophrenic compare normal subject , latency M schizophrenic compare normal . Any effect medication status symptom performance study consider exploratory data .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENTS : Experimental subject patient DSMIV diagnosis schizophrenia volunteer participate clinical research unit Clinical Brain Disorders Branch , NIMH . In addition , outpatient DSMIV diagnosis schizophrenia participate outpatient research CBDB include . All patient receive diagnosis schizophrenia mean Structured Clinical Interview DSMIV ( SCID ) three psychiatrist reach consensus diagnosis . Patients clinical research unit must meet rigorous criterion order participate research . Exclusionary criterion include history traumatic brain injury , know comorbid neurological disorder , include epilepsy , history drug alcohol abuse , etc . All patient undergone comprehensive battery neuropsychological test , include Wide Range Achievement Test Reading ( often good indicator premorbid intelligence ) , short version Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale ( WAISR ) , Wechsler Memory Scales ( WMSR ) , Trails A B , test attention executive function , include continuous performance test ( CPT ) , Wisconsin Card Sort ( WISC ) , NBack test work memory . Patients psychiatric disease schizophrenia currently active symptomatic include . All patient study schizophrenia . However , time testing , patient administer clinical rating scale ( i.e. , Brief Psychotic Rating Scale ( BPRS ) , appropriate section SCID Yale Hallucination Phenomenology Assessment ( YHPA ) ) determine presence passivity phenomenon . NORMAL VOLUNTEERS : Twentysix normal control include ; control screen NINDS Movement Disorders Outpatient Clinic , neurological physical examination . They ask abstain alcohol 24 hour study . All subject participate study valid Clinical Center Medical Record Number . ALL SUBJECTS : All subject age 18 65 . Subjects may male female . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients young 18 year old old 65 year old exclude study . A . Patients neurological disorder exclude . Patients psychiatric disorder schizophrenia experience active phase disorder exclude . B . Patients history significant medical disorder require chronic treatment drug , affect central nervous system stop exclude . C. Patients capable give informed consent exclude .</criteria>
