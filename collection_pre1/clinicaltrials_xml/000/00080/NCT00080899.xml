	<brief_title>Fenretinide Treating Patients With Biochemically Recurrent Hormone-Naïve Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess PSA response prostate cancer patient biochemical recurrence local curative therapy treat fenretinide ( 4-HPR ) . II . To assess PSA double time measure disease activity , time PSA progression prostate cancer patient receive fenretinide . III . To evaluate qualitative quantitative toxicity agent patient population . IV . To evaluate pharmacokinetic study bioavailability 4-HPR patient population . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior therapy ( surgery v radiotherapy and/or brachytherapy v ) , stage diagnosis ( organ confine vs extra-capsular extension v lymph node positive ) , Gleason score diagnosis ( 2-4 v 5-6 vs 7-10 ) , prostate-specific antigen level diagnosis ( 0-4 ng/mL v 4.1-10 ng/mL v &gt; 10 ng/mL ) . Patients receive oral fenretinide twice daily day 1-7 . Courses repeat every 21 day 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
