	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effectiveness experimental drug call LMB-2 treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma patient protein call cluster differentiation 25 ( CD25 ) cancer cell . LMB-2 recombinant immunotoxin . It make two part : genetically engineer monoclonal antibody bind CD25 , toxin produce bacteria kill cancer cell bind . LMB-2 kill CD25-containing cell laboratory experiment cause tumor mice shrink . Preliminary study human show effectiveness shrink tumor patient various type lymph blood cancer . Patients 18 year age old stage 1b IV cutaneous T-cell lymphoma progress within 2 year systemic topical therapy CD25 receptor proteins cancer cell may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood urine test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , echocardiogram , chest x-ray , compute tomography ( CT ) scan chest , abdomen pelvis , skin punch biopsy evaluate tumor infiltration skin , bone marrow biopsy patient stage IIa disease high . In addition , patient 's blood , bone marrow , tumor , tissue test determine presence CD25 cancer cell . Participants receive nine cycle LMB-2 therapy long cancer worsen develop serious side effect . Each 28-day cycle consist 30-minute infusion LMB-2 cycle day 1 , 3 , 5 . The drug infuse intravenous ( IV ) catheter ( plastic tube place vein ) central venous line - IV tube place large vein neck chest lead heart . In addition drug therapy , patient undergo follow procedure : Blood draw : Blood drawn , , LMB-2 infusion measure blood level drug , evaluate effect cancer cell , monitor side effect . Blood test also do cycle determine immune system interact drug . Disease evaluation : Patients undergo careful skin examination , blood test , chest x-ray , EKG treatment cycle follow-up visit . A CT scan echocardiogram ( heart ultrasound ) do first cycle . Before first second cycle , patient biopsy lymphoma skin . If biopsy helpful evaluate disease response LMB-2 , additional biopsy may request prior cycle well . A nuclear medicine scan may do , bone marrow biopsy may do patient stage II IV disease . If test helpful understanding response lymphoma treatment , may also repeat prior cycle , patient 's permission . Patients admit National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Clinical Center first treatment cycle . Subsequent cycle give outpatient . If infusion well tolerate , patient may return home one week ( possibly longer complication occur ) . After return home , patient blood test do weekly local physician .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : It estimate 40-50 % patient cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) tumor express cluster differentiation 25 ( CD25 ) ( Tac IL2Ra ) . Normal rest T-cells express CD25 . LMB-2 anti-CD25 recombinant immunotoxin contain variable domain MAb anti-Tac truncate Pseudomonas exotoxin . A phase I trial National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) find maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) LMB-2 40 microg/Kg intravenous ( IV ) give every day 3 dos ( QOD times 3 ) prophylactic IV fluid . The common adverse event transient fever , hypoalbuminemia transaminase elevation . In trial , two two patient cutaneous T-cell lymphoma clinical benefit ( 1 partial response ( PR ) , 1 stable disease ( SD ) ) . In 1999 another recombinant fusion protein , denileukin diftitox , approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment patient advance recurrent CTCL express high affinity interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) receptor . This receptor compose three subunit : CD25 , CD122 CD132 . Because LMB-2 cytotoxic cell express CD25 without IL-2 receptor subunit need form high affinity receptor , CD25+ CTCL patient good candidate test LMB-2 . Objectives : The purpose study determine activity anti-Tac ( Fv ) -PE38 ( LMB-2 ) patient Tac-expressing Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma ( CTCL ) . The primary endpoint trial response rate response duration . We also evaluate LMB-2 immunogenicity , pharmacokinetics , toxicity , monitor soluble Tac level serum . These evaluate use routine hematologic clinical evaluation , appropriate , monitor phenotype circulate T-cells biopsied tissue use antibody CD25 . Eligibility : CD25+ CTCL base immunohistochemistry flow cytometry blood . Patients must measurable stage 1b-IV disease progress great equal 2 prior systemic topical therapy . Labs require : alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) less equal 2.5-time upper limit , albumin great equal 3 , bilirubin le equal 2.2 , creatinine le equal 2.0 ( unless creatinine clearance great equal 50 ml/min ) , absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great equal 1000/ul , platelet great equal 50,000/ul ( ANC platelets great equal 500 10,000 blood/marrow involvement ) . Design : Patients receive LMB-2 30 ug/Kg QOD time 3 every 4 week absence neutralize antibody progressive disease . Dose escalation 40 ug/Kg QOD time 3 less 2/6 dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) 30 ug/Kg time 3 . 1st stage 16 patient , expand 25 great 1 16 patient respond .</detailed_description>

Measurable stage IbIV disease progress least 2 prior systemic topical therapy . Patients must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 2 least 18 year old . Patients must able understand give informed consent . Patients must 4 week monoclonal antibody . Patients must great equal 3 week CTCLspecific therapy evidence progressive disease . Patients chronic steroid must stable dose Prednisone less equal 20 mg/day ( equivalent dose another steroid ) least 3 week evidence progressive disease . Female patient childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test must use effective contraception ( barrier form contraception ) . The transaminase alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) must less equal 2.5times upper limit normal . Albumin must great equal 3.0 gm/dL . Total bilirubin must less equal 2.2 mg/dL . The creatinine must less equal 2.0 mg/dL creatinine clearance must great equal 50 ml/min . The absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) must great equal 1000/mm^3 unsupported platelet count must great equal 50,000/mm^3 patient without blood bone marrow involvement .
