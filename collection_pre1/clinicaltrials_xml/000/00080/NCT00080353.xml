	<brief_summary>This study examine effectiveness treat advanced melanoma special tumor-fighting cell take patient 's blood tumor grown laboratory . The cell give along infusion growth factor-like substance call interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) experimental vaccine call fowlpox gp100 . This vaccine consist peptide ( part protein ) call gp100 often find melanoma tumor chicken virus ( fowlpox ) alter produce illness human . Patients 16 year age old melanoma spread beyond original site respond standard treatment may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , chest x-ray , electrocardiogram , blood urine test , x-rays scan evaluate extent size tumor . Because experimental preparation base tissue type , patient tissue type HLA-A*0201 may participate . Tissue type determine blood test . Participants undergo follow procedure : - Leukapheresis , procedure collect lymphocyte ( white blood cell ) : Using procedure , special cell good tumor-fighting ability select remove later re-infusion patient . To collect cell , blood withdrawn needle arm vein direct catheter cell-separating machine . The lymphocyte remove rest blood return body needle . Alternatively , lymphocyte may also collect biopsied tumor tissue , obtain either needle small cut tumor . - G-CSF injection : This growth factor inject skin every day 5 day stimulate white blood cell production . - Catheter placement : Upon admission Clinical Center treatment , patient catheter ( plastic tube ) place vein neck arm give chemotherapy medicine , infuse lymphocyte , collect blood sample . - Leukapheresis : Repeated hospital collect store blood may need rare event patient 's blood component recover chemotherapy . - Chemotherapy : A week lymphocyte infusion , patient receive 1-hour infusion cyclophosphamide 2 day 15- 30-minute infusion fludarabine 5 day suppress immune system thereby prevent rejection infuse lymphocyte . - Vaccine lymphocyte delivery : The vaccine inject catheter , follow 30-minute infusion lymphocyte . - IL-2 G-CSF : Patients receive IL-2 infusion every 8 hour 5 day cell infusion help keep cell alive , G-CSF injection skin every day cell infusion white cell increase sufficient number . The entire hospital stay usually 12 16 day . About 4 week lymphocyte infusion , patient re-admitted hospital 10 day second vaccine injection course IL-2 infusion . Between 2 4 week complete full treatment regimen , patient return NIH evaluation . Those whose tumor shrink remain stable may repeat entire treatment regimen two time . Those whose tumor continue grow may re-treated infusion lymphocytes artery instead vein tumor receive blood major artery . If feasible , try without success , patient take study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Recent clinical study Surgery Branch demonstrate clinical response patient undergo adoptive transfer autologous tumor reactive lymphocyte follow non-myeloablative immunosuppressive chemotherapy regimen . Additional study Surgery Branch use immunization recombinant fowlpox virus cell transfer immunosuppressed host provide strong evidence suggest adoptive transfer lymphocytes clinical protocol patient melanoma substantially improve simultaneous administration recombinant fowlpox virus . Objectives : The primary objective determine whether gp100 reactive lymphocyte infuse conjunction immunization rf-gp100P209 administration high dose low dose IL-2 may result complete clinical tumor regression patient metastatic melanoma receive nonmyeloablative lymphoid deplete preparative regimen . Secondary objective determine survival patient , infused cell follow regimen , determine safety regimen . Eligibility : Patients HLA-A201+ must great equal 16 year age measurable metastatic melanoma refractory standard therapy . Safety laboratory value must within defined parameter . More four week must elapse since prior systemic therapy . Patients must eligible receive IL-2 may cardiac , pulmonary major medical illness . Patients may allergic egg hypersensitivity agent use trial , must require concomitant therapy steroid . Design : Patients receive nonmyeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen consist cyclophosphamide fludarabine treat adoptive transfer lymphocytes reactive gp100:209-217 melanoma antigen , immunization intravenous fowlpox virus rF-gp100P209 , administration high dose low dose IL-2 . Approximately 28 day cell infusion , patient receive high dose IL-2 receive second intravenous fowlpox virus rf-gp100P209 follow administration high dose IL-2 . A complete evaluation evaluable lesion conduct 6-8 week cell infusion . Patients receive low dose IL-2 receive second intravenous fowlpox virus rf-gp100P209 6 week injection one week rest follow repeat administration six week cycle low dose IL-2 . A complete evaluation evaluable lesion conduct 3 week last dose low dose IL-2 . For two cohort , small optimal Phase II design use target 15 % ( p1=0.15 ) goal complete response oppose essentially zero probability normally associate patient relapse high dose IL-2 alone ( p0=0.02 use ) . Initially , 16 patient enrol evaluated cohort ; least 1 first 16 patient complete response , accrual 29 patient take place . It expect require 2-3 year accrue 58 patient study .</detailed_description>

Absolute neutrophil count great 1000/mm3 without support filgrastim . Platelet count great 100,000/mm3 . Hemoglobin great 8.0 g/dl ( correct transfusion ) . Serum ALT/AST less three time upper limit normal . Serum creatinine less equal 2.0 mg/dl . Total bilirubin less equal 2.0 mg/dl , except patient Gilbert 's Syndrome must total bilirubin less 3.0 mg/dl . Must willing sign durable power attorney . Patients must able understand sign Informed Consent document . Patients resect brain metastasis eligible . Patients receive high dose IL2 50 year old great must normal stress cardiac test ( stress thallium , stress MUGA , dobutamine echocardiogram , stress test ) LVEF great 45 percent . Patients receive high dose IL2 history EKG abnormality , symptom cardiac ischemia arrythmias must normal stress cardiac test ( stress thallium , stress MUGA , dobutamine echocardiogram , stress test ) LVEF great 45 percent . Patients receive high dose IL2 prolong history cigarette smoking symptom respiratory dysfunction must normal pulmonary function test evidence FEV ( 1 ) great 60 percent predict . CELL INFUSION EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Less four week elapse since prior systemic therapy time patient receives preparative regimen , less six week since prior nitrosurea therapy . All patient ' toxicity must recover grade 1 less specify eligibility criterion . Patients may undergo minor surgical procedure past 3 week , long toxicity recover grade 1 less specify eligibility criterion section 2.1.1 . Women childbearing potential pregnant breastfeed potentially dangerous effect preparative chemotherapy fetus infant . Life expectancy less three month . Systemic steroid therapy require . Any active systemic infection , coagulation disorder major medical illness cardiovascular , respiratory immune system , evidence positive stress thallium comparable test , myocardial infarction , cardiac arrhythmia , obstructive restrictive pulmonary disease . Any form primary secondary immunodeficiency . Must recover immune competence chemotherapy radiation therapy evidence normal lymphocyte count great 500 ( grade 3 toxicity ) , normal ANC great 1000/mm3 absence opportunistic infection . ( The experimental treatment evaluate protocol depends intact immune system . Patients decrease immune competence may less responsive experimental treatment susceptible toxicity . ) Seropositive HIV antibody . ( The experimental treatment evaluate protocol depends intact immune system . Patients HIV seropositive decrease immune competence thus less responsive experimental treatment susceptible toxicity . ) Patients hepatitis B hepatitis C exclude .
