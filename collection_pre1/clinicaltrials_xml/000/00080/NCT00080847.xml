	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study rituximab combination chemotherapy see well work compare oblimersen , rituximab , combination chemotherapy treat patient advanced diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , locate cancer cell either kill deliver cancer-killing substance without harm normal cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , prednisone , work different way stop cancer cell divide stop grow die . Oblimersen may increase effectiveness anticancer drug make cancer cell sensitive drug . Combining rituximab combination chemotherapy oblimersen may kill cancer cell</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate 1-year progression-free survival probability rate young patient low low-intermediate IPI risk advance stage diffuse large B-cell NHL treat 8-cycles CHOP-rituximab . ( The CHOP-rituximab arm study permanently close , effective 10/15/04 . ) II . To estimate 1-year progression-free survival probability rate young patient low low-intermediate IPI risk advance stage diffuse large B-cell NHL treat 8 cycle CHOP-rituximab-G3139 . III . To evaluate response ( complete , complete unconfirmed , partial ) toxicity regimens patient population . ( The CHOP-rituximab arm study permanently close , effective 10/15/04 . ) IV . To estimate 1-year progression-free survival response rate subset patient overexpressing bcl-2 protein . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord age-adjusted International Prognostic Index ( 0 vs 1 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ( Arm I close accrual 9/21/04 . ) ARM I ( close accrual 9/21/04 ) : Patients receive rituximab IV 6 hour , cyclophosphamide IV 15-45 minute , doxorubicin IV 5-20 minute , vincristine IV 5-15 minute day 1 oral prednisone day 1-5 . ARM II : Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously day 1-7 ; rituximab IV 6 hour , cyclophosphamide IV 15-45 minute , doxorubicin IV 5-20 minute , vincristine IV 5-15 minute day 5 ; oral prednisone day 5-10 . In arm , treatment repeat every 21 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year , annually 5 year .</detailed_description>
