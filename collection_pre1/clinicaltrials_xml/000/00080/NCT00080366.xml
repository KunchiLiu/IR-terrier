	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effectiveness 1-octanol , substance similar alcohol less intoxicating , treat essential tremor . Essential tremor involuntary shaking , usually hand , satisfactory treatment . It affect 1.4 percent general U.S. population , figure climb nearly 4 percent among people 40 . Results two previous NIH study show 1-octanol promise potential new treatment . This study test effectiveness 1-octanol essential tremor dos low give previously . Patients 21 year old old essential tremor may eligible study . Participants admit NIH Clinical Center two treatment period 1 week , 1-week break home treatment . Before begin treatment , participant undergo medical history , physical examination , blood urine test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) . In addition , tremor measure use accelerometry , procedure small device , mount piece cardboard , tap patient 's hand 30 minute . Patients randomly assign one two group . One group take 2 4 capsule 1-octanol 3 time day 1 week , follow 1-week `` washout '' period ( treatment ) , 2 4 capsule placebo 3 time day 1 week . Following dosage schedule , second group take placebo first week , follow washout period 1-octanol treatment . Blood pressure pulse measure 15 , 30 , 60 minute first dose day 3 time day day hospitalization , EKG blood draw do every day hospitalization , blood drawn 1 week end study . Patients evaluate tremor daily accord tremor scale also rat accord alcohol intoxication scale .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Essential tremor common movement disorder affect approximately 1.4 % population . Response medication beta blocker mysoline may partial accompanied intolerable side effect . Roughly 80 % patient significant tremor reduction ? ethanol although daily use treatment potentially serious social legal consequence . The lead hypothesis pathophysiology essential tremor unmask spontaneous oscillation neuron inferior olive . Both ethanol 1-octanol show reduce spontaneous oscillation animal model essential tremor ; however , 1-octanol dose much low intoxicate dose suggesting may useful treatment essential tremor . Two pilot study 1-octanol patient essential tremor suggest efficacious safe . Objectives : The aim present study assess efficacy 1-octanol essential tremor double-blinded , placebo-controlled study . Study population : Patients alcohol-responsive essential tremor . Design : Double-blind , placebo-controlled two-period cross-over design . Outcome parameter : Primary outcome parameter tremor assess accelerometry , secondary outcome measure spiral drawing , subjective clinical scoring . Estimate outcome : 1-octanol dose 32mg/kg three time day significantly improve tremor patient alcohol-responsive essential tremor . Anticipated risks benefit : Besides unusual taste , anticipated risk associate 1-octanol ingestion . Patients may experience improvement tremor . Potential meaning field : Better treatment essential tremor .</detailed_description>
