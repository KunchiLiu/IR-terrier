	<brief_summary>This study test safety drug call EW-A-401 patient intermittent claudication - pain discomfort leg due blockage artery . The study also evaluate whether EW-A-401 improve blood flow leg . EW-A-401 contains genetic material ( DNA ) instruct body produce specific protein promote growth new blood vessel may , therefore , improve blood flow leg . Patients 21 year age old pain discomfort one leg due blockage artery groin may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test , eye examination , chest x-ray CT scan chest , treadmill test . Patients able exercise 12 minute treadmill may enroll study . Participants undergo follow procedure : - Muscle biopsy : On first day study , patient muscle biopsy . This procedure do local anesthesia mild sedation . A 1-inch incision cut skin calf muscle small amount muscle tissue remove examination pathologist . - Drug treatment test : About 10 13 day biopsy , patient admit NIH Clinical Center 3 5 day drug treatment test . They receive 10 injection either study drug ( EW-A-401 ) placebo ( inactive substance ) leg single session last 1 hour . In addition , blood urine test , complete questionnaire symptom , undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , test magnetic field radio wave produce detailed image body tissue organ . For procedure , patient lie table slide scanner ( large hollow tube ) image blood vessel legs . Patients wear headphone muffle loud knock thump sound occur scan process . - 30-day follow-up : Patients return Clinical Center three time 30 day follow hospital stay medical history , physical examination , blood urine test assess safety EW-A-401 . - Extended follow-up : Patients return Clinical Center 3 , 6 , 12 month hospitalization medical history physical examination , blood urine test , two treadmill test , questionnaire symptom , MRI study , include image blood flow measurement . Blood flow leg measure MRI use large blood pressure cuff inflate around legs scanning . The cuff inflate tightly 5 minute , dye inject arm vein brighten image . Additional picture take next 5 10 minute . At two follow-up visit , patient also eye examination , 3- 6-month visit repeat muscle biopsy calf . The study last 12 month . After 6 month , patient tell whether receive EW-A-401 placebo . Because EW-A-401 new , patient continue contact every year study complete .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EW-A-401 Treat Intermittent Claudication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lower limb intermittent claudication , muscular pain exercise relieve promptly rest , disable syndrome affect 10 million patient United States . Intermittent claudication cause peripheral artery atherosclerosis , disease cause heart attack . Peripheral artery atherosclerosis impairs blood flow skeletal muscle low limb . Growth factor , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF-A ) , show animal study improve blood flow lower limbs promote growth new blood vessel . This clinical study test safety feasibility gene transfer agent ( EW-A-401 ) intend improve blood flow skeletal muscle subject intermittent claudication . The investigational agent circle genetic material ( plasmid DNA ) instruct body produce genetically-engineered transcription factor , protein regulate expression gene . This specific transcription factor show animal study increase expression VEGF-A gene , promote growth new blood vessel . The study agent deliver injection leg muscle single session . This first human experience use transcription factor . This study randomize , double-blind , dose-escalation , placebo-controlled design . The primary outcome measure safety toxicity . In addition , collect exploratory effectiveness information include blood flow , walk capacity , quality life , inspection blood vessel sample leg muscle .</detailed_description>
