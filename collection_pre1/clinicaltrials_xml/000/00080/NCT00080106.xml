	<brief_summary>HIV vaccine may help immune system HIV infect patient well control virus . The goal study determine whether patient anti-HIV medication stop take medication receive HIV vaccine . While take anti-HIV medication , participant receive either HIV vaccine placebo . Participants stop take anti-HIV medication study compare viral load participant receive vaccine viral load participant receive placebo . Primary study hypothesis : 1 ) The Week 12 Week 16 post-ART interruption geometric mean HIV-1 RNA level low among participant receive MRK Ad5 vaccine prior ART interruption among participant receive placebo ; 2 ) time average area curve log10 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml versus day function 16 week post-ART interruption step lower among participant receive MRK Ad5 vaccine prior ART interruption among participant receive placebo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) significant impact HIV disease ; however , HIV cure current drug regimen . While majority patient initially benefit ART , drug regimen subsequently fail many patient due drug resistance , poor adherence , toxicity . If give HIV replication keep check ART , HIV vaccine may able generate effective long-term immune response capable control virus , even ART discontinue . The MRK Ad5 HIV-1 gag vaccine use replication-defective adenovirus vector find safe clinical trial HIV infect HIV uninfected adult . This study evaluate ability immunization MRK Ad5 HIV-1 gag vaccine control HIV replication individual undergo treatment interruption . The study enroll individual whose HIV replication successfully suppressed ART least 2 year . Participants study randomly assign receive either vaccine placebo . Both vaccine placebo inject upper arm muscle . Participants take antiretroviral medication first 3 month study . Injections give Day 1 , Week 4 , Week 26 . A study nurse call participant 1 2 day injection participant ask fill card reaction injection . About 3 month third injection , participant stop take antiretroviral medication 4 month . Participants study visit every 2 3 week medication . After 4 month , participant option restart antiretroviral medication continue without medication . Participants study visit every 2 month 8 month . Study visit include physical exam blood collection . All participant continue see primary care provider HIV treatment restart antiretroviral medication clinically indicate . Participants primary care provider contact phone update every 6 month additional 3.5 year .</detailed_description>
