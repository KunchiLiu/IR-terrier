	<detailed_description>The benefit antiretroviral therapy well establish limit wealthy nation . A predefined , simple sequence treatment regimen focus extend durability limit treatment option best potential implement resource poor country . South Africa 15 % world 's HIV/AIDS patient limit number physician treat ( l per 1,600 le 5 infectious disease specialist ) . HIV patient care primary care set must therefore delivered personnel doctor . Further , treatment strategy include entire household ensure maximum adherence minimize share drug .

The second part study determine community-based directly observe therapy ( DOT ) significantly superior continue clinic-based treatment support patient fail first-line therapy , measure cumulative virology failure rate . The project also evaluate cost economic impact predetermine schedule antiretroviral therapy ; treatment outcomes term morbidity , opportunistic endemic infection , mortality ; factor contribute treatment failure , include toxicity , resistance , compliance , treatment interruption . In Part 1 , household randomly assign receive first-line antiretroviral therapy monitoring care either HIV-trained medical doctor support adherence counselor HIV-trained primary health care sister ( nurse training diagnosis treatment prescription ) . Members household HIV infect receive stavudine , lamivudine , efavirenz ( nevirapine nelfinavir may use special population ) . Participants fail first-line antiretroviral therapy Part 1 study enter Part 2 study . Participants Part 2 receive zidovudine , didanosine , lopinavir/ritonavir . Participants randomly assign treatment monitor either clinic-based treatment support group community-based directly observe treatment ( DOT ) . For DOT arm , community member observe therapy least one dose day , five day week , home work participant . HIV infect child age 3 month 16 year live participate household also include study .
