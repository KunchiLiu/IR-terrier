	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVE : Many person survive poliomyelitis develop pain , weakness , fatigue many decade later . It known person develop syndrome others . One possibility polio cause subclinical damage motor cortex . Autopsies polio patient find damage brainstem motor cortex well spinal motor neuron . Alternatively , polio may spar motor cortex , cortex reorganize different way compensate loss spinal motor neuron . This study first assess integrity central motor pathway polio survivor without postpolio syndrome . The second goal investigate difference intracortical mechanism control muscle affect unaffected polio . STUDY POPULATION : 60 patient survive polio childhood . Only patient unequivocal history polio refer study . Half patient post-polio syndrome . 30 normal volunteer , age 21-75 . DESIGN : Patients screen collaborate institution , Uniformed Services University Health Sciences , also perform sensory evoke potential testing MRI . At NIH , motor evoke potential elicit four limb use transcranial magnetic stimulation assess central motor conduction time threshold . Intracortical facilitation use ass use paired-pulse magnetic stimulation . Two muscle test patient , one affect polio one unaffected polio . In affected muscle , intracortical facilitation assess exercise fatigue . OUTCOME PARAMETERS : Cortical threshold central motor conduction time four limb measure patient compare normal subject . The mean intracortical facilitation rest compare affect unaffected muscle polio patient without post-polio syndrome .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : POLIO PATIENTS : Complete screen evaluation . Meet clinical criterion diagnosis past polio ( see ) . Meet clinical criterion diagnosis PPS ( PPS group ) new muscle weakness . Age 21 old . CLINICAL CRITERIA FOR PAST POLIO ( CONFIRMED ) : Clinically compatible sign symptom paralytic poliomyelitis ( acute flaccid paralysis one limb ) . Decreased absent tendon reflex affect limb . No persistent sensory cognitive loss . No apparent cause ( include laboratory investigation rule cause similar syndrome ) . Neurological deficit present 60 day onset initial symptom . Associated isolation either vaccine wild poliovirus clinical specimen . CLINICAL CRITERIA FOR POSTPOLIO SYNDROME : History polio partial complete neurological functional recovery . Stable function great 15 year . New onset one following : fatigue , weakness , atrophy , muscle pain , functional loss . Exclusion explanation symptomatology . Neurological evaluation demonstrating : low motor neuron dysfunction ( confirm EMG , image study muscle biopsy ) , sensory loss . Must new onset muscle weakness one limb muscle , determine history clinical examination . NORMAL VOLUNTEERS : Healthy adult volunteer age 2180 willing participate . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Neurological disease condition , polio , judgment investigator may account symptom interfere experimental intervention . Implanted device , pump , pacemaker , metal fragment skull eye .</criteria>
