	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Estrogen progesterone stimulate growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use exemestane may fight breast cancer reduce production estrogen progesterone . Giving hormone therapy surgery may shrink tumor remove breast-conserving surgery . Giving hormone therapy surgery may kill remain tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness neoadjuvant adjuvant exemestane treat postmenopausal woman locally advancedestrogen and/or progesterone receptor-positive breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Adjuvant Exemestane Treating Postmenopausal Women With Locally Advanced Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine clinical response rate postmenopausal woman locally advance hormone receptor-positive breast cancer treat neoadjuvant adjuvant exemestane . Secondary - Determine response rate mammography , ultrasound , MRI , positron emission tomography scan patient treat drug . - Determine time progression patient treat drug . - Compare expression hormone receptor epidermal growth factor receptor ( include HER2/neu ) patient prior treatment drug correlate result clinical response rate . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral exemestane daily 16 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After 16 week , patient undergo surgery continue exemestane daily total 5 year ( include 16 week surgery ) . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year surgery every 6 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 16-46 patient accrue study within 2 year .</detailed_description>
