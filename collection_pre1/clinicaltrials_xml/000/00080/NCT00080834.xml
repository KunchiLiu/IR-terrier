	<brief_title>DJ-927 Second-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Progressive Locally Advanced Metastatic Colorectal Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine objective tumor response rate patient progressive locally advanced metastatic adenocarcinoma colon rectum treat DJ-927 second-line treatment . Secondary - Determine duration response patient treated drug . - Determine time tumor progression patient treat drug . - Determine median survival time patient treat drug . - Determine quantitative qualitative toxic effect drug patient . - Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior first-line treatment regimen ( irinotecan-containing v oxaliplatin-containing ) . Patients receive oral DJ-927* day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *Patients receive 1 2 select dos confirm previously establish maximum tolerate dose Patients follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 56-62 patient ( 28-31 per stratum ) accrue study within 12 month .</detailed_description>
