	<brief_summary>This study examine different brain area involve perception rhythmic pattern performance rhythmic movement . Patients certain type brain disease , Parkinson 's disease type stroke , may difficulty perform rhythmic movement , finger tap . Healthy , right-handed volunteer 21 65 year age may eligible study . Candidates visual , motor hearing problem exclude , musician pregnant woman . Participants come National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Clinical Center six session functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scanning . MRI use strong magnetic field radio wave obtain image body organ tissue . The scanner metal cylinder surround magnetic field . During MRI , subject lie still 20 minute time table cylinder wear earplugs muffle loud knocking noise occur electrical switch magnetic field . He communicate MRI staff microphone time procedure . For fMRI , image obtain subject performs task , hear sound move finger . The machine detects change brain movement involve perform task . The task explain , subject practice enter scanner .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective Rhythmic movement , finger tapping , relatively simple . However , many brain area include motor , somatosensory , premotor prefrontal cortex , supplementary motor area , basal ganglion , cerebellum , etc . report activated rhythmic movement . Patients lesion locate extrapyramidal cerebellar system , patient Parkinson 's disease , cerebellar ataxia stroke lesion system , difficulty perform rhythmic movement . Timing deficit basal ganglia cerebellar damage could also due abnormality interconnect cortical system commonly associate process . Few study examine involvement cerebral cortex time perception . The purpose study detect brain area associate three hypothesize process associate rhythm perception generation : ( 1 ) perception external rhythmic stimulation , ( 2 ) internal rhythm generation ( 3 ) execution rhythmic movement . To investigate whether process rhythm perception common across sensory modality , use auditory visual stimulation . Study population This research conduct use normal adult volunteer . Design Using functional magnetic resonance imaging , examine brain activity subject hear watch rhythmic stimulation press button rhythmically finger . A series experiment design demonstrate hypothesize three process separately . Outcome measure The brain activity correlate experimental condition behavioral data ( time error button press correspond rhythmic stimulation ) collect analyzed use statistical parametric mapping ( SPM ) . The finding expect obtain experiment contribute basic knowledge well understand pathophysiology disturbance perception generation rhythm patient neurological disorder , give theoretical background repetitive , rhythmically pattern movement train neurorehabilitation .</detailed_description>
