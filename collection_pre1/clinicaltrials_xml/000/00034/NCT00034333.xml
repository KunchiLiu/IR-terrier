	<brief_summary>MTC-DOX Doxorubicin DOX , chemotherapy drug , adsorb , make `` stick '' , magnetic bead ( MTCs ) . MTCs tiny , microscopic particle iron carbon . When DOX add MTCs , DOX attach carbon part MTCs . MTC-DOX direct deposited area tumor , think `` leak '' blood vessel wall . Once surround tissue , think Doxorubicin become `` free '' magnetic bead able act tumor cell . The iron component particle magnetic property , make possible direct MTC-DOX specific tumor sit liver placing magnet body surface . It hop MTC-DOX use magnet may target chemotherapy directly liver tumor provide treatment patient liver cancer . To sure effect MTC-DOX liver cancer , compare effect Doxorubicin give vein . The study treatment administer every three week , ( consider study treatment cycle ) , complete six treatment cycle , tumor grows , disappears , experience side effect , may cause leave study . Follow-up visit occur Days 3 , 10 , 21 follow treatment first cycle Days 7 21 remain cycle , also 60 day receive last treatment cycle . Therefore , purpose Phase 2/3 study evaluate safety , tolerance , efficacy ( survival time ) MTC-DOX dose strategy DOX dose determine tumor size</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients may enrol protocol follow inclusion criterion meet : Unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma diagnose CT scan meet criteria describe Section 23 . Total combined crosssectional area hepatic tumor determine CT scan 4 200 cm2 . Center tumor ( ) mass must &lt; /= 14 cm anterior lateral abdominal wall determine crosssectional imaging baseline . This required optimal placement magnet . If one tumor mass present , tumor mass must meet criterion . Is ambulatory Karnofsky performance status score &gt; 60 estimate life expectancy &gt; 3 month . Is judged investigator initiative mean compliant protocol within geographical proximity allow followup . Have ability give inform write consent prior initiation therapy . If female childbearing potential , must negative betaHCG prior receive treatment . Must agree use effective method contraception Patients exclude enrollment follow apply : Has history cancer hepatocellular ( exclude resect basal cell carcinoma ; curatively resect stage 1 less cervical cancer disease free 5 year ) . Has prior local radiation therapy within last 4 week , mediastinal radiation therapy within last 3 month , chemotherapy within last 4 week . Diffuse hepatocellular carcinoma disease preclude delivery drug tumor via vessel feed tumor . Has another active medical condition ( ) organ disease ( ) may either compromise patient safety interfere safety and/or outcome ( e.g. , survival ) evaluation study drug . While exclusion limit follow abnormality , follow laboratory abnormality present , patient exclude : WBC &lt; 2,000 /uL Platelets &lt; 50,000/uL Hemoglobin &lt; 8.0 gm/dL Total bilirubin &gt; 3.0 mg/dL ALT AST &gt; /= 5 x upper limit normal Serum Creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL INR &gt; /= 1.5 Has cardiac dysfunction leave ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 40 % . Has clinically significant pulmonary impairment Plans concomitant chemotherapy , radiation therapy , hormonal and/or biological treatment cancer include immunotherapy study . Has indwell cardiac pacemaker , cerebral aneurysm clip , indwell device appliance could adversely affect use external magnet . Has document evidence hemachromatosis hemosiderosis . Has CT ultrasound evidence portal vein invasion thrombosis . Prior orthotopic hepatic transplant . Has receive previous treatment doxorubicin , idarubicin , and/or anthracyclines anthracenes . Has know allergy doxorubicin , MTCDOX component . Has treat investigational drug , investigational biologic , investigational therapeutic device within 30 day initiate study treatment .</criteria>
