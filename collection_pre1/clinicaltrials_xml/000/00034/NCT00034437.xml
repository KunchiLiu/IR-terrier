	<brief_summary>This study evaluate immune response cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) . About 80 percent adult expose virus . CMV typically remain dormant ( inactive ) body , cause problem . In people immune suppression , however , virus become reactivated cause life-threatening pneumonia . The knowledge gain study may useful develop way improve immune response CMV stem cell transplant recipient . Healthy normal volunteer 18 65 year age expose cytomegalovirus eligible study . Candidates screen medical history blood test . Those enrolled provide 30-milliliter ( 6-tablespoon ) blood sample week 4 week final sample 2 month later . The blood use design test detect immune response CMV determine difference responses among healthy individual .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The NHLBI Stem Cell Allotransplantation Program researching method improve immunity infectious organism follow allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) . We particularly interested cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) , cause serious problem patient follow transplantation . In future , hope design way improve immune response CMV transplant recipient , vaccinate transplant donor and/or patient virus . In order characterize effect intervention CMV immunity , first need good understand CMV immune response normal , healthy person . This involve design validate vitro assay , reliably consistently detect immune response CMV . Furthermore , hope define temporal variability exist CMV responses healthy individual , essential design implementation future study . We plan collect blood sample 20 normal volunteer previously expose CMV ( CMV seropositive individual ) . Eligible individual ask donate blood five occasion , week four week fifth time , two month later . Eligible individual must 18-65 year age , otherwise healthy , seropositive CMV exposure .</detailed_description>
