	<brief_summary>This study two phase . Phase 1 examine role inflammatory mediator call cytokine growth hormone level woman rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . Phase 2 evaluate effect etanercept growth hormone level . Etanercept approve treatment RA . It lower level key inflammatory mediator call tumor necrosis factor-alpha effective reduce arthritis symptom . Growth hormone promote bone muscle growth . With age , people lose muscle mass bone strength , possibly decrease level growth hormone . People RA bone muscle change similar old people , perhaps also due decrease level growth hormone . The first part study see inflammatory mediator responsible joint inflammation ( warmth , redness , pain , swell ) RA relate lower growth hormone level disease . The second part evaluate effect etanercept treatment muscle mass bone density , addition growth hormone level . Premenopausal woman 18 55 year age recent diagnosis rheumatoid arthritis ( less 3 year ) eligible study . Healthy volunteer also enrol first phase study control subject . This study conduct two site , NIH Johns Hopkins Medical Center Baltimore . Healthy volunteer enrol study interview health status fill questionnaires diet general physical function , include fatigue , energy well . In addition , hospitalize NIH Clinical Center 24-hour blood sample visit Johns Hopkins Medical Center Baltimore brachial artery reactivity study , follow : - 24-hour blood sample growth hormone level . Blood sample ( 1/2 teaspoon ) collect every 20 minute 8 AM one day 8 AM follow day plastic tube arm vein . - Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan small area spine , hip wrist ass bone density total body DEXA scan ass amount distribution muscle body fat . - Blood vessel ( brachial artery reactivity ) study measure ability brachial artery dilate increase blood flow . For procedure , subject lie table electrocardiogram lead attach chest . A blood pressure cuff inflate several minute drop nasal spray nitroglycerin give may cause headache . Blood pressure headache monitor treat need . Patients rheumatoid arthritis see NIH clinic six separate visit ( week 0 , 1 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 26 ) 26 week . Week 0 screen visit . At week 1 26 , patient admit hospital 24-hour blood sampling , DEXA scan , brachial artery reactivity test , describe , plus X-rays hand foot . After first visit , start take etanercept , give self-injection skin ( like insulin shot ) twice week . Follow-up visit week 6 , 12 , 18 involve evaluation disease activity drug side effect joint examination , blood test , questionnaire .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role Cytokines Growth Hormone Suppression Premenopausal Women With Rheumatoid Arthritis Effect Treatment With Etanercept</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study pre-menopausal perimenopausal woman onset rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) less 10 year duration , conduct Clinical Center National Institutes Health The General Clinical Research Center Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center , Baltimore , MD . This investigation explore possible impact systemically release inflammatory cytokine suppression GH/IGF-1 axis , relationship alter endocrine-immune function body composition , endocrine , metabolic vascular function think associate RA-related sarcopenia , osteopenia increase cardiovascular risk . In phase I study , shall admit RA patient control subject Clinical Center 26-36 hour period assessment GH/IGF-I axis , cytokine , body composition , endocrine-metabolic cardiovascular function , quality life . We plan initiate Phase I study compare baseline endocrine inflammatory parameter RA patient match normal control . Phase II study , shall enroll new group RA patient evaluate outcome measure baseline six month treatment standard therapy , use soluble p75 TNF receptor molecule etanercept , recently approve FDA treatment patient early RA . Phase 2 study initiate upon access etanercept completion Phase I study .</detailed_description>
