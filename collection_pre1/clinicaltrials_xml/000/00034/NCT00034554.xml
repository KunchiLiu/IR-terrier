	<brief_summary>Up 24 patient stage III stage IV melanoma enrol . Patients currently disease-free high risk relapse also eligible . Patients receive vaccination gp75 assign dose level . Patients exhibit serologic stable/clinical response eligible receive booster vaccination . Patients evaluate safety efficacy throughout duration study . In study , optimal biologically effective dose define low dose gp75 result production anti-gp75 antibody .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study gp75 Vaccine Patients With Stage III IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design evaluate safety feasibility intramuscular vaccination gp75 DNA patient stage III IV melanoma . Secondary objective observe patient evidence anti-tumor response establish optimal biologically effective dose . Up 24 evaluable patient stage III IV metastatic melanoma stage III melanoma , currently disease-free , high risk recurrence enrol . Patients enrol assigned dose group receive five vaccination gp75 . In order dose escalation proceed , one patient current dose group may demonstrate dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) . If second patient experience toxicity patient move previous dose level , previous dose level consider MTD . If DLTs encounter , patient continue study assign dose level . Any patient experiencing DLT receive vaccination toxicity resolve . Patients exhibit serological stable/clinical response receive fifth vaccination eligible receive booster vaccination . An additional patient accrue dose level every patient progress prior fifth vaccination .</detailed_description>
