	<brief_title>A Study Compare Efficacy Safety Levofloxacin Treatment Children With Community-acquired Pneumonia Hospital Outpatient Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter study determine efficacy levofloxacin compare `` standard care '' ( antibiotic medication commonly use treatment infection question ) treat community acquire pneumonia child age 6 month 16 year . The study consist 4 phase : 1-day screening period patient test eligibility study ; 10-day treatment , blood collection , evaluation period ; post-treatment period begin 1 3 day last dose study medication ; post-study period 10 17 day last dose study medication ass whether patient cure pneumonia . Patients divide 2 group base upon age randomly assign receive 10 day either levofloxacin another antibiotic . The patient Group 1 randomly assign levofloxacin amoxicillin/clavulanate . The patient Group 2 randomly assign receive levofloxacin either ceftriaxone plus erythromycin lactobionate clarithromycin . Safety evaluation include laboratory test , physical examination , vital sign measurement , record adverse event , include adverse event affect muscle bone . Efficacy assessment include whether patient cure pneumonia base sign symptom pneumonia report start study . Additionally , post-therapy post-study visit , response evaluate patient ' sign symptom microscopic examination bacteria identify start study . The study hypothesis treatment levofloxacin effective treatment child age 6 month 16 year community acquire pneumonia wil well tolerated patient . Levofloxacin 10 mg/kg twice daily , amoxicillin/clavulanate 22.5 mg/kg twice daily , ceftriaxone 25 mg/kg twice daily plus erythromycin lactobionate 10 mg/kg every 6 hour clarithromycin 7.5 mg/kg twice daily , either intravenously mouth 10 day .</detailed_description>
