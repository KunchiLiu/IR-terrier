	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate safe dose TAK-165 , daily ( QD ) , patient HER2-tumor expression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Tolerability Study TAK-165 Subjects With Tumors Expressing HER2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) member Type 1 family growth factor tyrosine kinase . HER2 form hetero- homo-dimers member family tyrosine kinase . As result dimerization cell surface , intracellular signal transduction initiate , result cell proliferation . HER2 expression observe variety human tumor include breast cancer , non-small cell lung cancer , prostate cancer , pancreatic cancer , renal cell cancer , ovarian cancer . HER2 overexpression associate clinically aggressive breast cancer , independent predictor poor prognosis patient breast cancer . TAK-165 active selective inhibitor tyrosine kinase activity HER2 develop patient low level HER2 expression . This study seek determine safety , tolerability , maximum tolerate dose pharmacokinetics TAK-165 administered subject tumor know express HER2 . The total duration study minimum 8 week , 56 Days . Subjects without progressive disease 8 week may continue receive study drug , provide meet criterion withdrawal .</detailed_description>
