	<brief_summary>Background : People family history testicular cancer may increase risk disease . Genetic clinical study patient testicular cancer family member may help clarify cause disease identify clinical feature . Objectives : To characterize clinical feature testicular cancer . To identify gene may lead increase risk disease . To examine emotional behavioral issue member family increase risk disease . Eligibility : Males female family least two case testicular cancer blood relative . Males testicular cancer testicle . Males testicular cancer identical twin . Participants must least 12 year age . Design : Participants may take part Part 1 Parts 1 2 2-part study . Part 1 participant : - Provide blood cheek cell sample obtain DNA gene study . - Provide permission researcher obtain medical record review . - Complete questionnaire personal family medical history , exposure factor might influence risk testicular cancer , feeling member family several member testicular cancer . - These data collect participant home community . Part 2 participant : - All participant provide medical history , complete physical examination , include routine lab test , ultrasound test abdomen look kidney . - Males ultrasound test testicle scrotum . - Females ultrasound test pelvis look ovary , uterus fallopian tube . - Males 18 year age old provide semen sample . - Some participant compute tomography ( CT ) scan chest , abdomen pelvis instead kidney ultrasound . Children 18 year age may magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) instead CT. - These data collect participant 2-day visit NIH Clinical Center Bethesda , MD . Travel cost cover protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Testicular germ cell tumor ( TGCT ) common cancer men age 20-35 , increase incidence since mid-twentieth century . A family history TGCT associate increase risk disease . Evidence suggest genetic heterogeneity familial TGCT , thereby create opportunity new susceptibility gene discovery search genotype/phenotype/cancer correlation . Search genitourinary developmental anomaly testicular intraepithelial neoplasia ( TIN ) cell think precursor vast majority TGCT could help clarify etiology identify clinical feature . This project etiologic clinical focus , goal acquire comprehensive understanding genetic non-genetic factor contribute risk familial TGCT . OBJECTIVES : Ascertain new family familial testicular germ cell tumor . Characterize clinical feature familial TGCT . Determine underlying genetic mechanism susceptibility TGCT family ; one specific goal confirm , clone , hereditary testicular cancer gene map chromosome Xq27 . Evaluate various parameter relate psychosocial behavioral issue result member family increase risk TGCT . ELIGIBILITY : A single family member bilateral testicular cancer . Individuals gender family least two case document GCT blood relative ( least one testicular origin ) least one GCT case family willing participate study . Men history TGCT monozygotic twin brother ( unaffected identical sibling must also agree participate ) . Families deem ineligible critical informative family member lack survive spouse child unable provide germ line DNA Minor child age 12 eligible study participation . DESIGN : International collaboration NCI 's Clinical Genetics Branch International Testicular Cancer Linkage Consortium ( ITCLC ) , via contribution DNA . Non-randomized cohort study estimate accrual 75 100 new TGCT family period 5 year approximately 40 family willing visit NIH Clinical Center . Individuals family member ask contribute baseline questionnaire well questionnaires regard lifestyle , feeling , attitude behavior relate part high-risk family , DNA gene map clone effort . Detailed , in-person , etiologically-oriented evaluation NIH Clinical Center include comprehensive history physical examination , laboratory testing , ultrasound image kidney gonad identify clinical feature seek clinically occult TGCT TIN . CT image study chest , abdomen , pelvis perform indicate . Study participant monitor prospectively development outcomes interest mean periodic mail and/or telephone contact . Cancer outcomes document review medical , vital , pathology record . Tumor tissue obtain whenever feasible .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Study population : Patients must member family familial TGCT define . Definition familial TGCT : The criterion establish familial TGCT presence : least two case document GCT blood relative ( least one testicular origin ) , OR single family member bilateral testicular cancer , men history TGCT one set identical sibling also include study . Case definition : A case determine TGCT accord follow criterion : Pathologic confirmation germ cell derive tumor arise testis . Extragonadal germ cell tumor also include . Germ cell derive histology include : seminoma , germinoma , embryonal carcinoma , endodermal sinus ( yolk sac ) tumor , gonadoblastoma , choriocarcinoma , teratoma , mixed germ cell tumor . A case determine TIN basis pathologic confirmation intratubular malignant germ cell ( ITMGCs ) define Burke Mostofi . Individuals participate family eligible study include : ) TGCT case ; ii ) All GCT case ( include ovarian extragonadal site ) ; iii ) firstdegree relative TGCT case ; iv ) spouse ( ) every case spouse case child participate study ; v ) blood relative include ( ii iii ) genetically link two case ; vi ) blood relative cancer TGCT vii ) family member describe ) v ) must age 12 great order participate EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Families deem ineligible participation study : There least two proven case GCT family , one testicular origin , unless family member bilateral testicular cancer ; Deceased TGCT case lack archival source tissue DNA extraction AND lack survive spouse child willing paricipate study ( unavailability person prohibits infer genotype decease individual TGCT ) . Critical informative family member unwilling participate ( i.e. , unwilling provide write informed consent ) ;</criteria>
