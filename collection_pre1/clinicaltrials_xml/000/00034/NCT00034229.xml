	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness drug felbamate treat depression patient bipolar disorder respond standard treatment . Bipolar disorder severe , chronic , often life-threatening illness . Despite availability wide range antidepressant drug , proportion patient fail respond first-line antidepressant treatment despite adequate dosage , duration , compliance . Studies suggest glutamatergic system may play role pathophysiology treatment depression . Felbamate agent reduce glutamatergic neurotransmission may represent novel class antidepressant . Participants study admitted Clinical Center 10 week . At study entry , participant 7-day washout period taper psychiatric medication , possible exception lithium , give placebo ( inactive pill ) . After washout period , participant randomly assign receive either felbamate placebo 8 week . Participants whose depression symptom worsen 30 % study continuation consider potentially harmful take study offer open-label treatment . Participants receive felbamate respond well treatment option continue treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Felbamate Treatment-Resistant Bipolar Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bipolar affective disorder ( BPD , manic-depressive illness ) common , severe , chronic often life-threatening illness . Increasingly , recognize depressive phase illness , contribute much morbidity mortality . Impairment physical social function result depression severe chronic medical illness . Suicide cause death 10-20 % individual either bipolar recurrent depressive disorder . The treatment acute unipolar depression extensively research . However , despite availability wide range antidepressant drug , clinical trial indicate 30 % 40 % depressed patient fail respond first-line antidepressant treatment , despite adequate dosage , duration , compliance . Very study examine efficacy somatic treatment acute phase bipolar depression . Thus , clear need develop novel improve therapeutic bipolar depression . Recent preclinical study suggest antidepressant may exert delayed indirect effect glutamatergic system . Furthermore , grow body data suggest mood disorder associate regional volumetric reduction , cell loss atrophy . It noteworthy lamotrigine reduces glutamatergic neurotransmission , antidepressant effect bipolar depression , pilot study suggest NMDA antagonist may antidepressant effect . Together , data suggest glutamatergic system may play role pathophysiology treatment depression , agent , directly reduce glutamatergic neurotransmission , may represent novel class antidepressant . Felbamate ( Felbatol Â® ( Registered Trademark ) ) dicarbamate , FDA-approved monotherapy adjunctive therapy adult partial-onset seizure without secondary generalization partial generalized seizure associate Lennox-Gastaut syndrome child . Felbamate significant antiglutamatergic neuroprotective property , may prove antidepressant property bipolar patient . In study , propose investigate potential efficacy felbamate , reduce glutamatergic throughput via inhibition glutamate release NMDA , AMPA , metabotropic glutamate receptor blockade . This 8-week randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study examine efficacy safety felbamate acutely depress bipolar patient consider treatment-resistant . This study two phase . The first phase washout phase last 7 day . The second phase 8-week acute treatment phase efficacy tolerability felbamate placebo compare . Lithium remain Study Periods I II partial response agent document . Patients complete 8-week double-blind phase receive clinical treatment . Acute efficacy determine demonstrate great response rate use specify criterion . Patients , age 18 older , diagnosis Bipolar I II disorder , depress ( without psychotic feature ) , randomize double-blind treatment receive either felbamate ( 600-3000 mg/day ) placebo period 8 week . Following acute period , patient receive treatment clinically indicate . Approximately 52 patient treatment-resistant acute bipolar depression enrol study .</detailed_description>
