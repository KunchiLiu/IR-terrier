	<brief_title>Ginkgo Biloba : Antidepressant-Induced Sexual Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Virtually antidepressant medication associate high incidence adverse sexual side effect . In woman , side effect commonly report include decreased sexual arousal decrease lubrication , delay inhibit orgasm , decrease sexual desire . To date , effective pharmacological antidote treat sexual side effect . Ginkgo biloba extract ( GBE ) , naturally occur substance ancient Chinese Ginkgo tree , property prove increase peripheral blood flow facilitate relaxation smooth muscle tissue . Its effectiveness regard demonstrate numerous clinical trial show gingko biloba highly efficient treat peripheral vascular disorder . Female sexual arousal involve complex interplay action - relaxation smooth muscle tissue inflow blood genital region . Hence , pharmacologically , feasible GBE may effective enhance female sexual arousal . Moreover , give mechanism hypothesize facilitate female sexual function operative peripheral rather central ( i.e. , neurotransmitter ) level , unlikely GBE would adversely impact mood-alleviating therapeutic effect antidepressant medication believe centrally mediate . Limited , uncontrolled study lend support hypothesis . The purpose present study provide first empirical examination effect acute chronic GBE subjective physiological measure sexual function woman experience clinically diagnosable hypoactive sexual desire disorder , female sexual arousal disorder , and/or inhibit female orgasm secondary either fluoxetine , sertraline , paroxetine use . Women ( N = 110 ) stabilize antidepressant medication free current Axis I disorder randomized 8 week daily treatment either GBE ( 200 mg ) placebo . Sexual functioning assess ( ) daily patient diary recording , ( b ) patient-rating scale complete week , ( c ) blind independent evaluator rating . The acute effect GBE also assess use vaginal photoplethysmograph technique assess genital blood flow , prior follow chronic GBE treatment . The finding present study ( ) help determine whether chronic and/or acute GBE facilitate sexual function woman antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction , ( b ) examine whether acute GBE influence vaginal measure sexual arousal . If effective , GBE could play significant adjunctive role treatment clinical depression psychological disorder commonly treat antidepressant medication .</detailed_description>
