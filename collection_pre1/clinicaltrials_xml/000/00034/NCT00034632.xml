	<brief_title>Study Posaconazole Treatment Invasive Fungal Infections ( Study P02095 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current clinical trial design provide posaconazole ( SCH 56592 subject invasive fungal infection ) refractory resistant standard antifungal therapy b ) currently effective therapy . Subjects invasive fungal infection enrol control , randomize clinical trial . Secondly , clinical trial also design provide posaconazole ( SCH 56592 ) subject invasive fungal infection c ) experience serious severe toxicity receive standard antifungal therapy ) pre-existing organ dysfunction renal dysfunction require standard antifungal therapy preclude toxicity associate therapy . This clinical trial also serve allow collection preliminary data regard safety efficacy posaconazole ( SCH 56592 ) variety invasive fungal infection although serious life-threatening sufficiently rare study control , randomize clinical trial . This open-label , treatment protocol multi-center study posaconazole ( SCH 56592 ) 200mg orally four time daily ( QID ) hospitalize follow posaconazole ( SCH 56592 ) 400mg orally twice daily ( BID ) discharge hospital , treatment invasive fungal infection . Approximately 320 subject enrol 160 clinical study center US worldwide .</detailed_description>
