	<brief_summary>In study , patient randomize one three dose regimen group . Each dose OvaRex MAb-B43.13 2 mg slow intravenous administration . Group 1 receive two dos , one month apart . Group 2 receive three consecutive monthly dos , 12-week interval 2 year disease relapse total 9 dos . Group 3 receive six consecutive monthly dos , 12-week interval 2 year disease relapse total 11 dos . The study compare time disease relapse patient demonstrate immune response OvaRex MAb-B43.13 time disease relapse demonstrate immune response OvaRex MAb-B43.13 . Differences percentage patient demonstrate immune response dose regimen group also assess .</brief_summary>
