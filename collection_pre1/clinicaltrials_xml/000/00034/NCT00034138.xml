	<brief_title>A Comparative Pharmacokinetics Safety Study OvaRex MAb-B43.13 Patients With Ovarian Epithelial Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , open-label , randomize , parallel group , Phase 1/2 study female patient Stage III/IV epithelial ovarian cancer . The study compare pharmacokinetic profile OvaRex MAb-B43.13 ascites fluid product OvaRex MAb-B43.13 cell culture product . The study also evaluate safety cell culture product immune response patient follow treatment . The study conduct three phase : 1 . The pharmacokinetic assessment phase include least 24 patient , randomize two treatment group receive single 2 mg dose either ascites fluid product cell culture product . 2 . The treatment phase continue administration two monthly dos ( week 4 8 ) patient receive cell culture product . Study patient follow safety immune response week 20 . 3 . The continuation phase continue administration cell culture product discretion investigator quarterly schedule 104 week eligible patient tolerate therapy . Patients continue treatment follow serious adverse event patient follow survival 2 year first treatment .</detailed_description>
