	<brief_summary>The purpose study see body 's immune system change replace add new anti-HIV drug patient 's current anti-HIV therapy . This study also see whether add drug safe . Patients take part A5136 also eligible take part 2 substudies . The purpose substudy A5140s see many latently infected cell ( cell HIV virus survives ) lymph node ( small , rounded structure make disease-fighting cell ) . Substudy A5155s perform see many latently infected cell blood replace add anti-HIV drug . ACTG A5136 follow-up study ACTG 315 ACTG 375 , design examine effect highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) certain HIV-infected patient . Many HIV-infected patient undergone long-term anti-HIV therapy virus suppress . However , patient still problem immune system . The reason problem unknown . This study may help researcher understand cause immune system problem people low level HIV blood .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>ACTG 315 follow-up study , ACTG 375 , design examine immunologic virologic consequence highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) patient moderately advance HIV-1 disease . At conclusion ACTG 375 , patient eligible participation ACTG A5136 receive 5 year antiretroviral therapy . Despite long-term therapy long-term maximal viral suppression patient , significant immune defect impaired response antigen , include HIV , abnormally low CD4 cell count , abnormally high immune activation , decrease expression CD28 persist . It uncertain whether defect persist result irreversible damage inflict HIV infection ongoing immune perturbation result continuous low-level HIV replication . Cellular reservoir HIV persist ( despite undetectable plasma viral load ) may contribute persistent immune activation impair immune function . A great deal information relationship low-level viral replication persistent immune impairment may gain investigate patient intensification antiretroviral therapy regimen . Patients continue receive ACTG 375 antiretroviral therapy register A5136 . Following entry evaluation , patient replace protease inhibitor ( PIs ) ACTG 375 regimen lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ) , add tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) regimen , maintain rest ACTG 375 regimen 48 week . Patients clinic visit entry Weeks 4 , 12 , 16 . After 24 week , patient clinic visit every 12 week . Blood drawn visit viral load , immune response , routine test . A skin test , urine sample collection , pregnancy test ( woman reproductive potential ) also perform entry . Patients also receive immunization . At Weeks 12 16 , lyme vaccine , polyvalent administer . At Week 36 , lyme vaccine , polyvalent ; pneumococcal vaccine , polyvalent ; haemophilus b conjugate ( HIB ) vaccine administer [ AS PER AMENDMENT 05/14/02 : Lyme disease vaccine remove study due unavailability ] . At Week 48 , skin test perform . Week 52 final clinic visit , blood drawn urine sample take . Patients participate substudy A5140s undergo 2 lymph node aspirate , entry Week 48 . Patients participate substudy A5155s blood drawn screen Week 48 .</detailed_description>
