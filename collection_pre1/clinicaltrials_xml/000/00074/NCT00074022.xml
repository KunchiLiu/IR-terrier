	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine recommend phase II dose GTI-2040 docetaxel patient recurrent , metastatic , unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer , prostate cancer , solid tumor ( phase I study close accrual 8/5/2004 ) . II . Determine toxicity regimen patient . III . Determine objective tumor response rate patient treat regimen . IV . Determine stable disease rate , time disease progression , objective response duration , duration stable disease patient treat regimen . V. Determine pharmacokinetics GTI-2040 administer combination docetaxel patient . VI . Correlate pharmacokinetics GTI-2040 biological toxic effect regimen patient . VII . Correlate baseline post-treatment level ribonucleotide reductase activity tumor biopsy peripheral blood mononuclear cell tumoral expression c-myc , ra , pRAF1 , pMAPK , marker apoptosis clinical outcome patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This open-label , dose-escalation , multicenter study . Phase I ( close accrual 8/5/2004 ) : Patients receive GTI-2040 IV continuously day 1-14 . Patients also receive docetaxel IV 1 hour day 3 course 1 day 1 subsequent course . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos GTI-2040 docetaxel maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . The recommended phase II dose ( RP2D ) define dose precede MTD . Phase II : Patients receive GTI-2040 docetaxel RP2D phase I . Patients follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 12-48 patient ( 12-18 phase I [ close accrual 8/5/2004 ] 15-30 phase II ) accrue study within 4-16 month .</detailed_description>
