	<brief_title>Pentostatin Treating Patients With Refractory Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine response rate patient refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease treat pentostatin . Secondary - Determine time next immunosuppressive agent ( i.e. , time progression best response ) patient treat drug . - Determine toxicity drug patient . - Determine infection rate patient treat drug . - Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . - Determine change lymphocyte population patient treated drug . - Determine survival patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive pentostatin IV 20-30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response 6 course receive 4 additional course . Patients achieve partial response , minor response , stable disease 6 course may receive 6 additional course . Patients follow every 4 week 1 year , every 3 month 2 year , annually 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 37 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologic documentation chronic GvHD follow allogeneic HCT donor lymphocyte infusion . 2 . Patients may progressive , quiescent , de novo onset chronic GvHD . 3 . Patients extensive stage chronic GvHD require systemic immunosuppressive therapy eligible . Patients limited stage disease exclude . Extensive stage define accord Seattle criterion ( 9 ) either : Generalized skin involvement Limited skin involvement hepatic involvement one following : Liver histology show chronic progressive hepatitis , bridge necrosis cirrhosis Eye involvement ( Schirmer 's test &lt; 5 mm wet ) Involvement minor salivary gland oral mucosa Involvement organ 4 . Patients must fail treatment , experience progression , prior corticosteroid extensive stage chronic GvHD , define . 4.1 Patients consider fail corticosteroid one follow criterion : Progressive disease less minor response organ system despite 2 week corticosteroid treatment least 1 mg/kg methylprednisolone equivalent . Failure achieve least minor response least 4 week treatment dose ≥ 0.5 mg/kg methylprednisolone equivalent . Achievement le partial response 8 week corticosteroid treatment despite use dose ≥ 0.5 mg/kg methylprednisolone equivalent . Requirement ≥ 0.5 mg/kg methylprednisolone equivalent maintain partial response well 12 week corticosteroid treatment . Requirement &gt; 10 mg/kg methylprednisolone equivalent maintain partial response well 18 week corticosteroid treatment . 4.2 Patients progression extensive stage chronic GvHD prior history treatment least 18 week corticosteroid , require reintroduction corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg/day methylprednisolone equivalent ) additional agent ( include photopheresis , PUVA ) treatment . 5 . Patients establish chronic GvHD improve progress immunosuppressive agent also eligible steroid refractoriness establish previously . 6 . Age ≥ 18 year 7 . Performance Status 03 8 . Patients mechanical ventilation exclude . 9 . No active infection . Patients active infection require antibiotic therapy eligible infection control . 10 . No HIV infection . Patients HIV infection exclude safety concern patient population . 11 . Nonpregnant nonnursing . Women men reproductive potential agree use appropriate method birth control throughout participation study due teratogenic potential therapy utilized trial ( although unlikely successful pregnancy occur patient chronic GvHD ) . Appropriate method birth control include oral contraceptive , implantable hormonal contraceptive ( Norplant® ) , double barrier method ( diaphragm plus condom ) . 12 . Required Initial Laboratory Values : Calc . Creatinine Clearance ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2 ANC &gt; 1000/μL Platelets &gt; 50,000/μL without transfusion</criteria>
