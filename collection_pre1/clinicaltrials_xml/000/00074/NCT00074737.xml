	<brief_summary>The principal goal clinical trial ass ability cenersen sodium ( EL625 ) improve cancer responsiveness establish AML therapeutic agent Idarubicin use alone combination Cytarabine ( Ara-C ) . Cenersen sodium drug design block effect protein call p53 . Laboratory evidence show block p53 make many type cancer , include acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) , sensitive variety establish cancer therapeutic make normal tissue resistant toxic effect agent .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dosing Study Ara-C/EL625/Idarubicin Refractory Relapsed AML</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial design assess ability cenersen sodium ( EL625 ) combination Idarubicin alone Cytarabine either : ( 1 ) induce remission patient previously fail go remission response chemotherapy ; ( 2 ) provide patent relapse go chemotherapy-induced remission long remission . Cenersen sodium one new class drug call antisense oligonucleotides ( oligos ) . Oligos design block production specific proteins thereby inhibit function . Cenersen sodium target p53 , widely study protein . In cancer , p53 occurs either un-mutated ( `` normal '' ) mutate form . The majority participants trial expect un-mutated p53 . Cenersen sodium anticipate sensitize cancer un-mutated p53 establish cancer therapeutic . p53 pivotal role protect body cell suffer genetic damage , result , function properly . The protein first sense level damage force damage cell respond damage either repair commit suicide . In general , great level damage likely cellular response suicide . Many cancer therapeutic , include chemotherapy radiation , cause type genetic damage activate p53 , consequently , cause either damage repair cellular suicide . Laboratory study suggest cancer cell host defense reduce chance cell respond genetic damage commit suicide . So compare normal cell , cancer cell likely repair damage cause cancer therapeutic normal cell likely commit suicide . Thus , block un-mutated p53 likely prevent repair cancer cell prevent suicide normal cell . This provide basis differential effect cenersen sodium cancer cell verse normal cell . When p53-dependent repair prevent cancer cell begin copy damage genetic information preparation cell division . This copy genetic damage trigger p53-independent backup suicide mechanism , result , cancer cell eliminate . This presumed mechanism whereby cenersen sodium able sensitize cancer cell normal p53 function numerous cancer therapeutic . At high dos however , chemotherapy sometimes block cell copy gene preparation division . Thus , possible chemotherapeutic agent use high dose could block sensitize effect cenersen sodium might otherwise cancer . The chemotherapeutic agent Idarubicin know produce type genetic damage effect p53 expression , cause p53-dependent response show make effective killing cancer cell cenersen sodium . Cytarabine ( Ara-C ) widely use chemotherapeutic agent AML . Cenersen sodium appear sensitize cancer cell Cytarabine high dos Cytarabine may reduce capacity cenersen sodium sensitize cancer cell . Hence , AML study examine effect Cenersen sodium use combination Idarubicin one three different dos Cytarabine ( i.e . 0 , 0.1 1.0 gm/m2/day ) , responsiveness participant chemotherapeutic agent .</detailed_description>
