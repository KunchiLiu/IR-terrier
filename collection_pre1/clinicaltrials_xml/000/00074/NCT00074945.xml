	<brief_summary>This study explore factor affect obesity obesity-related disease Caucasians African Americans . By look rate human body burn calorie rest ( rest energy expenditure , REE ) rate fat travel blood ( fatty acid flux ) , study examine relationship REE fatty acid flux , determinant obesity . Researchers compare test result Caucasians African Americans determine race effect relationship REE fatty acid flux . Volunteers must 18 49 year age . Equal number typical weight , overweight , obese participant recruit . Candidates screen physical examination , electrocardiogram , blood test , interview diet exercise habit , family medical history , employment . Participants place two-week maintenance diet ( prepared dietician regulate maintain calorie consumption ) must visit outpatient clinic weight measurement 10 consecutive weekday . During two-week diet , participant also undergo two 20-minute computerized scan measure abdominal body fat . At end two week , participant hospitalize two day allow researcher conduct blood test , oral glucose test , physical examination measure REE fatty acid flux level comparison .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Thirty percent Americans obese . Women severely affect men . African-Americans severely affect Caucasians . To understand metabolic consequence obesity , essential know rate free fatty acid ( FFA ) release adipose tissue . Circulating FFA contribute complication obesity particularly diabetes heart disease . As sex race difference prevalence condition may sex race difference FFA flux . FFA flux represent rate FFA circulate . FFA flux result three process go time , ( 1 ) rate FFA release adipose tissue , ( 2 ) rate circulate FFA use energy , ( 3 ) rate FFA leave circulation re-enter adipose tissue . No data available whether sex race difference FFA flux exist . Further , compare subject different size , sex race , unknown whether FFA flux correct lean body mass rest energy expenditure . To determine sex race difference FFA flux ensure adequate enrollment African American Caucasians , investigation collaborative effort National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Bethesda , Maryland Mayo Clinic Olmsted County , Minnesota . The great Washington , DC , metropolitan area , NIH locate , large African-American community whereas 90 percent resident Olmsted County Caucasians . Therefore , sex difference FFA flux African Americans mainly study National Institutes Health . Sex difference FFA flux Caucasians mainly study Mayo Clinic . But , confirm ability combine data two different site , Caucasians enrol NIH African Americans enrol Mayo Clinic . The result two study combine determine race difference FFA flux . At NIH , 50 African-Americans ( 25M , 25W , age range 18-49 year ) 14 Caucasians ( 7M , 7W age range 18-49 year ) enrol . Equal number normal weight , overweight obese subject recruit . As outpatient , participant place weight maintain diet two week admit two-day hospital stay . On in-hospital morning , rest energy expenditure measure stable isotope infuse measure FFA flux . Stable isotope naturally occur form element , safe non-radioactive . From study African-Americans NIH possible determine ( ) rate FFA release African-Americans highly related lean body mass rest energy expenditure , ( b ) sex difference relationship . Then describe , result Mayo Clinic NIH combine determine race difference FFA flux .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Population : A total 134 subject , age range 18 49 recruit . 64 AfricanAmericans ( 32 men , 32 woman ) 56 Caucasians ( 35 men , 35 woman ) Within racial group equal number normal weight , overweight obese subject recruit . AfricanAmericans : Individuals consider AfricanAmerican selfidentify AfricanAmerican bear United States . Further must describe parent AfricanAmerican born United States . Age : We recruit subject age 18 49 year . Weight : Enrollees must weigh less 136 kg ( 300 lb ) BMI le 36 kg/m ( 2 ) . Screening Blood Work : To enroll subject must normal hemoglobin level , electrolyte panel normal kidney , thyroid liver function test . Hysterectomy : Women hysterectomy may participate long less equal 49 year age normal gonadotropin level . Weight Exercise Regimens : Subjects must report weight stable least 3 month initiate rigorous exercise regimen participation study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Age : As , subject less 18 year great 49 year enrol . Weight : Subjects great 136 kg ( 300 lb ) BMI great 36 kg/m ( 2 ) enrol . Medications : Subjects take medication know affect parameter investigation exclude . Some examples medication : oral contraceptive , depoprovera , antihyperglycemic medication , antihypertensive , hypolipidemics , steroid antiobesity agent . Medical condition , specifically : Diabetes , Hypertension Hyperlipidemia . Breastfeeding : Women breastfeed infant less four month age exclude . Pregnancy : Pregnant woman exclude participate . Minority Status AfricanAmerican : After sample size necessary achieve clinically relevant data calculate , plan seek permission IRB expand study enrollment minority .</criteria>
