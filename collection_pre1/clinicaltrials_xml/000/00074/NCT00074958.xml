	<brief_summary>People Fabry disease alteration genetic material ( DNA ) cause deficiency a-galactosidase A enzyme . This enzyme help break remove certain type fatty substance call `` glycolipids '' . These glycolipids normally present within body cell . In people Fabry disease , glycolipids build various tissue liver , kidney , skin , blood vessel a-galactosidase A present , present small quantity . The build glycolipid level ( also refer `` globotriaosylceramide '' `` GL-3 '' ) tissue think cause clinical symptom common Fabry disease . Symptoms commonly appear childhood pain hand foot . This study explore safety , efficacy pharmacokinetics Fabrazyme pediatric patient age 7 15 year .</brief_summary>
