	<brief_summary>People Fabry disease alteration genetic material ( DNA ) cause deficiency a-galactosidase A enzyme . Fabrazyme drug help breakdown remove certain type fatty substance call `` glycolipids . '' These glycolipids normally present within body cell . In Fabry disease , glycolipids build various tissue liver , kidney , skin , blood vessel a-galactosidase A present , present small quantity . The build glycolipid ( `` globatriaosylceramide '' `` GL-3 '' ) level tissue particular thought cause clinical symptom common Fabry disease . This study test safety efficacy Fabrazyme treatment patient Fabry disease .</brief_summary>
