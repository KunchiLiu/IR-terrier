	<brief_summary>Background : Patients cancer blood immune system often benefit transplant stem cell genetically well-matched sibling . However , severe problem may follow transplant high-dose chemotherapy radiation accompany procedure . Also , donate immune cell sometimes attack healthy tissue reaction call graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) , damage organ liver , intestine skin . To reduce toxicity high-dose preparative chemotherapy , study performs allogeneic transplant low dos chemotherapy . In attempt improve anti-tumor effect without increase GVHD , study us donor immune cell ( Th2 cell ) grow laboratory ; patient receive standard donor immune cell ( grown laboratory ) . All patient receive immune modulating drug sirolimus cyclosporine prevent GVHD . Objective : To determine safety , treatment effect rate GVHD patient receive transplant use low-intensity chemotherapy , sirolimus plus cyclosporine , transplant booster either Th2 cell standard immune cell . Eligibility : Patients 16 75 year age acute chronic leukemia , non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , Hodgkin 's disease , multiple myeloma , myelodysplastic syndrome . Patients must suitable genetically match sibling donor adequate kidney , heart lung function . Design : The protocol three treatment group : cohort 1 , Th2 booster two week post-transplant ; cohort 2 , standard T cell booster two week post-transplant ; cohort 3 , multiple infusion Th2 cell .

	<detailed_description>Background In protocol 99-C-0143 , evaluate new approach allogeneic HSCT involve intensive host T cell ablation graft augmentation vitro generate donor Th2 cell . Rapid full donor engraftment occur regimen ; however , grade II IV acute GVHD significantly reduce Th2 cell recipient . In attempt improve clinical result use Th2 cell graft engineering , second-generation Th2 cell clinical trial develop incorporates follow intervention : ( 1 ) In attempt reduce transplant-related toxicity , protocol use low-intensity host preparative chemotherapy ; ( 2 ) In attempt reduce GVHD , study utilize Th2 cell expand presence immune modulation agent , rapamycin ( sirolimus ) , murine Th2 cell grown rapamycin reduce GVHD effectively control Th2 cell ; ( 3 ) To reduce GVHD , subject receive short-course sirolimus therapy addition standard cyclosporine GVHD prophylaxis ; ( 4 ) Using novel low-intensity transplant platform , compare preliminary manner post-transplant outcome patient receive pre-emptive donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) use either Th2 cell unmanipulated donor T cell . Objectives In set HLA-matched sibling allogeneic HSCT use GVHD prophylaxis cyclosporine short-course sirolimus , compare preliminary manner safety , feasibility , alloengraftment , clinical anti-tumor effect , GVHD rate low-intensity Preparative Chemotherapy pre-emptive DLI use either Th2 cell unmanipulated T cell day 14 post-HSCT . Eligibility Subjects 16 75 year age suitable 6/6 HLA-matched sibling donor potentially eligible . Subjects diagnosis acute chronic leukemia , non-Hodgkin lymphoma , Hodgkin disease , multiple myeloma , myelodysplastic syndrome potentially eligible . Adequate kidney , cardiac , pulmonary function require . Design - Patients age 18 old lymphoma ( type ) chronic lymphocytic leukemia randomize prior transplant regimen receive DLI either donor Th2 cell ( cohort 1 ) unmanipulated T cell ( cohort 2 ) ; n=10 patient accrue arm provide stopping rule pertain excessive GVHD graft rejection meet . For randomized patient , preparative regimen consist low-intensity fludarabine ( 120 mg/m ( 2 ) ) plus cyclophosphamide ( 1200 mg/m ( 2 ) ) GVHD prophylaxis consist short-course , high-dose sirolimus follow maintenance cyclosporine . Cohorts 1 2 compare preliminary manner respect post-transplant outcome , particular : ( ) conversion mixed chimerism predominant donor chimerism ; ( b ) rate severity classical acute late acute GVHD day 100 day 180 post-transplant time point ; ( c ) time induction leukemia/lymphoma remission ( enter transplant disease ) time relapse ( enter transplant remission ) . - Patients non-lymphoma diagnosis , patient lymphoma age 18 lymphoma patient project unable complete protocol-defined therapy day 180 post-transplant randomize treated cohort 3 ( n=40 ) , evaluate transplantation without Flu/Cy preparative regimen pre-emptive Th2 cell DLI . The primary objective cohort 3 evaluate whether transplantation without preparative regimen reduce rate acute GVHD associate Th2 cell DLI 41 % ( rate observe Flu/Cy preparative regimen ) rate 15 % ( 6 case 40 ) .</detailed_description>
