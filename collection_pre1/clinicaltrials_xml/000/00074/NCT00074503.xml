	<brief_summary>This study examine use positron emission tomography ( PET ) measure docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) absorption blood brain . DHA type fatty acid find fish seafood . It involve brain cell activity underlie ability think , move , respond outside world . When amount DHA brain low , brain may work normal amount DHA . If PET use successfully evaluate brain DHA metabolism , method might useful future study alcoholism , since brain DHA level influence alcohol consumption . Healthy normal volunteer 18 65 year age may eligible study . Because study participant must stop take medication , include herbal preparation , individual require regular medication exclude protocol . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Psychological questionnaire concern thought behavior . - Nutritional status analysis : A dietitian ass subject 's nutritional status questionnaire measurement body fat . Body fat measure use bioelectrical impedance analysis . This analysis use low , safe electric current measure body composition , give reading percentage fat body . - Fat biopsy measure composition fat tissue : An area upper half buttock numb needle inserted aspirate sample fat tissue analysis . - Blood drawing : Blood sample collect time fat biopsy PET scan ( see ) measure DHA indicator may influence DHA . - Diet : 3 day fat biopsy least 3 day PET scan , subject consume diet low DHA omega-3 fat . This seafood diet prohibits eat fish , shellfish , seaweed , seafood , health food product supplemental vitamin , food contain canola flaxseed oil . Caffeine-containing beverage limit one per day 3 day study . Alcoholic beverages prohibit 2 week study . For 24 hour PET scan , subject eat standard meal provide . - Magnetic resonance imaging : A brain MRI scan do fit PET scan image onto picture whole brain . During scan , subject lie table inside narrow metal cylinder contain strong magnetic field . - PET scan : Before PET scan , catheter ( small plastic tube ) insert arm vein wrist artery . The venous catheter use inject radioactive substance detect scanner , arterial catheter use collect blood sample scan . For scan , subject lie bed slide doughnut-shaped scanner . A mask place keep head still . A transmission scan do see much radiation skull absorbs . Radioactive water ( 15O-water ) inject blood , brain scan 10 minute measure brain blood flow . Then , radioactive DHA ( 11C-DHA ) inject , follow 1-1/2 hour scan measure DHA absorption brain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA , 22:6 n-3 ) essential omega-3 fatty acid selectively concentrate brain . Epidemiologic study suggest DHA deficiency relate affective disorder , clinical study suggest DHA efficacious treat depression . DHA also show important second messenger involve phospholipase A ( 2 ) -mediated signal transduction . Although animal study provide wealth knowledge role DHA neural function , method exists evaluate DHA content metabolism live human brain . Our goal establish quantitative method examine brain DHA metabolism use PET healthy human measure regional DHA incorporation plasma brain . Utilizing data pilot phase healthy volunteer , apply method study DHA metabolism alcoholic . Since alcohol consumption deplete brain DHA , hypothesize compare healthy volunteer ; alcoholic decrease rate incorporation DHA plasma brain . Utilizing method establish , anticipate find previously undetectable metabolic abnormality alcoholic . We may find abnormality correlate cognitive behavioral function . Now pilot phase protocol complete , proceed main phase protocol study non-smoking chronic alcoholic .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Age 1865 year . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Any Axis I diagnosis , current past . 2 . History intravenous drug use , DSM IV diagnosis drug use alcohol abuse dependence . 3 . Recent use ( within past two week ) alcohol , period extensive use , define average one standard drink per day twelvemonth period . 4 . Abnormal laboratory diagnostic test might disturb dependent measure study . 5 . Inability give clinical history inform consent . 6 . Inability follow dietary guideline . 7 . Serious medical problem require ongoing treatment ( i.e. , diabetes hypertension ) . 8 . Positive test hepatitis C human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . 9 . Metallic foreign body lodge head neck would affect MRI scanner magnet . 10 . Head trauma result period unconsciousness lasting longer one hour . 11 . History central nervous system infection . 12 . History fetal alcohol syndrome neurodevelopment disorder . 13 . History seizure , childhood relate fever . 14 . Nursing woman , woman positive pregnancy test woman childbearing age willing use form birth control study . 15 . Recent exposure radiation ( i.e. , PET research ) combine study would allowable limit exposure . 16 .
