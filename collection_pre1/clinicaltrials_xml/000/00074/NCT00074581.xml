	<detailed_description>Initiation antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) HIV infect population show dramatically reduce morbidity mortality HIV infection sustain reduction HIV viral replication . However , therapy cure HIV infection prevent spread virus . ART may , however , make HIV infected people less contagious lower plasma HIV-1 RNA level , compare people ART . This study seek determine whether initiate ART ART-naive , HIV infect people prevent sexual transmission HIV among HIV-discordant couple , well demonstrate whether quality life change initiation ART . Both opposite sex couple recruit study site Brazil , India , Malawi , Thailand , United States , Zimbabwe study . Participating couple enrol approximately 78 month ( 6.5 year ) . Couples randomly assign one two arm . HIV infect partner Arm 1 begin ART addition receive HIV primary care . HIV infect partner Arm 2 receive HIV primary care . When CD4 count participant reach 200 250 cells/mm3 , drop 200 cells/mm3 , develop AIDS-defining illness , initiate ART . All couple receive HIV counsel urine blood collect screen enrollment , select monthly , quarterly , yearly interval . They ask periodically report information adherence ART regimen .
