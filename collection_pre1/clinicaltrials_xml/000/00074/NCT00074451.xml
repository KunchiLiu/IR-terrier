	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Metabolic syndrome , characterize cluster multiple metabolic abnormality include abdominal obesity , dyslipidemia , hyperinsulinemia , hyperglycemia , hypertension , one important risk factor cardiovascular disease stroke . Genetics play significant role determine individual susceptibility metabolic syndrome inter-individual variation associate phenotype , though genetic factor remain largely unknown . The long-term goal identify metabolic syndrome susceptibility gene functional variant . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The goal research study underlie phenotypic structure metabolic syndrome systematically search genetic locus predispose metabolic syndrome use genome scan approach . The specific aim : ( 1 ) screen 10,000 sibling pair age 40 64 year Anqing , Anhui China , intermediate phenotype metabolic syndrome include body mass index , waist hip circumference , serum lipid profile ( triglyceride , HDL- , LDL- , total cholesterol ) , fast serum glucose insulin level , blood pressure ; ( 2 ) study underlie phenotypic structure metabolic syndrome 10,000 ascertain sibling pair use factor analysis ; ( 3 ) select genome scan 800 nuclear family pool ascertain sibling pair use Weber screening set 10 marker . Each select nuclear family contain `` proband '' &gt; =3 family member . The value three significant factor metabolic syndrome factor analysis ( see specific aim 2 ) use classify `` proband '' status subject . A `` proband '' define &gt; =2 3 factor value fall side 10/90 percentile tail correspond age- sex-adjusted population distribution ; ( 4 ) test linkage genome-scanned family intermediate phenotype factor metabolic syndrome use Unified Haseman-Elston method . In addition univariate test , linkage analysis perform use novel multivariate version Unified H-E method , recently propose show significantly powerful univariate test trait common genetic determinant ; ( 5 ) perform expansion replication linkage study loci identify genome scan 300-400 additional family &gt; =1 proband denser set marker .</detailed_description>
