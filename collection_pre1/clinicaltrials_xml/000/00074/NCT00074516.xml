	<brief_summary>This study test effectiveness combination anti-rejection medicine prevent complication typically see cystinosis patient undergo kidney transplant . Cystinosis rare disease affect child cause growth retardation kidney failure . Kidney transplant standard treatment kidney failure patient , follow immunosuppression prevent organ rejection . The standard drug regimen immunosuppression include steroid , lead serious complication . This study look combination therapy include steroid . Patients 7 year age old cystinosis candidate kidney transplant National Institutes Health Clinical Center may eligible 5-year study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood test . Participants undergo follow test procedure : 1 . Kidney transplant : Patients undergo kidney transplant surgery general anesthesia . 2 . Central line placement : A large intravenous catheter ( plastic tube , IV line ) place vein chest neck local anesthesia transplant surgery . The line remain place time hospitalization administer immunosuppressive medication , antibiotic , blood , need . The line also use collect blood sample . 3 . Leukapheresis : This procedure collect white blood cell do transplant . The cell study evaluate patient 's immune system . Whole blood withdrawn catheter arm vein central line direct machine separate blood component spin . The white cell remove red cell plasma return body . 4 . Immunosuppressive medication follow transplantation - Adults receive thymoglobulin time transplant 3 day surgery ; mycophenolate mofetil daily transplant ; tacrolimus twice day kidney work well ; sirolimus daily . - Children receive daclizumab day transplant , day 4 surgery , week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 11 , 15 , 19 , 23 , mycophenolate mofetil daily transplant . 5 . Follow-up visit : After discharge hospital , patient return Clinical Center follow-up 6 month , 1 year , yearly 5 year . A physical examination do first four visit , blood urine sample collect every visit . Kidney biopsy ( removal small amount kidney tissue thin needle ) do 6 month , 1 , 3 , 5 year transplant . The biopsied tissue examine evaluate well kidney respond immunosuppression medicine , determine whether less medication need , evaluate patient respond donor kidney . 6 . Routine laboratory test , coordinate patient 's local physician , do 2 3 time week first 2 3 month transplantation , weekly several month , least monthly life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Kidney Transplantation Patients With Cystinosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cystinosis autosomal recessive disorder due impaired cystine transport across lysosomal membrane , result abnormal cystine accumulation throughout body . Fanconi syndrome manifest first year life , end-stage renal failure occur ~10 year age , require dialysis kidney transplantation . Oral cysteamine therapy delay always prevent need renal allograft cystinosis , account ~3 % pediatric transplant United States . With improvement immunosuppression , short-term graft patient survival quite good cystinosis patient , although good patient ESRD due structural defect . Long-term graft survival affect non-renal complication cystinosis , persist renal transplantation . The aim study establish standard transplantation kidney patient nephropathic cystinosis use steroid-sparing immunosuppression . Our goal : 1 . Analyze long short term outcome cystinosis patient follow live cadaveric kidney transplantation use steroid-free immunosuppression ; 2 . Determine consistent clinical approach recipient cystinosis immediate post-operative period , specifically regard fluid electrolyte management , retention native kidney , time re-initiation cystinosis therapy transplantation ; 3 . Assess immunologic impact cystinosis monitoring immune response use number vitro assay . In study , patient receive live donor cadaveric kidney transplant steroid free immunosuppression . Graft function , histology graft patient survival measure . Progression cystinosis organ system monitor . Additional study graft include transcriptional analysis inflammatory immunologic mediator . Serum assay inflammatory mediator peripheral white blood cell assay immune function . This study represent first comprehensive , prospective analysis kidney transplantation patient cystinosis .</detailed_description>
