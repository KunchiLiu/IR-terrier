	<brief_summary>Subject 's asked take part study type cancer spread meninges ( tissue cover brain spinal cord ) . There known effective treatment specific disease subject receive treatment know work specific disease without success . Currently , effective treatment type cancer . The purpose study : - determine high dose gemcitabine , anti-cancer drug , safely give directly spinal fluid child adult whose cancer long respond standard treatment ; - find effect ( good bad ) gemcitabine give directly cerebrospinal fluid ( call intrathecal administration ) child adult neoplastic meningitis ( cancer spread line brain spinal cord ) ; - determine gemcitabine beneficial patient ; - understand gemcitabine handle body intrathecal administration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intrathecal Gemcitabine Treat Neoplastic Meningitis , IT Gemcitabine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE STUDY ? Before participate study , screen process . Administration : Gemcitabine receive directly cerebrospinal fluid ( fluid circulates around brain spinal cord ) Ommaya reservoir ( similar type reservoir ) . An Ommaya reservoir surgically implanted catheter use inject medication withdraw cerebrospinal fluid fluid chamber head . All patient hospitalize overnight follow first dose gemcitabine . If first dose well tolerate , dose gemcitabine administer outpatient clinic close observation minimum 2 hour administration . Weeks 1-6 Cohort 1a ( first three patient ) : Gemcitabine give week 6 week . Patients may continue therapy disease worsen . Weeks 1-6 ( patient enrol study ) : Gemcitabine give twice week 6 week . Patients may continue therapy disease worsen . Weeks 7-12 : Gemcitabine give week 6 week . Weeks 13-29 ( approximately ) : Gemcitabine give twice monthly 4 month . Weeks 30-52 ( approximately ) : Gemcitabine give monthly duration study . For safety reason , first patient treat study receive low dose gemcitabine . If dose cause severe side effect , next group receive high dose gemcitabine give earlier group , may receive low dose side effect occur . In addition , first three patient treat study receive gemcitabine weekly . If tolerate , subsequent patient receive medication twice weekly . Following first dose gemcitabine investigator would like draw special blood spinal fluid sample help learn much drug blood spinal fluid . These study call pharmacokinetics . A total 10 sample collect . The blood sample may collect intravenous catheter central venous catheter . The spinal fluid sample may collect either via Ommaya reservoir lumbar reservoir . In addition intrathecal gemcitabine , patient may receive chemotherapy , give directly fluid surround brain spine , recommend doctor treatment prevention cancer outside line brain spinal cord . The maximum length treatment gemcitabine one year . However , end study , monthly check-ups require monitor disease make sure side effect study drug stop .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>least 3 year age . Neoplastic meningitis secondary underlying leukemia/lymphoma solid tumor ( include primary CNS tumor carcinomas unknown primary site ) conventional therapy . Patients CNS leukemia/lymphoma must refractory conventional therapy , include XRT ( i.e . 2nd great relapse ) . Neoplastic meningitis define follow : Leukemia/Lymphoma : CSF cell count &gt; 5 uL AND evidence blast cell cytospin preparation cytology . Solid tumor : Presence tumor cell cytospin preparation cytology OR presence meningeal disease MRI scan . Life expectancy least 6 week . Patients &gt; 10 year old : Karnofsky performance status &gt; /= 50 % . Patients &lt; /=10 year old : Lansky performance status &gt; /= 50 % . Must recover acute neurotoxic effect prior chemo , immuno , radiotherapy must without uncontrolled significant systemic illness ( e.g . infection ) . Must receive systemic CNSdirected therapy within 3 week craniospinal irradiation within 8 week prior start treatment study . Must receive intrathecal therapy within 1 week prior start treatment study . Must platelet count &gt; 40,000/uL HCT &gt; 30 % ANC &gt; 1000/uL . Must adequate liver function , total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg , SGPT &lt; 5 time upper limit normal ; adequate renal function ( serum creatinine &lt; 2 time upper limit normal age ) . Patients must willing intraventricular access device Ommaya reservoir . Patients receive therapy ( either intrathecal systemic ) design treat leptomeningeal disease . However , patient receive concomitant chemotherapy control systemic disease bulk CNS disease eligible , provide systemic chemotherapy phase I agent , agent significantly penetrate CSF , agent know serious unpredictable CNS side effect . Nuclear Medicine CSF flow study require within 2 week prior study entry solid tumor patient . In leukemia/lymphoma patient CSF flow study require CSF analysis MRI suggest blockage CSF flow . Patients clinical evidence obstructive hydrocephalus eligible protocol . Nor patient compartmentalization CSF flow document radioisotope Indium111 Technetium99DTPA flow eligible protocol . If CSF flow block compartmentalization demonstrate , focal radiotherapy site block restore flow follow repeat CSF flow study demonstrate clear blockage require patient eligible study . Patients must clinically significant abnormality serum electrolyte , include calcium , magnesium , phosphorus . Patients ventriculoperitoneal ( VP ) ventriculoatrial ( VA ) shunt eligible unless shuntindependent evidence shunt nonfunctional Patients leukemia/lymphoma concomitant bone marrow relapse . Women childbearing age must pregnant lactating . ( Male female patient fertile must willing use effective mean birth control avoid pregnancy . ) Must free uncontrolled infection except HIV ( i.e. , AIDSrelated lymphomatous meningitis ) . Must NOT receive investigational agent must receive investigational agent within 14 day prior study treatment . The 14day period extend investigational agent know delayed toxicity . Patients impend spinal cord compression , CNS involvement require local XRT ( e.g . optic nerve ) , isolated bulky ventricular leptomeningeal base lesion eligible . Concomitant CNS radiation therapy permit . ( Patients permit receive radiation port encompass part brain spine study . ) Patients may receive radiation therapy extraCNS site , e.g . painful bone metastases craniospinal axis .</criteria>
