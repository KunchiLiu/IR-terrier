	<brief_title>CC-8490 Treating Patients With Recurrent Refractory High-Grade Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine maximum tolerate dose CC-8490 patient recurrent refractory high-grade glioma . - Determine , preliminarily , toxic effect drug patient . - Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . Secondary - Determine , preliminarily , potential anti-glioma activity drug patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive oral CC-8490 daily day 1 3-28 ( course 1 ) . Beginning course 2 subsequent course , patient receive oral CC-8490 daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos CC-8490 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Once MTD determine , total 10 patient treat dose . Patients follow within 2 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 34 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
