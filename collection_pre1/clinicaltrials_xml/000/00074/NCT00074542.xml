	<brief_title>An Efficacy Safety Study Omega-3 Free Fatty Acids ( Epanova™ ) Maintenance Symptomatic Remission Subjects With Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Crohn 's disease chronic inflammatory disorder frequently involve colon small bowel . Patients commonly experience abdominal pain , diarrhea , malaise result decrease quality life increase risk chronic disability unemployment . Currently available therapeutic option maintenance remission Crohn 's disease inadequate . Patients ' quality life often severely diminish . A clear need exist well-tolerated drug reliably reduce risk disease relapse . In recent year considerable attention focus dietary marine fish oil mean treat several chronic inflammatory disorder include Crohn 's disease . Fish oil find reduce inflammation severity lesion animal model inflammatory bowel disease . Commercially available fish oil supply fatty acid triglyceride ethyl ester often associate unpleasant side effect nausea , flatulence , diarrhea belching . These adverse effect limit administration high dos preparation . Several study demonstrate superior absorption across intestinal membrane free fatty acid comparison triglyceride ethyl ester . Epanova™ develop well-tolerated mean deliver high concentration marine fish oil free fatty acid . Additionally , gelatin coating capsule consist permeable polymer result delay release active compound thus reduce frequency adverse event . The objective clinical trial follow : Primary Objective : - To assess ability Epanova™ maintain symptomatic remission subject Crohn 's Disease respond steroid induction therapy Secondary objective : - To assess safety tolerability Epanova™ - To assess ability Epanova™ maintain quality life subject Crohn ’ Disease respond steroid induction therapy - To assess efficacy Epanova™ Crohn ’ Disease Activity Index ( CDAI ) , Investigator Subject Global Ratings , employment status use Crohn ’ Disease relate medical visit subject Crohn ’ Disease respond steroid induction therapy</detailed_description>
