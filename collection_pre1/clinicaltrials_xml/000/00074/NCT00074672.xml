	<brief_summary>This study explore occurs sensory motor system restless legs syndrome ( RLS ) . Patients RLS uncomfortable sensation leg , usually even early part night . Most patient also periodic involuntary leg movement . The condition tend worsen time , result severe discomfort sleep disturbance . Healthy normal volunteer patient RLS 18 80 year age may eligible study . All candidate screen medical history , physical neurological evaluation , electroymogram ( measure muscle activity ) , overnight sleep study , electrocardiogram ( ECG , measurement electrical activity heart ) , blood urine test . They may also brain spine magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) computerize tomography ( CT ) scan chest X-ray . Participants must stop take medication prohibit study 2 day study start throughout duration . Participants undergo prepulse inhibition test assess nervous system function . The participant sits comfortably quiet room . Several cable attach face leg use special cream conduct electrical signal cable record equipment . Nervous system activity evaluate subject rest sensory stimulation ( stimulating nerve legs face brief electrical current mild moderate intensity ) . At time , subject receive short , mild sound stimulation deliver earphone . The test session take 4 6 hour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background - Restless leg syndrome ( RLS ) , condition affect million Americans , characterize uncomfortable sensory symptom relive voluntary involuntary movement . Objectives -To test hypothesis sensorimotor gate deficient RLS . Methods - In control proof-of-principle clinical study , sensorimotor gate assess use validated electrophysiological test prepulse inhibition , 17 adult patient RLS 17 match healthy control . Risks benefit -Risks involve study minimal , deem reasonable relation potential benefit . This investigation lead good understand pathophysiology RLS .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects meet follow inclusion criterion screen eligible participate study : 1 . Male female subject age 18 80 . 2 . For patient , diagnose primary RLS base presence characteristic clinical history IRLSSG diagnostic criterion . 3 . Normal physical neurological examination . 4 . Subject willing adhere protocol requirement evidence write , informed consent . 5 . No clinically significant abnormality clinical chemistry hematology examination prestudy medical evaluation . 6 . Negative prestudy urine drug screen . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects meet follow exclusion criterion enrol immediately exclude study , appropriate : 1 . History medical condition reasonably expect compromise scientific integrity study ; 2 . Patient unwilling unable stop usual mediation RLS ; 3 . Subjects unable unwilling discontinue prohibit concomitant medication 4 . Subjects unwilling sign inform consent comply protocol requirement . 5 . Subjects clinical and/or biological evidence secondary RLS ( e.g . renal failure ( endstage renal disease ) , iron deficient , anaemia pregnancy baseline ) .</criteria>
