	<brief_summary>Pompe disease ( also know glycogen storage disease Type II ) cause deficiency critical enzyme body call acid alpha-glucosidase ( GAA ) . Normally , GAA use body 's cell break glycogen ( stored form sugar ) within specialized structure call lysosome . In patient Pompe disease , excessive amount glycogen accumulates store various tissue , especially heart skeletal muscle , prevents normal function . The objective protocol provide enzyme replacement therapy rhGAA expand access basis , severely affected patient infantile-onset Pompe disease alternative treatment meet clinical characteristic describe inclusion criterion participation Genzyme Corporation-sponsored study currently enrol patient infantile-onset Pompe disease .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The patient patient 's legal guardian ( ) must provide write informed consent prior studyrelated procedure perform ; The patient must diagnosis infantileonset Pompe disease define : ) The patient has/had onset symptom compatible Pompe disease 12 month age adjust gestation , necessary . Age onset symptom must document patient 's medical record ( ) . AND b ) The patient document GAA deficiency , i.e. , laboratorydefined cutoff value determine laboratory perform GAA enzyme activity assay . Tissues use determination GAA deficiency may include blood , muscle skin fibroblast . Patients less equal 6 month age must one following : ) Cardiomyopathy , define LVMI determine crosssectional echocardiography ; OR b ) requirement invasive noninvasive ventilatory support , noninvasive ventilation define form ventilatory support apply without use endotracheal tube . Patients great 6 month age must 2 follow : ) Cardiomyopathy , define LVMI determine crosssectional echocardiography ; b ) requirement invasive noninvasive ventilatory support , noninvasive ventilation define form ventilatory support apply without use endotracheal tube ; OR c ) Severe motor delay , defined failure perform gross motor skill achieve 90 % normal age peer Denver Developmental Assessment ; The patient his/her legal guardian ( ) must ability comply clinical protocol .
