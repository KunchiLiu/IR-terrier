	<brief_title>Dobutamine Echocardiography In Patients With Ischemic Heart Failure Evaluated Revascularization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The number individual present coronary artery disease ( CAD ) impair left ventricular ( LV ) function ( measure ejection fraction { EF } &lt; 35 % ) , clinical evidence heart failure ( HF ) continue increase . Patients condition face need continuous intensive medical management poor quality life . The STICH trial design compare medical management surgical revascularization patient . STICH 's design include myocardial function determination several method . The timely important question myocardial viability function poor examine use radionuclide method . However , consensus best technique determine myocardial viability , data support assessment potential determinant prognosis follow surgery . DECIPHER STICH add dobutamine echocardiography ( DE ) myocardial viability measurement parent trial . The study significance address important question add data technique bear approximately half cost radionuclide method . Furthermore , revise design allow randomize blinded evaluation different treatment modality accord myocardial viability determine two different technique . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The Dobutamine Echocardiography Patients Ischemic Heart failure Evaluated Revascularization Study , part Surgical Treatment Ischemic Heart Failure Trial ( DECIPHER-STICH ) , design address hypothesis assessment myocardial viability dobutamine echocardiography ( DE ) patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , leave ventricular ( LV ) dysfunction heart failure ( HF ) identify patient derive great survival benefit surgical revascularization medical therapy . In addition , study determine value DE prediction recovery LV function follow revascularization , clinical value DE relative radionuclide technique use purpose , relationship abnormal LV size shape contractile reserve dysfunctional myocardium . DECIPHER-STICH ancillary study large-scale STICH trial , multicenter international randomize study design define role coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) surgical ventricular restoration ( SVR ) treatment HF patient CAD LV dysfunction . In previous study , DE compare favorably method detection viable myocardium . The widespread availability echocardiography possibility simultaneously derive information structural abnormality ( e.g. , thrombus ) , valve function , intracardiac pressure addition real-time assessment regional global systolic function make DE particularly useful comprehensive evaluation CAD patient LV dysfunction . Because patient STICH trial also undergo radionuclide test , DECIPHER-STICH study allow comparison commonly use technique assessment myocardial viability . Patients recruit STICH trial invite participate DECIPHER-STICH study ask sign separate consent form prior randomized assignment therapy . Forty center North America Europe recruit patient STICH trial agree take part DECIPHER-STICH study . A total 1,450 2,800 patient enrol STICH trial undergo DE prior treatment . DECIPHER-STICH address hypothesis great beneficial effect coronary artery bypass surgery ( CABG ) medical therapy alone 3-year survival rate 80 % power detect 25 % -to-12.5 % reduction all-cause mortality patient viable myocardium . In addition , study &gt; 99 % power address three important secondary hypothesis . The result study provide definitive information regard value assess myocardial viability DE significant clinical implication selection patient CAD , LV dysfunction , HF likely benefit surgical revascularization .</detailed_description>
