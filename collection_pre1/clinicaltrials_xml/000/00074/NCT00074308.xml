	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Advanced Melanoma Other Advanced Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine tolerability , maximum tolerate dose , low biologically active dose imatinib mesylate bevacizumab patient advance melanoma advance cancer . II . Determine response rate , time progression , survival patient treat regimen . III . Correlate clinical activity inhibition platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor , flt-1 , marker angiogenesis patient treated regimen . IV . Correlate clinical activity alteration tumor perfusion assess dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI Doppler ultrasound patient treated regimen . V. Correlate toxicity , clinical activity , correlative endpoint steady-stage plasma concentration imatinib mesylate patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , open-label study . PHASE I ( close accrual 8/23/04 ) : Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily day 1-28 bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 14 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos imatinib mesylate bevacizumab maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . PHASE II : Patients receive imatinib mesylate bevacizumab phase I MTD .</detailed_description>
