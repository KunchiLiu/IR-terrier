	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine , carboplatin , docetaxel , use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining one drug may kill tumor cell . It yet know treatment regimen effective stage IIIB stage IV non-small cell lung cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness gemcitabine carboplatin follow immediately docetaxel give delay docetaxel treat patient stage IIIB stage IV non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Carboplatin Followed By Docetaxel Treating Patients With Stage IIIB Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare overall survival patient stage IIIB IV non-small cell lung cancer treat gemcitabine carboplatin follow immediate v delay docetaxel . Secondary - Compare response rate time progression patient treat regimen . - Compare toxicity regimens patient . - Compare quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize study . Patients stratify accord ECOG performance status ( 0 1 v 2 ) . All patient receive gemcitabine IV 30-60 minute day 1 8 carboplatin IV 30-60 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable respond disease proceed docetaxel therapy . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I ( immediate docetaxel ) : Patients receive immediate docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 . - Arm II ( delay docetaxel ) : Patients observe first evidence disease progression receive docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 . In arm , treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life ( QOL ) assess baseline , restaging ( completion gemcitabine carboplatin ) , course 2-6 docetaxel* , 1 3 month study treatment . NOTE : *For patient randomize delayed docetaxel , QOL assess every 3 week first disease progression course 2-6 docetaxel Patients follow monthly 3 month , every 2 month 6 month , every 3 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 550 patient ( 275 per treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
