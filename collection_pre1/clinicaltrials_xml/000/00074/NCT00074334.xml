	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : The TP-38 toxin locate tumor cell kill without harm normal cell . Giving TP-38 toxin directly tumor may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose TP-38 toxin administer directly brain see well work treat young patient recurrent progressive supratentorial high-grade glioma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TP-38 Toxin Treating Young Patients With Recurrent Progressive Supratentorial High-Grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Phase I - Determine maximum safe volume rate maximum tolerate infusion concentration TGFa-PE38 toxin ( TP-38 ) infuse 2 3 catheter pediatric patient recurrent progressive supratentorial high-grade glioma . - Describe toxic effect drug patient . - Phase II - Estimate efficacy drug , term post-infusion survival , patient . Secondary - Phase I II - Determine prevalence epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) expression phosphorylation ( activity ) patient treat drug . - Correlate EGFR expression qualitative measure ( e.g. , histology , grade , tumor characteristic ) tumor response , survival , progression-free survival patient treated drug . - Phase II Only - Estimate objective response rate patient treat drug . - Estimate progression-free survival patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients phase I portion study stratify accord number successfully place catheter ( 3 catheter vs 2 catheter ) . Patients phase II portion study stratify accord time recurrence high-grade glioma ( first v second great ) surgery extent ( surgical resection v stereotactic biopsy ) first recurrence . - Phase I : Patients undergo stereotactic biopsy resection tumor follow intratumoral ( tumor bed ) catheter placement treatment infusion . Within 12-48 hour intratumoral ( tumor bed ) catheter placement , patient receive TGFa-PE38 toxin ( TP-38 ) intratumorally 2 3 catheter 33 124 hour . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient ( stratum ) receive escalate volume maximum safe volume ( MSV ) determine . Cohorts 3-6 patient ( stratum ) receive escalate concentration MSV maximum tolerate infusion concentration ( MTIC ) determine . The MSV MTIC define volume concentration precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . - Phase II : Patients receive treatment phase I MSV MTIC . Phase I patient follow post catheter placement , daily TP-38 infusion , 30 day , every 2 month 1 year . Phase II patient follow additional year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 6-105 patient ( 6-60 phase I 45 phase II ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
