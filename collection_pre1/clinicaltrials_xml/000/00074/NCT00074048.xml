	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : The BL22 immunotoxin locate tumor cell kill without harm normal cell . This may effective treatment hairy cell leukemia respond treatment cladribine . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study BL22 immunotoxin see well work treat patient previously treat cladribine hairy cell leukemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BL22 Immunotoxin Treating Patients Previously Treated With Cladribine Hairy Cell Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine response rate patient cladribine-resistant hairy cell leukemia treat BL22 immunotoxin . Secondary - Determine response duration patient treat drug . - Determine safety drug patient . - Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . - Correlate BL22 blood level toxicity drug development neutralize antibody patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive BL22 immunotoxin IV 30 minute day 1 , 3 , 5 follow rest . Patients evaluate 8 week . Patients achieve complete hematologic remission follow . All patient continue receive BL22 immunotoxin day 1 , 3 , 5 . Treatment repeat every 4 week total 16 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve CR without minimal residual disease ( MRD ) receive 2 course beyond CR . Patients achieve CR MRD receive 4 course beyond CR . Patients follow every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 36 patient accrue study within 3 year .</detailed_description>
