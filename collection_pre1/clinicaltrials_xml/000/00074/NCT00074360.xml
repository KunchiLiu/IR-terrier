	<brief_summary>This study divide two part ; design answer separate related question : Which brain region activate human reward property ethanol administration ? Is possible demonstrate condition response stimulus pair rise blood alcohol concentration ( BAC ) humans response observe brain use functional magnetic resonance image ( fMRI ) technique ? Part 1 . In order determine brain region activate reward property ethanol administration , propose use Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent ( BOLD ) fMRI technique test hypothesis time rise peak BAC , mesolimbic , mesocortical , nigrostriatal dopamine ( DA ) terminal area brain show significant increase cerebral blood flow . Healthy , non-alcoholic subject give intravenous ( IV ) ethanol placebo infusion separate day . The infusion three phase . On day , first phase saline infusion use measure basal brain blood flow . The second phase ethanol infusion deliver rate calculate produce BAC 0.08 plus minus 0.005 g/dl 10 minute . The rate infusion next 10 minute ( third phase ) calculate maintain BAC target level 0.08 plus minus 0.005 g/dl duration infusion . On placebo day , subject receive saline infusion set rate phase two three use ethanol infusion . Continuous multi-slice fMRI data collect infusion . Part 2 . In order investigate condition response ethanol , three group healthy , non-alcoholic subject give series IV infusion separate day . The experimental group receive ethanol infusion pair conditioned stimulus ( CS ) present BAC rise . One control group ( I ) healthy , non-alcoholic subject also give series intravenous ethanol infusion separate day , infusion pair CS . The control group ( II ) give saline infusion CS presentation . After three training session , three group undergo fMRI scan CS pair saline infusion . This allow response CS alone observe . After 10 minute CS presentation , ethanol infusion begin continue another 15 minute . Conditioned response ( CR ) demonstrate experimental group show great increase BOLD signal control group motivation area mesolimbic , mesocortical , nigrostriatal dopamine ( DA ) terminal area brain response CS receive saline infusion . Control group II also undergo fMRI scan give saline infusion follow ethanol infusion last 15 minute scanner control non-specific effect repeat infusion &amp; scan BOLD response ethanol . If able produce CR brain region associated motivation , may possible use CR experimental model human alcohol craving .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study design answer four question : 1 . Which brain region activate human reward property ethanol administration ? 2 . How ethanol administration affect brain response visual cue know evoke positive negative emotion ? 3 . Do individual regularly drink ethanol large amount ( heavy drinker ) differ individual regularly drink large amount ethanol ( social drinker ) ethanol affect brain function ? 4 . Does ethanol administration affect brain region activate risk-taking task social drinker heavy drinker ? In order determine brain region activate reward property ethanol administration , propose use Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent ( BOLD ) fMRI technique test hypothesis time rise peak BAC , mesolimbic , mesocortical , nigrostriatal dopamine ( DA ) terminal area brain show significant increase cerebral blood flow . Healthy , subject seek treatment alcohol use disorder give intravenous ( IV ) ethanol placebo infusion separate day . An ethanol infusion deliver rate calculate produce BAC 0.08 plus minus . An ethanol infusion deliver rate calculate produce BAC 0.08 plus minus 0.005 g/dl 15 minute . Then rate infusion adjust next 30 minute ( second phase ) BAC maintain target level 0.08 0.005 g/dl . On placebo day , subject receive saline infusion set rate use ethanol infusion . Continuous multi-slice fMRI data collect infusion . During infusion , BOLD response visual stimulus design evoke emotion also examine . In addition , compare BOLD response healthy social drinker healthy heavy drinker . We also compare BOLD response elicit risk-taking ethanol infusion placebo infusion social heavy drinker .</detailed_description>
