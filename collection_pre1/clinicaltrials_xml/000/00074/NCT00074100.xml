	<brief_title>Amonafide Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer That Has Progressed After Previous Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine time progression woman metastatic breast cancer progress prior chemotherapy treat amonafide . - Determine overall response rate ( complete partial response ) patient treat drug . - Determine safety phenotypically driven dose regimen drug patient . Secondary - Determine time tumor response , duration response , time treatment failure patient treat drug . - Determine overall survival patient treated drug . - Determine pharmacokinetic profile drug patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive amonafide IV 1 hour day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day least 5 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable respond disease may receive additional course ( beyond 5 course ) investigator 's discretion . Patients follow 30 day every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 175 patient accrue study within 1 year .</detailed_description>
