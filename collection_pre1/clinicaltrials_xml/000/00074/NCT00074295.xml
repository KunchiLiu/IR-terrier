	<brief_title>S0310 : Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Stage IIIB Stage IV Bronchoalveolar Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine progression-free overall survival patient select stage IIIB stage IV bronchoalveolar carcinoma treat GVAX lung cancer vaccine . - Determine response rate ( confirm unconfirmed complete partial ) patient treat vaccine . - Determine frequency severity toxic effect vaccine patient . - Determine functional status patient treat vaccine . - Correlate systemic biologic activity ( i.e. , antigen-specific antitumor systemic cytokine response ) clinical outcome patient treat vaccine . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior systemic cancer therapy bronchoalveolar carcinoma ( BAC ) ( yes v ) pattern BAC ( diffuse v nodular ) . After successful vaccine manufacturing tumor tissue procure , patient receive GVAX lung cancer vaccine intradermally ( ID ) ( 6-7 injection per vaccination ) week 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 total 5 vaccination . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline week 9 , 13 , 21 . Patients follow 4 week , every 8 week 1 year , every 12 week 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 117 patient ( 67 previously untreated 50 previously treat ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
