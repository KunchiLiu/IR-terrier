	<detailed_description>Scleroderma refers group diseases involve abnormal growth connective tissue , support skin internal organ . Scleroderma affect skin , make hard tight ; also damage blood vessel internal organ heart , lung , kidney . Estimates number people United States systemic ( body-wide ) form scleroderma range 40,000 165,000 . The number people scleroderma-related disorder 250,000 992,500 . Researchers believe several factor interact produce scleroderma , include abnormal immune activity , potential environmental trigger , genetic makeup . Scleroderma pass parent child , certain gene may make person likely develop disease . The goal project identify gene influence disease susceptibility expression systemic scleroderma establish repository DNA , plasma , serum sample single case scleroderma family , multicase family , healthy unrelated volunteer use researcher interested study disease . Participants Registry phone interview regard disease characteristic family history . Participants send blood kit get blood sample drawn locally shipment Registry lab . Blood sample make available ( anonymously ) study researcher around country . In case , participant ask sign release medical information medical record obtain verify diagnosis . As May 2009 , study longer enrol family member .</detailed_description>
