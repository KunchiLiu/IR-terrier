	<brief_summary>The primary objective determine tolerability safety , day 0 210 , escalate dos rPA either without Alhydrogel ( adjuvant ; use increase action principle drug ) give two-dose , intramuscular regimen health adult . The secondary objective evaluate antibody responses rPA , day 0 210 , follow one four escalating dos vaccine give without Alhydrogel give two-dose series healthy adult , compare immune response follow rPA follow BioThrax ( tm ) give either intramuscular SQ route . The tertiary objective describe antibody kinetics follow vaccination . This information use determine probable optimal dose rPA and/or Alhydrogel safe , well tolerate , maximally immunogenic use future phase II trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anthrax-rPA : Safety , Tolerability , Immunogenicity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I , Dose-Escalating clinical study design examine immunologic response rPA presence absence Alhydrogel 2 low dose level . The study investigate whether use aluminum-based adjuvant result increase magnitude duration antibody response , thus provide information necessity aluminum-based adjuvant formulation use phase II clinical trial . The rationale use BioThrax two administration route trial allow preliminary comparison immune response follow currently available vaccine response follow new recombinant product . Approximately 80 outpatient community volunteer Baltimore-Washington area age 18-40 year recruit basis good health , express interest study , availability follow-up determine preliminary interview . Each eligible subject enrol 1 4 study group , three arm , 7 month . The subject ' randomly assign double-masked Arms A B 30 day screen period receive two dos IM rPA IM rPA+Alhydrogel IM BioThrax one month apart , follow day 1 , 2 , 7 , 14 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 35 , 42 , 120 , 210 . The subject randomly assign , unmasked , arm 1-C 2-C receive 3 dos SQ BioThrax 14 day interval follow day 1 , 2 , 7 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 21 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 35 , 42 , 120 210 . The information gather study objective use determine probable optimal dos rPA +/- Alhydrogel safe , well tolerate , maximally immunogenic use future phase II trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 18 40 year , inclusive . Good health evidence screen evaluation within 30 day prior immunization . Expressed interest availability fulfill study requirement . Signed , informed consent : screening , HIV antibody test , store specimen , HIPAA authorization , protocolspecific consent . Agreement avoid pregnancy 30 day follow vaccination use highly effective birth control method . A highly effective birth control method define one result failure rate le 1 % per year use consistently correctly . These method include tubal ligation , implant , injectables , combine oral contraceptive , IUD 's ( All commonly use copper hormone implant IUD 's US highly effective include follow type : TCu380A , TCu220C , MLCu375 , NovaT , LNG20 . The less effective IUD 's include Lippes loop stainless steel ring ) , sexual abstinence , vasectomized partner . Agreement refrain take experimental drug vaccine day 30 day 90 . History follow medical illness : Diabetes mellitus , Cancer , Heart disease ( include hospitalization heart attack , arrhythmia , syncope ) , Unconsciousness ( single brief concussion ) , Seizures ( simple benign febrile seizure childhood ) , Gastrointestinal disease ( include inflammatory bowel disease , celiac disease , ulcer ) , Recurrent arthritis , Immunodeficiency , Autoimmune disease ( include Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ) , Any current illness require daily medication ( vitamin , contraceptive , topical medication ) , Other condition opinion investigator would jeopardize safety subject evaluation study objective . Abnormal physical finding include , limited , follow : Cardiac murmur ( functional murmur ) , Focal neurologic deficit , Hepatomegaly splenomegaly , Lymphadenopathy , Jaundice , Hypertension ( BP &gt; 150/90 2 separate day ) , Body mass index 35 19 . Body mass index , BMI , measure weight correct height ( weight kg/ [ height meter ] ( second power ) ) . Expected BMI range 22 24 . Morbid obesity define BMI great 44 , BMI 18 may associate anorexia . Other physical finding opinion investigator would jeopardize safety subject evaluation study objective . A psychiatric condition , include schizophrenia , personality , anxiety , affective disorder , opinion investigator could compromise subject 's ability participate trial . Known hypersensitivity component vaccine . Current drug alcohol dependence evidence fourquestion screen interview determine whether subject medical , occupational , family problem related alcohol illicit drug use past 12 month . These question derive Drug Abuse Screening Test ( DAST10 ) develop Addiction Research Foundation recommend National Institute Drug abuse tool family physicians wish routinely screen new patient drug abuse ( http : //www.nida.nih.gov/DiagnosisTreatment/Diagnosis5.html ) . History receipt anthrax vaccine history diagnosis exposure form anthrax . Member Armed Forces deploy Desert Storm/Desert Shield station Korea Southwest Asia since 1990 , give possibility previous receipt license anthrax vaccine . Positive urine pregnancy test within 24 hour prior vaccination . Positive blood test HIV , hepatitus B surface antigen hepatitus C antibody , syphilis ( define positive RPR FTA ) . Failure pas write exam . Employment industry involve contact large ruminant animal , work slaughter house , handle raw animal hide raw wool , veterinary science involve ruminant animal , others exposure B. anthracis may occur . Screening laboratory value fall outside normal range delineate Appendix 3 . Receipt experimental vaccine medication within 30 day prior receipt study vaccine . Receipt live , attenuated vaccine within 60 day prior receipt study vaccine . Receipt subunit kill vaccine within 14 day prior receipt study vaccine . Receipt blood product , include immunoglobulin , 90 day prior receipt study vaccine . Anything , opinion investigator , compromise participation subject respect his/her right risk . Oral temperature &gt; 37.7 C acute illness occur prior inoculation day vaccination . ( This lead postponement enrollment , exclusion trial ) .</criteria>
