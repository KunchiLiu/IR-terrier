	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect erlotinib see well work treat patient metastatic unresectable non-small cell lung cancer , ovarian cancer , squamous cell carcinoma ( cancer ) head neck . Erlotinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary growth</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib Treating Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer , Ovarian Cancer , Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine significant correlation exist length CA dinucleotide repeat polymorphism EGFR gene observe toxicity patient treat OSI-774 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To study pharmacodynamic effect OSI-774 EGFR activity MAP kinase signal use skin surrogate tissue . II . To determine interindividual variation OSI-774 pharmacokinetics relate previously describe CYP3A5 genetic polymorphism . III . To evaluate whether toxicity inhibition EGFR phosphorylation correlate OSI-774 AUC patient treat OSI-774 . IV . To describe observed anti-tumor response toxicity patient advance solid tumor treat single agent fix dose OSI-774 . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord length CA dinucleotide repeat polymorphism ( short v medium v long ) . Patients receive oral erlotinib day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
