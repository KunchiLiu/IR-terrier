	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study find risk spread vaccine virus , vaccinia , smallpox vaccination site different type bandage use cover site . The study also look bandage type affect heal sore . Study participant include healthy individual , 18-50 year old , previously receive smallpox vaccine healthy individual , 18-50 year old , receive previous smallpox vaccine . All participant receive smallpox vaccine randomly assign 1 3 different bandage group cover vaccine site : standard gauze dress attached paper tape , Opsite gauze-impregnanted occlusive dressing ( attached paper tape waterproof ) , Allevyn hydropolymer dressing ( self-adhesive highly absorbent ) . Volunteers involve study related procedure 252 day .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study investigate potential secondary transmission vaccinia smallpox vaccination site cover various type dressing , well effect dress type heal vaccination lesion . The result could great implication infection control public health wake potential mass smallpox vaccination . The study population consist two cohort : healthy individual naive smallpox vaccine ( `` naive group '' ) healthy individual previous vaccination smallpox vaccine ( `` experience group '' ) . Individuals group vaccinate dose smallpox vaccine dilute 1:5 randomized receive one three dress preparation cover vaccination site : standard 2 inch x 2 inch gauze attach skin via paper tape ( `` Gauze dressing '' ) ; Opsite gauze-impregnated occlusive dressing ( `` occlusive dressing '' ) ; Allevyn hydropolymer dressing ( Smith Nephew , `` hydropolymer dressing '' ) . In addition , 30 108 subject ( 15 naïve 15 experience ) enrol `` cardiac subgroup '' additional blood drawn assessment specific biochemical marker related thrombosis platelet activation ( specifically , plasminogen-activator inhibitor type 1 ( PAI-1 ) soluble CD40 ligand ( sCD40L ) . The primary study objective assessment infectivity vaccination sit via evaluation vaccinia growth specimens outer dress bandage type . Positive culture reflect failure bandage prevent possible spread vaccinia . Secondary study objective include follow : assessment infectivity vaccination sit via evaluation vaccinia growth specimen hand contralateral vaccine site dress type ; comparison rate lesion healing ( time vaccination lesion deem `` well-healed '' ) dress cohort ; association adverse event ( AEs ) involve transmission vaccinia , autoinoculation secondary dissemination , type dress cover vaccination site ; determination alteration smallpox vaccination body 's endogenous fibrinolytic system investigate potential pathophysiology adverse ischemic cardiac event see vaccinated subject recent civilian military campaign . The tertiary objective study include : assessment overall safety profile cohort , determine reactogenicity vaccine development expect unexpected AEs unrelated dress type ; assessment efficacy 1:5 dilution APSV vaccinia-experienced adult measure proportion individual respond vaccination `` take : 6-11 day vaccination ; characterization humoral immune response generate follow vaccination cohort ; assessment pharyngeal carriage shed vaccinia virus cohort vaccinate volunteer ; assessment tolerability dress total number bandage change determine volunteer questionnaire summarize bandage type . Volunteers follow 56 day follow primary vaccination . Volunteers `` take '' offer revaccination separate protocol 56-day blood sample drawn . All volunteer contact telephone information serious adverse event 180 day primary vaccination .</detailed_description>
