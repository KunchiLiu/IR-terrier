	<brief_summary>Despite advance medical gene therapy , orthotopic liver transplantation remain definitive therapeutic option child end-stage liver disease . Recent advance pre- , intra- , early post-transplant care result dramatic improvement survival pediatric liver transplant patient . The broad long-range goal research program direct enhance patient 's long-term survival . Our primary focus relate obligate life-long immunosuppression , inherent complication include severe infection development cancer . These two complication come together single disease , Epstein-Barr Virus ( EBV ) - associate post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder ( PTLD ) . EBV , latent human lymphotrophic herpes virus infect immortalizes B cell . Primary infection usually occur via salivary exchange result mild , self-limited illness follow life-long EBV-specific T cell control EBV latency . T cell-based immunosuppression prevents allograft rejection , however , also suppress cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) function , generate environment EBV-infected cell proliferate . Patients receive life-long T cell-based immunosuppression increase risk develop PTLD due inability produce normal immunoregulatory response . This disease particularly devastate pediatric patient incidence least 4-fold great adult liver transplant patient population . In fact , PTLD number one cause death follow pediatric liver transplantation . At time , definitive method prospectively detect , diagnose , treat PTLD , current treatment protocol place liver allograft patient risk . Therefore , diagnostic tool sensitive specific , treatment strategy low toxicity greatly need decrease morbidity mortality suffer pediatric liver transplant patient PTLD . Our proposed study support hypothesis combination persistently elevate EBV load set diminish immune response EBV early risk indicator associate PTLD development , pre-emptive treatment utilize autologous adoptive EBV-specific CTL immunotherapy provide low toxicity treatment option .</brief_summary>
