	<brief_title>Reducing Risk Transplant Rejection : Simultaneous Kidney Bone Marrow Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Of two currently available treatment kidney failure , long-term dialysis kidney transplantation , kidney transplantation provide potential cure . After kidney transplant , body 's immune system recognize kidney foreign try attack destroy process call rejection . To avoid rejection , patient must take medication call immunosuppressant anti-rejection drug . It believe transplant bone marrow time solid organ kidney , state `` mixed chimerism '' ( mix donor recipient 's immune system ) achieve . Mixed chimerism may prevent rejection without need anti-rejection drug . Patients study receive simultaneous bone marrow kidney transplant living relate donor attempt establish mixed chimerism . Prior transplantation , patient undergo `` condition regimen '' involve cyclophosphamide chemotherapy , radiation thymus gland , four immunosuppressive medication : cyclosporine A , man-made antibody know rituximab suppress B cell , short course steroid , T-cell deplete antibody know MEDI-507 . MEDI-507 investigational medication approve FDA . The primary goal study investigate safety condition regimen ability promote mixed chimerism transplant kidney destroyed . The study also determine whether patient mixed chimerism eventually safely remove long-term immunosuppressive therapy follow transplantation . Patients assessed transplantation actively follow 24 month . Patients monitor graft rejection medication toxicity . After Month 24 , study continue additional 36 month medical record-based surveillance .</detailed_description>
