	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose erlotinib give together gemcitabine radiation therapy treat patient locally advance unresectable pancreatic cancer . Erlotinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Combining erlotinib gemcitabine may make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose erlotinib give concurrently gemcitabine radiotherapy patient locally advance unresectable pancreatic cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine toxicity regimen patient . II . Determine , preliminarily , antitumor efficacy regimen , term response rate , patient . III . Determine time tumor progression overall survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This non-randomized , open-label , dose-escalation study erlotinib . Chemoradiotherapy : Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 day week 5.5 week . Beginning day 1 continue concurrently radiotherapy , patient receive gemcitabine IV 30 minute twice weekly oral erlotinib daily . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos erlotinib maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Once MTD determine , additional 10 patient receive treatment dose . Patients radiologically restaged 3-4 week completion radiotherapy . Patients stable responsive disease proceed maintenance therapy . Patients whose image study suggest potential curative resection refer surgical evaluation initiate maintenance therapy . Maintenance therapy : Beginning 4-7 week completion chemoradiotherapy , patient receive maintenance chemotherapy comprise gemcitabine IV 30 minute day 1 8 oral erlotinib daily . Treatment repeat every 21 day total 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 19-28 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
