	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Cardiovascular disease remain leading cause death United States one lead cause morbidity . New technology recently allow non-invasive investigation extent atherosclerosis different vascular bed . Unfortunately , clinical implication significance new technology yet fully examine interrelationship various measurement clinical sub-clinical atherosclerosis . The study ancillary Multi-Ethnic Study Atherosclerosis ( MESA ) , NHLBI-supported epidemiological study atherosclerosis several ethnic group . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A longitudinal assessment carotid intima medium thickness ( IMT ) add schedule follow-up visit MESA subject order study relationship carotid IMT measure calcium burden coronary vessel . In addition , study conduct two non-invasive marker atherosclerosis relate cardiovascular disease risk factor clinical events.The study utilize MESA cohort involve 6500 subject baseline four follow-up examination . coronary artery calcification ( CAC ) IMT obtain baseline , CAC determination also schedule follow-up . IMT determination add conjunction CAC study second third exam detail analysis carry two measure atherosclerotic burden may reflect different biologic process .</detailed_description>
