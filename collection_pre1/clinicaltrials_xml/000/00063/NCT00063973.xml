	<brief_title>Cilengitide Treating Children With Refractory Primary Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe acute dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) define maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) cilengitide ( EMD 121974 ) administer child adolescent refractory primary brain tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To obtain preliminary evidence biologic activity determine alteration tissue perfusion , tumor blood flow metabolic activity use MR perfusion , PET MRS correlate finding change tumor size volumetric MRI . II . To characterize inter- intra-patient variability pharmacokinetics cilengitide estimate cilengitide renal clearance patient population . III . To characterize pharmacogenetic polymorphism drug transporter ( e.g. , MRP4 , BCRP ) relate cilengitide disposition . IV . To evaluate change circulate endothelial cell ( CECs ) circulate endothelial precursor ( CEPs ) patient treat cilengitide , investigate correlation change CECs CEPs , plasma , serum urine angiogenic protein level VEGF , clinical outcome . V. To obtain preliminary information efficacy cilengitide patient population . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients receive cilengitide ( EMD 121974 ) IV 1 hour twice weekly . Treatment repeat every 4 week 13 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos cilengitide maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose 25 % patient expect experience dose-limiting toxicity . Once MTD determine , 6 additional patient accrue treated dose level total 12 patient MTD . Patients receive treatment follow weekly first three month monthly one year 13 course treatment . Patients discontinue treatment follow resolution adverse event occur treatment and/or within 30 day last administration study drug . Patients follow short 1 ) three month last protocol base treatment , 2 ) date therapy initiate .</detailed_description>
