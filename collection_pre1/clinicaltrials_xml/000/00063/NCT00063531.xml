	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The ability noninvasively detect CAD subclinical stage fundamental understanding biology transition occult CAD clinical CAD asymptomatic people high risk future CAD . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The cross-sectional study design identify factor explain individual exercise ischemia without significant coronary artery calcium ( CAC ) others extensive CAC without exercise ischemia . The investigator compare pathophysiological feature functional test subclinical CAD detection ( exercise radionuclide perfusion SPECT ) anatomical test detect coronary calcification ( ultrafast CT ) high-risk asymptomatic population 30 59 year old sibling people premature CAD . Siblings undergo screen occult CAD use detection method . Individuals abnormal either test ( exercise-induced ischemia calcium score great 75th percentile age sex ) offer cardiac catheterization , include quantitative coronary angiography , assessment endothelial function intracoronary acetylcholine , measurement plaque volume composition select coronary artery intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) . The study focus pathophysiology occult CAD among individual exercise ischemia low calcium score individual high calcium score without ischemia . Discrepancies two test measure potentially different biological pathway discrepancy observe frequently high-risk asymptomatic sibling ( 40 % recent pilot study ) . Analyses do determine biological risk factor account variation plaque calcification result discordance two measure occult disease ( include lipid level subclass , Lp ( ) , diabetes , thrombotic factor , pro-inflammatory cytokine , importantly , factor involve calcium regulation , bone regulatory protein ) . In sibling undergo cardiac catheterization , analyse do determine whether severity extent coronary luminal narrowing , presence epicardial microvascular endothelial dysfunction , volume calcium content plaque IVUS account discordance two screen test . Polymorphisms several candidate gene may affect tissue calcification examine possible explanation variation plaque calcification reflect test discordance . Plasma DNA also collect novel study factor may account variability coronary plaque calcification unique well characterize asymptomatic high risk population . This first comprehensive study define unique biological genetic factor relate occult CAD , detect perfusion image ultrafast CT .</detailed_description>
