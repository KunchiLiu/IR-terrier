	<brief_title>Neighborhoods CVD Risk Multiethnic Cohort - Ancillary MESA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Recent epidemiologic study find live socioeconomically disadvantage neighborhood associate increase prevalence incidence coronary heart disease , even control measure personal income , education , occupation . Although suggests feature neighborhood may relevant cardiovascular risk , important question remain regard whether association observe reflect causal process . Two important unresolved issue role selection factor generate association need identify specific characteristic neighborhood relevant . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study use publicly available newly collect neighborhood data link Multi-Ethnic Study Atherosclerosis ( MESA ) : ( 1 ) examine relationship neighborhood socioeconomic characteristic prevalence progression subclinical atherosclerosis ; ( 2 ) examine association neighborhood socioeconomic characteristic specific individual-level factor may mediate neighborhood difference disease risk ; ( 3 ) develop measure specific characteristic neighborhood environment ( measure resource availability , neighborhood social cohesion neighborhood stress ) examine relation select individual-level risk factor ; ( 4 ) determine specific neighborhood characteristic explain difference cardiovascular risk socioeconomically advantage socioeconomically disadvantage neighborhood ; ( 5 ) examine neighborhood characteristic contribute race/ethnic difference cardiovascular risk . Measures neighborhood attribute base Year 2000 Census data , survey area resident , use GIS method link data area resource MESA neighborhood . The examination subclinical disease outcome avoid problem related selection person neighborhood base health status . The project use two innovative approach ( residential survey ecometric technique GIS-based method ) develop direct measure specific neighborhood attribute order test relationship disease risk . Confirming specific feature neighborhood causally related disease would important implication prevention .</detailed_description>
