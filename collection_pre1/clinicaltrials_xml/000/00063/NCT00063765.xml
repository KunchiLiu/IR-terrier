	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety ciliary neurotrophic factor ( CNTF ) implant place eye allow release CNTF directly retina . The result study may lead large investigation CNTF implant treat retinitis pigmentosa ( RP ) , progressive degenerative eye disease begin loss peripheral vision night blindness often lead blindness later life . Currently , effective treatment RP . Researchers find , however , certain protein , call ciliary neurotrophic factor ( CNTF ) , partially protect cell eye give directly inside eye . A major challenge treat RP deliver medicine directly eye . One way ensure CNTF get eye surgically place implant inside eye release protein . Patients 18 year age old retinitis pigmentosa whose visual acuity 20/100 worse may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , eye examination , eye photograph . The eye examination include measurement visual acuity eye pressure , examination pupil eye movement , examination lens back eye . In addition , patient follow test : - Visual field test : Patients look central spot white screen tell examiner whenever see small light appear place screen . - Electroretinogram ( ERG ) : Electrodes tap patient 's forehead . Special contact lens place eye , similar normal contact lenses , eye numbed drop . The contact lenses sense small electrical signal generate retina . The ERG measure electrical activity retina stimulate light . For ERG recording , patient look inside large , hollow , dark sphere , see flash light , first dark , light turn sphere . - Optical coherence tomography : This test , do machine use examine eye , measure retinal thickness produce cross-sectional picture retina . Participants undergo surgery NIH Clinical Center 30-minute operation place implant one eye . The surgery do local anesthetic . Before procedure , patient give steroid injection along side eye minimize inflammation surgery . Following procedure , patient return follow-up visit month 6 month . At visit , several exam describe repeated evaluate treatment effect check adverse side effect . After 6 month , implant surgically remove . Post-surgical care implant explant surgery include examination day week surgery examine wound , high dose steroid immediately surgery , oral antibiotic 7 day , eye drop 1 week prevent infection inflammation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Retinitis Pigmentosa ( RP ) group incurable degenerative disease retina complex molecular etiology . Approximately 100,000 Americans suffer inherit retinal degenerative RP . More 100 RP-inducing mutation identify several gene include : rhodopsin , rod visual pigment ; peripherin , membrane structure protein ; PDEB , beta subunit rod cyclic GMP ( cGMP ) phosphodiesterase . However , genotype unknown majority patient . Despite genetic heterogeneity , tend common pattern visual loss patient RP . Typically , patient experience disturbance night vision early life due degeneration rod photoreceptors . The remain cone photoreceptors become mainstay vision , year decade , cone slowly degenerate , lead blindness . These two phase degeneration visual life RP patient may involve different underlie pathogenic mechanism . Regardless initial causative defect , end result photoreceptor degeneration . This common pathogenesis pathway provide target therapeutic intervention . To date , available , effective treatment retinal degenerative disorder . One major challenge deliver potential therapeutic agent back eye , particular retina . The blood-eye barrier prevents penetration variety molecule neurosensory retina similar manner action blood-brain barrier , exist central nervous system systemic circulation . To overcome challenge , Neurotech USA , Inc. ( Neurotech ) develop encapsulate cell technology ( ECT ) , specifically NT-501-10 NT-501-6A.02 device , enable control , sustain delivery therapeutic agent directly intra-ocular fluid thus provide direct access retina . ECT utilizes cell encapsulate within semi-permeable polymer device secrete therapeutic factor directly vitreous . In addition , ECT device retrieve , provide add level safety . Histopathologic study demonstrate possibility growth factor , neurotrophic factor , cytokine therapeutic RP . Specifically , ciliary neurotrophic factor ( CNTF ) proven effective reduce retinal degeneration . Therefore , use implant NT-501-10 NT-501-6A.02 device , secrete CNTF retina , may beneficial patient RP retinal degenerative disease . This pilot study assess ophthalmic systemic safety , extent efficacy , novel intra-ocular NT-501-10 NT-501-6A.02 implant patient RP poor visual acuity one eye . The main purpose study assess safety NT-501-10 NT-501-6A.02 implant . Secondary outcome include anterior chamber cell scale vitreous haze grade measure inflammation , may cause implant . Other secondary outcome measure relate potential product performance visual acuity , visual field , electroretinogram ( ERG ) , optical coherence tomography ( OCT3 ) determine retinal thickness .</detailed_description>
