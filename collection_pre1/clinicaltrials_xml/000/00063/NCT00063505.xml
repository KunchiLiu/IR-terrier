	<brief_title>Genes Hypertension African Americans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Since mid 1990s , investigator extensively characterized African Americans phenotype relate cardiovascular renal function . Based recently complete genome scan , identify several chromosomal region likely contain gene influence hypertension-related phenotype hypertensive , African American sib pair . For several phenotype , overlap QTLs also identify related study genetically isolated French Canadian population and/or homologous chromosomal region F2 cross Dahl-salt sensitive x normotensive Brown Norway rat . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The investigator extensively phenotype 500 hypertensive 500 normotensive African American subject conduct genetic association study , use single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) genomic scan approach . To achieve clear separation blood pressure hypertensive subject , normotensive subject select low third population-based blood pressure distribution . Hypertensive ( BMI ) , age . Inclusion phenotype base relevance pathophysiology hypertension prior evidence `` heritability . '' Candidate gene SNP analysis select within chromosomal region two quantitative trait locus ( QTLs ) previously demonstrate link hypertension-related phenotype -- QTL body mass index chromosome 1 QTL microalbuminuria chromosome 18 . SNP analyse carry 15 percent gene within QTLs , gene select basis relevance hypertension , include document sequence conservation blood pressure relate QTLs rat mouse . The final goal project determine distinct cluster blood pressure relate phenotype identify permit stratification hypertensive individual distinct subgroup facilitate analysis genetic determinant hypertension and/or provide mechanistic lead gene contribute trait .</detailed_description>
