	<detailed_description>Increased calcium intake effective increase bone mineral density child , effect disappear calcium supplement discontinue . Increased dietary calcium daily food source may great impact bone density achieve calcium supplement . However , study yet demonstrate sustained achievement increase calcium food source . In addition , effect baseline calcium intake , bone density , puberty status may influence bone response increase dietary calcium . This study develop , implement , evaluate Behavioral Modification-Nutrition Education ( BM-NE ) Intervention Program design promote sustain increase dietary calcium . The study quantify impact increase dietary calcium bone density growth development determine whether presence risk factor low bone density influence compliance program . Participants recruit two group : group healthy child know risk factor low bone density ( i.e. , know chronic disease previous oral steroid exposure ) , group healthy child potential risk factor low bone density ( previous fracture usual childhood activity , daily dietary calcium refusal , lactose intolerance , family history osteoporosis ) . Children without risk factor randomly assign participate intensive BM-NE intervention group usual care group receive counsel bone health . The BM-NE Program consist five group session parent child 6 week . The program use individualized plan increase child 's calcium intake 1500 mg per day . Children follow 3 year . Primary outcome measure include daily calcium intake bone mineral density . Data height , weight , sexual skeletal maturation , physical activity also collect .</detailed_description>
