	<brief_title>Physical Activity Childhood Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Childhood obesity rapidly increase many country environmental factor main cause . The onset puberty may critical period . Diet physical activity likely prime causative factor , although relative role may vary child differ age , gender ethnicity . There also likely many psychosocial social-demographic factor confound relationship , confounders may vary sub-groups . There continue uncertainty regard role factor differential effect subgroups population . It crucial develop well understand dietary physical activity pattern affect energy balance , characteristic interact factor . Measures physical activity add ongoing assessment boys girl ( n=10,000 ) participate Avon Longitudinal Study Parents Children ( ALSPAC ) . This comprehensive study follow child parent 9-10 year . The study extensive database include maternal paternal social background , lifestyle habit ( include diet physical activity ) , medical history medication pregnancy thereafter . ALSPAC also collect retained biological sample include maternal blood , urine , cord blood , umbilical cord , placenta , hair nail clipping , deciduous teeth , child 's blood DNA . Data mother also include detail parent 's lifestyle , childhood , lifestyle , occupation history diet , access mother 's biological sample . Over 71 % cohort ( &gt; 10,000 14,541 participant ) retain . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Levels pattern physical activity measure child age 11 13 assess relationship measure obesity . Physical activity measure objectively 5 day . The data , together data collect pregnancy , infancy childhood use investigate relationship mode , intensity , quantity pattern physical activity development obesity critical stage life . The strengths prospective study size , high retention rate extensive set whole-of-life measure already take child . With 10,000 child expect attend annually health check throughout adolescence , study adequately power quantify association physical activity obesity . The study physical activity child date seriously restrict high level measurement error inherent self-report measure physical activity . In study , physical activity measure use single-plane accelerometer ( CSA model 7164 ) - small , lightweight electronic motion sensor attach child 's belt period 5 day . This instrument give capacity characterize child 's physical activity , inactivity , accurately ever . Comprehensive measurement diet body composition ( principally Dual-emission X-ray Absorptiometry - DXA ) also take age 11 13 separate funding .</detailed_description>
