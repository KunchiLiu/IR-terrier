	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether special coil design magnetic stimulation area deep brain affect mood emotion healthy volunteer . Researchers hope good understand brain control mood motivation go wrong process disease . For transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , wire coil hold scalp . A brief electrical current pass coil create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . Eighteen participant , 9 men 9 woman , enrol study . They assign one follow two experiment . Experiment 1 In experiment , researcher test effectiveness new type wire coil . They deliver magnetic impulse vary strength . Approximately 150 stimulation give 20 minute . To determine whether coil cause problem hearing , participant undergo hear test immediately experiment . Experiment 2 This experiment , two part , design determine whether TMS affect mood . In first part , participant ask report change mood , magnetic stimulation . In second part , ask choose set 2 identical pictures-choosing one result full magnetic stimulation , choose result stimulation 10 percent full intensity . Participants compensate $ 100 involvement study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Current magnetic stimulation technique permit superficial stimulation brain , purpose deep stimulation would helpful . The purpose study determine whether special coil design magnetic stimulation deep brain region affect mood emotion healthy human volunteer . The special coil design stimulate neuronal pathway relate control motivation reward , specifically , fiber connect cingulated prefrontal cortex nucleus accumbens . Computerized theoretical calculation make order optimize coil design maximize percentage stimulation depth relative cortical region . The present study look first influence coil response motor cortex . Should good evidence coil truly effective stimulate deep structure , explore whether indeed affect mood emotion single pulse apply .</detailed_description>
