	<brief_title>National Institute Neurological Disorders Stroke ( NINDS ) Parkinson 's Disease Neuroprotection Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) affect nearly million Americans , number increase come decade population age . While available medical therapy usually effective control symptoms initial year follow diagnosis , high dose multiple agent required time , increase side effect incomplete control symptom . Although treatment dramatically improve life patient PD initially , address underlying cause disease inevitable disease progression . This multi-center , randomize , double-blind trial involve 42 trial center United States Canada , enroll 195 people PD . The primary objective neuroprotection trial identify agent capable slow progression PD . In trial , investigator assess impact minocycline creatine progression PD determine futile non-futile proceed study agent . In study , subject early , untreated PD equally randomize one three study arm : 1 . ) group receive active minocycline placebo instead creatine , 2 . ) group receive active creatine placebo instead minocycline , 3 . ) group receive placebo instead minocycline creatine . Subjects remain blinded study drug 18 month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion : Willing able give inform consent . Men woman idiopathic PD le 5 year duration diagnosis . Diagnosis must confirm bradykinesia plus one cardinal sign ( rest tremor , rigidity ) present , without know suspected cause parkinsonism . The clinical sign must asymmetric . Subjects must require therapy ( include levodopa , dopamine agonist , anticholinergic , amantadine selegiline ) treat symptom PD time enrollment . Subjects may prior exposure one agent , exposure agent may longer 60 day duration subject must agent within 90 day prior baseline . Once subject need dopaminergic treatment , medication may add part best medical management . The subject still remain study . Age &gt; 30 year . Willingness ability comply study requirement . Women childbearing potential ( i.e. , postmenopausal surgically sterile ) may participate provide use adequate birth control method duration study . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test baseline nonlactating . Exclusion : Use follow drug within 180 day prior baseline : neuroleptic , metoclopramide , alphamethyldopa , clozapine , olanzapine flunarizine . Use follow drug within 90 day prior baseline : methylphenidate , cinnarizine , reserpine , amphetamine MAOA inhibitor ( pargyline , phenelzine , tranylcypromine ) . Presence atypical Parkinson 's syndrome due drug ( e.g. , metoclopramide , flunarazine ) , metabolic identify neurogenetic disorder ( e.g. , Wilson 's disease ) , encephalitis , degenerative disease ( e.g. , progressive supranuclear palsy ) . Use minocycline creatine 90 day prior baseline . Use CoQ10 &gt; 300mg 90 day prior baseline . Subjects must maintain stable dosage CoQ10 throughout duration trial . Participation drug study receipt investigational drug within 90 day prior baseline . Presence freezing . Impairment postural reflex ( pull test score &gt; 0 ) . Any clinically significant medical condition ( e.g. , active GI illness , angina , active neoplasm ) laboratory abnormality , would judgment investigator interfere subject ability participate study follow . History stereotaxic brain surgery PD ( e.g. , pallidotomy , deep brain stimulation , fetal tissue implantation ) . Clinically significant structural brain disease investigator believe would interfere study evaluation . History known hypersensitivity intolerability minocycline know allergy tetracycline creatine .</criteria>
