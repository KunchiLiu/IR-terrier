	<brief_summary>Parkinson 's disease patient usually difficulty make automatic movement . Automatic movement movement people often make without conscious thought . The purpose study investigate region brain affect automatic movement understand movement Parkinson 's patient . Investigators hope knowledge lead well treatment disease . Thirty participant enrol study . Each give medical history undergo brief physical exam . Participants two MRI scan , last approximately 1.5 hour . During scan , may ask move right left hand remember letter show . Before undergoing second scan , participant ask practice task perform correctly .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Studying Automatic Movements Patients With Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) deficient make automatic movement . The underlying neural correlate problem understood . In present study , investigate brain activity contribute disorder , use specially design dual-task paradigm functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) technique . Thirty patient PD ask perform sequential finger-tapping movement right hand ; result analyze 20 patient achieve automaticity define study . In addition , use dual-task paradigm evaluate automaticity subject perform either distraction task ( involve visual memory ) interference task ( tap leave hand ) simultaneously sequential movement . Patients practice achieve automaticity . fMRI obtain achieve automaticity . By analyze fMRI result , explore brain region associated deficiency automatic movement PD patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Thirty patient PD include study . The diagnosis PD base medical history , physical neurological examination , response levodopa dopaminergic drug , laboratory test MRI scan exclude disease . Patients assess Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) MiniMental State Exam ( MMSE ) . Only patient mild moderate motor disability ( UDRS le equal 40 ) without cognitive impairment ( MMT score great equal 25 ) investigate . Patients studied medication withdraw least 12 hour . All subject participate study valid Clinical Center Medical Record Number . The fMRI experiment follow standard operating procedure HMCS Neuroimaging Group . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects psychiatric disorder severe motor disability exclude . Subjects pacemaker , cardiac neural defibrillator , intracranial aneurysm clip , intraorbital metallic structure , insulin pump , cochlear implant , metallic object scan . Women pregnant exclude MRI safety fetus presence high magnetic field establish . Therefore , woman childbearing potential pregnancy test perform , must negative , proceed . Subjects age 18 exclude .</criteria>
