They undergo two outpatient session , last 3 hour . The first visit stroke patient occur 2 week 3 month stroke ; second visit least 6 month stroke . Participants physical exam , give medical history , complete questionnaire . Then undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . They lie MRI scanner ask number skilled hand movement use right hand ( pretend use hammer wave goodbye ) response direction appear screen mount head . Their movement record videotape procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : The present study focus evaluate neural activation pattern underlie praxis movement normal control patient ideomotor apraxia use event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . Ideomotor apraxia disorder affect patient stroke variety brain lesion . The disorder involve disturbed timing , sequence , spatial organization skilled movement , execution probably also preparatory phase . As consequence , patient suffer incorrect temporal spatial component movement evidence pantomime transitive ( object/tool relate ) intransitive ( independent object/tool use ) gesture . Thus far , damage posterior parietal region parietofrontal circuit implicate significantly contribute disorder . However , little known mechanism cortical reorganization follow damage , notably recovery process . We hypothesize recruitment parallel contralateral motor pathway compensate reduced communication within parietofrontal circuit prevents accurate motor performance . STUDY POPULATION : We study two group participant : one group patient ideomotor apraxia one group healthy subject . DESIGN : We measure fMRI activation transitive intransitive gesture 10 patient ideomotor apraxia subacute chronic stage compare 25 normal control . The design behavioral paradigm incorporate distinct period plan prior movement . OUTCOME MEASURES : The design study allow evaluate difference plan execution phase patient control . Further analysis examine pattern functional connectivity activate brain area , notably alter interaction ideomotor apraxia . Of special interest putative engagement perilesional even remote brain area neuronal network attempt recovery motor deficit . It expect study well understanding cortical plasticity compensate motor deficit ideomotor apraxia therapeutically exploit , notably rehabilitation process .</detailed_description>
