	<brief_title>Safety AMD070 When Administered Alone Boosted With Low-Dose Ritonavir HIV Uninfected Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current therapy HIV infection primarily use drug inhibit HIV replication via inhibition viral protease reverse transcriptase . Many patient either tolerate medication well develop virologic failure due incomplete viral suppression development antiviral resistance . New drug target HIV entry cell . AMD070 bind chemokine receptor CXCR4 , inhibit membrane fusion viral entry . Animal study show AMD070 generally safe well tolerate . The dose-escalation drug-drug interaction study evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics single , multiple , RTV-boosted dos AMD070 healthy , HIV uninfected male volunteer . Participants study assign single- multiple-dose AMD070 group ( Group 1 ) , single-dose AMD070 group ( Group 2 ) , RTV-boosted , multiple-dose AMD070 group ( Group 3 ) . Some participant Group 1 give AMD070 empty stomach food drink except water 2 hour 1 hour receive drug . Up 4 different dos test subgroup Group 1 participant . Some participant Group 1 give AMD070 7 time , 12 hour apart , eat standardize breakfast 30 minute receive drug ; 3 different dos test group . Participants Group 2 give single dose AMD070 eat standardized meal . Participants Group 3 give morning dose AMD070 Days 1 , 3 , 17 eat standardize breakfast 30 minute receive drug , morning evening dose RTV Days 3 18 . Group 3 participant may also ask enroll additional study group receive single dose AMD070 Days 1 3 fasting . All participant observe hospital inpatient . Group 1 2 participant stay hospital 24 hour ; Group 3 participant stay hospital 4 day . All participant blood urine collection throughout hospital stay . Group 3 participant select join additional study group blood urine sample collect throughout 5-day study . These participant discharge hospital Day 5 follow-up visit around Day 35 . All study participant also undergo ophthalmologic evaluation questionnaire sometime receive AMD070 .</detailed_description>
