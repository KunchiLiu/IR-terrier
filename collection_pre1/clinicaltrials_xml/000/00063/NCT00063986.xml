	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Laparoscopic-assisted surgery video-assisted thoracoscopy less invasive type surgery esophageal cancer may fewer side effect improve recovery . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well laparoscopic-assisted surgery video-assisted thoracoscopy work treat patient undergo esophagectomy high-grade dysplasia esophagus stage I , stage II , stage III esophageal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Esophagectomy Treating Patients With High-Grade Dysplasia Esophagus Stage I , Stage II , Stage III Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine feasibility perform minimally invasive esophagectomy ( MIE ) , term 30-day mortality , patient high-grade dysplasia esophagus stage I-III esophageal cancer . - Determine complication associated procedure patient . - Determine rate conversion open operation require patient undergoing procedure . - Determine length operation , duration intensive care unit stay , length hospital stay patient undergoing procedure . - Determine feasibility conversion rate MIE neoadjuvant therapy . - Assess effectiveness lymph node dissection MIE record total number lymph node dissect . - Assess outcome follow-up three year . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients undergo minimally invasive esophagectomy comprise video-assisted thoracoscopy mobilize thoracic esophagus combination laparoscopy complete esophagectomy neck incision mobilize cervical esophagus . Mortality 30 day assess . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 1 year . ACTUAL ACCRUAL : A total 110 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS : High grade dysplasia esophagus would undergo esophagectomy OR esophageal cancer stage T1T3 , N0N1 require esophagectomy ( patient M1 disease and/or bulky lymph node involvement exclude ) . Pathological confirmation diagnosis cancer highgrade dysplasia esophagus biopsy . Computerized tomography ( CT ) scan chest abdomen within 6 week prior registration Stomach must available conduit Age 18 ECOG performance status 02 Creatinine less 2 mg/dL Patients esophageal cancer would treat neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation eligible . If patient register prior receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy allow 5 month complete therapy restaging necessary operation perform . The patient consider appropriate candidate surgery base preoperative clinical stag physiological factor prior registration document surgical plan . Preoperative stag include : Endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) Positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan and/or laparoscopic staging ( Laparoscopic staging could perform day resection . Additional evaluation recommend PET scan suggest distant metastatic disease . ) EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Cancer extend stomach 20 % Prior antireflux gastric operation Prior right thoracotomy Prior major neck operation removal superficial skin lesion</criteria>
