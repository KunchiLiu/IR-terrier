	<brief_summary>Super rapid transcranial magnetic stimulation ( srTMS ) method brain stimulation may able change electrical activity nerve cell brain . It propose test treatment brain disorder , include Parkinson 's disease . The purpose study use device call magnetic stimulator investigate safe limit srTMS , intensity stimulation number magnetic pulse may lead excessive brain stimulation . Ten patient Parkinson 's disease-whose main problem slowness movement difficulty walking-will participate study . They ask come laboratory one experiment . Before srTMS treatment , investigator test participant ' brain function series psychological test EEG ( electroencephalogram ) . The srTMS treatment perform place insulate coil wire scalp pass brief electrical current wire coil . The experiment last 2 4 hour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The treatment Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) need improvement , particularly area gait freeze . A promising technique repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) , far , produce small effect bradykinesia drug free patient limited trial . The relevant rTMS parameter therapeutic effect unknown . Use high rTMS frequency ( 50 Hz , maximum output modern TMS machine , super rapid TMS [ srTMS ] circular coil design [ vs. figure eight shape ] ) may improve therapeutic effect people PD . The 50 Hz srTMS frequency propose range exceed currently establish guideline since high frequency investigate . We look acute srTMS effect primary motor cortex ( M1 ) stimulation ( 60 % 100 % motor threshold [ MT ] intensity , 0.5 second 2 second train duration ) . A multi-channel electromyography ( EMG ) record visually control sign increase time-locked EMG activity , EMG correlate spread excitation M1 , increase M1 excitability establish safe superrapid transcranial magnetic stimulation ( srTMS ) limit . The electroencephalogram ( EEG ) Record , Folstein Mini-Mental Exam , CFL FAS Letter Production Test ( word begin letter ' C ' , ' F ' etc ) , Serial Reaction Time , Grooved Pegboard Test , Unified PD Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) do srTMS session control possible srTMS side effect .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects men woman age 40 80 year DOPAresponsive , akineticrigid PD . After obtain informed consent , patient interview examine either prinicipal investigator ( PI ) Brain Stimulation Unit ( BSU ) HMCS physician establish diagnosis PD rule neurologic condition . Only patient Hoehn Yahr grade 2 4 'off ' accept . Patients must regimen include LDOPA , must total dose medication equal 300 mg LDOPA equivalent , include dopamine agonist agent . Any patient whose record contain neurological examination past year reexamine enrollment . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Any significant medical psychiatric illness ( PD ) , pregnancy , history epilepsy , concurrent use tricyclic antidepressant , neuroleptic agent , licit illicit drug antiparkinsonian agent could lower seizure threshold . Persons surgically traumatically implanted foreign body pacemaker , implanted stimulators , implanted medication pump , metal plate skull , metal inside skull eye ( dental appliance filling ) may pose physical hazard magnetic stimulation also exclude . Most exclusion also come category significant medical illness . Patients participation study would , opinion investigator , cause undue risk stress reason tendency fall , excessive fatigue , general fatigue , general frailty , excessive apprehensiveness also exclude . A urine sample pregnancy test obtain woman childbearing potential prior start srTMS , day initial interview sign consent form . Pregnant woman exclude study . Mentally impaired patient capacity provide consent exclude study .</criteria>
