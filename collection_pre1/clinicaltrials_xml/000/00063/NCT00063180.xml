	<brief_summary>Patients stroke sometimes condition call diaschisis , loss function part brain locate distance original stroke-injury site . Doctors know happen . The purpose study get good understanding diaschisis occur study people experienced stroke people age good health . Forty-four participant old 40 year age enrol study-18 healthy people 26 stroke patient . They 3 4 study visit . The first visit involve medical history physical neurological exam . Participants magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan , either first visit later day . On next visit , undergo position emission tomography ( PET ) scan . Finally , return another MRI scan .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Remote Effects Stroke With MRI PET Scans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : Following stroke , dysfunction lesioned area , also remote functional depression non-lesioned area . This functional depression , call diaschisis , likely contribute functional deficit patient . The objective study obtain good understand pathophysiology diaschisis integrate method neuroimaging ( positron emission tomography ( PET ) proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( H-MRS ) ) . Study population : We recruit patient subcortical stroke subacute state chronic state , normal control . Design : The stroke lesion basal ganglion , internal capsule , thalamus , cerebellum . The frontal cortex , include motor cortex , choose remote area . Neurochemical change diaschitic area investigate measure glucose metabolic rate PET , concentration neurochemically important metabolite , gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) glutamate , H-MRS . Outcome measure : Metabolic change diaschitic area relative contra-lateral unaffected side calculate laterality index . First , index compare among patient group control group . As second analysis , relationship glucose metabolism measure PET concentration metabolite detect H-MRS evaluate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients clinically radiologically document stroke subacute ( 2 week 6 month onset ) chronic state ( 6 month onset ) , lesion subcortical region include basal ganglion , thalamus , internal capsule , combination structure , cerebellum unilaterally . These lesion extend surround area , however include cerebral area HMRS ROI locate . Both ischemic infarction hemorrhage include ; however , case hemorrhage , exclude case deformation cerebral hemisphere due mass effect hemorrhage , hydrocephalus , extension ventricle . Patients 18 year age old . Healthy control enter study must free serious somatic disease determine standard physical neurological examination . Controls age 18 year . Female patient control child bear potential pregnancy test specific interview prior study ensure pregnant patient participate study . Both patient control asked abstain alcohol one week PET HMRS scan . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : A . Patients MRI finding consistent brain tumor , trauma AVMs exclude . B . Patients multiple stroke lesion exclude , except prior asymptomatic lacunar infarction stroke lesion know cause diaschisis frontal cortex ( occipital cortex ) . C. Patients severe stenosis ( great 70 % ) occlusion internal cervical artery proximal portion middle frontal cerebral artery detect angiography MRA exclude . Subjects medical disorder affect concentration cerebral metabolite , include renal failure , hepatic failure untreated electrolyte abnormality exclude . Subjects poorly control diabetes mellitus ( casual plasma glucose concentration great equal 200 mg per dL ( 11.1 mmol per L ) fast plasma glucose concentration great equal 126 mg per dL ( 7.0 mmol per L ) exclude . Subjects take sleep drug tranquilizer ask stop take two day prior PET HMRS scan . D. Subjects prestroke history schizophrenia bipolar disorder exclude . E. Subjects implant device pacemaker , medication pump defibrillator , metal cranium except mouth , intracardiac line , history shrapnel injury condition/device may contraindicate prevent acquisition MRI . F. Subjects cancer exclude . G. Patients capable give informed consent exclude H. Ethnic origin race bias inclusion . Participation child : Children exclude study need study homogeneous group subject age developmental change metabolite complicate study . Additionally , young child sufficiently cooperative long period test . Moreover , radiation dose PET study would subject relatively great risk adult .</criteria>
