	<brief_title>Monitoring Trends Venous Thromboembolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) estimate third common cardiovascular disorder . Frequently cite estimate incidence VTE , associate outcome , base study conduct decade ago hospitalize patient . Contemporary data magnitude disorder , clinical profile patient affect , acute long-term outcome , use different treatment strategy need give recent advance diagnostic therapeutic modality . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The goal study collect population base data describe trend time epidemiology VTE include incidence , management , short long-term recurrence rate , mortality . The study take place resident Worcester , Massachusetts , metropolitan area , ( 2000 census = 477,800 ) examine change time additional endpoint patient validate VTE 1998 , 2000 2002 minimum follow-up three year . Complementing community base surveillance VTE , newly diagnose case VTE occur member large Health Maintenance Organization ( HMO ) Central Massachusetts 1998 2002 identify . This cohort track outpatient computer database allow systematic collection additional data treatment practice outcomes occur outside hospital setting . The project build investigator ' clinical epidemiological experience data collection methodology use Worcester Deep Vein Thrombosis ( DVT ) study ( 1985-1989 ) ongoing Worcester Heart Attack Study . The medical record Worcester area resident diagnose VTE related diagnostic rubric review validated accord pre-established diagnostic criterion . Records additional hospitalization death certificate review examine trend long-term recurrence survival rate 2005 . The result study provide much need current reformation epidemiology VTE provide important data current diagnostic therapeutic strategy use patient . Implementation registry set stage systematic long-term surveillance medically important problem .</detailed_description>
