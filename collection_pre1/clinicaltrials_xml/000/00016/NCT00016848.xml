	<brief_summary>This study try determine intake dietary fat carbohydrates influence tendency gain weight accumulate body fat . It examine hormone regulate weight may change shift balance diet one low fat carbohydrate , irrespective caloric intake . Men woman age 18 40 year body mass index 30 49 kg/m2 may eligible study . Candidates screen history , physical examination , blood test questionnaires regard activity , prior diet , eat pattern . Participants follow two separate diet regimens 5 day . The first balance diet , second either low-fat/high-carbohydrate diet low-carbohydrate/high-fat diet . The diet design produce weight loss .
