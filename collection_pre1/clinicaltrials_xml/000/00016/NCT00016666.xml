	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine dose new timed-release tablet drug propranolol reduce secretion hormone melatonin healthy volunteer . This study also determine whether suppress melatonin improve depressive symptom people seasonal affective disorder ( SAD ) . SAD ( sometimes refer winter depression ) condition people experience depression result seasonal variation light . Human brain circadian pacemaker regulate many body function . As season change light duration varies , circadian pacemaker regulate seasonal behavior transmit signal day length pineal gland , secrete hormone melatonin . Melatonin secretion increase winter duration light decrease . Evidence suggest melatonin signal seasonal change present people SAD healthy volunteer ; thus possibility seasonal change influence duration melatonin secretion control course illness individual SAD . This study determine whether propranolol shorten duration melatonin secretion mimic effect summer day improve symptom depression people SAD . Healthy volunteer admit hospital 2 day . The volunteer receive either propranolol placebo ( inactive pill ) go bed upon awaken . Blood sample collect various time throughout study . Participants SAD interview periodically outpatient basis determine onset depression fall winter . Two week depressive symptom arise , participant begin treatment either propranolol placebo . At begin treatment , participant hospitalize 2 day blood collect various time . During hospital stay , participant continue treatment either propranolol placebo morning night ; participant receive propranolol point study . Participants interview weekly 4 week . Premenopausal woman without SAD keep record menstrual cycle use urine test kit identify time ovulation month admission hospital .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Symptoms seasonal affective disorder ( SAD ) humans resemble seasonal change occur animal . Moreover , human animal , occurrence change regulate light . In animal circadian pacemaker regulate seasonal behavior transmit signal daylength sit organism . This signal express , reciprocally , duration nocturnal melatonin secretion , long winter shorter summer . Sites distal pineal regulate seasonal behavior read respond melatonin signal change season . In longitudinal study , show homologous melatonin signal change season present patient SAD healthy volunteer . In light animal model , find raise possibility seasonal change duration melatonin secretion govern course illness patient SAD . If , intervention shortens duration melatonin secretion winter thereby mimic effect summer day improve symptom winter depression . To test hypothesis , propose administer propranolol , beta-adrenergic receptor block medication frequently prescribe treatment hypertension , patient SAD winter . We administer propranolol time night would suppress shorten duration melatonin secretion ascertain whether intervention improve depression . A unique feature parallel-design , control clinical trial propranolol , administered time day melatonin secrete , serve active placebo .</detailed_description>
