	<brief_summary>Phase II trial study effectiveness combination chemotherapy plus monoclonal antibody therapy treat patient metastatic prostate cancer respond previous hormone therapy . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Monoclonal antibody bevacizumab may stop growth cancer cell stop blood flow tumor . Combining monoclonal antibody therapy chemotherapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Plus Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine time objective progression , response rate ( objective PSA response ) duration response men hormone refractory prostate cancer treat estramustine , docetaxel bevacizumab . II . To determine toxicity regimen men hormone refractory prostate cancer . III . To study relationship baseline VEGF level urine plasma change level response duration response treatment bevacizumab , docetaxel estramustine . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral estramustine 3 time daily day 1-5 docetaxel IV 1 hour follow bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 2 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow least every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
