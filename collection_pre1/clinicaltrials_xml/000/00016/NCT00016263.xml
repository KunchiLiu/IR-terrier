	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Oblimersen ( G3139 ) may help dacarbazine kill cancer cell make tumor cell sensitive drug . It yet know dacarbazine effective without oblimersen ( G3139 ) . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness dacarbazine without oblimersen ( G3139 ) treat patient advanced malignant melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dacarbazine With Without Oblimersen ( G3139 ) Treating Patients With Advanced Malignant Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare survival patient advance malignant melanoma treat dacarbazine without oblimersen ( G3139 ) . - Compare response rate , durable response rate , progression-free survival patient treat regimen . - Compare safety regimens patient population . - Compare performance status , body weight , tumor-related symptom patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord ECOG performance status ( 0 vs 1 2 ) , extent metastasis lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) level ( skin subcutaneous and/or lymph node metastasis without visceral involvement normal LDH v visceral metastasis elevate LDH ) , liver metastasis ( yes v ) . Patients randomize one two treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive dacarbazine IV 60 minute day 1 . - Arm II : Patients receive oblimersen ( G3139 ) IV continuously day 1-6 followed dacarbazine IV 60 minute day 6 . Treatment repeat every 21 day maximum 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable disease partial complete response may eligible another 8 course treatment extension protocol . Patients follow least every 2 month 2 year study . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 750 patient ( 375 per arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
