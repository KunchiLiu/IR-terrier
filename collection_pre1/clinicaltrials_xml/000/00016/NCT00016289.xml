	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response rate progression-free interval patient peritoneal carcinomatosis associate ovarian epithelial cancer primary peritoneal carcinoma treat intraperitoneal interleukin-12 . II . Determine qualitative quantitative toxicity reversibility toxicity regimen patient . III . Determine peritoneal cavity tumor cell response , term negative cytology , conversion aneuploidy diploidy , apoptosis evidence therapeutic effect , patient treat regimen . IV . Assess quality life patient treat regimen . V. Determine pharmacology pharmacokinetics drug patient . VI . Determine whether regimen facilitates adaptive innate immunity vivo serum antibody responses tumor-associated antigen patient . VII . Determine whether regimen decrease expression vascular endothelial growth factor , fibroblast growth factor 2 , interleukin-8 surrogate marker angiogenesis whether decrease marker expression associate clinical activity drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive interleukin-12 intraperitoneally weekly . Treatment repeat every 4 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable respond disease receive 2 additional course . Quality life assess baseline ; prior week 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 treatment ; patient inform disease response ; 2 week later . Patients follow every 2 month 1 year every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
