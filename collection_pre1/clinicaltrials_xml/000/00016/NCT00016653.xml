	<brief_summary>This study help determine effectiveness glutamine creatine possible therapy DMD . Boys DMD enrol trial randomly choose receive creatine monohydrate glutamine inactive placebo orally six month . Once month six-month treatment period , study participant muscle strength evaluate use manual computerized testing method . This study conduct several CINRG Centers throughout U.S. , Belgium , Israel Puerto Rico . This study support Muscular Dystrophy Association .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Creatine Glutamine Steroid-Naive Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The purpose study see child Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) give glutamine ( nutritional supplement ) creatine monohydrate ( nutritional supplement ) change strength compare child give medicinal treatment . Children choose research study diagnose DMD , age 5 10 year old , participate DMD clinical trial within last year , medication disqualify participation trial . All child clinical trial enter discretion doctor charge study . During first second visit , child fulfill criterion participation clinical trial determine . We expect 50 subject participate CINRG center worldwide . PROCEDURES Children randomize ( procedure like flip coin ) one three group : treat glutamine , treat creatine monohydrate , untreated ( placebo : sugar pill medication ) . Neither parent , child , doctor treat child know group child assign . Because study design , possibility child receive treatment ( placebo group ) clinical trial . During trial child must take one supplement mixed water morning supplement mixed water night . Nine ( 9 ) clinic visit require complete clinical trial . During visit clinic , child evaluate member research team determine child ? strength . Strength measure different way : manual testing , quantitative testing , usual measure use visit neurologist ( child ask rise floor , walk across room , etc. ) . Manual test way strength usually measure child ? doctor . The quantitative muscle strength test ( QMT ) mechanical way measure strength : child sits/lays examine table ask pull/push strap . This test determine strength different muscle group kilograms force . An electrocardiogram ( ECG , heart test ) perform screen visit 2 month 6 blood ( small amount equal 2 3 tablespoon ) draw screen visit 2 month 1 , 3 6 . Urine test do screen visit 2 nd month 1 , 3 6 monitor kidney function .</detailed_description>
