	<brief_summary>This study examine origin development certain neurological disease involve abnormal metabolism . A significant number patient progressive neurological disorder diagnose despite extensive workups . Lack specific diagnosis may amplify distress patient family decrease chance obtain effective therapy . This study try advance diagnosis management patient . Patients metabolic neurological disease unknown cause one present unusual difficult management problem may eligible study . This study include patient know suspected leukodystrophy . Participants undergo various procedure , include physical neurologic examination , blood urine test , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) determine extent severity disease . MRI scan us strong magnetic field radio wave show structural chemical change brain . During procedure , patient lie table narrow cylinder contain magnetic field . He speak staff member via intercom system time procedure . Patients also lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) examine cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , bath brain spinal cord . To obtain fluid , local anesthetic administer needle inserted space bone low back CSF circulate spinal cord . A small amount fluid collect needle . Although spinal fluid examine regularly , test may request clinic visit . X-rays , nuclear medicine scan consultation may obtain need . Other test may include electroencephalogram ( brain wave recording ) , psychological test , speech language rehabilitation evaluation . A skin biopsy may do grow cell culture metabolic genetic test analyze skin microscope . For biopsy , area skin numb anesthetic small circular area remove , use sharp cookie cutter-type instrument . First degree relative ( parent , child sibling ) patient metabolic disorder unknown cause ask provide blood sample DNA study try identify genetic basis disorder . The study expect continue 3 year , yearly monitoring patient change neurological , ophthalmological general medical status .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>On protocol see patient age neurodegenerative disorder unknown etiology , well patient know disease atypical present difficult management problem . Patients know suspected leukodystrophy exclude study . Lack specific diagnosis amplifies distress felt patient family decrease chance effective therapy . Clinical laboratory evaluation include blood , urine , spinal fluid , peripheral tissue pathology radiological study .</detailed_description>
