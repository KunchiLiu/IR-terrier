	<brief_summary>We test new combination medicine , determine could use treat cystic fibrosis ( CF ) . Subjects CF two copy common mutation ( change ) find patient CF call DF508 . CF cause lack chloride movement nose , sinus , lung , intestine , pancreas sweat gland . We conduct study determine safety use combination two medicine , Phenylbutyrate Genistein , improve ability cell line nose regulate movement salt ( chloride ) water people CF . Phenylbutyrate extensively use treat patient rare metabolic disease ( different CF ) , Phenylbutyrate investigational drug purpose study . Genistein naturally occur substance find food product soy tofu , also investigational drug study . Both drug may able restore normal chloride movement body organs gland . We study salt water nose movement technique call nasal transepithelial potential difference ( NPD ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phenylbutyrate/Genistein Duotherapy Delta F508-Homozygous ( Cystic Fibrosis )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects randomize receive either Phenylbutyrate placebo tablet 1 week , 2 3 chance receive Phenylbutyrate standard adult dose , visit study day 1 , 4 , 7 . The study last additional 2 week determine whether effect Phenylbutyrate Placebo persist length time , visit study day 14 21 . Every participant receive Genistein NPD day 1 7 . The dose Genistein use escalate every participant . Safety evaluation visit include history , physical exam mental status exam , blood urine test , lung function test . The main physiologic outcome trial assessment salt water transport NPD . In way , ass whether genistein enhances effect phenylbutyrate improve chloride transport nose topical application genistein nasal mucosa NPD procedure study day 1 7 .</detailed_description>
