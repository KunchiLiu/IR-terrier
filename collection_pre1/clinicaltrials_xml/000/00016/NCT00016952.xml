	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Giving drug different combination may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial compare effectiveness either irinotecan fluorouracil plus leucovorin treating patient metastatic colorectal cancer previously treat oxaliplatin without irinotecan .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan Fluorouracil Plus Leucovorin Treating Patients With Previously Treated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine tumor response rate patient receive irinotecan fluorouracil leucovorin calcium metastatic colorectal cancer previously treat oxaliplatin without irinotecan . - Determine time tumor progression , time treatment failure , overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine toxic effect regimens patient . - Evaluate quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior chemotherapy ( oxaliplatin-based therapy v irinotecan oxaliplatin combination therapy ) . Patients assign one two treatment group . - Group I ( prior oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy ) : Patients receive irinotecan IV 90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week . - Group II ( prior irinotecan oxaliplatin combination chemotherapy ) : Patients receive leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour fluorouracil IV continuously day 1 2 . Treatment repeat every 2 week . - Both group : Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients confirm complete response 2 consecutive course may discontinue treatment investigator 's discretion . Quality life assess baseline , approximately every 6 week treatment , last course treatment . Patients follow every 3 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
