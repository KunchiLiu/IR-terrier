	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effectiveness drug bevacizumab , combination doxorubicin docetaxel , improve survival patient inflammatory breast cancer locally advance breast cancer . Inflammatory breast cancer aggressive form locally advance breast cancer often cause red , swollen , tender breast associate poor prognosis . Bevacizumab block growth new blood vessel supply oxygen nutrient tumor , therefore , may kill cancer cell stop growth . Doxorubicin docetaxel approve drug treat breast cancer . Patients 18 year age old stage inflammatory breast cancer treat chemotherapy radiation therapy may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood urine test , chest x-ray , electrocardiogram , MUGA scan echocardiography ( see ) . A mammogram breast , dynamic MRI imaging affect breast , compute tomography ( CT ) head , chest , abdomen pelvis , bone scan do determine extent disease . Participants undergo follow procedure various interval , and/or complete chemotherapy : Tumor skin biopsy study effect bevacizumab tumor blood vessel , tumor growth , biology inflammatory breast cancer . A small piece tumor tissue small piece skin affect breast remove local anesthesia microscopic study . Dynamic MRI examine change blood vessel breast cancer follow bevacizumab treatment . This test involve inject contrast liquid vein scan . A standard MRI scan do dynamic MRI . Blood test do 1 ) study clot formation breakdown , 2 ) measure level VEGF ( substance produce breast cancer cell ) VCAM-1 ( substance produce cell line blood vessel wall ) , 3 ) check blood count liver kidney function . MUGA ( nuclear medicine scan check heart 's pump ability ) echocardiogram ( ultrasound scan heart evaluate heart function . Blood pressure monitor Urine test CT scan x-rays evaluate disease treatment . Patients central venous line ( plastic tube ) place major vein chest begin treatment . The line stay body entire treatment period use give chemotherapy medication , need , draw blood sample . All treatment give single day every 3 week . This constitute one treatment cycle . Cycle 1 consist bevacizumab alone ; cycle 2 7 consist bevacizumab doxorubicin docetaxel . During cycle , patient also receive injection skin G-CSF , drug raise number infection-fighting white blood cell , often decreased side effect chemotherapy . After cycle 7 , patient may require surgery radiation radiation alone . After radiation treatment , bevacizumab re-started , give alone every 3 week additional eight cycle . Patients whose tumor positive estrogen progesterone receptor advise take drug tamoxifen anastrozole 5 year decrease chance disease recurrence . This would begin cycle 8 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Treat Inflammatory Breast Cancer Locally Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study patient previously untreated inflammatory breast cancer ( IBC ) locally advanced breast cancer ( LABC ) evaluate angiogenesis parameter treatment rhuMAb VEGF - recombinant humanize monoclonal antibody vascular endothelial growth factor ( bevacizumab ) . The challenge new molecular-targeted anti-angiogenesis therapy devise appropriate reliable marker monitor efficacy . This may achieve directly evaluate change angiogenesis parameter tumor sample . The use less invasive surrogate marker assess efficacy anti-angiogenic therapy preferable . This may include functional change tumor vasculature assess use non-invasive method magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) determination change circulate soluble marker angiogenesis . Most breast cancer express VEGF thus make ideal disease treatment anti-angiogenesis therapy . This study evaluate effect bevacizumab angiogenesis parameter molecular functional . The first cycle consist bevacizumab alone follow six cycle bevacizumab combination doxorubicin docetaxel ( AT ) . Loco-regional therapy follow bevacizumab recommence eight cycle . Changes pre-designated angiogenesis parameter assess baseline , three week bevacizumab three cycle AT/bevacizumab . The first three molecular parameter : endothelial cell proliferation , endothelial cell apoptosis tissue VEGF require multiple tumor core biopsy obtain use mammotome . The fourth parameter k ( ep ) , redistribution constant obtain use dynamic MRI . To determine variability value three molecular primary angiogenesis parameter , multiple biopsy sample time point . An attempt make correlate four primary angiogenesis parameter time progression/recurrence . The effect bevacizumab alone AT/bevacizumab directly tumor vasculature use dynamic MRI image circulate angiogenesis marker , serum vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 ) three time point prior surgery undertaken exploratory manner . An attempt make correlate change parameter clinical finding change tissue angiogenesis parameter . Additionally , angiogenesis biomarkers also study exploratory manner . Thrombosis factor monitor give increased incidence venous arterial thrombosis see previous clinical trial use bevacizumab . An increase incidence hypertension also see . A subset patient study undergo frequent blood pressure monitor obtain profile effect bevacizumab blood pressure .</detailed_description>
