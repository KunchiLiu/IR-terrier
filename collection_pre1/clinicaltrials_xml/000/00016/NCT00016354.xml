	<brief_title>Benzoylphenylurea Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine maximum tolerate dose benzoylphenylurea patient advance solid tumor . - Evaluate acute chronic toxicity profile regimen patient . - Evaluate pharmacokinetics metabolites regimen potential correlation pharmacodynamic effect patient . - Determine antitumor activity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive oral benzoylphenylurea ( BPU ) weekly . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos BPU maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Once MTD determine , 12 additional patient accrue treated BPU confirm MTD . Patients follow 30 day . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 18-24 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
