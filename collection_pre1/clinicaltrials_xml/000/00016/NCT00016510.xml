	<brief_summary>This study examine difference brain process English Korean native Korean speaker fluent non-fluent English second language . It think people non-fluent second language process second language differently native language-using different area brain require additional work memory . The study increase understanding language acquisition , brain plasticity bilingualism . Native Korean speaker 18 50 year age English second language may eligible study . Three group individual enrol : 1 ) less fluent bilingual - live United States least 1 , less 2 year study English age 12 TOEFL ( Test English Foreign Language ) score 550 ; 2 ) fluent bilingual early acquisition - expose English age 7 live United States ; 3 ) fluent bilingual late acquisition - expose English age 12 live United States age 10 . People history head injury neurological thought disorder , left-handed people , people read material use study exclude study . Participants undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan read word English Korean ; translate one language ; answer question mean word language . MRI use strong magnetic field image brain tissue . The patient lie table slide narrow metal cylinder , scanner . The head restrain gently foam pad limit movement . The patient see scanner mirror contact technician via intercom time procedure . The scan measure blood flow different part brain , provide information brain region use task perform . Another scan do obtain detailed picture brain 's structure . This study evaluate usefulness MRI identify brain area involve process different language increase knowledge illness affect brain function . It may help plan treatment bilingual patient must undergo brain surgery uncontrolled epilepsy neurological disorder affect different language vary degree .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This protocol use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) examine localization verbal work memory translation system normal volunteer speak English second language . Several important issue area language acquisition , cortical plasticity , bilingualism advance increase understand multiple language represent brain . There also increase number bilingual patient need undergo surgical intervention , particularly uncontrolled epilepsy , suffer variety neurological disorder affect different language vary degree . It important accurately assess localize language function patient . This study identify cortical area activate immediate translation word sentence native second language , well difference verbal work memory system two language . It also evaluate difference verbal work memory translation system among subject different proficiency different age acquisition second language . This study advance understand cortical representation underlies multiple language function .</detailed_description>
