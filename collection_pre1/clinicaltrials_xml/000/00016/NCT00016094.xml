	<brief_title>S0108 Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate 6-month progression-free survival rate patient relapse aggressive NHL treat single agent bevacizumab therapy . II . To evaluate response rate toxicity patient relapse aggressive NHL treat regimen . III . To measure tumor VEGF VEGF receptor 1 2 expression ( Flt-1 Flk-1/KDR ) explore correlation expression level histology response . IV . To measure pre-therapy , week 8 time progression biologic measure VEGF activity include plasma VEGF level , urinary VEGF level , circulate number endothelial cell explore correlation response . OUTLINE : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day maximum 24 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 6 month 3 year</detailed_description>
