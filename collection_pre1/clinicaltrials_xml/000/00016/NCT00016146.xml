	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines may make body build immune response kill tumor cell . Biological therapy use different way stimulate immune system stop cancer cell grow . Combining vaccine therapy biological therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase I trial study effectiveness combine vaccine therapy biological therapy treat patient relapsed prostate cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine optimal ( term antibody response ) safe dose range glycosylated MUC-2-Globo H-KLH conjugate vaccine adjuvant GPI-0100 patient biochemically relapsed prostate cancer . - Assess post-immunization change prostate-specific antigen level objective parameter disease patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study GPI-0100 . Patients receive glycosylated MUC-2-Globo H-KLH conjugate vaccine adjuvant GPI-0100 subcutaneously weekly week 0-2 , 6 , 14 , 26 absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Cohorts 5 patient receive escalate dos GPI-0100 optimal dose , base antibody response , reach . Patients follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
