	<brief_title>Flavopiridol Treating Patients With Unresectable Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine confirm unconfirmed complete partial response patient unresectable metastatic renal cell cancer treat flavopiridol . - Determine 6-month time treatment failure rate overall survival rate patient treat drug . - Determine qualitative quantitative toxic effect drug patient population . - Determine , preliminary manner , association tumor response pretreatment tumor proliferative apoptotic rate patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive flavopiridol IV 1 hour day 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-35 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
