	<brief_title>Linkage Study Familial Pulmonary Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Familial pulmonary fibrosis ( FPF ) rare , progressive , life-threatening disease . Although far definitive , several line evidence suggest could involve genetic susceptibility expression may modify gene-environment interaction involve exposure fibrogenic dust . If specific gene locus involve identified function characterize , study could lead good understand etiology disease effective intervention strategy among family increase risk . It conceivable genetically influence pathologic mechanism involve may share , common form pulmonary fibrosis idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) asbestosis . Thus , study could lead early identification individual susceptible reversible interstitial lung disease development novel therapeutic approach . Familial pulmonary fibrosis indistinguishable pathologically idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis appear inherit autosomal dominant trait variable penetrance ; pulmonary fibrosis associate pleiotropic genetic disorder , Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome , neurofibromatosis , tuberous sclerosis , Neimann-Pick disease , Gaucher 's disease , familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia ; pulmonary fibrosis frequently observe autoimmune disease , include rheumatoid arthritis systemic sclerosis ; variable susceptibility evident among worker report expose occupationally similar concentration fibrogenic dust ; inbred strain mice differ susceptibility fibrogenic dust . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study use standard genetic methodology ( linkage analysis ) investigate distribution polymorphisms anonymous genetic marker family familial pulmonary fibrosis . The comprehensive genome-wide study , use standard genetic marker , allow identification loci subsequently may prove contain novel gene play role pathogenesis pulmonary fibrosis . Once genetic locus define familial pulmonary fibrosis , candidate gene identify basis positional functional criterion . Moreover , approach provide basic information high priority loci applicable rapidly evolve dense human transcript map pulmonary fibrosis family two case pulmonary fibrosis . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
