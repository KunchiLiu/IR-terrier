	<brief_summary>Some patient take anti-HIV drug part highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) show HIV blood ; however , HIV remain hidden body , drug stop , return blood . The purpose study determine short period stop HAART increase activity CD8 CD4 cell ( cell immune system fight infection ) , repeat stop drug longer period time restart increase effectiveness HAART , increase immune system activity result stop treatment lead low level HIV time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Some HIV infect patient take HAART able achieve prolong suppression HIV viral load extend period time . However , discontinue HAART consistently result HIV 's return plasma . Both CD8 CD4 cell markedly reduce individual prolong HIV suppression ; control response cell-associated HIV dependent immune-mediated mechanism involve cell . It hypothesize brief low-level increase HIV level result HAART interruption might boost HIV-specific CD8 CD4 T-cell count . After suppression viral load reintroduction HAART , expand CD8 population might able good control viral replication well respond cell-associated HIV . Future treatment interruption may lead long period undetectable viral load . Patients divide 2 age cohort , Cohort 1 consist child adolescents 4 year old 21 year age , Cohort 2 consist child adolescents 2 year old 4 year age . Patients assign one 2 group . Group A patient participate drug holiday cycle HAART back HAART ; Group B control group remain continuous HAART throughout study . Cycle 1 Group A patient begin 18 day HAART 3-day drug holiday . At end drug holiday , viral load measure HAART resume 28 day ( detectable virus cycle ) viral load detectable drug holiday . If viral load remain level detection , patient begin next drug holiday cycle . With subsequent drug holiday cycle , time HAART increase 2 day . Patients fail 4 repeat detectable virus ( 28-day treatment ) cycle take study . Patients enrol study minimum 142 week . For Group A , HIV viral load CD4 cell count measure end drug holiday HAART resumption ; HIV-specific CD4 CD8 response measure every 3 cycle ; cell-associated HIV assess entry , 12-week interval , end study . For Group B , physical exam conduct HIV viral load blood work measure every 12 week .</detailed_description>
