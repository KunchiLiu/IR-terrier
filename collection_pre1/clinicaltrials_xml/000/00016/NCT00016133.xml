	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines make patient 's white blood cell tumor cell may make body build immune response kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining vaccine therapy chemotherapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase I/II trial study effectiveness vaccine therapy combine leucovorin fluorouracil treat patient undergone surgery completely remove stage II stage III colon cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety immunogenicity adjuvant autologous tumor cell vaccine patient completely resect stage II III adenocarcinoma colon . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord disease stage ( II v III ) . Beginning 28-35 day total surgical resection , patient receive adjuvant autologous tumor cell vaccine intradermally weekly 3 vaccination . The first 2 vaccination also contain BCG . Patients stage II disease receive fourth vaccination 6 month surgical resection . Beginning 10-17 day third vaccination , patient stage III disease receive adjuvant leucovorin calcium IV fluorouracil IV day 1-5 . Chemotherapy continue every 28-35 day total 6 course . These patient also receive fourth vaccination 1 month completion chemotherapy . Patients follow 90 day 6 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
