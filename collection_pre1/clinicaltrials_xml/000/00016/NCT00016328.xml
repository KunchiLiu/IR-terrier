	<brief_title>CCI-779 Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine efficacy CCI-779 , term percentage patient progression-free 6 month , time progression , time death , patient recurrent glioblastoma multiforme . II . Determine toxic effect drug patient . III . Correlate molecular alteration tumor patient response treatment drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord concurrent P450 anticonvulsant use ( yes v ) . Patients receive CCI-779 IV 30 minute weekly 4 week . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 6 month 5 year annually 10 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 63 patient accrue study within 39 month .</detailed_description>
