	<brief_summary>Patients consider participation NCI Pediatric Oncology Branch research study screen eligibility protocol . For every NCI research study , patient must meet defined medical criterion order ensure integrity research study maximize patient safety . Tests procedure require determine eligibility depend specific study patient consider . Some common test procedure : - History physical examination - Blood urine sample routine laboratory test possibly research study - Quality life assessment questionnaire - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan use magnetic field radio wave produce picture body structure , include tumor - Computerized tomography ( CT ) scan us radiation produce multiple detailed picture body structure - X-rays us radiation provide single picture body part - Nuclear medicine scan use chemical tag radioactive substance detect tumor , measure kidney heart function , monitor flow cerebrospinal fluid ( fluid bathe brain spinal cord ) - Electrocardiogram ( EKG ) use electrode place skin evaluates heart rate rhythm measure electrical impulse heart - Echocardiogram us high-frequency sound wave evaluate heart structure function - Lumbar puncture test cancer cell substances cerebrospinal fluid . Involves place needle low back bone spine withdraw fluid sample fluid-containing space spinal cord - Ommaya reservoir surgically implant catheter insert fluid-filled ventricle brain , use withdraw spinal fluid sample give medication - Eye examination vision test eye examination - Biopsies removal small piece tissue , needle surgery , examination microscope . An area skin biopsy site numb anesthetic . For needle biopsy , needle inserted tumor , tissue bone marrow pull small sample . A surgical biopsy may do operating room , clinic , hospital room , depend biopsy location . The tissue tumor remove cut small piece sharp knife scalpel area close suture staple .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - Patients , screen POB research protocol , undergo series test procedure determine protocol eligibility prior entry onto primary research protocol - In case , specific research sample require primary research protocol may becollected screen process order prevent subject patient painful procedure multiple occasion . - Performing invasive procedure sole purpose obtain tissue specimen body fluid research purpose often ethically justifiable child , yet specimens need advance knowledge childhood cancer . Therefore , critical obtain tissue fluid sample future research procedure perform clinical indication . OBJECTIVES : - Evaluate patient eligibility participation POB research protocol . - Collect clinical data , medical history clinical laboratory result serve baseline value subsequent research protocol . - Procure residual tissue fluid remain test procedure perform clinical indication ( e.g. , diagnosis treatment cancer ) screen process treatment follow-up primary POB research protocol . These specimen transfer subsequent research protocols IRB-approved research study store future research study . ELIGIBILITY : - Children young adult evaluate treated protocol within Pediatric Oncology Branch . - Patients parents/guardians refuse participate tissue procurement portion protocol still participate screen eligibility POB research trial . DESIGN : - Patients evaluate POB primary research protocol enter onto screen tissue procurement protocol eligibility screen collection tissue specimen . - Procedures do may include , limited , laboratory test blood , CSF , urine , specimens ; pulmonary function test ; TB skin test ( control ) ; subspecialty consultation ; molecular diagnostics tumor tissue PCR Ewing rhabdomyosarcoma , HLA , IHC , FISH ; radiographic nuclear medicine study , may require administration contrast radioisotopic tracer ; needle open biopsy diagnostic purpose . - Tissues body fluid obtain screen process time treatment follow-up primary POB research protocol discard stored future research purpose consent patient his/her parent guardian , patient eligible elect enroll primary research protocol . These specimen store patient identifier , IRB approval request prior perform research tissue fluid sample identifier remove ( unlinked ) exemption request OHSR .</detailed_description>
