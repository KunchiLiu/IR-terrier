	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safe give patient shot mixture vaccine dendritic cell ( DCs ) , special kind immune cell , safe give shot vaccine alone . Current HIV vaccine strong enough give good immune response . Research show immune response vaccine deliver DCs great response without DC delivery . A5130 study seek give good delivery vaccine important immune cell body .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety/Immunogenicity Immunizations ALVAC-DC-SC v ALVAC-SC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte ( CTL ) responses important viral destruction thereby protective immune response viral infection . Current HIV vaccine consistently elicit strong CTL response . The limited immune response current HIV vaccine could attribute , addition cause , failure vaccine reach appropriate cell initiate robust immune response . DCs particularly effective stimulate primary T-cell-dependent immunity . Antigen-bearing DCs use adjuvant active immunotherapy human , particularly increase host resistance tumor certain viral infection . A5130 exploratory , proof-of-concept study seek ensure adequate delivery vaccine important antigen-presenting cell . Patients randomize 1 2 vaccination group entry . Group A : Patients receive SC vaccination DCs infect ALVAC-HIV vCP1452 . DC exposure KLH occur Weeks 3 7 . Leukopheresis occur entry . Group B : Patients receive SC vaccination ALVAC-HIV vCP1452 without DCs . KLH injection administer Weeks 3 7 . Patients group receive vaccination Weeks 3 , 7 , 15 . This study consist 4 step patient necessarily qualify enter Step II , Step III , Step IV . Step I : vaccination phase . Step II : withdrawal potent ART . Step III : optional discontinuation ART . Step IV : reinitiation ART . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 04/10/02 : Step V : follow-up period potent ART . ]</detailed_description>
