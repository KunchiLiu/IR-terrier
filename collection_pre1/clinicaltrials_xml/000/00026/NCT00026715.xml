	<brief_summary>This study test accuracy new `` Fast GFR '' ( glomerular filtration rate ) test evaluate kidney function . Accurate assessment kidney function important many clinical situation , include detect kidney disease early , determine appropriate drug dosage , decide begin dialysis , evaluate heart kidney organ donor recipient . The current GFR test use mostly research purpose , costly complicate general medical use . Another significant drawback use diagnose acute kidney failure time take ( 3 24 hour ) complete , since effective therapy condition require detection soon possible . The Fast GFR , comparison , take 45 minute . Patients 6 year old old kidney disease impair kidney function cause abnormal heart function swelling-from congestive heart failure , severe infection , swell fluid accumulation , fluid abdomen , burns-may eligible study . Patients undergo standard Fast GFR test , describe , evaluate accuracy new test . Fast GFR : Two catheter ( thin flexible tube ) place two arm vein , one inject iothalamate-an agent commonly use CT scan blood vessel imaging-and collect blood sample . Baseline blood urine sample collect 0.5 milliliter ( ml ) iothalamate inject vein . Blood sample collect 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 30 , 45 minute adults 5 , 15 , 45 minute child . Urine collect 45 minute . The size bladder measure use ultrasound determine bladder completely empty . Standard GFR : Iothalamate ( 1 ml ) inject skin . Blood sample collect 60 , 90 , 120 , 180 240 minute . ( A heparin lock use avoid multiple needle stick . ) Urine collect 60 , 90 , 120 , 180 240 minute . The size bladder measure use ultrasound determine bladder completely empty .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Accurate measurement renal function require detect treat renal dysfunction . The glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) widely use test measure renal function research study . However , current GFR test lengthy , costly , complicated general use clinical setting . At present time , therapy acute renal failure generally unsatisfactory . However , likely effective therapy need give early course acute renal failure . We recently develop simple Fast intravenous GFR test perform 45 minute may assist identification patient early stage acute renal failure . This test validate ambulatory adult chronic renal failure . The current protocol compare fast intravenous GFR test reference standard subcutaneous GFR method patient acute renal failure , sepsis , congestive heart failure , edema , chronic renal failure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Both male female subject recruit without regard race ethnic origin . Suspected renal dysfunction base upon : Acute renal failure elevate serum creatinine ( least 50 % increase within 24 hour precede enrollment ) without stabilization recovery , despite optimization hemodynamic fluid status correction know pharmacologic , prerenal , postrenal etiologic factor , Congestive heart failure clinical criterion ( rale , S3 , pedal edema clinical exam ) , Edema ascites ( clinical exam ) , Sepsis septic physiology ( shock hyperdynamic circulation , suspect sepsis ) , Chronic Renal Failure ( creatinine great 1.3 ) . Patients older 18 year old provide inform consent . Patients young 18 least 6 year old whose parent legal guardian provide inform consent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Inability cooperate study . Known allergy iothalamate iodine contain compound . Urinary tract obstruction . Pregnant woman lactate mother . Patients vascular access secure .</criteria>
