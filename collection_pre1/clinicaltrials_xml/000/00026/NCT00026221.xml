	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study give bevacizumab together interferon alpha see well work compare give bevacizumab alone treat patient metastatic malignant melanoma . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill deliver cancer-killing substance . Interferon alpha may interfere growth cancer cell slow growth tumor . Combining bevacizumab interferon alpha may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab With Without Interferon Alfa Treating Patients With Metastatic Malignant Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare objective response rate progression-free survival patient metastatic malignant melanoma treat bevacizumab without low- high-dose interferon alpha . OUTLINE : This randomize study . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute day 1 . Patients also receive low-dose interferon alpha ( IFN-alpha ) subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1-14 . ARM II : Patients receive bevacizumab arm I . ARM III : Patients receive bevacizumab arm I . Patients also receive high-dose IFN-alpha SC day 1 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 , 12 . In arm , treatment repeat every 14 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo restaging completion course 12 . Patients stable disease clinical response may continue treatment accord assign treatment arm 1 year . Patients stable disease 1 year treatment bevacizumab IFN-alpha ( arm I III ) may continue receive bevacizumab alone every 21 day ( arm II ) absence disease progression . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
