	<brief_summary>Recent study show patient receive state-of-the-art treatment HIV infection ( highly active antiretroviral therapy , HAART ) show discordant response therapy-that , improve clinically immunologically ( increase CD4 immune cell count ) , level HIV blood drop . This study examine blood sample take HIV-infected child treat 2',3'-dideoxyinosine ( didanosine , ddI ) early NCI study determine patient similar discordant response therapy . If , study also examine factor may predictive disease progression survival . Investigators measure HIV level blood specimens child previously enrol NCI protocol 88-C-0129 . The measurement do specimen draw initiation treatment ddI various time course treatment . The viral response therapy correlate short- long-term clinical immunologic outcome . In addition , researcher examine patient ' blood sample additional factor recently discover potentially influence disease progression . They include selenium level certain genetic factor . A good understanding discordant response therapy help physician determine best treatment option situation therapy result show uniform benefit . This protocol involve scientific examination laboratory specimens clinical study open patient enrollment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study examine clinical immunologic data HIV-1 RNA level bank serum specimen HIV-infected pediatric patient previously enrol NCI protocol 88-C-0219 , phase I/II study 2 ' , 3'-dideoxyinosine ( ddI ) . In original study serum p24 antigen use direct measurement viral quantitation . Advances understand HIV pathophysiology demonstrate HIV-1 RNA level measure quantitative RNA PCR far superior molecular tool assess viral replication burden vivo . Analysis clinical , HIV-1 RNA CD4 responses perform identify patient discordant surrogate marker response therapy , define : improvement immunologic parameter set virologic non-response failure . Correlation make short long term clinical outcome . Following initial analysis identify patient discordant response , selenium level , viral genotypic phenotypic profile resistance ddI , vitro viral fitness examine . These biologic parameter recently determine potentially play important role clinical , immunologic virologic HIV-related outcome . Parameters examine subset patient follow surrogate marker response profile : . ) immunologic virologic responder ; b . ) immunologic virologic non-responders ; c. ) discordant immunologic virologic responder . Specimens ddI monotherapy study choose analysis substantial body clinical immunologic data available patient 7 year .</detailed_description>
