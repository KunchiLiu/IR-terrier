	<brief_title>Hepatic Arterial Infusion Plus Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Colorectal Cancer Metastatic Liver</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety toxicity hepatic arterial infusion floxuridine dexamethasone follow systemic therapy oxaliplatin capecitabine patient surgically resect liver metastasis primary colorectal carcinoma . II . Determine 2-year survival rate patient treat regimen . III . Determine 2-year recurrence rate time recurrence patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive floxuridine dexamethasone intra-arterially continuously day 1-14 , oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 22 , oral capecitabine twice daily day 22-35 . Treatment repeat every 6 week 4 course absence disease recurrence unacceptable toxicity . After completion fourth course , patient receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 2 course absence disease recurrence unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 2.5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 15-75 patient accrue study within 9 months-3.25 year .</detailed_description>
