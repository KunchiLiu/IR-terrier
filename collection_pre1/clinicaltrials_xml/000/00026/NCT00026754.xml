	<brief_summary>The purpose protocol provide patient adequate informed consent understand screen test minimal health risk perform evaluate eligibility research study . The protocol make clear patient initial visit intramural clinical program may include screen study medically necessary disease management , do purely research purpose . Patients know suspected diagnosis cancer , HIV infection , skin disorder immunodeficiency consider enrollment National Cancer Institute intramural clinical research protocol participate consent protocol . It inform patient screen test procedure involve minimal risk do research purpose , include blood test , electrocardiogram , standard X-rays ( e.g. , chest X-ray ) , bone film , compute tomography ( CT ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , nuclear medicine study . It explain eligibility screen invasive involve great risk , biopsy , require separate consent .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Screening Patients NCI Protocol Eligibility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Patients evaluate Center Cancer Research protocols must screen determine whether meet eligibility criterion prior enrollment . - Performing invasive procedure sole purpose obtain tissue specimens biological fluid research purpose often ethically justifiable human subject , yet specimens need advance knowledge variety cancer . Therefore , critical obtain tissue biological fluid sample future research procedure ( e.g. , surgical excision , diagnostic biopsy ) perform clinical indication population . Objectives : - Evaluate patient eligibility participation NCI/CCR research protocol . - Collect result screen test use subsequent research protocol baseline ( e.g. , pretreatment ) value . - Collect specific research sample require primary research protocol part screen test procedure order avoid subject patient painful procedure multiple occasion . - Procure residual tissue fluid remain test procedure perform clinical indication ( e.g. , diagnosis treatment cancer ) screen process treatment follow-up primary NCI/CCR research protocol . These specimen store future research study . Eligibility : - Patients evaluate treated protocol within CCR . Design : - This protocol research study - Screening test procedure require primary research protocol conduct order establish eligibility protocol . - In case specific research sample require primary research protocol may collect screen process order avoid subject patient painful procedure multiple occasion . - Tissues biological fluid obtain screen process time treatment follow-up primary CCR research protocol store . Residual biological fluid obtain test procedure consider clinically indicated diagnosis treatment patient 's cancer related disease . - Once patient completes screen process enter onto another study may remain study allow screen trial future tissue procurement portion trial .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients evaluate treated protocol within CCR . All patient legal guardian ( patient &lt; 18 year age ) must sign document inform consent indicate understanding research nature risk procedure perform assess eligibility research protocol . Patients parents/guardians refuse participate tissue procurement portion protocol still participate screen eligibility CCR research trial . A Durable Power Attorney offer patient &gt; 18 year age potentially cognitively impaired . EXCLUSION CRITERIA :</criteria>
