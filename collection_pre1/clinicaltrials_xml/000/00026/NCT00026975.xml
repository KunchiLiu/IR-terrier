	<brief_summary>This study design develop predictive model development wound complication patient undergo laryngectomy surgery laryngeal/adjoining structure cancer , evaluate clinical efficacy hyperbaric oxygen prevention/management wound complication previously irradiate population . The eligibility profile welcome involvement patient need laryngectomy newly diagnose cancer fail chemoradiation . Patients afford opportunity care distinguish head &amp; neck surgeon hyperbaric medicine physician University Pennsylvania Philadelphia , old teach medical facility country , well Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center . In addition , participant contribute body research uncover new method assessment tissue/tumor oxygenation , model promote early wound complication identification , confirm role hyperbaric oxygen therapy care prevention problem wound .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Clinical Outcomes Modeling Laryngectomy Surgery Patients Efficacy Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy , Ara Chalian , MD Project Leader , develop predictive model surgical risk among patient require laryngectomy due cancer , validate model ass efficacy HB02 therapy improve outcome . The focus determine patho-physiological basis heighten surgical risk among post-radiation head neck patient efficacy hyperbaric oxygen ( HB02 ) therapy improve outcome . This multidisciplinary center investigate mechanism action , safety , clinical efficacy Hyperbaric Oxygen ( HB02 ) Therapy . The group evaluate HB02 therapy benefit patient must undergo laryngectomy reconstructive surgery radiation therapy , pharmacological dos , oxygen augments angiogenesis impedes specific type intercellular adherence . The project test two hypothesis : ( 1 ) Predictive model develop sub-groups head neck cancer patient undergo surgery base tumor specific site , previous treatment , co-morbidity predict patient complication ( wound infection fistula ) , ( 2 ) HB02 give standard protocol modify tissue hypoxia vascularity present patient previous radiation therapy neck recurrent secondary cancer require laryngectomy . The specific aim : ( 1 ) develop detailed database model predict risk develop post-operative complication complex head neck aerodigestive tract cancer resection , ( 2 ) conduct prospective validation predictive model use data patient treat University Pennsylvania Head Neck Cancer Center , ( 3 ) determine whether hyperbaric oxygen therapy alters post-surgical complication rate acute long-term quality life . The study include evaluation clinical parameter , surgical outcome quality life measurement , objective , laboratory-based assessment magnitude hypoxia/vascularization surgical zone tumor provide objective data surgical risk clinical response HB02 therapy . The prospective trial allows plan follow-up data collection model tumor oxygenation assessment patient undergo laryngectomy . The randomized trial treatment trial , compare standard care laryngectomy intervention pre- &amp; post-operative HBO2 conjunction laryngectomy . All patient receive nutritional counseling , speech therapy , comprehensive peri-surgical care .</detailed_description>
