	<brief_summary>Although cause ( ) clinical drug resistance non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) unknown , vitro study suggest abnormality cell cycle mechanism apoptosis may play important role . Clinical study show p53 , bcl-2 tumor proliferation significant effect clinical drug resistance . To investigate role gene control cell cycle apoptosis , wish correlate expression multiple molecular target [ include restrict bcl-2 , BAX , bcl-6 , MIB-1 , p53 , p21 , p27 , p16 , cyclin D ( 1 ) , cyclin A , cyclin E , mdm-2 , cpp 32 , mcl-1 , EBER-1 , ALK , panel B , T cell lineage marker ] , involve pathway , clinical outcome follow treatment combination chemotherapy . All clinical data tissue sample study come patient previously enrol two protocol initial treatment aggressive lymphoma . No new patient enrol study .</brief_summary>
