	<brief_summary>This study investigate brain area activate vocal motor tic patient Tourette 's syndrome tic disorder . Tics involuntary repetitive movement similar voluntary movement . They may simple , involve muscle simple sound , complex , involve several group muscle orchestrate bout . This study involve simple motor tic , eye blinking , nose wrinkling , facial grimace abdominal tensing , simple vocal tic , throat clearing , sniff snort . Healthy normal volunteer patient 14 65 year age simple motor vocal tic may eligible study . Participants brief medical history physical examination magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain . MRI use magnetic field radio wave produce image . For procedure , subject lie table move cylindrical chamber contain strong magnet . Earplugs worn muffle loud thump sound make electrical switching radio frequency circuit protect temporary hearing impairment . During scan , normal volunteer ask make simple movement sound design imitate tic , raise eyebrow , blink cough . Patients tic disorder two part scan session . First relax allow tic occur spontaneously , ask imitate specific tic urge tic . Patients healthy subject electromyography ( EMG ) record time voluntary movement tic . For procedure , several pair small , saucer-like electrode attach skin gel paste . Electric signal electrodes amplify record computer . A microphone may place near patient record vocal tic . A video camera may also use record tic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine area brain responsible motor tic patient tic disorder include Tourette 's Syndrome Chronic Motor Vocal Tic Disorder . Previous study do look brain activity tic use electroencephalography ( EEG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) . 16 adult patient DSM-IV-TR ( American Psychiatric Association 2000 ) diagnosis tic disorder frequent tic study . We utilize blood oxygenation level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging ( BOLD fMRI ) patient tic experience spontaneous tic voluntarily imitate tic . The differential activation tic voluntary movement may shed light region brain responsible generation tic .</detailed_description>
