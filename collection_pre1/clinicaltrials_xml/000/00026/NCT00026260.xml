	<brief_title>SU5416 Treating Patients With Persistent Recurrent Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine antitumor cytostatic activity SU5416 , term 6-month progression-free survival time progression , patient persistent recurrent cervical squamous cell carcinoma . - Determine nature degree toxicity drug patient . - Correlate surrogate endpoint molecular imaging marker clinical outcome patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive SU5416 IV 1 hour day 1 4 . Treatment repeat weekly absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 19-51 patient accrue study within 8-23 month .</detailed_description>
