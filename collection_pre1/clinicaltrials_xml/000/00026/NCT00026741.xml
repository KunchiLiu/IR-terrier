	<brief_summary>This study examine production protein call chemokines inflammatory skin reaction . It think chemokines attract recruit white blood cell blood stream skin skin injury infection , cause inflammation . This study examine chemokine production induce inflammatory reaction try gain good understand white blood cell attract inflamed area body . Healthy normal volunteer 33 60 year old may eligible study 1 ) history chronic skin disease ; 2 ) allergic egg ; 3 ) tend form large irregular scar trauma skin , example , cut , scratch surgical incision . Candidates ask short series question limit skin examination . Participants 10 ml ( 2 tablespoon ) blood drawn arm vein start end 5-day study undergo follow procedure : 1 . Day 1 - Participants receive injection right upper arm mumps antigen ( protein commonly used test immunization mumps ) injection `` vehicle '' ( saline plus preservative thimerosal , glycine formaldehyde ) leave upper arm . 2 . Day 3 - Participants develop swell mumps antigen large 5 mm wide receive another injection antigen right arm another injection vehicle leave arm . Those whose swell great 5 mm exclude study point . 3 . Day 5 - All four injection site , plus another site leave upper arm biopsied . For procedure five injection area numb local anesthetic . A punch biopsy instrument resemble small cookie cutter ( one-third diameter dime ) insert one-fifth inch deep skin tissue remove . Two stitch use close wound . Antibiotic bandage apply 5 day . Nine day biopsy participant return NIH removal stitch . New molecular biology technique use measure change chemokine production biopsied tissue .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In skin , T lymphocytes critical modulators effector acquire defense response delayed-type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) . T lymphocytes leukocyte recruit challenged site via interaction selectins , integrins , immunoglobulin gene superfamily molecule ligand , cytokine include large grow chemokine group . Endogenous proinflammatory agent Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNF ) -alpha Interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) modulate lymphocyte recruitment via up-regulation endothelial adhesion molecule chemokines . In vitro evidence suggest endothelial cell-derived chemokines may play crucial role induce firm arrest leukocytes endothelial cell prior transmigration . However , investigation expression pattern regulation chemokines human skin limit . Our goal qualitatively quantitatively investigate change chemokine expression pattern human skin use DTH response mumps antigen model T cell mediate immunological response . We study effect intradermal injection mumps antigen cutaneous chemokine expression healthy human volunteer five-day period . Skin biopsy treat mock-treated area obtain process state-of-the-art , real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis mRNA chemokines related molecule interest . Routine immunohistological analysis chemokine receptor , chemokines , cytokine cell marker fix frozen tissue also perform attempt correlate chemokine expression pattern influx leukocyte subset skin . Our hypothesis chemokines up-regulated , kinetics expression pattern individual chemokines may identical , thus possibly account differential recruitment T lymphocytes leukocyte course DTH response . Chemokine expression determine quantitative RT-PCR compare result obtain semi-quantitatively immunohistochemical staining . This study may increase understand pathogenic mechanism inflammatory disease characterize recruitment T lymphocytes , thus possibly identify target treatment cutaneous inflammatory disease psoriasis .</detailed_description>
