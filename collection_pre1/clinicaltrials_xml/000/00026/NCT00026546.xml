	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine brain control motor activity child attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) . The inability control one behavior important symptom many psychiatric illness . The stop signal paradigm involve withhold motor response go signal , prove useful assess uncontrolled behavior child ADHD disorder . This study use stop signal paradigm order evaluate ability child without ADHD control motor behavior . A magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan use study brain work specific activity . This study evaluate stop signal paradigm three group people : healthy child , child ADHD , healthy adult . This study comprise two sub-studies : behavioral study participant perform simple activity MRI study . Participants ask stop over-the-counter medication 5 day enter behavioral MRI study . Children ADHD ask stop take medication ADHD 72 hour study . All participant medical history psychiatric evaluation ( child , parent child provide information assessment ) . Participants MRI study also physical examination blood urine test . All child undergo intelligence test ; ADHD test confirm diagnosis . The parent child participant complete autism screen questionnaire .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The inability exert appropriate inhibitory control one 's behavior important symptom many psychiatric illness . The stop signal paradigm , involve withhold prepotent motor response signal , prove useful assess deficit child range disorder , particularly attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) . In order adapt paradigm use fMRI study , important address two methodological issue : 1 ) substitution visual stop signal commonly-employed auditory stop signal , 2 ) fact , traditional stop task ( subject withholds motor response stop signal ) , correct trial involve motor response whereas incorrect trial . The latter problem address use stop-change task ( subject execute alternative motor response stop go signal ) . The first aim protocol compare behavioral data stop stop-change task control adult , control child , child ADHD . These data use test hypothesis , paradigm , child ADHD show inhibitory deficit compare control child , control child show inhibitory deficit compare control adult . The second aim protocol conduct pilot fMRI study stop stop-change task control adult . The study event-related design test hypotheses ventral prefrontal activation great successful unsuccessful stop ( stop-change ) trial , stop stop-change trial associate anterior cingulate right inferior frontal activation go trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : CONTROL SUBJECTS : Male female subject two age cohort recruit : 716 1845 year . Subjects must free current past psychopathology medicationfree . The 716 year old gender match ADHD subject . ADHD SUBJECTS : Male female subject age 716 currently meet DSMIV criterion ADHD . The diagnosis make basis KSADSPL interview parent score great 65 hyperactivityimpulsivity subscale Connors Teacher Scale . With exception symptom sign attributable ADHD , Oppositional Defiant Disorder , Learning , Communication Disorders , Elimination Disorders , Separation Social Anxiety Disorders , subject must free current past psychopathology . fMRI STUDY : Subjects age 845 year recruit . Otherwise behavioral study healthy volunteer ADHD participant . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : CONTROL SUBJECTS : I.Q . le 80 ; pregnancy ; ongoing medical illness ; neurological disorder ( include seizure ) ; meet past present criterion diagnosis KSADSPL ( child adolescent ) SCID ( adult ) . ADHD SUBJECTS : I.Q . le 80 ; pregnancy ; ongoing medical illness neurological disorder ADHD ; contraindication discontinue medication 72 hour ; psychiatric disorder sufficiently severe require specific treatment , exception Oppositional Defiant Disorder , Learning , Communication , Elimination Disorders , Separation Anxiety Disorder Social Anxiety Disorder . Explicit exclusion include Pervasive Developmental Disorders , Tourette 's syndrome , conduct disorder , mood Generalized anxiety disorder . fMRI STUDY : I.Q . le 80 ; pregnancy ; ongoing medical illness ; neurological disorder ( include seizure ) ; meet past present criterion diagnosis SCID ; KSADS except ADHD , Oppositional Defiant Disorder , Learning , Communication Disorders , Elimination Disorders , Separation Social Anxiety Disorders ; metallic object body would constitute contraindication fMRI scan .</criteria>
