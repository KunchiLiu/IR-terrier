At start study , patient taper psychiatric medicine begin treatment placebo ( sugar pill formulate look like active drug ) . At point , switch placebo riluzole . In addition , participant undergo follow procedure : - Physical examination electrocardiogram ( EKG ) begin end study , vital sign ( temperature , blood pressure heart rate ) check daily - Weekly 1-hour interview consist psychiatric psychomotor rating scale assess treatment response - Weekly blood test measure blood level riluzole evaluate drug side effect At end study , participant ' psychiatric status reassess appropriate long-term psychiatric treatment arrange .

	<detailed_description>Major affective disorder common , severe , chronic often life-threatening illness . Major depression contribute significant morbidity mortality . Impairment physical social function result depression severe chronic medical illness . Suicide cause death 10-20 % individual either bipolar recurrent depressive disorder . Despite availability wide range antidepressant drug , clinical trial indicate 30 % 40 % patient major depression fail respond first-line antidepressant treatment , despite adequate dosage , duration , compliance . Thus , clear need develop novel improve therapeutic unipolar bipolar depression . Recent preclinical study suggest antidepressant may exert delayed indirect effect glutamatergic system . Furthermore , grow body data suggest mood disorder associate regional volumetric reduction , cell loss atrophy . It thus noteworthy lamotrigine , , among effect reduces glutamate release , antidepressant effect , pilot study suggest NMDA antagonist may antidepressant effect . Together , data suggest glutamatergic system may play role pathophysiology treatment depression , agent , directly reduce glutamatergic neurotransmission , may represent novel class antidepressant . Riluzole , agent Food Drug Administration-approved Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis significant antiglutamatergic neuroprotective property , may prove antidepressant property depress patient . In study , propose investigate potential antidepressant efficacy riluzole , agent reduces glutamatergic throughput via inhibition release , also exert robus neurotrophic effect . This 6-week single-arm , single-blind study examine efficacy safety riluzole patient major depression without psychotic feature . The study two Study Periods . Study Period I washout phase last 7 day . Study Period II monotherapy 6-week acute treatment phase efficacy tolerability riluzole compare baseline . Patients , age 18 60 diagnosis major depression without psychotic feature , pilot study ( single arm , single-blind ) receive riluzole ( 50-200 mg/day ) period 6 week . Acute efficacy determine demonstrate great response rate use specify criterion . Approximately 25 patient enter study obtain 22 subject complete 6 week acute riluzole treatment . Therefore 7/22 patient great great 50 % improvement primary efficacy measure , base statistically guideline Optimal Two Stage Design Clinical Trials , control trial would indicate scientifically confirm signal observe single arm trial .</detailed_description>
