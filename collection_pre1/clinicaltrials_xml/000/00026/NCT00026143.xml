	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate clinical response rate patient metastatic malignant melanoma treat rhIL-12 interferon alfa-2b . II . To estimate progression-free survival patient metastatic malignant melanoma treat rhIL-12 interferon alfa-2b . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To measure serum level interferon-gamma . II . To measure level JAK-STAT signal intermediate patient PBMCs tumor sample . III . To analyze interferon-alpha-induced STAT signal patient PBMCs . IV . To determine expression IFN-regulated gene patient PBMCs tumor tissue . V. To determine pattern gene expression induce treatment IL-12 interferon-alpha use DNA microarray technique patient PBMCs . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive interleukin-12 IV 5-15 second day 1 interferon alfa subcutaneously day 2-6 . Treatment repeat every 2 week absence unacceptable toxicity . Patients reassess 6 course . Patients complete response receive 2 additional course . Patients partial response stable disease continue treatment absence disease progression . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
