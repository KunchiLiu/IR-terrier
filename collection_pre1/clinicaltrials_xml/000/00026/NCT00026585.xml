	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine drug tamoxifen affect brain patient bipolar I disorder . Bipolar Disorder ( BD ) severe , chronic , often life-threatening illness safe effective treatment necessary . The mood stabilize effect lithium valproate revolutionize treatment patient BD . However , significant percentage patient respond fully drug , biochemical basis antimanic mood-stabilizing action lithium valproate unclear . Both drug inhibit protein kinase C ( PKC ) . There need investigate efficacy direct PKC inhibitor treatment acute mania . Tamoxifen currently relatively selective PKC inhibitor available human use . Participants study screened physical , psychiatric , eye examination blood urine test . Eligible participant hospitalize Clinical Center least 4 week . They taper psychiatric medication keep drug free 2 7 day . They also put low-monoamine , low-caffeine diet . Participants randomly assign receive either tamoxifen placebo ( inactive pill ) 3 week . During time , participant daily pulse blood pressure measurement , several electrocardiogram ( EKGs ) , blood draw . Weight measurement take least twice study , caffeine dextromethorphan give begin end study test tamoxifen affect way body eliminate medication . Participants physical examination end study . At end 4-week study , participant may continue study receive tamoxifen additional 3 week . At conclusion study , participant ' psychiatric status reassess long-term psychiatric treatment mood disorder arrange .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Examination Tamoxifen Acute Mania Patients With Bipolar I Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bipolar Disorder ( BD ) common , severe , chronic often life-threatening illness . Suicide cause death 10-20 % individual BD . The discovery lithium 's efficacy mood-stabilizing agent since revolutionize treatment patient BD . However , approximately 50 % patient respond fully lithium , biochemical basis lithium 's antimanic mood-stabilizing action remain fully elucidate . Elucidation mechanism ( ) lithium stabilize underlying dysregulation limbic limbic-associated function also offer potential delineate underlie pathophysiology BD ; however , major problem inherent neuropharmacologic research difficulty attribute therapeutic relevance observe biochemical finding . One powerful approach identify common biochemical target , modify drug belong therapeutic class ( e.g . mood-stabilizing agent ) possess distinct chemical structure administer therapeutically relevant paradigm ( i.e. , effect observe upon chronic drug administration , yet persist beyond abrupt drug discontinuation ) . In context , noteworthy valproic acid ( VPA ) lithium , different chemical structure , belong therapeutic class cause considerable inhibition protein kinase C ( PKC ) . The PKC signal pathway clearly target action two structurally highly dissimilar antimanic agent -- lithium VPA . Do effect lithium VPA PKC signal clinical relevance ? There thus clear need investigate potential efficacy direct PKC inhibitor treatment acute mania . There currently one relatively selective PKC inhibitor available human use- Tamoxifen . Tamoxifen ( TAM ) , synthetic nonsteroidal antiestrogen , widely use treatment breast cancer . TAM 's potent inhibitory effect PKC strike . Recently , group conduct first open-label study TAM acute mania . In study , TAM result significant decrease manic symptom within short period time ( 3-7 day ) . The overarch goal proposal test hypothesis PKC inhibition part mechanism therapeutic effect mood stabilize drug . The proposal derive build publish open-label study TAM acute mania ( Bebchuk et al. , 2000 ) . However , efficacy TAM monotherapy acute mania report open-label study yet evaluate randomize , double blind , placebo-controlled study . Male female patient , age 18 65 , diagnosis bipolar I disorder manic mixed ( without psychotic feature ) , randomize double-blind treatment receive either TAM ( 20-140 mg/day ) placebo , period 3 week . Following acute period , patient receive either open-label TAM treatment clinically indicate . Approximately 50 patient acute mania enrol study . Biochemical measure obtain study .</detailed_description>

We permit patient Durable Power Attorney ( DPA ) participate study . We however , encourage patient sign DPA signing informed consent . However , sign DPA requirement participate study . Patients must diagnosis bipolar I disorder currently display acute manic mixed episode ( without psychotic feature ) accord DSMIV base clinical assessment confirm structured diagnostic interview SCIDP . This include following diagnosis : 296.4x , Bipolar I Disorder , Most Recent Episode Manic ; 296.6x , Bipolar I Disorder , Most Recent Episode Mixed . Patients must YMRS total score great equal 14 Visits 1 2 . No decrease total score YMRS great equal 20 % washout ( Visits 1 2 ) . DSMIV rapid cyclers permit participate study . Duration current manic episode 4 week . Previous trial one follow antimanic agent : lithium , valproate , carbamazepine , oxcarbazepine , typical antipsychotic drug , atypical antipsychotic drug ( olanzapine , risperidone , ziprasidone , aripiprazole , quetiapine ) . If subject previously take one antimanic treatment , research physician may start one NIH . Subjects respond 3 week trial antimanic agent choice ( least 50 % decrease YMRS rating scale baseline ) eligible randomize continue meet study criterion .
