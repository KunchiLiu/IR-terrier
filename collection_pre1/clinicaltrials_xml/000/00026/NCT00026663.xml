	<brief_summary>This study examine blood , bone marrow , tumor tissue sample patient cancer study tumor resistance chemotherapy ( drug treatment ) . Many patient cancer improve initially chemotherapy , disease relapse , tumor long respond treatment . Other patient tumor drug-resistant start . The study look `` resistance factor '' substance blood tissue render tumor resistant chemotherapy . The finding may provide information need develop method combat drug resistance . Patients cancer 18 year old may eligible study . Participants 40 milliliter ( 3 tablespoon ) blood drawn begin study ; additional sample obtain periodically course treatment . A small sample tumor normal tissue take patient undergo surgery tumor biopsy ( removal small piece tumor ) medical reason part research treatment protocol . Patients require surgery biopsy may ask permission obtain tumor sample . Depending location tumor , may do : 1 ) withdraw bone marrow small needle ; 2 ) remove fluid chest abdomen ; 3 ) remove small tumor sample needle ; 4 ) remove sample small incision around tumor . These procedure do low risk patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collection Blood , Bone Marrow , Tumor , Tissue Samples From Patients With Cancer Study Drug Resistance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Ongoing research Experimental Molecular Therapeutics Sections , NCI , require availability blood , serum , tumor , hair follicle tissue sample patient cancer . Resistance underlying cause treatment failure , may present acquired intrinsic drug resistance . Patients cancer frequently present chemotherapy-responsive disease , undergo tumor response , eventually experience relapse , time tumor may refractory treatment . This term acquired drug resistance ; intrinsic resistance implies cancer refractory outset . Diverse mechanisms drug resistance describe often dependent upon particular drug study . Objectives : To obtain blood , serum , tumor , hair follicle normal tissue sample would allow development assay use subsequent clinical trial Eligibility : Patients prior diagnosis malignancy , advanced refractory cancer evaluate Medical Oncology Clinic , NCI . Blood sample hair follicle sample may collect initial visit , follow visit . Tumor sample may obtain fine needle aspirate , removal pleural peritoneal fluid , excisional biopsy , provide tumor accessible minimal risk patient . Patients may , process evaluate research protocol . Patients may receive treatment standard care protocol . Normal volunteer may enroll study collection blood hair follicle sample . Design : Acquired sample record computerized data bank currently exist Molecular Therapeutics Section . No germline test perform sample collect . Tests pilot study relate Section work biology drug resistance cell survival cancer . If research test consider minimal risk patient , separate permission request IRB perform test , new consent obtain . Examples type study perform biopsy drug resistance gene expression assay , goal demonstrate utility assay patient sample . Evaluation method detect drug resistance proteins gene explore , include Northern blot , immunoblot , polymerase chain reaction assay , RNA situ hybridization . With whole blood , may evaluate presence dye transport ex vivo assay , example , use inhibitor ABCG2 . Evidence drug accumulation DNA damage may seek patient mononuclear cell hair follicle sample .</detailed_description>
