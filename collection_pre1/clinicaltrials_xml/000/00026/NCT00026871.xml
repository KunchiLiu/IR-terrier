	<brief_summary>We propose determine response newly develop laser heat , vycor glass fiberoptic radiation dosimetry system ionize radiation clinical radiotherapy environment . Present system measure total dose limitation , instability , non-linearity , excessive size decouple measurement system , make unsuitable variety clinical application . This fiberoptic couple dosimetry system new innovative technology application allow on-line measurement instantaneous dose rate total dose never achievable . It offer clear advantage patient treatment delivery , allow on-line correction essential new generation radiotherapy treatment machine development beam intensity modulation adjunct 3D conformal therapy . It also advantage submillimeter size minimally invasive , make ideal brachytherapy . This system potential stable , accurate , reproducible , clinically feasible measurement total dose dose rate . The output system measure various clinical condition encounter clinical setting compare exist thermolumeniscent diode dosimetry standard . Initial measurement use tissue equivalent phantom depth dose accuracy measurement . Additional study include dosimetric measurement routine clinical treatment setup patient receive therapeutic irradiation .</brief_summary>
