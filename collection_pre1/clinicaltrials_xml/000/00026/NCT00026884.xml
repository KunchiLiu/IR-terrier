	<brief_title>Collection Serum Tissue Samples From Patients With Biopsy-Proved Suspected Malignant Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background - Kidney , prostate , bladder , testis penile cancer account 22 % cancer diagnose United States responsible 10 % cancer deaths year U.S. Understanding gene gene pathway cause genitourinary malignancy provide foundation development target therapeutic agent patient affect cancer . Since 1982 investigator Urologic Oncology Branch study genetic basis urologic cancer . The identification gene cancer kidney lead approval FDA number new agent patient advanced disease . It goal study cancer gene pathway genitourinary malignancy order understand cancer gene pathway cause disease . Objectives - Collection benign malignant tissue patient know suspected cancer . - Collection benign malignant tissue patient rare inherited condition associate increase risk kidney cancer . - Determine molecular genetic difference normal tumorigenic tissue . - Investigate category genes/ biochemical pathway influence cell cycle , angiogenesis , metabolic change , metastatic potential . - Examine protein expression bioimmunoassays investigate potential genetic marker . - Investigate cellular/biochemical response exist novel therapeutic agent . - Investigate quality life men prostate cancer . - Investigate molecular genetic basis urologic malignancy Eligibility - Patients biopsy-proven malignant disease . - Patients suspect malignant disease . - Patients know suspected urologic malignant disorder clinically indicate urologic non-urologic surgical lesion . - Family member patient suspect inherited genitourinary malignancy - Family member patient DNA variant Design - Patients screened eligibility Urologic Oncology Branch Clinic . - Blood urine sample may obtain . - Normal malignant tissue may collect patient undergo clinically indicate surgical procedure . - Basic scientific research perform collected specimen . - Patients option contact result detect would affect health give opportunity evaluate re-tested IRB approve protocol available . - Germline somatic whole genome exome sequencing may perform</detailed_description>
