	<brief_summary>This partially randomized phase III trial study isotretinoin dinutuximab , aldesleukin , sargramostim see well work compare isotretinoin alone follow stem cell transplant treat patient neuroblastoma . Drugs use chemotherapy , isotretinoin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Monoclonal antibody , dinutuximab , may block tumor growth different way target certain cell . Aldesleukin sargramostim may stimulate person 's white blood cell kill cancer cell . It yet know chemotherapy effective without dinutuximab , aldesleukin , sargramostim follow stem cell transplant treat neuroblastoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Isotretinoin With Without Dinutuximab , Aldesleukin , Sargramostim Following Stem Cell Transplant Treating Patients With Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine monoclonal antibody Ch14.18 ( dinutuximab ) + cytokine + isotretinoin ( 13-cis-retinoic acid , RA ) improve event free survival myeloablative therapy stem cell rescue compare RA alone , high risk neuroblastoma patient achieve pre-autologous stem cell transplant ( ASCT ) response complete response ( CR ) , good partial response ( VGPR ) , partial response ( PR ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine monoclonal antibody Ch14.18 + cytokine + isotretinoin ( 13-cis-retinoic acid , RA ) improve overall survival myeloablative therapy stem cell rescue compare RA alone , high risk neuroblastoma patient achieve pre-ASCT response CR , VGPR , PR . II . Determine immunotherapy + RA improve event free survival overall survival compare RA alone , subgroup high risk International Neuroblastoma Staging System ( INSS ) stage 4 neuroblastoma patient achieve pre-ASCT response CR , VGPR , PR . III . Determine toxicities combination monoclonal antibody Ch14.18 cytokine . IV . To compare outcome data patient persistent disease document biopsy ( Stratum 07 ) historical data analogous patient Children 's Cancer Group ( CCG ) -3981 . V. To describe refine event free survival ( EFS ) overall survival ( OS ) estimate baseline characteristic subject receive Ch14.18 + cytokine + RA , follow cessation randomize portion study . VI . To describe safety toxicity Ch14.18 + cytokine + RA new administration guideline implement follow cessation randomize portion study focus : ) number course deliver per subject ; b ) number dose reduction stoppage ( ch14.18 and/or interleukin [ IL ] -2 ) ; c ) number toxic death . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . In subgroup neuroblastoma patient achieve pre-ASCT response CR , VGPR , PR , determine difference two randomize regimen reduce minimal residual disease ( MRD ) burden detect follow parameter : meta-iodobenylguanidine ( MIBG ) scan , immunocytology ( IC ) blood bone marrow sample , reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) tyrosine hydroxylase , phosphoglycolate phosphatase ( PGP ) 9.5 , melanoma antigen family A , 1 ( MAGE-1 ) blood bone marrow . II . Determine change baseline MRD associate event free overall survival . III . Determine whether tumor biology diagnosis correlate event-free overall survival , either randomize regimen . IV . To explore relationship antibody-dependent cellular cytoxicity ( ADCC ) EFS . V. To determine descriptive profile human anti-chimeric antibody ( HACA ) immunotherapy . VI . To determine variability 13-cis-retinoic-acid pharmacokinetics relationship pharmacogenomic parameter determine level and/or genetic variation correlate EFS systemic toxicity . VII . To determine potential effect ch14.18 cardiac repolarization evaluate ch14.18 plasma level . VIII . To determine presence naturally occur anti-glycan antibody correlate allergic reaction blood level ch14.18 . IX . To determine genotype Fc receptor ( FcR ) killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor ( Kir ) /Kir-ligand correlate EFS . X . To determine natural killer cell p30-related protein ( NKp30 ) isoform expression single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) , circulate ligand B7-H6 prognostic EFS OS . OUTLINE : Patients stratify biopsy-confirmed post-ASCT persistent disease also enrol Children 's Oncology Group ( COG ) -A3973 COG-ANBL0532 assign treatment Arm II . Patients first set stratum randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Beginning day 56-85 post-ASCT , patient receive isotretinoin orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) 14 day . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may cross Arm II provide experienced disease progression receive anti-neuroblastoma therapy follow completion isotretinoin therapy . ( close accrual 4/16/2009 ) ARM II : Beginning day 56-85 post-ASCT , patient receive immunotherapy comprising sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) subcutaneously ( SC ) intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour day 0-13 course 1 , 3 , 5 dinutuximab IV 10-20 hour day 3-6 course 1-5 . Patients also receive aldesleukin IV continuously day 0-3 7-10 course 2 4 . Immunotherapy repeat every 28 day 5 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also receive isotretinoin Arm I begin day 11 immunotherapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 10 year .</detailed_description>
