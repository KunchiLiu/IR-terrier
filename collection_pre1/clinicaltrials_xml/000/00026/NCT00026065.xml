	<brief_title>Hypertension : Prediction Biofeedback Success</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In next century , health care system attempt manage chronic illness large age population ever know . Non-adherence pharmacological therapy non-pharmacological therapy prove costly . Hypertension , present 50 million Americans , increase risk cardiovascular disease associate morbidity mortality . Thus critical adherence treatment hypertension increase . While medication effective certain patient , adverse effect make compliance treatment difficult ensure . In addition , person turn alternative medicine deal health problem . Biofeedback offer alternative medical treatment , show reduce systolic diastolic blood pressure and/or allow reduction antihypertensive medication patient , adverse effect . Yet biofeedback therapy time-intensive technician-intensive . Therefore , critical able predict patient essential hypertension likely low his/her blood pressure use technique . This research propose test three different mean predict whether hypertensive subject successful lower his/her blood pressure use biofeedback . Specifically , first set predictive criterion test propose Weaver &amp; McGrady ( 1995 ) . This model derive five variable : heart rate , finger temperature , forehead muscle tension , plasma rennin response furosemide , mean arterial pressure response furosemide . The second prediction model base magnitude circadian variation blood pressure measure 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring . The third prediction model base locus control behavior . A total 60 hypertensive subject study three-year period . The result study enable care hypertensive person recommend treatment ( i.e. , biofeedback ) individualize way , thereby promote adherence .</detailed_description>
