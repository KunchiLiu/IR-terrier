	<brief_summary>The purpose study find substance blood urine indicate person kidney damage . It identify protein find patient acute kidney failure normal healthy people patient volume depletion . Adults child least 3 year old fall one follow four category may eligible study : 1 . Are healthy normal kidney function 2 . Have volume depletion ( condition differs acute kidney failure easily treat fluid ) 3 . Are high risk kidney failure 4 . Have acute kidney failure ( kidney shutdown ) All study participant history physical examination . Up four blood sample 3 tablespoon take laboratory analysis . Urine collect analysis measure urine output . The participant length stay study varies . People normal kidney function study 1 day patient volume depletion study 3 day . The length hospitalization patient high risk kidney failure acute kidney failure depend patient condition medication requirement . The result study may lead development earlier accurate method diagnose acute kidney failure . With early detection , treatment could start early , possibly prevent damage help recovery injury already occur .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The mortality acute renal failure ( ARF ) remain high despite advance supportive care . There establish effective drug therapy , dialysis may promote renal injury via hypotension neutrophil activation . Many agent [ e.g. , mannitol , furosemide , dopamine , Atrial Natrieuretic Peptide ( ANP ) , Insulin-like Growth Factor ( IGF-1 ) , thyroid hormone , etc . ] effective animal model ineffective treat prevent human ARF . The failure agents human ARF may due late enrollment trial ; effective therapy likely require early detection . The objective clinical study identify new biomarkers renal injury , progression recovery analyze urinary protein ARF . We enroll patient ARF , patient high risk ARF , patient volume depletion , patient urinary tract infection , patient chronic kidney disease , normal subject . The diagnosis pre-renal versus renal ARF make routine clinical laboratory test . The level renal dysfunction determine creatinine clearance . Those patient high risk ARF follow prospectively undergo additional testing ARF develop . Patients also study creatinine level return normal . We identify protein and/or microRNA biomarkers unique patient ARF , find normal subject patient volume depletion . It hop protein may form basis new diagnostic test ARF .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects great equal 3 year old . Both male female subject recruit without regard race ethnic origin . Either : Normal ( creatinine level less 1.3 mg/DL adult ; creatinine level less standard nomogram child ) ; OR Oliguria due volume depletion ( indicated oliguria Fractional Excretion Sodium ( FENa ) less 1 % ) ; OR High risk ARF , include surgery , transplantation , nephrotoxic antibiotic , bone marrow transplant ; OR Evidence ARF define acute progressive rise serum creatinine ( least 50 % increase within 24 hour precede enrollment ) without stabilization recovery , despite optimization hemodynamic fluid status correction know pharmacologic , prerenal , postrenal etiologic factor ; OR Urinary tract infection ( serve control ARF study ) ; OR Established chronic kidney failure ( serve control ARF study ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Inability give inform consent cooperate study . Existence condition would complicate implementation interpretation study .</criteria>
