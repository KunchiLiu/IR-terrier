	<detailed_description>Multiple line evidence suggest serotonin1A ( 5-HT1A ) receptor serotonin transporter ( 5-HTT ) function abnormal major depressive disorder ( MDD ) somatic antidepressant treatment effect change function system relevant therapeutic mechanism . The data supporting hypothesis obtain assess neuroendocrine temperature responses 5-HT1A agonist MDD subject , measure 5-HT1A receptor 5-HTT binding brain tissue acquire post mortem small sample MDD subject , examine effect 5-HT1A receptor function rat follow antidepressant drug ( AD ) administration . The recent development highly selective 5-HT1A receptor 5-HTT radioligands positron emission tomography ( PET ) image make direct , noninvasive exploration central serotonin site bind possible . Two study conduct use one , [ carbonyl-11C ] -WAY-100635 , find reduce 5-HT1A receptor bind potential ( BP ) mesiotemporal cortex , raphe , prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) . Pilot data study suggest abnormal reduction 5-HT1A receptor BP prominent bipolar disorder ( BD ) MDD subject ( i.e. , unipolar depressive ) bipolar relative , exist independently mood state . However , data limitation subject sample study preliminary post mortem PET series small , [ carbonyl-11C ] WAY-100635 uptake difficult quantitate PET image . Therefore , observation require replication subject sample large enough establish main effect diagnostic subtype use 5-HT1A receptor radioligand validly quantitated . A selective 5-HT1A receptor radioligand suitable purpose , [ 18F ] FC-WAY100635 ( [ 18F ] FCWAY ) , recently develop NIH . In addition , recently develop selective 5-HTT ligand , [ 11C ] DASB provide unique opportunity image 5-HTT depressed sample . The propose study advance knowledge regard neurobiology mood disorder employ PET [ 18F ] FCWAY [ 11C ] DASB compare 5-HT1A receptor BP mood disorder healthy control subject mesiotemporal cortex , raphe , anterior cingulate gyrus , leave orbital cortex . The following hypothesis , base upon pilot data acquire use [ carbonyl-11C ] -WAY-100636 , test : 1 ) Depressives reduce 5-HT1A receptor bind relative healthy control . 2 ) Bipolar depressives significantly great reduction 5-HT1A receptor bind unipolar depressive unipolar relative . A pilot study bipolar depressive treat lithium divalproex re-imaged test third hypothesis , 5-HT1A receptor bind increase bipolar subject mood stabilizer therapy . Finally , central 5-HT1A receptor density down-regulated rodent corticosterone administration stress-mediated corticosterone secretion , assessment hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis activity ( commonly elevate MDD BD ) , assess determine whether down-regulation 5-HT1A receptor correlate cortisol hypersecretion mood disorder . Because down-regulation may play compensatory role reduce cortisol secretion , neuroendocrine assessment long-standing rather acute hypercortisolism pathophysiological diathesis hypersecrete cortisol emphasize provide sensitive correlate reduce 5-HT1A receptor binding . A medical control group Cushing 's Disease also image determine whether pathological elevation glucocorticoid level down-regulates 5-HT1A receptor expression human , rat .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : MDD SAMPLES : Seventy subject ( age 18 60 ) MDD select additionally meet criterion one 3 subgroup : A ) MDD , Currently depress FPDD , define DSMIV criterion recurrent MDD , currently major depressive episode , first degree relative MDD first degree relative mania , alcoholism , antisocial personality disorder . B ) MDD , Currently remission history FPDD , define period least six month one clinically significant symptom , time subject take AD agent . Subjects thus meet historical criterion recurrent MDD ( DSMIV ) . We also require subject previously least one antidepressant drug trial , ensure severity previous episode warrant treatment . C ) MDD , Currently depress , nonFPDD . To assess specificity finding MDD FPDD , sample meeting criterion MDD , currently depressive episode , FPDD also image . BIPOLAR DEPRESSED SAMPLE : Forty five subject ( age 18 60 ) meet DSMIV criterion bipolar disorder currently major depressive episode . Subjects may inpatients outpatient . Because effective treatment discontinue purpose protocol , subject identify never treat discontinue medication due lack efficacy , noncompliance , physician order reason prior study entry . HEALTHY , LOW RISK , CONTROL SAMPLE : One hundred four subject ( age 18 60 ) meet criterion major psychiatric disorder . The control subject know first second degree relative mood disorder . CUSHINGS DISEASE CONTROL SAMPLE : Ten subject ( age 18 60 ) probable Cushing 's Disease recruit clinical biochemical evidence hypercortisolism ( include urinary free cortisol excretion high upper limit normal ( great 248 ) nmole/day , marked central adiposity , cutaneous atrophy , proximal myopathy , large purple stria ) . The diagnosis probable Cushing 's Disease also establish prior referral via CRH ACTH . MENSTRUALLYRELATED DYSPHORIC DISORDER SAMPLE : ( n equal 12 ; age 1850 ) . These female recruit , screen diagnosed collaboration protocol number 81M0126 , previously approve IRB , entitle 'The Phenomenology Biophysiology Menstrually Regulated Mood Behavioral Disorders ' , principal investigator , David Rubinow , M.D . As described protocol subject must regular menstrual cycle last 21 33 day meet following criterion : 1 ) history within last two year least six month menstruallyrelated mood behavioral disturbance least moderate severity , disturbance distinct appearance associate notable degree subjective distress ; 2 ) 30 percent increase mean negative mood rating ( relative range scale employ ) premenstrual week compare week follow end menses least two three cycle ; 3 ) age 18 50 ; 4 ) pregnant good medical health ; 5 ) regular menses . REMITTED MDD WITH AND WITHOUT A HISTORY OF PPD : ( n=40 ; age 1840 ) . These subject recruit , screen diagnosed collaboration 95M0097 , previously approve IRB entitle An Endocrine Modal Postpartum Mood Disorders . These subject history DSMIV MDD . Twenty also hypomanic/manic episode occur within three month childbirth twenty latter within three month childbirth . Women well minimum one year , regular menstrual cycle least three month , medication free ( include birth control pill ) , history puerperal suicide attempt psychotic episode require hospitalization . Any woman current axis I psychiatric diagnosis exclude participate protocol . HEALTHY FEMALE CONTROLS UNDER 95M0097 : ( n=20 , age 1840 ) . These healthy control woman identical drug administration regimen 40 remit MDD woman similarly recruit screened 95M0097 . They meet criterion specify remitted MDD group past present Axis I diagnosis evidence menstrually related mood disorder . This healthy sample female give birth . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects must take antidepressant medication likely alter monoamine neurochemistry cerebrovascular function least 3 week ( 8 week fluoxetine ) prior scan . Subjects scan two point point twice menstrual cycle must take birth control pills least 6 month prior scan . However , effective medication discontinue purpose study . Instead , subject recruit currently receive psychotropic drug . Subjects also exclude : 1. serious suicidal ideation behavior ; 2. psychosis extent ability provide inform consent doubt ; 3. medical neurological illness likely affect physiology anatomy ; 4. history drug alcohol abuse within 1 year lifetime history alcohol drug dependence ( DSM IV criterion ) ; 5. current pregnancy 6. current breast feeding ; 7. general MRI exclusion criterion ; 8. previous exposure ecstasy ( i.e . MDMA ) neurotoxic effect 5HTT express neuron . Subjects beyond age 50 exclude MRMD sample due perimenopausal status subject beyond age 60 exclude reduce biological heterogeneity encompass MDD criterion , since depressive whose ageat MDDonset later 60 far great likelihood MRI correlate cerebrovascular disease agematched , healthy control agematched , earlyonset depressive . Subjects whose first major depressive episode arise temporally major medical psychiatric condition also exclude , since functional imaging result generally differ report primary MDD .</criteria>
