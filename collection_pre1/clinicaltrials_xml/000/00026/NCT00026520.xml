	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine 6-month progression-free survival rate patient stage IV melanoma treat interferon alfa thalidomide . - Determine confirm unconfirmed complete partial response rate patient measurable disease treat regimen . - Determine quantitative qualitative toxic effect regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive interferon alfa subcutaneously twice daily oral thalidomide daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 2 additional course documentation CR . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 35 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
