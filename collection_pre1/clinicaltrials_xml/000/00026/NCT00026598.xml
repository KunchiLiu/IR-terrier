	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate change brain associate Parkinson 's disease influence control motor think speed . There disagreement whether patient Parkinson 's disease slow think well movement . This study may provide new framework explain relationship motor cognitive aspect human behavior help clarify pathophysiology Parkinson 's disease . There two part study : behavioral test functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . All participant ask medical history , physical examination , complete questionnaire . They must take regular medication , include levodopa dopamine agonist , 8 hour prior study . The behavioral study involve computer-generated neuropsychological task , include hand movement , imagination movement , mental calculation . Response record evaluate . Electrodes may place participant 's skin measure surface electromyogram ( EMG ) . The fMRI study involve MRI scan motor think task perform . Electrodes may place skin monitor muscle activity . Thirty patient , age 40 , early-stage Parkinson 's disease recruit . Sixty normal volunteer age 21-75 include well comparison .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A high-level motor control often require complex process sensory information . Such cognitive aspect motor control suppose share underlie neural component non-motor , cognitive operation . The present study aim clarify similarity difference cognitive processing motor control non-motor , cognitive processing , especially term speed process . From standpoint , patient Parkinson 's disease manifest motor slow well possible cognitive slow provide interest model explore similar control mechanism speed motor non-motor behavioral control . Using psychophysical observation , try clarify normal diseased control motor cognitive speed . Furthermore , use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , explore neural correlate underlie control motor cognitive speed normal brain well pathologic brain . Blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal change measure fMRI , index activity neural population , expect reveal underactivity compensatory overactivity functionally impaired brain area responsible slow movement , thinking , . This study may provide new framework explain relationship motor cognitive aspect human behavior help clarify pathophysiology Parkinson 's disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Imaging method ( e.g. , structural MRI ) may include part prestudy evaluation . PD patient relatively early stage disease must devoid neuropsychiatric symptom , especially dementia . To assure , rat UPDRS ( motor subscale ) standard neuropsychological battery ( e.g. , minimental test ) . Thirty PD patient age 40 high recruit . Patients may male female . Patients ask withhold medication influence central nervous system ( e.g . levodopa ) least 8 hour prior examination . They also ask abstain alcohol 24 hour study . Sixty normal volunteer range 2175 include . Normal volunteer recruit people register HMCS Normal Volunteers . Patients would refer HMCS Clinic . All subject participate MR study valid Clinical Center Medical Record Number . Procedures fMRI experiment follow Standard Operating Procedures HMCS Neuroimaging group . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : PD patient young 40 year exclude study since consider youngonset PD slightly different characteristic typical idiopathic PD . Normal subject young 21 year old also exclude . Patients MRI finding consistent organic brain lesion brain tumor , stroke , trauma AVM 's exclude . Patients progressive neurological disorder PD exclude . Patients history significant medical disorder cancer , require continuous treatment drug antiparkinsonian medication , exclude . Subjects contraindication MRI exclude fMRI part study . We scan pregnant woman safety high magnetic field fetus establish . Therefore , administer urine pregnancy test female subject childbearing potential prior functional MRI scan . Patients capable give informed consent exclude .</criteria>
