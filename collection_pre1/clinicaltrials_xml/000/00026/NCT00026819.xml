	<brief_summary>This study evaluate ability new non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) call rofecoxib prevent pain follow third molar ( wisdom tooth ) extraction . The Food Drug Administration approve rofecoxib 1999 treat symptom arthritis , menstrual cramp , pain . Healthy normal volunteer 16 35 year age general good health require third molar ( wisdom tooth ) extraction may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history oral examination , include dental x-ray need confirm need third molar removal . Participants four wisdom teeth extract , biopsy ( removal small piece tissue ) take inside cheek around area behind low wisdom tooth . On morning surgery , patient give dose either standard anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen ( Advil , Nuprin , Motrin ) , rofecoxib , placebo ( pill active ingredient ) . Before surgery , give local anesthetic ( lidocaine ) mouth sedative ( midazolam ) arm vein . After surgery , patient remain clinic 4 hour monitor pain effect drug . Patients complete pain questionnaire . Patients whose pain unrelieved hour surgery may request receive morphine intravenously ( vein ) . After 4 hour , patient discharge additional pain medicine ( Tylenol codeine study drug ) instruction use . They also give pain diary record pain rating medication take home . A clinic staff member telephone patient home morning surgery ensure rating pain intensity proper time take medication instruct . Patients return clinic 48 hour surgery pain diary pain reliever . At visit , another biopsy take local anesthetic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pain inflammation predictable sequela follow tissue injury , surgery . Conventional treatment intraoperative postoperative control pain include local anesthetic administer preoperatively analgesic administer postoperatively . Disadvantages approach include pain interval effect local anesthesia dissipate postoperatively administer analgesic take effect adverse effect opioid-containing analgesic ambulatory patient . Research past two decade demonstrate administer nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) preoperatively significantly reduce intensity duration postoperative pain eight hour ( Dionne et al. , 1978 Jackson et al. , 1989 ) . Parallel clinical investigation suggest pre-emptive treatment long-acting local anesthetic NMDA-antagonist reduces pain 24 72 hour post-surgery ( Gordon et al. , 1997 ; Yamamoto et al. , 1993 ; Gordon et al. , 1999 ) . This propose clinical trial use oral surgery model ass therapeutic efficacy pre-emptive preventive treatment potent selective COX-2 inhibitor , rofecoxib ( VioxxÂ® ( Registered Trademark ) ) , give prior follow third molar extraction reduce postoperative pain 24 48 hour post-surgery . This study double-blind , randomize control trial parallel group use placebo , ibuprofen , rofecoxib . Rofecoxib 50 mg administer PO 90 minute surgery Clinical Center NIH another 50 mg self-administered 24 hour later subject home . This regimen predict suppress onset intensity post-operative dental pain great extent placebo non-selective COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor ( ibuprofen ) . The analgesic effect drug estimate hourly observation first four hour surgery use two different measure pain intensity , category scale visual analog scale ( VAS ) . It hypothesize pre-emptive administration selective COX-2 inhibitor , rofecoxib inhibit development central peripheral sensitization follow tissue injury manifest hyperalgesia later time point .</detailed_description>
