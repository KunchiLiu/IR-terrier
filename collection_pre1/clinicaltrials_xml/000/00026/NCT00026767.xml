	<brief_summary>This study collect data incidence ( rate occurrence ) fungal infection recipients bone marrow , stem cell organ transplant . The data provide information need develop strategy prevention early treatment fungal infection patient . Any patient receiving bone marrow transplantation , peripheral stem cell transplantation solid organ transplantation eligible study . The survey conduct 3-year period 20 collaborating transplant center . Through annual accrual 9,000 patient , estimate least 5 8 percent per year document suspect invasive fungal infection . The study conduct three phase follow : - Phase 1 A 6-month `` start-up '' phase sit initiate screen begin collect data incident case invasive fungal infection . - Phase 2 A 2-year phase sit conduct surveillance collect data specimen standardized fashion . - Phase 3 A 6-month `` wrap-up '' phase active surveillance invasive fungal infection conduct among patient transplant begin phase . Patient care provide patient primary protocol standard care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Invasive fungal infection emerge important cause morbidity mortality among recipient bone marrow , stem cell , solid organ transplantation ( SOT ) , well patient receive intensive chemotherapy treatment hematological malignancy , patient aplastic anemia , patient inherited immunodeficiency . This study formerly conduct surveillance network BMT/SCT SOT center collaboration Centers Disease Control surveillance invasive fungal infection recipient bone marrow , stem cell transplantation , solid organ transplantation . The first three phase study conduct six-year period approximately 23 collaborate transplant center complete enrollment multi-center case March 31 , 2006 . The addition fourth phase allow study case invasive fungal infection continue extend protocol four year NIH Clinical Center . It estimate least 5-8 % immunocompromised patient accrue annually document suspected invasive fungal infection . Objectives : The objective study conduct multi-institutional surveillance invasive fungal infection recipient bone marrow , stem cell transplantation , solid organ transplantation , well immunocompromised patient within Clinical Center patient population . To maintain multi-institute surveillance network evaluate new approach prevention diagnosis invasive fungal infection analysis immune function , include antigen detection , within population patient develop invasive fungal infection . Eligibility : Any patient within NIH Clinical Center receive bone marrow transplantation , peripheral stem cell transplantation solid organ transplantation , patient inherited immunodeficiency , aplastic anemia oncologic diagnosis meeting EORTC/MSG criterion invasive infection . Design : This prospective surveillance study invasive fungal infection immunocompromised host population . An incident case define transplant recipient , immunocompromised patient ( i.e. , inherited immunodeficiency , aplastic anemia general oncology ) proven probable invasive fungal infection meeting criterion IFI describe MSG/EORTC guideline . Positive microbiological evidence prompt acquisition discard serum blood Department Laboratory Medicine analysis immune function , include antigen detection , evaluate new approach prevention diagnosis invasive fungal infection .</detailed_description>
