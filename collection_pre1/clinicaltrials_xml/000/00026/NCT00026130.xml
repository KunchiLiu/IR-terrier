	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Combining chemotherapy radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combination chemotherapy radiation therapy treat patient locally advanced pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine overall survival patient locally advance non-metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma treat gemcitabine , fluorouracil , radiotherapy . - Determine time progression patient treat regimen . - Determine overall clinical response patient treat regimen . - Determine toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive gemcitabine IV 30 minute weekly fluorouracil IV continuously day 1-5 weekly 6 week . Patients concurrently undergo radiotherapy 5 day week 6 week . Three week completion chemoradiotherapy , patient receive gemcitabine IV 30 minute weekly week 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 4 week total 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 2 month 1 year every 3 month 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 78 patient accrue study within 24 month .</detailed_description>
