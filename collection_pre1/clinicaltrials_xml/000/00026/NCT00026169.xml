	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer Kidney Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) STI571 cohorts patient vary degree renal dysfunction ( normal , mild , moderate , severe ) . II . To determine effect renal dysfunction plasma pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics STI571 . III . To evaluate safety STI571 patient various degree renal dysfunction . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients stratify accord creatinine clearance ( least 60 mL/min vs 40-59 mL/min v 20-39 mL/min v le 20 mL/min v creatinine clearance undergoing dialysis ) . Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily day 1 4-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient stratum receive escalating dos imatinib mesylate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede least 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 60-69 patient ( 12 per stratum ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
