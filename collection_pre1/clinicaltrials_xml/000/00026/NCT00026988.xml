	<detailed_description>Huntington 's disease ( HD ) progressive fatal neurologic disorder cause expanded CAG repeat gene cod protein unknown function name huntingtin . The exact cause neuronal death HD unknown , however , lead hypothesis excitotoxicity apoptosis induce defect energy metabolism may cause oxidative stress . We previously demonstrate mitochondrial inhibitor produce striatal lesion closely mimic phenotype HD . We also show oxidative injury involve model may human HD . Because research , increase interest HD field explore complementary agent might prevent oxidative injury , Creatine widely use dietary supplement principally take enhance athletic performance . It strong candidate neuroprotective agent HD neurodegenerative disorder ability ameliorate toxin-based animal model preliminary evidence transgenic HD mouse . However , limited animal experience creatine yet trial human neurodegenerative disorder . There several potential mechanism creatine could effective treatment HD . First , evidence neuroprotective relieve oxidative stress . Second , could directly inhibit apoptotic neuronal death inhibitory action mitochondrial transition pore . Third , preliminary evidence creatine treatment may associate reduce huntingtin aggregation , potentially toxic process . Finally could act peripherally help reverse weakness muscle mass loss major clinical problem HD . We preliminary evidence creatine extend survival transgenic model HD reduce brain marker metabolic stress human HD . We propose test whether creatine ameliorate behavioral neuropathologic phenotype occur transgenic model HD , examine potential mechanism creatine neuroprotection , test safety tolerability HD patient , collect pilot clinical data examine creatine impact HD symptom progression . These study intend provide basis subsequent phase III trial creatine HD .</detailed_description>
