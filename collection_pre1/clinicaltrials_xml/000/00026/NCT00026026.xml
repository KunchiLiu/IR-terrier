	<brief_summary>The congenital absence teeth , commonly refer hypodontia tooth agenesis , common developmental anomaly human dentition affect approximately 20 % population . Although new genetic molecular approach human mouse increase understanding molecule control tooth patterning ( number , position , shape size ) , precise nature gene involve hypodontia human poorly understood . Hence , understand molecular basis miss teeth issue paramount importance timely significant practice dentistry . So far , two gene associate non-syndromic familial tooth agenesis : MSX1 PAX9 . Substitution mutation homeodomain region MSX1 link premolar agenesis insertion mutation pair box domain PAX9 show responsible molar oligodontia . The long-term goal research elucidate molecular pathology human tooth agenesis , particular , evaluate whether gene MSX1 PAX9 ( locus heterogeneity ) involve . Alternatively , case MSX1 , interest know whether allelic variation , different mutation gene , associate tooth agenesis . We propose study potentially large kindred report developmental absence several posterior teeth . The fundamental hypothesis test state gene responsible congenital absence molar teeth kindred critical element genesis molar . The specific goal perform linkage analysis follow direct sequence PCR product identify gene characterize nature underlie defect . Identifying underlying gene defect family affect tooth agenesis add new knowledge understanding pathogenesis defect provide basis future study .</brief_summary>
