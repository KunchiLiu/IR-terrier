	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Biological therapy gefitinib may interfere growth tumor cell slow growth colorectal cancer . Combining chemotherapy gefitinib may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase I/II trial compare effectiveness chemotherapy without gefitinib treat patient metastatic locally recurrent colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oxaliplatin With Without Gefitinib Treating Patients With Metastatic Locally Recurrent Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine recommend phase II dose gefitinib administer combination oxaliplatin patient metastatic locally recurrent colorectal cancer . - Determine dose-limiting toxicity regimen patient . - Compare time progression , objective response rate , median overall survival patient treat oxaliplatin without gefitinib . - Compare toxicity regimens patient . OUTLINE : This phase I dose-escalation study gefitinib follow phase II randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord ECOG performance status ( 0 vs 1-2 ) . - Phase I : Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 oral gefitinib daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos gefitinib maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . - Phase II : Patients randomize one two treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 . - Arm II : Patients receive oxaliplatin arm I oral gefitinib daily MTD day 1-21 . In arm , treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients arm II stable respond disease 6 course may continue receive gefitinib alone disease progression . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 77 patient ( 9 phase I 68 phase II ) accrue study within 12-14 month .</detailed_description>
