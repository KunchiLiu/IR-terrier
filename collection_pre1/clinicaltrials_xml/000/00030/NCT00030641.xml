	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy docetaxel use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Oblimersen may increase effectiveness docetaxel make tumor cell sensitive drug . It yet know docetaxel effective without oblimersen treat non-small cell lung cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized phase II/III trial compare effectiveness docetaxel without oblimersen treat patient relapsed refractory non-small cell lung cancer previously treat .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel With Without Oblimersen Treating Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare survival patient non-small cell lung cancer treat docetaxel without oblimersen ( G3139 ) . - Compare proportion major antitumor responses patient treat regimen . - Compare response duration time progression patient treat regimen . - Compare safety clinical benefit regimen , term change performance status tumor-related symptom , patient . - Compare proportion patient survive 6 12 month treatment regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord response prior first-line chemotherapy regimen ( progression v stable disease , partial response , complete response ) , ECOG performance status ( 0-1 v 2 ) , prior paclitaxel treatment ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oblimersen ( G3139 ) IV continuously day 1-7 docetaxel IV 1 hour day 5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients respond stable disease upon completion 8 course may receive 8 additional course physician 's discretion . - Arm II : Patients receive docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Upon completion 8 course , patient may continue receive docetaxel study physician 's discretion . Patients follow every 9 week 18 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 280 patient ( 140 per treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
