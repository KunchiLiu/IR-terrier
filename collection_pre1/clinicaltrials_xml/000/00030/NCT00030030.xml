	<brief_title>Evaluating Silymarin Chronic Hepatitis C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective exploratory project assess feasibility investigate effect silymarin , derive milk thistle plant , Silybum marianum , prevent reverse complication chronic infection HCV and/or clear HCV infection , thereby generate preliminary result serve basis definitive study . Allopathic therapeutic intervention prove promising , particularly genotype commonly encounter Egypt prohibitively expensive develop world . Egypt high prevalence HCV infection world , average 15-25 % rural community . There limited rigorous assessment dietary supplement milk thistle , promise salutary effect . The specific aim evaluate whether silymarin , extract milk thistle , : ( 1 ) improve hepatic morbidity subject chronic HCV hepatitis and/or cirrhosis ; ( 2 ) prevent progression liver disease participant chronic HCV infection normal liver enzyme level ; ( 3 ) help clear HCV infection ; ( 4 ) improve participant ' quality life . Participants randomly assign receive silymarin vitamin supplement ( antioxidant level ) . Participants recruit cohort HCV-infected individual currently enrol large observational study Egypt . Participants receive supplement daily 18 month , measure obtain every six month . Measures assess include : retention study , compliance study assignment , self-described symptom , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) level , serum collagen marker , abdominal ultrasound , viral load clearance , quality life ( SF36 survey ) . It hypothesize silymarin lead clearance HCV infection prevent progression liver disease participant chronic HCV hepatitis , case , reverse hepatic lesion already present , well improve quality life individual use dietary supplement . This exploratory project anticipate result successful initiation large definitive study effect milk thistle HCV infection . Evidence beneficial effect inexpensive benign herbal dietary supplement would great impact large global population suffer chronic HCV infection .</detailed_description>
