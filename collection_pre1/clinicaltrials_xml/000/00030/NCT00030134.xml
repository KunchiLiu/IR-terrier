	<brief_summary>This protocol collect information need design clinical study symptom problem woman Fabry disease , inherit metabolic disorder . In disease , enzyme call a-galactosidase A , normally break fatty substance call glycolipids , function properly . The result accumulation glycolipids various tissue cause arm leg pain , skin lesion , problem kidney , heart , nerve , blood vessel . This protocol involve experimental drug treatment , participant may offer enrollment future study registry . Women 18 year age old Fabry disease enzyme replacement therapy may participate study . Pregnant woman eligible , may exclude certain procedure , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Participants follow test procedure 3-day period : - Personal family medical history - Physical , neurological , eye examination - Blood urine test - Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) measure electrical activity heart - Echocardiogram ( ultrasound ) examine heart muscle pump action - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) examine brain . This test use magnetic field radio wave produce image brain . The patient lie narrow cylinder ( MRI scanner ) imaging may talk staff time procedure . - Magnetic resonance angiogram ( MRA ) examine blood vessel head neck . This procedure similar MRI . - Genotyping confirm diagnosis Fabry disease . DNA blood sample examine gene associate Fabry disease . - Skin punch biopsy microscopic examination tissue . A piece skin tissue 1/8-inch thick remove cookie cutter-like instrument . Participants also complete two questionnaire regard pain quality life . They ask stop take pain medication 7 day complete pain questionnaire , may resume medication 7 day pain intense . The questionnaire complete telephone interview . Patients also ask keep diary pain medication take 7 day study .</brief_summary>
