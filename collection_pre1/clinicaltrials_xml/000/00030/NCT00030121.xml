	<brief_title>Carperitide Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS severe form acute lung injury . ARDS characterize increase pulmonary vascular permeability result non-cardiogenic cause , lead increase vascular water volume , pulmonary inflammation , severe hypoxemia . Conventional therapy ARDS primarily respiratory management mechanical ventilation use positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) . Mechanical ventilation major management concern patient ARDS , due high risk infection morbidity . Treatment Carperitide may reduce time ventilator reduce pulmonary edema improve gas exchange . The result Carperitide study animal human support idea hormone effective manage acute pulmonary complication hypoxemia see ARDS .</detailed_description>
