	<brief_title>Bortezomib Treating Patients With Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine efficacy bortezomib , term response rate , patient previously untreated relapsed mantle cell lymphoma . - Determine toxicity drug patient . - Correlate suppression 20S proteasome level toxicity response drug patient . - Determine time progression response duration patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This nonrandomized , multicenter study . Patients receive bortezomib IV 3-5 second day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients complete response ( CR ) receive 2 course beyond documentation CR . Patients stable disease receive maximum 4 course . Patients partial response ( PR ) continue therapy disease progression 2 course beyond documentation stable PR . Patients follow 4 week every 3 month disease progression . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 14-30 patient accrue study within 18-24 month .</detailed_description>
