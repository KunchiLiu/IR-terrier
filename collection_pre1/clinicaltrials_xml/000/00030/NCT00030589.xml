	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop cancer cell divide stop grow die . Photodynamic therapy use light drug make cancer cell sensitive light kill cancer cell . Photosensitizing drug , methoxsalen , absorb cancer cell , expose light , become active kill cancer cell . Combining chemotherapy photodynamic therapy may effective treatment cutaneous T-cell lymphoma . PURPOSE : Randomized phase II trial study effectiveness combine different dos bexarotene photodynamic therapy treat patient stage IB stage IIA cutaneous T-cell lymphoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare efficacy 2 different dos bexarotene administer ultraviolet A light therapy methoxsalen ( PUVA ) patient stage IB IIA cutaneous T-cell lymphoma . - Compare safety regimens patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label , multicenter study . Patients randomize one two treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive low dose oral bexarotene daily week 1-26 . Patients also receive ultraviolet A light therapy oral methoxsalen 3 time weekly week 2-26 . - Arm II : Patients receive high dose oral bexarotene daily week 1-26 . Patients also receive ultraviolet A light therapy arm I . Patients follow 4 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 100 patient ( 50 per treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
