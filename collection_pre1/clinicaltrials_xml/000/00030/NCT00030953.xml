	<brief_summary>This study use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) brain try gain well understanding disease process Tourette syndrome , neuropsychiatric disorder characterize motor vocal tic . Tourette syndrome also associate behavioral emotional disturbance , include symptom attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) . MRI MRS show chemical substance brain . Findings normal volunteer compare patient . Healthy volunteer patient Tourette syndrome 14 year age old may eligible study . Volunteers screen medical history physical neurological examination . Patients screen NINDS protocol 93-N-0202 . Participants undergo MRI MRS. MRI use strong magnetic field radio wave visualize brain anatomy chemistry . For study , subject lie stretcher , move strong magnetic field ( MRI scanner ) . Earplugs worn muffle loud thumping noise cause electrical switching radio frequency circuit . During study , subject lie still scan , 1 8 minute time . Total scanning time varies 20 minute 2 hour , examination last 45 90 minute . The subject speak intercom staff member performing study time procedure . Up 5 study may perform .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE The purpose study obtain good understand pathophysiology Tourette 's Syndrome ( TS ) nuclear magnetic spectroscopic imaging . The basal ganglion implicate origin tic , plan use spectroscopy determine whether neuronal degeneration decrease aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) within basal ganglion , thalamus , frontal cortex patient TS compare normal individual . STUDY POPULATION This research conduct use patient TS normal volunteer . DESIGN Patients normal volunteer scan 3 Tesla General Electric ( GE ) magnetic resonance imager use magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) measure N-acetylaspartate , choline , creatine , lactate GABA . OUTCOME MEASURES Concentrations metabolite compare two group .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients clinically document TS define Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders ( DSM ) IV evaluation tic severity use Yale Tic Scale . Fourtyfour patient , range 1465 age , recruit . Patients normal volunteer may male female ; however , female subject child bear potential pregnancy test interview prior study ensure pregnant subject participate study . Patients ask stop medication influence central nervous system one week prior exam . They ask abstain alcohol one week study . Sixtytwo normal control include ; control screen NINDS Movement Disorders Outpatient Clinic . After screen consenting , control neurological physical examination . Controls chronic illness , take medication affect CNS exclude . Female subject child bear potential pregnancy test interview prior study ensure pregnant subject participate study . They ask abstain alcohol one week study . More control need order ensure sequence work prior acquisition data , since sequence use 1.5T MRI scanner use 3T . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects young 14 year old . Patients MRI finding consistent brain tumor , stroke , trauma arteriovenous malformation ( AVMs ) . Patients progressive neurological disorder Tourette 's syndrome . Patients history significant medical disorder , require chronic treatment drug stop . Subjects implanted device pacemaker , medication pump defibrillator , metal cranium except mouth , intracardiac line , history shrapnel injury condition/device may contraindicate prevent acquisition MRI . Patients cancer . Patients capable give informed consent .</criteria>
