At home , collect 24-hour urine sample ; fill questionnaire assess average calcium intake ; record food intake 7 day . Those enrolled study continue next 3 visit . Visit 2 Participants complete physical activity questionnaire , food diary review , meet dietitian nutritional counseling . Triceps fold thickness waist hip circumference measure three time . Body composition analyze DEXA study . For procedure , subject lie flat table small dose X-rays pass body . Participants randomly assign take either calcium carbonate ( 1500 mg/day ) placebo capsule twice day mouth 2 year . ( The placebo look like calcium capsule contain calcium . ) They receive 6-month supply study capsule visit 2 return NIH every 6 month next supply . They also send questionnaire mail every 3 month complete information health problem often study capsule take . Visits 3 4 Visit 3 schedule participant take study capsule 1 year ; visit 4 schedule 2 year ( end study ) . At visit , participant DEXA scan , blood urine test , blood pressure measurement , measurement height , weight , waist hip circumference .

	<brief_title>Supplemental Calcium Overweight People</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An estimate 97 million people United States overweight obese , therefore increase risk number obesity-related co-morbid condition ( hypertension , dyslipidemia , Type 2 Diabetes ) well all-cause mortality . The total cost attributable obesity amount $ 99.2 billion US 1995 figure , like prevalence increase body mass , rise alarm rate . At time calcium intake US adult population far RDA ( recommend daily allowance ) much daily optimal calcium intake recommend 1994 NIH consensus conference . An analysis NHANES III database suggest strong inverse association relative risk obesity calcium intake . Further , prospective study animal model , retrospective analysis human study suggest calcium supplementation may play role minimize yearly weight gain , may possibly induce small weight loss . In order test relationship calcium intake body weight , propose conduct 2-year , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial calcium supplementation ( 1500 mg/day supplementary calcium vs. placebo ) adult BMI great equal 25 kg/m ( 2 ) . We study effect supplemental calcium body weight , body composition , obesity-related comorbid condition , insulin sensitivity lipid . The effect supplementation blood pressure also systematically evaluate . A control group untreated , healthy , adult also enrol comparison study subject .</detailed_description>
