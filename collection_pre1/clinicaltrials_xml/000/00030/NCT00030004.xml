	<brief_summary>This study design determine whether medicine produce temporary amnesia ( midazolam ) use block memory treatment spinal manipulation . This important since study design determine whether spinal manipulation effective would better patient aware whether treat . This would allow true assessment treatment effect without complication strong placebo effect manipulative treatment may produce .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Spinal Manipulation Chronic Neck Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There grow recognition high frequency Americans utilize complementary alternative health care provider annually 10 % population treat chiropractor . While chiropractor employ several type treatment , spinal manipulation important unique therapy . Over 90 % spinal manipulation perform U.S. do chiropractor remainder perform osteopathic physician . The annual number chiropractic visit U.S. estimate approximately 100 per 100 person-years . Spinal manipulation chiropractic controversial least partially due paucity clinical scientific evidence benefit . For example , review literature randomize clinical trial ( RCT 's ) manipulative treatment back pain variably find evidence benefit insufficient evidence benefit . A review exist clinical trial spinal manipulation neck pain conclude five exist RCT 's relatively poor quality , despite evidence short-term benefit , study higher quality need order determine whether clinical benefit condition . This issue important since neck pain second common reason presentation chiropractor . There several difficulty research effect spinal manipulation . Most condition treat ( i.e. , back neck pain ) well-defined pathophysiology . Therefore , possible study treatment evaluate effect treatment physiological variable . The lack proven pathophysiology also lead heterogeneous study population large variability response treatment . This make necessary use large experimental population order detect effect treatment . There heavy reliance subjective outcome measure neck back pain research , make clinical trial particularly sensitive placebo `` nonspecific '' effect . The use blind subject accept method deal issue , blind particularly difficult achieve investigate physical intervention , particularly therapist ca n't blind whether s/he deliver actual sham treatment . The present proposal response request application pilot study establish methodological feasibility strengthen scientific rationale proceed full-scale RCTs use chiropractic osteopathy manage treat musculoskeletal injury disorder . One state goal request application refine control strategy study manipulative therapy . The propose study examine whether amnestic agent , midazolam , use blind subject experimental group double-blind , pilot RCT . This proposal similar study Sloop et al use diazepam produce amnesia study spinal manipulation chronic neck pain . The present study utilize agent specific amnestic effect also address several methodological problem study . If successful , method employ pilot study may permit high degree blind full scale RCT 's spinal manipulation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>This study enroll patient chronic neck pain ( 3 month duration ) without occipitallybased head pain without sign radiculopathy myelopathy . They must pain least moderate intensity ( report score least 3 10 visual analogue pain scale ) least four day week limitation activity weekly basis due neck pain . These subject spinal manipulative treatment least two year adverse reaction manipulative treatment benzodiazepine . They may regular user benzodiazepine medication . They also currently enrol ongoing physical therapy program , though may take analgesic , antiinflammatories medication problem . They may continue ongoing exercise program . Subjects also exclude pregnant , lactating plan pregnant , significant cardiac pulmonary disease plan relocate course study .
