	<brief_summary>This study examine whether experimental drug BMS 247550 ( Ixabepilone ) effective treatment kidney cancer . BMS 247550 belongs class drug call epothilones interfere ability cancer cell divide . In way kill cell , similar class compound know taxanes , include drug Taxol . Other characteristic epothilones , however , enable work cell resistant Taxol . Patients 18 year age old kidney cancer spread central nervous system ( unless brain tumor remain stable least six month surgical radiation treatment ) may eligible study . Pregnant nursing woman may participate . Candidates screen various test may include blood urine test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , chest x-ray . Computerized tomography ( CT ) scan X-rays , possibly nuclear medicine study may do determine extent disease . Participants receive BMS 247550 1-hour infusion vein 5 consecutive day ( day 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 5 ) 21-day treatment cycle . Patients must stay National Institutes Health ( NIH ) area near Bethesda , Maryland , 7 8 day first treatment cycle 5 day treatment subsequent cycle . The total number cycle vary among patient , depend individual clinical situation . The drug dose may increase gradually subsequent cycle patient tolerate increase . In addition , participant undergo follow test procedure : - Periodic physical examination frequent blood test - X-ray imaging study determine tumor respond treatment . - Tumor biopsy confirm diagnosis spread tumor examine reaction certain protein cancer cell BMS 247550 . Two biopsy do . For procedure , small piece tumor tissue withdrawn needle local anesthetic . Treatment stop patient whose tumor grow receive BMS 247550 . Patients whose tumor disappear completely follow NIH periodically examinations test . Patients whose disease completely resolve whose disease recurs may advise appropriate research protocol NIH , none available , return care local doctor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : BMS-247550 ( NSC 710428 ) , ( ixabepilone ) semi-synthetic analog natural product epothilone B . The epothilones novel class non-taxane microtubule-stabilizing agent obtain fermentation cellulose degrade myxobacteria , Sorangium cellulosum . BMS-247550 active cancer model naturally insensitive paclitaxel develop resistance paclitaxel , in-vitro in-vivo . Objectives Establish efficacy investigational agent BMS-247550 patient renal cell carcinoma administer one hour infusion day 1 5 every 21 day . Evaluate plasma pharmacokinetics BMS-247550 . Explore pharmacodynamics BMS-247550 use assay measure amount endogenous tubulin peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) exist polymerized versus unpolymerized state . Determine extent pharmacodynamic change observe range dos BMS-247550 . Determine cross-resistance BMS-247550 exist patient previously receive sorafenib sunitinib . Eligibility : Age great 18 . Pathological confirmation renal cell carcinoma . Prior chemotherapy include sorafenib sunitinib allow . Design : Phase II study . BMS-247550 administer day 1 5 , every 21 day . Restaging do every two cycle .</detailed_description>
