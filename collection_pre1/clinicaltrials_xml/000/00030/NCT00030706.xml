	<brief_title>Ixabepilone Treating Patients With Relapsed and/or Refractory Stage III Stage IV Ovarian Epithelial Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine antitumor activity ixabepilone , term clinical response progression-free survival , patient relapse and/or refractory stage III IV ovarian epithelial primary peritoneal cancer . - Determine nature degree toxicity drug patient . Secondary - Correlate pre-ixabepilone survivin mRNA protein level patient-derived ovarian cancer cell quality response ( i.e. , least partial response v response ) . - Correlate CYP3A4 ( 3A4*1B ) , 3A5 ( 3A5*1 ) , 3A7 ( ER6 p variation ) allelic polymorphisms parent drug kinetic parameter , toxicity , efficacy drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive ixabepilone IV 1 hour weekly week 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 4 week total 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 12-37 patient accrue study within 12 month .</detailed_description>
