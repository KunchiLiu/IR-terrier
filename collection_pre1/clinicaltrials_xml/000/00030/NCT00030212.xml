	<brief_summary>This study examine abnormal immune response patient sporadic inclusion body myositis ( s-IBM ) -the common inflammatory muscle disease people age 50. s-IBM progress steadily may lead severe weakness waste arm leg muscle . Patients may become unable perform daily living activity confine wheelchair . s-IBM thought autoimmune disease , body 's immune system attack healthy muscle . This study explore cause muscle tissue inflammation responsible destruction muscle fiber weakness disease . Information study may help development effective treatment disease . Patients s-IBM may eligible study . Those unable travel severe cardiovascular , renal end-stage organ disease exclude . Candidates screen eligibility medical history physical neurological examination . Participants see NIH Clinical Center every six month 12-month period ( visits enrollment , 6 month 12 month ) either inpatient outpatient basis , depend disease severity . Each 2- 3-day visit involve follow test evaluation : - Blood sample routine laboratory test collect every visit . Additional blood research study collect 12 month . - Quantitative muscle strength test do every visit . The patient pull strap connect dynamometer ( device measure muscle power ) evaluate strength main muscle group arm leg . - Lymphapheresis do enrollment 12 month . This procedure collect quantity lymphocyte ( white blood cell important part immune system ) . Blood collect needle place arm vein circulate machine spin , separate component . The lymphocyte remove rest blood ( red cell , platelet plasma ) return body needle another needle place arm . - Electrophysiologic study ( electromyography nerve conduction test ) do enrollment 12 month . Electromyography evaluate electrical activity muscle . A small needle inserted muscle patient ask relax contract muscle . For nerve conduction testing , nerve stimulate electrode ( small wire tap skin muscle ) . - Muscle biopsy do enrollment 12 month . A sample muscle tissue ( size lima bean ) arm leg surgically remove confirm diagnosis s-IBM analysis protein involve muscle inflammation process . A local anesthetic use numb area surgery wound close stitch .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sporadic Inclusion Body Myositis ( s-IBM ) common acquire myopathy age 50 year . It disable disease lead wheelchair confinement . The cause unknown autoimmune mechanism implicate . The primary goal study search candidate autoantigen ( ) drive autoimmune response identify candidate pathogenic T-cell epitope among endomysial T-cells extract patient ' muscle biopsy . It anticipate search antigen implicate clonal expansion endomysial T-cells time elucidate autoimmune pathogenesis disease lead development antigen-specific immunomodulatory therapeutic strategy . This investigative study intend good define pathogenesis s-IBM . No new therapy provide except standard care .</detailed_description>
