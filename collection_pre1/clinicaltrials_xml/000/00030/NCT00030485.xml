	<brief_title>Erlotinib Treating Patients With Locally Advanced and/or Metastatic Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine efficacy erlotinib , term response rate duration stable disease , patient locally advance and/or metastatic carcinoma endometrium . - Determine toxicity drug patient . - Determine time progression duration response patient treated drug . - Correlate objective tumor response level epidermal growth factor receptor expression patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral erlotinib daily . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 4 week . Patients complete partial response stable disease also follow every 3 month relapse death . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 15-30 patient accrue study within 12-18 month .</detailed_description>
