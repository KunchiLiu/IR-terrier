	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Solid Tumors Childhood</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response rate patient relapse refractory pediatric solid tumor treat imatinib mesylate . II . Determine toxicity drug patient . III . Determine time progression patient treat drug . IV . Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . V. Correlate response c-kit platelet-derived growth factor receptor expression patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord disease ( Ewing 's sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor v osteosarcoma v neuroblastoma v ) . Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
