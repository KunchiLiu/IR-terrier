	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Biological therapy use different way stimulate immune system stop cancer cell grow . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining biological therapy chemotherapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase I/II trial study effectiveness biological therapy combine chemotherapy treat patient metastatic kidney cancer colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety repeat course interleukin-12-primed activated T cell ( 12ATC ) combination fluorouracil , sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) , interferon alfa-2b patient metastatic renal cell colorectal carcinoma . - Determine clinical response patient treat regimen . - Determine efficacy 12ATC patient . - Determine whether change immunologic parameter related 12ATC measure lymphocyte phenotype cytokine secretion patient . - Determine correlation clinical response patient treat regimen vitro immune function lymphocyte . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord disease type ( renal cell carcinoma v colorectal carcinoma ) . Patients receive sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) subcutaneously ( SC ) daily day 1-5 undergo collection autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) day 6 7 week 1 . The PBMC treat ex vivo form interleukin-12-primed activated T cell ( 12ATC ) . Patients receive fluorouracil IV 24 hour day 6 week 2 interferon alfa-2b SC GM-CSF SC 3 time weekly week 3-5 . Patients receive 12ATC IV 15-30 minute twice weekly interferon alfa-2b SC ( least 24 hour 12ATC infusion ) weekly week 6-8 . Patients complete partial response stable disease 3 week last 12ATC infusion may receive additional 8-week course . Patients follow every 2-3 month 1 year every 6 month 2 year time physical examination symptom suspicious tumor progression . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 60 patient ( 30 per stratum ) accrue study within 2-3 year .</detailed_description>
