	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Celecoxib may slow growth cancer stop blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining chemotherapy celecoxib may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness celecoxib docetaxel treat patient non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Celecoxib Docetaxel Treating Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine efficacy feasibility celecoxib combine docetaxel first-line therapy elderly poor performance status patient advance non-small cell lung cancer . - Determine response rate patient treat regimen . - Determine toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily ( begin day -7 first course ) docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 2 additional course CR . Patients achieve stable disease ( SD ) partial response ( PR ) receive minimum 2 additional course SD PR . At discretion treat physician , patient receive maintenance therapy comprise celecoxib . Patients discontinue therapy disease progression unacceptable toxicity follow least 6 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 21-39 patient accrue study within 13-28 month .</detailed_description>
