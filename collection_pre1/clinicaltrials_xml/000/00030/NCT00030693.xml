	<brief_summary>Randomized phase I trial compare effectiveness two different vaccine give directly tumor treat patient metastatic solid tumor . Vaccines may make body build immune response kill tumor cell . Infusing vaccine directly tumor may cause strong immune response kill tumor cell . It yet know vaccine may effective treat metastatic solid tumor</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine compare feasibility clinical toxicity administer rF-B7.1 rF-TRICOM vaccine patient accessible cutaneous , subcutaneous , lymph node metastatic tumor . II . To determine compare feasibility clinical toxicity administer rF-B7.1 rF-TRICOM vaccine patient accessible visceral metastatic tumor . III . To determine optimal dose rF-B7.1 rF-TRICOM vaccine deliver intra-tumoral injection . IV . To compare clinical response safety profile patient cutaneous tumor visceral tumor receive rF-B7.1 vaccine similar patient receive rF-TRICOM vaccine . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish evidence host anti-tumor immune reactivity follow intra-lesional vaccine administration compare difference rF-B7.1 rF-TRICOM patient cutaneous tumor visceral tumor . II . To evaluate quality life vaccine administration . OUTLINE : This randomize study dose-escalation component . Patients stratify accord tumor location ( cutaneous , subcutaneous , lymph node metastasis vs visceral metastasis ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive rF-B7.1 vaccine intratumorally day 1 . ARM II : Patients receive fowlpox-TRICOM vaccine intratumorally day 1 . Treatment arm repeat every 4 week 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable respond disease may receive additional course . Three patient cutaneous disease ( CD ) stratum treat low-dose treatment arm . If 1 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) , 6 additional CD patient randomize high-dose treatment . If 1 6 patient experience DLT , 12 patient visceral disease ( VD ) stratum randomize low-dose treatment . If 2 12 VD patient experience DLT , next cohort 12 VD patient randomize high-dose treatment . If 3 original 12 VD patient experience DLT , 6 additional VD patient receive low-dose treatment . If 3 18 patient experience DLT , 12 VD patient receive high-dose treatment . Quality life assess baseline , monthly therapy , end therapy . Patients follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
