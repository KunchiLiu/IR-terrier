	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effectiveness drug raloxifene rimostil treat perimenopause-related depression . Perimenopause-related mood disorder cause significant distress large number woman ; demand effective therapy treat mood disorder considerable . Estradiol replacement therapy ( ERT ) demonstrate efficacy treat perimenopause-related depression . Unfortunately , long-term risk associate ERT . Selective estrogen receptor modulators ( SERMS ) , raloxifene , phytoestrogens , rimostil , estrogen-like property may offer safe alternative ERT . The effect SERMS phytoestrogens mood cognitive function need examine woman perimenopause-related depression . Participants study undergo medical history , physical examination , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , blood urine test . They randomly assign receive one four treatment 8 week : raloxifene pill plus placebo ( inactive substance ) skin patch , rimostil pill plus placebo skin patch , estradiol skin patch plus placebo pill , placebo patch plus placebo pill . Participants clinic visit every 2 week . During visit , blood drawn participant meet staff member complete symptom self-rating scale . A urine blood sample collect begin end study . At end study , participant receive placebo whose study medication ineffective offer treatment standard antidepressant medication 8 week . Non-menstruating woman receive progesterone 10 day induce menstrual bleeding shed inner layer uterus , may stimulate study medication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Perimenopause-related mood disorder cause significant distress potentially large number woman . The demand effective therapeutic alternative estrogen treat mood disorder considerable , need define clinical biologic marker may predict successful response mood disturbance phytoestrogens selective estrogen receptor modulators ( SERMs ) . Further , study potential biological mechanism underlie perimenopause-related mood disorder response treatment may offer possibility uncover etiopathogenic mechanism involve related mood disorder . Results protocol # 90-M-0077 demonstrated therapeutic efficacy estradiol therapy ( ET ) perimenopausal depression , independent effect vasomotor symptom . Nevertheless , long term risk ET endometrial breast tissue continue deter many woman use . Recently , selective estrogen receptor modulators ( SERMs ) phytoestrogens ( plant-derived estrogen-like compound ) become available reported display tissue-specific profile estrogen agonist antagonist action differential affinity two form estrogen receptor . For many woman , novel compound would represent safer alternative ET prevention osteoporosis treatment menopausal symptom . However , effect SERMs phytoestrogens mood cognitive function perimenopausal woman remain undetermined . In protocol wish investigate effect SERMs phytoestrogens mood cognition placebo control condition compare effect estradiol therapy . This protocol address follow question : 1 ) Do selective estrogen receptor modulators phytoestrogens improve mood cognition perimenopausal depress woman ? 2 ) Are mood cognitive effect SERMs phytoestrogens comparable ET ? 3 ) Do selective estrogen receptor modulators phytoestrogens improve measure bone metabolism perimenopausal depress woman ?</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects study meet follow criterion : 1 . Selfreport onset depression associate menstrual cycle irregularity amenorrhea ; 2 . A current episode minor ( meet 34 criterion symptom ) major depression ( moderate severity less Structured Clinical Interview Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders ( DSM ) IV ( SCID ) severity scale meeting DSMIV criterion symptom 9 ( suicide ) ) determine administration minor depression module Schedule Affective Disorders Schizophrenia Lifetime Version ( SADSL ) . Additionally , ensure subject meet minimum threshold severity depression , subject score great equal 10 either Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) Center Epidemiologic Studies Depression ( CESD ) Scale least three four clinic visit two month screen phase , well 17 item Hamilton Depression score great equal 10 . Subjects exclude meet follow criterion : major depression great moderate severity , DSMIV criterion # 9 ( suicide ) , anyone require immediate treatment clinical assessment functional impairment rating five six seven consecutive day daily rating ; 3 . Evidence perimenopausal reproductive status ; 4 . Age 40 60 ; 5 . No prior hormonal therapy treatment perimenopauserelated mood physical symptom within last six month ; 6 . No history psychiatric illness two year prior report onset current episode depression ; 7 . In good medical health , take medication dietary herbal supplement regular basis ( exception multivitamins calcium supplement ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : The following condition constitute contraindication treatment preclude subject participation protocol : 1 ) Severe major depression follow : 1. positive ( threshold ) response SCID major depression section item # 9 , suicidal ideation ; 2. anyone require immediate treatment clinical assessment ; 3. severity rating great moderate SCID IV interview ; 4. functional impairment rating five six seven consecutive day daily rating . 2 ) Current treatment antidepressant medication . Our main concern exclude subject take medication would treat precipitate depression adversely interact reproductive hormone , phytoestrogens ( e.g. , anticoagulant ) , SERMs . Thus , wish exclude woman receive psychotropic medication , medication report induce change mood behavior , hormone replacement therapy , oral contraceptive agent , medication may potential adverse interaction compound employ study . 3 ) History psychiatric illness two year report onset current episode depression . 4 ) History ischemic cardiac disease , pulmonary embolism , retinal thrombosis , thrombophlebitis ; subject risk factor thromboembolic phenomenon include cigarette smoker ; varicose vein , patient prolong period immobilization ( include prolong travel ) , active heart disease . The literature suggest although smoke hormone replacement/oral contraceptive associate risk thromboembolic phenomena cardiovascular event , individual risk become significantly great combine great 10 cigarette day consume . Thus wish exclude subject study smoke great 10 cigarette per day . 5 ) Renal disease , asthma . 6 ) Hepatic dysfunction . 7 ) Women history carcinoma breast , woman family history following : premenopausal breast cancer bilateral breast cancer first degree relative ; multiple family member ( great three relative ) postmenopausal breast cancer . 8 ) Women history uterine cancer , endometriosis , illdefined pelvic lesion , particularly undiagnosed ovarian enlargement , undiagnosed vaginal bleeding . 9 ) Patients know hypersensitivity raloxifene , phytoestrogens ( include Rimostil , isoflavones , genistein , daidzein , red clover extract soyrelated compound ) , estradiol , Alora , medroxyprogesterone acetate , excipients ( inactive compound ) contain within medication include : Rimostil tocopherol , cellulose , calcium hydrogen phosphate , magnesium stearate , silicacolloidal anhydrous ; Provera calcium stearate , corn starch , lactose , mineral oil , sorbic acid , sucrose , talc ; Alora sorbitan monooleate , acrylic adhesive ; Evista anhydrous lactose , carnauba wax , crospovidone , Federal Food , Drug , Cosmetic Act ( FD &amp; C ) blue # 2 aluminum lake , hydroxypropyl methylcellulose , lactose monohydrate , magnesium stearate , modify pharmaceutical glaze , polyethylene glycol , polysorbate 80 , povidone , titanium dioxide . 10 ) Pregnant woman . 11 ) Porphyria . 12 ) Diabetes mellitus . 13 ) Cholecystitis pancreatitis . 14 ) History cerebrovascular disease ( stroke ) , epilepsy , hypertension , hypercalcemia . 15 ) Recurrent migraine headache . 16 ) Malignant melanoma . 17 ) History familial hyperlipoproteinemia .</criteria>
