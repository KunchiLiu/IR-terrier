	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate Treating Patients With Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response rate patient Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia treat imatinib mesylate . II . Determine disease-free survival patient treated drug . III . Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . IV . Determine toxic effect drug patient . V. Determine rate hematological , cytogenetic , molecular response time response patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord disease ( chronic myelogenous leukemia [ CML ] first chronic phase fail interferon therapy demonstrate intolerance interferon [ close accrual 12/05/03 ] v CML relapse stem cell transplantation second subsequent chronic phase [ close accrual 7/29/05 ] v newly diagnose CML first chronic phase prior treatment [ close accrual 7/29/05 ] v newly diagnose CML first chronic phase prior treatment ) . Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients fail achieve complete hematologic response 3 course partial complete cytogenic response 6 course remove study . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 109 patient ( 30 stratum I [ close accrual 12/05/03 ] stratum II [ close accrual 7/29/05 ] , 34 stratum III [ close accrual 7/29/05 ] , 45 stratum IV ) accrue study within 2 year .</detailed_description>
