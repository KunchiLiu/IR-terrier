	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine gemcitabine , use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Palliative chemotherapy may improve quality life patient locally advance metastatic biliary tract cancer may help live comfortably . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness adjuvant capecitabine gemcitabine improve quality life patient locally advance metastatic biliary tract cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjuvant Palliative Capecitabine Gemcitabine Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Biliary Tract Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine ability palliative capecitabine gemcitabine maintain improve tumor-related symptom ( treatable biliary duct obstruction relieve ) measure clinical benefit response patient locally advance metastatic biliary tract cancer . Secondary - Determine clinical benefit response patient treat regimen . - Determine time duration clinical benefit response patient treat regimen . - Determine objective response time progression patient treat regimen . - Determine overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine quality life patient treat regimen . - Determine adverse event patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive gemcitabine IV 30 minute day 1 8 oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-14 ( 28 total dos ) . Treatment repeat every 21 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients respond treatment may receive additional course discretion investigator . Quality life assess baseline , weekly week 2-9 ( course 1-3 ) , administration gemcitabine . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 19-44 patient accrue study within 3 year .</detailed_description>
