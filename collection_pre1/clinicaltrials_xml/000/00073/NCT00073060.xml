	<brief_summary>This study examine effect repeat apheresis procedure bone density calcium balance . Apheresis procedure collect large number specific blood component , white cell ( leukapheresis ) platelet ( plateletpheresis ) . For procedure , whole blood collect needle arm vein direct machine separate component spin . The desired cell remove rest blood return donor , either needle needle arm . A blood thin medicine call citrate add cell-separating machine . Citrate reduces ionize calcium level blood , prevents blood clot . When blood return donor , donor also receive citrate . This lower donor 's ionized calcium level may irritate nerve muscle cell , cause tingle around mouth , hand , foot procedure . The reduced ionized calcium level result increase parathyroid hormone level donor , effect bone calcium store . In addition , citrate return donor excrete urine along calcium , cause loss calcium body . It known calcium loss apheresis people undergo procedure repeatedly long-term effect body calcium balance bone calcium store . This study measure bone density calcium balance long-term platelet white cell donor compare finding whole blood donor , receive citrate . Healthy people 18 80 year age weigh 110 300 pound , metal prosthesis , pregnant may eligible study . Participants undergo follow procedure : Whole blood donor - Blood sample collection 2 week blood donation . - I remove undergo standard whole blood donation - Urine sample collection . - DEXA scan ass bone density measure bone calcium store . For procedure , subject lie still table spine , hip , whole body scan use small amount radiation . The forearm also scan subject seat . The scan may repeat 2 year . Plateletpheresis leukapheresis donor - Standard platelet white cell donation . - Blood sample collection immediately prior donation , first , fourth , fourteenth day donation . - Urine sample collection begin end apheresis procedure first , fourth , fourteenth day donation . - DEXA scan beginning study ( earlier 2 week late apheresis donation ) . The scan may repeat 2 year . - Some apheresis donor may ask second procedure take calcium accord standard guideline plateletpheresis leukapheresis . During second procedure , platelet donor take oral calcium tablet start plateletpheresis . White cell donor receive calcium intravenously ( vein ) second leukapheresis . For second procedure , donor provide additional blood urine sample describe .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Citrate Effects Bone Density Long-Term Apheresis Donors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately one million plateletpheresis procedure perform year U.S. , include 3,500 Platelet Center Department Transfusion Medicine , NIH . Healthy donor eligible undergo plateletpheresis often 24 time per year . During plateletpheresis , citrate anticoagulant add blood collection pathway prevent clot apheresis device , infuse donor procedure.1-3 Adverse effect related citrate administration common ; well-studied acute hypocalcemia due formation calcium-citrate complex . Recent study Department indicate change serum calcium , PTH , osteocalcin , alkaline phosphatase , vitamin D level also present may sustain 24 hour apheresis . Observations European study suggest serial plateletpheresis donation may associate reduce bone density ; however , study include control group , involve pay donor , generally generally young , allow donate frequently , representative population demographic U.S . In addition volunteer plateletpheresis donor , NIH Department Transfusion Medicine maintain registry approximately 500 person undergo leukapheresis procedure provide component vitro research use , receive compensation . These research apheresis procedure use device plateletpheresis donation , also require citrate anticoagulant infusion . However , procedure duration total dose citrate administer may twice great occurs plateletpheresis . Leukocyte plateletpheresis donor may undergo 100 apheresis procedure course participation donor program NIH . The impact serial , frequent , long-term apheresis donation total body calcium balance bone density unknown . In study , measure bone density laboratory test 75 NIH plateletpheresis donor , 75 NIH research leukapheresis donor , control group 150 age , gender , race match NIH whole blood donor . The apheresis study group include least 50 frequent donor ( great 50 donation past 10 year ) 20 donor less 25 lifetime donation . Comprehensive laboratory evaluation effect citrate administration bone metabolism body calcium magnesium metabolism apheresis perform . Similar laboratory bone density measurement perform 75 subject donate platelet facility outside NIH ( non-NIH donor ) , undergo plateletpheresis frequent interval NIH donor . The effect intravenous calcium administration apheresis-induced change laboratory parameter also assess . This information major impact understand short long-term adverse effect citrate administration commit apheresis donor , may also provide insight calcium , magnesium , phosphorus metabolism .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : &lt; TAB &gt; Healthy donor meet American Association Blood Banks , Food Drug Administration NIH DTM criterion allogeneic research blood donation donate blood apheresis component great 50 time past 10 year period ( NIH donor ) , great 100 time past 10 year ( nonNIH donor ) , less 25 time life ( NIH donor ) . Age great equal 18 year less equal 80 year . Weight great equal 50 kg less 135 kg . &lt; TAB &gt; Able give inform consent Able donate early 08:00 morning ( apheresis donor ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Pregnancy Metal prosthesis place &lt; TAB &gt; Any prior radiologic contrast administration within precede one week ( include CT contrast , MRI contrast , intravenous pyelogram , barium swallow fluoroscopy ) Weight less less 50 Kg ( minimum weight donate platelet , leukocyte , whole blood ) Weight great than135 Kg ( maximum weight DEXA Scan ) More 2 lifetime apheresis donation whole blood donor ( recent apheresis must least one month prior study ) .</criteria>
