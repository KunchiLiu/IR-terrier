	<brief_summary>This 2-phase study determine safety treat patient non-small cell lung cancer genetically engineer HyperAcute-Lung cancer vaccine . It establish proper vaccine dose examine side effect potential benefit treatment . The vaccine contain kill lung cancer cell contain mouse gene cause production foreign pattern protein-sugars cell surface . It hop immune response foreign substance stimulate immune system attack patient 's cancer cell similar protein without sugar pattern , cause tumor remain stable shrink . Patients 18 year age old non-small cell lung cancer recur long respond standard treatment may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood test , urinalysis , chest x-ray , lung function test . CT , MRI , PET , ultrasound scan chest may obtain need . Participants receive four vaccination month apart . The vaccine inject skin , similar way tuberculosis skin test give . Phase I study treat successive group patient increase number vaccine cell evaluate side effect treatment determine optimum dose . Phase II look beneficial effect vaccine give high dose find safe Phase I . Weekly blood sample draw 4 month vaccine treatment . In addition , patient follow-up visit schedule every 2 month first year vaccination every 3 month next 2 year follow test procedure evaluate treatment response side effect : - Medical history physical examination - Blood test - X-rays various scan ( nuclear medicine/CT/MRI ) - FACT-L Assessment questionnaire measure impact treatment patient 's general well-being . The questionnaire administer begin treatment , vaccination , follow-up visit complete treatment . It include question severity lung cancer symptom ability perform normal activity daily life . In addition procedure , 3 skin punch biopsy do vaccination site look local immune response . For procedure , area skin numb anesthetic 4 mm ( 1/4-inch ) circular area remove , use sharp cookie cutter-type instrument . Also , one blood sample per year collect next 15 year monitor safety gene transfer . Patients whose lung cancer spread skin , superficial soft tissue , superficial lymph node may ask undergo biopsy lesion see effect treatment may tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Lung cancer remain leading cause cancer death estimate 174,400 new case 162,400 death year U.S. - Despite attempt early diagnosis development new therapeutic agent , limited improvement outcome patient advance lung cancer . - A enzyme call alpha ( 1,3 ) galactosyltranferase ( alphaGT ) find human transfer sugar proteins human cell make highly immunogenic cause reject body . - Antitumor vaccination use kill donor human lung cancer cell express alphaGT may stimulate immune response patient lung cancer lung cancer may share antigens vaccine cell make immunogenic expression alphaGT . Objectives : Phase I complete . Phase II - To assess tumor response rate anti-tumor vaccination use irradiated allogeneic lung cancer cell line genetically engineer express murine alpha ( 1,3 ) galactosyltransferase enzyme patient advance , recurrent refractory non-small cell lung cancer . - To assess immunological response patient lung cancer undergo antitumor vaccination irradiate allogeneic lung cancer cell line genetically engineer express murine alpha ( 1,3 ) galactosyltransferase . - Assess survival distribution well duration response . Eligibility : - Non-small cell lung cancer ( Adenocarcinoma , squamous cell carcinoma , large cell anaplastic carcinoma bronchoalveolar carcinoma ) . - Stage IV , recurrent treatment refractory disease . - No exclusion prior therapy . Prior therapy may include surgery , radiation , immunotherapy , chemotherapy regimen . EGFR inhibitor monoclonal antibody include chemotherapy . - Patients must granulocyte count great equal 1000/microL , platelet great equal 100,000/microL , hemoglobin great 10.0 gm/dL , albumin great equal 3.0 gm/dL acceptable hepatic renal function . - No systemic corticosteroid . Design ( Phase II ) : - Patients intradermally vaccinate 300 million alpha ( 1,3 ) galactosyltranferase-expressing vaccine cell every 2-weeks complete total eight vaccination . - Patients monitor tumor immunological response safety .</detailed_description>
