	<brief_title>Wounded Spirits , Ailing Hearts : Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Cardiovascular Disease Indians</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) unique psychiatric condition characterize persistent maladaptive reaction result exposure stressful traumatic event ( ) . In United States general population PTSD lifetime prevalence 5 percent men 10 percent woman . PTSD known produce alternation central autonomic nervous system hormonal dysregulation . However , little known long-term consequence PTSD cardiovascular system . PTSD common disorder among reservation dwell American Indians life-time prevalence 12 percent men 23 percent woman . Similarly , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , emerge major health problem American Indians past decade . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study examine relationship PTSD cardiac function population-based sample American Indians . The technical aim study involve : 1 ) identification American Indian men woman age 18-52 lifetime history PTSD free overt CVD ; 2 ) selection age- , sex- , tribe-matched comparison group American Indians history PTSD free know CVD ; 3 ) comprehensive lifestyle clinical evaluation PTSD non-PTSD group assess CVD risk factor smoke , exercise , obesity , blood pressure , concentration blood lipid , inflammatory thrombogenic factor ; 4 ) set non-invasive test subclinical CVD measure CVD risk . These test include positron emission tomography ( PET ) myocardial perfusion image examine coronary flow reserve , high-resolution ultrasound carotid artery measure carotid intima-media thickness , high-resolution ultrasound brachial artery determine flow-mediated vasodilation , ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring , assess heart rate variability ( HRV ) . With data , study address specific aim , : 1 ) determine whether individual PTSD , compare without PTSD , show great evidence subclinical CVD , include low coronary flow reserve , increase carotid intimamedia thickness , reduce forearm flow-mediated vasodilation ; 2 ) ascertain whether HRV low individual PTSD compare without PTSD ; 3 ) investigate role lifestyle ( e.g. , smoking , alcohol use , exercise , obesity ) , cultural ( e.g. , acculturation , religiosity ) , biological ( e.g. , blood pressure , blood lipid glucose concentration ) mediator relationship PTSD coronary flow reserve HRV .</detailed_description>
