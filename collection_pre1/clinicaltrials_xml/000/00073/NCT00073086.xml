	<brief_summary>This study evaluate treat people SARS , new type pneumonia ( lung infection ) originate China . SARS cause new virus easily transmit person person . This study look course disease ; determine virus affect body body fights infection ; evaluate diagnostic test quickly identify disease . People 18 year age old probable suspect SARS may eligible study . Close contact patient SARS , patient recover SARS , NIH health care worker involve care patient also enrol . Patients SARS require hospitalization admit NIH Clinical Center . Because SARS spread easily , hospitalize patient room allow visitor . They leave room except test , x-ray . All participant full medical examination , include medical history , physical examination , blood test . In addition , participant undergo various test procedure follow : - Probable suspected SARS patient may hospitalize may see outpatient . They provide treatment judge best disease , usually accord express published recommendation . The best treatment SARS yet know , study evaluate therapy . Outpatients see three time week 2 week , week 4 week , 6 month . Patients mouth throat swab take three time week first 2 week , week 4 week . Blood drawn three time week first 2 week , week 3 , 4 , 6 . If virus still detectable 6 week , nose washing throat swab repeat virus detect 3 week row . In addition , patient provide urine stool sample , chest x-ray electrocardiogram , undergo bronchoscopy bronchial lavage . For bronchoscopy , bronchoscope ( pencil-thin flexible tube ) pass large airway lung , allow physician examine airway . Cells secretion airway rinse lung salt water . A brush size pencil tip pass bronchoscope scrape cell line airway piece tissue collect analysis . - Close contact patient evaluate twice week 2 week , week 2 week . Blood drawn first visit 1 , 2 , 4 week . Mouth throat swab , nose washing , sputum collection do twice week 2 week , week 2 week . Urine stool sample collect week 4 week . If virus nose throat still detectable 4 week , weekly nose washing throat swab continue virus detect 3 week row . Blood may also draw weekly visit . - Recovered SARS patient provide blood , urine , stool sample mouth throat swab nose aspiration see SARS virus present . For nasal aspiration , salt water put nose suction . Usually , test do . If virus detect , however , nose washing , throat swab blood test repeat week virus detect 3 week row . - Health care worker document contact patient , use isolation procedure equipment , unexpected event occur contact . They evaluate symptom infection provide blood sample month</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Treatment Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since mid February 2003 , report atypical pneumonia originate China subsequently term Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) . SARS subsequently spread multiple country include United States , accompany high anticipated morbidity mortality . Because world travel apparent easy transmissibility disease report nation , number patient SARS may continue rise . The primary purpose protocol evaluate treat person SARS . Other goal characterize clinical course SARS also evaluate close contact people SARS , well recovered SARS . Additional goal protocol elucidate pathophysiology SARS , characterize immune response SARS , evaluate diagnostic test rapid identification SARS clinical specimen . Further knowledge SARS may lead effective form therapy improve mortality disease .</detailed_description>
