	<brief_summary>This study examine pelvic pain associate endometriosis explore well approach treatment . In woman endometriosis , uterine tissue grows outside uterus . Standard treatments - alter hormone level prevent endometrial tissue growth surgically remove endometrial tissue - treat pelvic pain temporarily . This study investigate role sex hormone , immune chemical , stress hormone , gene pelvic pain determine nerve , muscle , skeletal system involve pain . Women 18 50 year age : 1. endometriosis chronic pelvic pain , 2. chronic pelvic pain without endometriosis , 3. neither endometriosis chronic pelvic pain willing tubal ligation ( Healthy Volunteer group ) , may eligible study . Candidates screen questionnaire obtain information pain previous treatment related medical social issue . Participants undergo follow test procedure : 1 . Medical history physical examination , include pelvic exam , blood test , urinalysis , diaphragm fitting . 2 . Questionnaires pain , quality life , sexuality , psychological attitude , spiritual experience , history headache depression . 3 . At-home monitoring 4 6 week pain symptom , menstruation spotting , medicine take , urine collection test `` LH '' surge . LH hormone cause ovary release mature egg . 4 . Pre-laparoscopy evaluation include : - Examination menstrual blood collect diaphragm 4 hour . - Blood sampling measure adrenal pituitary hormone . For test , corticotrophin-releasing hormone ( CRH ) inject IV needle . Up five blood sample draw , start injection 45 minute . Blood also collect time genetic analysis . - In-depth pain assessment identify trigger point muscle associate pelvic pain , region skin sensitivity , bone pain . Some woman undergo microdialysis , use acupuncture-type needle collect chemical two different muscle . - Blood sample twice week 1 month measure change blood substance menstrual cycle . - Blood sample LH surge measure progesterone level . - Cervicovaginal lavage ( wash cervix saline collect fluid ) obtain secretion research . - Ultrasound ovary uterus . This examination use probe inserted vagina emits sound wave use form picture internal structure . A small piece uterine lining also obtain examination research purpose . - A visit member Pain Palliative care service evaluate pain anticipation offering treatment pain surgery . - Surgery : CPP + Endo CPP : Laparoscopy look remove endometrial tissue . This procedure do general anesthetic . A viewing instrument call laparoscope pass incision belly button look endometriosis . If find , two incision make abdomen instrument remove tissue . A small piece uterine lining also obtain examination research purpose . Healthy Volunteers : Laparoscopy perform tubal ligation . A tubal ligation , commonly know `` get tube tie , '' surgical procedure woman sterilize . This procedure close fallopian tube , stop egg travel ovary uterus prevent sperm reach fallopian tube fertilize egg . In tubal ligation , fallopian tube cut , burn , blocked ring , band clip . The surgery effective immediately . Tubal ligations 99.5 % effective birth control . This procedure do general anesthetic . A viewing instrument call laparoscope pass incision belly button perform tubal ligation . Two incision make abdomen instrument perform procedure . During laparoscopy , look remove endometrial tissue . A small piece uterine lining also obtain examination research purpose . -Follow-up evaluation . Two week surgery , patient return NIH discuss surgical finding treatment option . Follow-up visit schedule 1 , 3 , 6 month surgery complete questionnaire determine treatment work . Blood sample draw visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic pelvic pain associate endometriosis poorly understood . This study effort well understand pelvic pain identify novel medical approach treat . Endometriosis common disease woman reproductive year , endometrial tissue grows outside uterus . In recent epidemiologic study , show strong association among endometriosis , fibromyalgia , autoimmune disorder . Currently , believe endometriosis cause chronic pelvic pain . Yet , woman endometriosis pain others pain area unrelated endometriosis disease location . The standard approach treat endometriosis pain medically alter hormone level prevent endometriosis tissue growth surgically remove endometriosis lesion . Pelvic pain temporarily treat either approach , suggest current classification pain , base disease treatment hormone surgery adequate . The feeling pain involve many complex process . Generally , woman suffer frequently chronic , long-term , painful condition men . This suggest woman process pain differently difference sex hormone level gene express sexually dimorphic fashion , well central nervous immune system function difference . We examine relation among sex hormone , pain processing , immune system substance pain related gene . We also examine change level hormonal immune substance blood , endometriosis lesion normal endometrial tissue . Myofascial pain note woman endometriosis chronic pelvic pain . We study nerve , muscle skeletal system involve pelvic pain perform depth pain assessment . Finally , stress play important role generate perpetuate chronic pain . We examine hormone related stress response may alter pelvic pain .</detailed_description>
