	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The metabolic syndrome identifies cluster lipid abnormality , hypertension , hyperglycemia abdominal obesity . It common strong contributor heart disease diabetes disproportionably affect old person . Animal small clinical study suggest psychosocial stress risk factor metabolic syndrome . Underlying mechanism may activation hypothalamopituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis cause hypercortisolemia , , partly turn , elevated inflammation decrease sex hormone level . However , longitudinal data show psychosocial stress indeed contribute onset sequelae metabolic syndrome population large , lack . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The primary objective conduct data-analyses biological sample analysis examine effect psychosocial stress , indicate mood problem ( depressive symptom ) stressful social circumstance ( poverty , negative life event , occupational stress , lack emotional support ) , onset sequelae metabolic syndrome . Secondary objective examine underlie biological mechanism effect psychosocial stress metabolic syndrome . The investigator use available data two ongoing longitudinal community-based study among old person : Health Aging Body Composition ( Health ABC ) study ( n=3,075 , mean age=74 year , 52 % =female , 42 % African American ) InChianti study ( n=1,453 , mean age=69 year , 56 % =female ) . In study psychosocial stress metabolic syndrome well define , longitudinal data sequela ( CVD event diabetes onset ) onset metabolic syndrome available , potentially underlying biological variable , , assess include 24-h urinary cortisol , serum sex steroid hormone ( estradiol , testosterone , SHBG , DHEAS ) inflammatory marker ( IL-6 , IL-10 , TNF-alpha , CRP , various soluble cytokine receptor ) . The result study help design future intervention trial evaluate whether reduce stress and/or physiological consequence , either pharmacological treatment behavioral intervention , could reduce incidence metabolic syndrome old general population .</detailed_description>
