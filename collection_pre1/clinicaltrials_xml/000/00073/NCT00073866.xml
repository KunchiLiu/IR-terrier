	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Celecoxib may stop growth tumor cell stop blood flow tumor . Combining celecoxib combination chemotherapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose irinotecan docetaxel give together celecoxib see well work treat patient advance non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine recommend phase II dose docetaxel irinotecan combination celecoxib patient advance non-small cell lung cancer . - Determine toxic effect regimen patient . - Determine response rate patient treat regimen . - Determine progression-free overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine pharmacokinetics regimen patient . - Correlate angiogenesis marker ( intratumoral microvessel density vascular endothelial growth factor [ VEGF ] expression serum VEGF ) cyclooxygenase-2 expression response survival patient treat regimen . - Correlate UGT1A1 genotype CYP3A4 activity toxic effect regimen patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study docetaxel irinotecan . - Phase I : Patients receive docetaxel IV 60 minute irinotecan IV 30 minute day 1 8 . Patients also receive oral celecoxib twice daily begin day 2 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos docetaxel irinotecan recommend phase II dose determine . The recommended phase II dose define high dose 0 3 1 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . - Phase II : Patients receive treatment phase I recommend phase II dose . Patients follow every 3 month disease progression . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 3-70 patient ( 3-36 phase I 16-34 phase II ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
