	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine docetaxel , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining gemcitabine docetaxel may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combine gemcitabine docetaxel treat patient recurrent osteosarcoma , recurrent Ewing 's sarcoma , unresectable locally recurrent chondrosarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Docetaxel Treating Patients With Recurrent Osteosarcoma ( Closed Accrual 12/21/06 ) Ewing 's Sarcoma Unresectable Locally Recurrent Chondrosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine objective response rate patient recurrent osteosarcoma Ewing 's sarcoma unresectable locally recurrent chondrosarcoma treat sequential gemcitabine docetaxel . Secondary - Determine time progression patient treat regimen . - Assess toxicity regimen patient . - Compare pharmacokinetics regimen vs gemcitabine alone patient . - Obtain tumor sample cDNA microarray analysis gene expression development cell line xenotransplantation model . OUTLINE : This nonrandomized , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord diagnosis recurrent osteosarcoma v recurrent Ewing 's sarcoma v unresectable locally recurrent chondrosarcoma ) . Patients receive gemcitabine intravenously 90 minute day 1 8 docetaxel intravenously 1 hour day 8 . Patients also receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously ( SC ) begin day 9 continue blood count recover . Patients may receive pegfilgrastim SC day 9 ( per course ) alternative G-CSF . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Optional blood sample collect baseline periodically study pharmacokinetics study . Optional tumor tissue sample biopsy surgical resection analyse cDNA microarray analysis gene expression . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A maximum 120 patient ( 40 per stratum ) accrue study within 17-24 month .</detailed_description>
