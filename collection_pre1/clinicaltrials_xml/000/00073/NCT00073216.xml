	<detailed_description>The development vaccine elicit HIV-specific humoral cellular immune response desirable prevention HIV infection . This study investigate combination vaccine regimen consist prim DNA follow boost recombinant envelope glycoprotein adjuvanted MF59 . All participant follow 15 month . Participants enrol Groups 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 receive either vaccine placebo . Study visit complete initial entry ; five visit every 14 day first 2.5 month ; visit Months 4 , 4.5 , 6 , 6.5 , 9 , 9.5 , 12 , 15 . All participant undergo physical exam , urine collection , blood test assess safety , HIV infection , immune response injection . Risk reduction/pregnancy prevention counsel give every study visit . Participants also ask complete questionnaire outside test beliefs certain visit . There two part study . In Part A , participant sequentially assign one three group . Each group receive injection different amount either DNA vaccine placebo entry , Month 1 , Month 2 . This follow identical injection glycoprotein/adjuvant placebo Months 6 9 . Group 1 receive 250 mcg gag env DNA plasmid microparticle vaccine ; Group 2 receive 500 mcg vaccine ; Group 3 receive 1000 mcg vaccine . Participants enrol sequentially low high dose begin Group 1 . In Part B , Group 4 begin second part study simultaneously safety review participant Part A . Group 4 participant receive identical injection either DNA vaccine placebo entry Months 1 , 2 , 6 , 9 . Group 5 begin enrollment enrollment complete Groups 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . Group 5 participant receive identical injection either glycoprotein/adjuvant placebo study entry Months 3 9 .
