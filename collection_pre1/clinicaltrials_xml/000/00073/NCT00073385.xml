	<brief_title>Comparative Trial Pivanex Docetaxel Vs Docetaxel Monotherapy Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Pivanex histone deacetylase inhibitor induces tumor differentiation and/or apoptosis . Pivanex well tolerate clinical trial show preliminary evidence efficacy patient non-small cell lung cancer . Docetaxel approve drug second-line treatment non-small cell lung cancer . Preclinical study indicate combination Pivanex docetaxel synergistic . Purpose : This open-label randomized trial evaluate whether combination therapy Pivanex docetaxel provide clinical benefit docetaxel alone patient chemotherapy resistant non-small cell lung cancer . Objectives : - Compare survival patient non-small cell lung cancer treat combination therapy Pivanex docetaxel vs. docetaxel alone - Compare time disease progression , tumor response , safety profile patient non-small cell lung cancer treat combination therapy Pivanex docetaxel vs. docetaxel alone Outline : This randomize , open-label , multicenter study patient non-small cell lung cancer previously treat one prior platinum contain chemotherapy regimen . Patients stratify ECOG performance status ( 0-1 vs. 2 ) , response prior platinum base chemotherapy ( progression vs. CR/PR/SD ) prior taxane therapy ( yes vs. ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm A : Patients receive combination Pivanex intravenously Days 1-3 docetaxel intravenously Day 4 . Treatment repeat every 21 day disease progression treatment withdrawal . - Arm B : Patients receive docetaxel intravenously Day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day disease progression treatment withdrawal .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) ; Treatment one prior platinumbased chemotherapy regimen ( Eligible patient may include : 1 . Patients previously treat adjuvant neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( must complete within 6 month prior randomization ) 2 . Patients receive chemotherapy advance metastatic lung cancer ) ; Recurrent progressive NSCLC ( local , distant , ) follow initial chemotherapy ) ; Measurable nonmeasurable disease ; Males female , age = &gt; 18 year ; Adequate renal function creatinine = &gt; 1.5 mg/dl ; Adequate liver function alkaline phosphatase = &gt; 2.5 X upper limit normal , SGOT , SGPT = &gt; 1.5 X upper limit normal ; total bilirubin = &gt; upper limit normal ; Adequate bone marrow function : platelet &gt; 100,000/mm3 , hemoglobin = &gt; 9 g/dL , absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) = &gt; 1,500 cells/mm3 ; Able give informed consent ; Discontinuation previous surgery , radiation therapy cancer chemotherapy least four week prior randomization ( six week prior nitrosourea mitomycin C ) , recovery treatmentassociated toxicity ; A predict life expectancy least 12 week ; ECOG performance status 0 , 1 , 2 . Receipt one chemotherapy regimen NSCLC ; A second malignancy within last 5 year curatively treat carcinomainsitu nonmelanoma skin cancer ; Pregnant lactating female ( Females childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test male female patient reproductive potential must agree use adequate birth control ) ; Known HIVpositive patient ; Acute medical problem , ischemic heart lung disease uncontrolled systemic infection ; Patients underlie medical condition circumstance , would contraindicate therapy study treatment , affect compliance impair evaluation study endpoint ; Patients receive investigational agent within 30 day screen visit ; Known allergy reagent study ; Prior docetaxel therapy ; Symptomatic untreated brain metastasis ( Patients brain metastasis eligible clinically neurologically stable &gt; 4 week since therapy ( radiation therapy , radiosurgery/gamma knife ; surgical resection ) determine investigator either corticosteroid stable dose corticosteroid ) .</criteria>
