	<criteria>Signed informed consent ; Subjects must histologically confirm invasive breast cancer stage IV disease primary diagnosis relapse curativeintent surgery [ Singletary , 2002 ] ; Tumors ER+ and/or PgR+ ; Subjects consider ER+ PgR+ assay [ cytochemical , immunochemical , immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) , radioimmunoassay ] primary secondary tumor tissue positive ; Postmenopausal female subject =18 year age ; ECOG Performance Status 0 1 ; Subjects must archive tumor tissue available compare tumor response intratumoral expression ErbB1 ErbB2 . Archived tumor tissue also use confirm estrogen receptor ( ER ) and/or progesterone receptor ( PgR ) positivity . Results use determine subject eligibility study ; Adjuvant therapy aromatase inhibitor allow ; however , treatment must end 1 year prior ( &gt; 12 month ) first dose randomized therapy ; Adjuvant therapy trastuzumab allow ; however , treatment must end 1 year prior ( &gt; 12 month ) first dose randomized therapy ; Subjects receive neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy present newly relapse advanced metastatic disease eligible ; however , prior neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy require study entry ; 11 . Subjects must end hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) ( e.g. , conjugate estrogens tablet , USP , [ Premarin ] ) , least 1 month ( 30 day ) prior receive first dose randomized therapy ; Radiotherapy prior initiation randomize therapy allow limited area ( e.g. , palliative treatment painful bone metastasis ) , sole site disease . Subject must complete treatment recover treatment related toxicity , particular bone marrow suppression ; Able swallow retain oral medication ; Cardiac ejection fraction within institutional range normal measure echocardiogram ( MUGA scan echocardiogram perform inconclusive ) ; Subjects must complete screen assessment outline protocol ; Adequate organ function Premenopausal , pregnant , lactate ; Received prior chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , immunotherapy , biologic therapy , antiErbB1/ErbB2 therapy advance metastatic disease ; Bisphosphonate therapy bone metastases allow ; however , treatment must initiate prior first dose randomize therapy . Prophylactic use bisphosphonates subject without bone disease , except treatment osteoporosis , permit ; Malabsorption Syndrome , disease significantly affect gastrointestinal function , resection stomach small bowel . Subjects ulcerative colitis also exclude ; History malignancy . Subjects diseasefree 5 year , subject history completely resect nonmelanoma skin cancer successfully treat situ carcinoma eligible ; Concurrent disease condition would make subject inappropriate study participation , serious medical disorder would interfere subject 's safety ; Subjects recover toxicity relate prior adjuvant therapy ( e.g. , surgery , radiotherapy , chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , immunotherapy , biologic therapy , investigational agent ) ; Subjects receive anthracyclines neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant setting , exceed follow dos : 360 mg/m2 Doxorubicin , 720 mg/m2 Epirubicin , 72 mg/m2 Mitoxantrone ; Subjects extensive symptomatic visceral disease include hepatic involvement pulmonary lymphangitic spread tumor , disease consider investigator rapidly progress life threatening ; Active uncontrolled infection ; Dementia , alter mental status , psychiatric condition would prohibit understanding rendering informed consent ; Known history uncontrolled symptomatic angina , arrhythmia , congestive heart failure ; Known history , clinical evidence , central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases leptomeningeal carcinomatosis ; Concurrent anticancer therapy ( chemotherapy , radiation therapy , surgery , immunotherapy , hormonal therapy , target therapy , biologic therapy , tumor embolization ) letrozole ; Concurrent treatment investigational agent participation another clinical trial ; Used investigational drug within 30 day 5 halflives , whichever longer , precede first dose randomized therapy ( GW572016 placebo ) ; The subject know immediate delay hypersensitivity reaction idiosyncrasy drug chemically relate randomize therapy ( GW572016 placebo ) excipients randomized therapy ( GW572016 placebo ) ; 18 . Subject know hypersensitivity Femara excipients Femara</criteria>
