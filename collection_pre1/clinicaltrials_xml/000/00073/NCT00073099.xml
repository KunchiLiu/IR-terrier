	<brief_summary>Surface eye problem ( problem cornea conjunctiva ) , dry eye , often evaluate use ocular surface stain - application color dye surface eye . The physician examines nature , degree , pattern stain eye 's surface determine diagnosis , assess disease severity , document treatment effect . Grading ocular surface stain often use research study measure response treatment treatment side effect . Therefore , critical grading methodology reproducible sufficiently detail detect change eye health status . Current evaluation technique use dye somewhat subjective , however , since require human assessment judgment . This study assess validity reliability digital photography compare standard slit lamp evaluation analyze ocular surface dye stain document surface eye damage patient dry eye . Patients 3 year age old dry eye may eligible study . Participants follow test procedure : - Visual acuity : ( eye chart ) test - Slit lamp evaluation : Examination front part eye special microscope call slit lamp biomicroscope . Special dye derive vegetable instill eye stain surface eye dry damage . The doctor determine extent stain . The staining repeat within one week first examination . - Digital eye photography : Digital photograph eye take aid assess extent dry eye change . The camera flash bright light picture . About 5 10 picture take eye .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ocular surface vital dye stain measure ocular surface damage frequently use endpoint clinical study . The identification development standardize objective outcome measure evaluation therapeutic intervention ocular surface disease area previously identify critical future well-designed clinical trial area . The Report NEI / Industry Workshop Clinical Trials Dry Eyes identify , standardization clinical test use diagnose dry eye state assess treatment effect , area critical interest . The purpose protocol determine suitability slit lamp biomicroscopic digital photography ocular surface vital dye stain compare current standard procedure , clinical assessment . Digital image-based assessment would many advantage current procedure would apply appropriate rigor evaluation anterior segment show extremely effective method evaluation extent posterior segment disease diabetic retinopathy age-related macular degeneration . Such valid , reproducible , reliable photographic documentation retinal abnormality disease progression successfully employ primary outcome measure many large clinical trial . In protocol , compare grade digital image ocular surface stain clinical assessment , facilitate use ocular surface vital dye stain valid outcome measure clinical trial .</detailed_description>
