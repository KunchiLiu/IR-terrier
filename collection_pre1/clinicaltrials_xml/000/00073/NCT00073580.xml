	<criteria>Inclusion : Be least 18 year age . Be accept OPCAB graft surgery ( repeat CABG eligible ) New diagnosis history objectively document HIT/HITTS Type II , define : 1 . Positive heparininduced platelet aggregation ( HIPA ) functional assay HIT immunoassay HIT antibody ( ELISA ) , AND/OR 2 . HIT : Thrombocytopenia associate heparin therapy , platelet count decrease 50 % , OR 3 . HITTS : Thrombocytopenia ( define B ) PLUS arterial venous thrombosis ( Deepvein thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , mesenteric venouse arterial thrombosis , acute myocardial infarction , leave ventricular thrombus , ischemic stroke , occlusion limb artery ) diagnose physical exam/lab evidence and/or appropriate imaging study ( duplex ultrasound , venography , ventilationperfusion scan , venouse arterial angiography , MRI/MRA , catheterization . ) Confirmed pregnancy , urine serum pregnancy test ( woman childbearing potential ) . Cerebrovascular accident within 6 month , cerebrovascular accident residual neurological deficit . Intracranial neoplasm , arteriovenous malformation , aneurysm . Dependency renal dialysis creatinine clearance &lt; 30mL/min . Ongoing treatment warfarin ( oral anticoagulant ) time enrollment . Patients previously treat warfarin may enrol warfarin therapy safely discontinue baseline INR &lt; 1.3 time control absence heparin therapy . Known allergy Angiomax hirudin derive drug , know sensitivity component product . Patients receive clopidogrel ( Plavix® ) within previous 5 day may enrol opinion Investigator benefit surgery outweigh risk associate recent clopidogrel administration . Patients receive glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor within previous 48 hour abciximab ( ReoPro® ) 12 hour eptifibatide ( Integrilin® ) tirofiban ( Aggrastat® ) , may enrol opinion investigator benefit surgery outweigh risk associate wait 48 12 hour time period prior enrollment . Patients receive lepirudin ( Refludan® ) argatroban within previous 24 hour prior enrollment . Patients currently receive lepirudin argatroban enrol switched Angiomax least 24 hour prior contemplate OPCAB . Patients receive low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) thrombolytic within previous 12 hour may enrol opinion Investigator benefit surgery outweigh risk associate wait 12 hour time period . Participation clinical research study involve evaluation investigational drug device within 30 day randomization . Refusal undergo blood transfusion become necessary . Any disease condition , , judgment investigator would place patient undue risk enrol trial inability comply study requirement .</criteria>
