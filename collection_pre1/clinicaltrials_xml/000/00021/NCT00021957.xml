	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The study develop easily obtain surrogate marker incorporate model function place `` hard '' end-points assessment new treatment patient heart failure . In view epidemiologic importance heart failure large expensive study currently require test new treatment , successful surrogate marker model would major advance field would speed development reduce cost therapeutic advance . The study ancillary NHLBI-supported clinical trial `` Evaluation Study Congestive Heart Failure Pulmonary Artery Catheterization Effectiveness ( ESCAPE ) . '' ESCAPE compare efficacy Pulmonary Artery Catheterization ( PAC ) -directed treatment strategy non-invasive treatment strategy morbidity mortality patient severe , class IV New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) congestive heart failure . A secondary objective ESCAPE determine cost resource utilization PAC-directed treatment strategy compare non-invasive treatment strategy . The study response initiative `` Ancillary Studies Heart , Lung , Blood Disease Trials '' release National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute June 2000 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The ancillary , prospective , observational study design evaluate potential serum biomarkers atrial natriuretic peptide , brain natriuretic peptide , cardiac troponins serve prognostic index surrogate endpoint death hospitalization heart failure trial . The first goal wlll accomplish evaluate outcomes . The investigator develop risk score patient advance heart failure incorporate serum biomarkers clinical variable test interaction score pulmonary artery catheterization . They evaluate ability serum biomarkers serve objective measure clinical hemodynamic status assess potential marker serve tool assist selection titration therapy . In addition . examine relation level natriuretic peptide , troponins , catecholamine . This information launch point second goal , examine relationship serum biomarkers treatment effect pulmonary-artery catheterization death hospitalization . In addition , investigator evaluate relation level natriuretic peptide , troponins , treatment effect B-adrenergic antagonist inotropic agent clinical outcome . Ultimately , intend construct statistical model incorporate serum biomarkers great promise clinical variable demonstrate predict survival . This final model may prove best surrogate endpoint possible , capture array physiological mechanism pulmonary-artery catheter guide therapy may effect . This propose substudy conduct within framework ESCAPE trial . Natriuretic peptide level currently collect randomization , discharge , one month , six month secondary endpoint trial . Catecholamines also collect baseline three month . In addition , ESCAPE investigator ready capture detailed demographic , clinical , physiological information part protocol primary study . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
