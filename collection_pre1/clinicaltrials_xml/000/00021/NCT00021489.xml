	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn safe well-tolerated mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) give abacavir ( ABC ) . Another purpose see add MMF ABC decrease viral load ( amount HIV blood ) ABC alone . Many HIV-infected patient heavy exposure anti-HIV drug experience treatment failure need new treatment combination . One promise combination ABC MMF part drug combination . Laboratory study show MMF help ABC destroy HIV cell clinical test need . MMF FDA-approved treatment HIV infection approve FDA prevent rejection organ transplant . Doses MMF test study lower use treat people organ transplant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mycophenolate Mofetil Abacavir Treatment HIV Patients With Failed Anti-HIV Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A large group heavily drug-exposed HIV-infected individual detectable HIV-1 RNA exist result sequential use failure exist antiretroviral agent 3 antiretroviral drug class ( nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [ NRTIs ] , protease inhibitor [ PIs ] , nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [ NNRTIs ] ) . Systematic approach need define `` salvage therapy '' regimens patient group . This trial use short-term study determine initial safety , pharmacology , antiviral potency MMF augment antiretroviral effect ABC , appraise use salvage regimen . After rapid oral absorption , MMF hydrolyze form MPA ( mycophenolic acid ) , active metabolite . Recent vitro study show MPA concentration low 62.5 nM synergistically increase antiviral effect ABC ddI , ABC combination ddI , multinucleoside-resistant HIV strain . These observation suggest MMF combination ABC might play role antiretroviral therapy patient drug resistance , continue clinical evaluation MMF warrant . At study entry , patient stop current NRTIs continue take PIs NNRTIs study treatment . The first 50 patient stratified plasma HIV-1 RNA ( 40,000 copies/ml 40,000 high copies/ml ) randomize either Arm A Arm B . Arm A receive ABC MMF placebo ; Arm B receive ABC MMF . Only ABC MMF provide study . Treatment receive 4 week patient evaluate safety , tolerability , virologic response . At Week 4 , entry genotype result provide patient antiretroviral therapy may alter indicated . Patients unblinded study treatment soon possible Week 4 later Week 7 . Future open Arm C 125 additional patient delay first 50 patient reach Week 4 interim review safety virologic response complete . Responders may continue study treatment Week 24 . At 10 clinic visit patient blood draw HIV-1 RNA determination , CD4 CD8 cell count , genotyping . Patients may participate pharmacokinetic substudy A5121s .</detailed_description>
