	<brief_summary>Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill deliver cancer-killing substance . Combining chemotherapy monoclonal antibody may kill tumor cell . This randomized phase II/III trial see combination chemotherapy work well without bevacizumab treat patient advance , metastatic , recurrent non-small cell lung cance</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy With Without Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Advanced , Metastatic , Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess toxicity survival patient advance metastatic ( stage IIIB pleural effusion/IV ) , nonsquamous histology non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) treat carboplatin plus paclitaxel +/- bevacizumab . ( Phase II ) II . To assess response rate time progression patient advance metastatic ( stage IIIB-pleural effusion/IV ) , nonsquamous histology NSCLC treat carboplatin plus paclitaxel +/- bevacizumab . ( Phase II ) III . To assess overall survival patient advance metastatic ( stage IIIB-pleural effusion/IV ) , nonsquamous histology NSCLC treat carboplatin plus paclitaxel +/- bevacizumab . ( Phase III ) IV . To assess response rate , time progression , toxicity patient advance metastatic ( stage IIIB-pleural effusion/IV ) , non-squamous histology NSCLC treat carboplatin plus paclitaxel +/- bevacizumab . ( Phase III ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine pre-treatment level plasma VEGF predict response chemotherapy carboplatin-Taxol without anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) . II . To determine pre-treatment plasma VEGF prognostic value advance NSCLC . III . To determine whether elevated plasma level endothelial cell-specific protein ( VCAM , E-selectin ) , reflective chemotherapy anti-VEGF induce endothelial damage , useful marker assess response carboplatin/Taxol +/- anti-VEGF therapy . IV . To determine whether pre- post-treatment plasma level basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) prognostic value predictive response therapy . OUTLINE : This randomize study . Patients stratify accord measurable disease ( yes v ) , prior radiotherapy ( yes v ) , weight loss ( le 5 % vs 5 % ) , disease stage ( IIIB vs IV v recurrent ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour follow carboplatin IV 15-30 minute day 1 . ARM II : Patients receive paclitaxel carboplatin arm I follow bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment arm repeat every 3 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion 6 course , patient arm II stable respond disease continue receive bevacizumab . Treatment repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 842 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
