	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect motor train focal hand dystonia people writer 's cramp examine whether train affect excitability motor cortex brain . In dystonia , muscle spasm cause uncontrolled twist repetitive movement abnormal posture . Focal dystonia involve one part body , hand , neck face . Patients focal hand dystonia difficulty individualize finger movement , may due increase excitability motor cortex . Patients hand dystonia 21 year age old may eligible 2-month study . Those take botulinum toxin injection must stop medication 3 month enter study . Participants undergo complete neurologic examination . They undergo motor training `` constraint-induced movement therapy . '' This therapy involve constrain finger allow others move . Participants follow test procedure baseline ( motor training ) , 4 week motor training , 8 week : - Handwriting analysis - A computerized program evaluate degree `` automatic movement '' patient us write , well write pressure speed . - Symptoms evaluation - Patients fill write questionnaire symptom rate improvement , , train . - Transcranial magnetic stimulation - The patient seat comfortable chair , insulated wire coil place scalp . Brief electrical current pas coil , create magnetic pulse travel brain . These pulse generate small electrical current brain cortex , briefly disrupt function brain cell stimulate area . The stimulation may cause muscle twitch tingle scalp , face , arm hand . During stimulation , patient ask slightly tense certain muscle hand arm perform simple action . Electrodes tap skin muscle activate stimulation , electrical activity muscle record computer . - Electroencephalogram ( EEG ) - Wire electrode tap scalp place Lycra cap patient wear record brain 's electrical activity . Participants 50-minute motor training session 3 time first week study , twice second week week 3 4 . In addition , require practice training home 25 minute day week 1 50 minute day remain 3 week . Fingers train splint .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dystonia movement disorder characterize sustained muscle contraction generate twist repetitive movement abnormal posture . Abnormalities motor cortex show patient focal hand dystonia . In addition well know dystonic patient co-contraction antagonist muscle , individualize finger movement imprecise difficult . Motor train `` constraint-induced movement therapy '' describe successful patient musician 's cramp . We therefore hypothesize motor train train individualized finger movement could improve focal hand dystonia patient writer 's cramp . We propose study one group twelve patient either pure dystonic writer 's cramp . Patients receive individualize finger train immobilization finger train . Evaluation improvement do handwriting analysis program develop Mai Marquardt , clinical evaluation Fahn-Dystonia Scale . Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) study show patient dystonia less intracortical inhibition compare normal subject , lead excessive cortical activity possibly co-contraction agonist-antagonist group muscle forearm result dystonic posturing . Furthermore , study basal ganglia disorder well dystonia suggest movement related cortical potential might show plastic change reflect degree `` successful '' performance motor task . We therefore would like evaluate excitability motor cortex train TMS movement relate cortical potential .</detailed_description>
