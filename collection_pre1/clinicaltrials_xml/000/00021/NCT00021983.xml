	<brief_title>Immunotoxin Therapy Treating Patients With Hairy Cell Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Assess toxicity therapeutic efficacy recombinant BL22 immunotoxin patient refractory recurrent CD22+ hairy cell leukemia . - Define pharmacokinetics drug , include terminal elimination serum half-life area curve volume distribution , patient . - Evaluate immunogenicity drug patient . - Determine effect drug various component circulate cellular immune system patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive recombinant BL22 immunotoxin IV 30 minute day 1 , 3 , 5 . Treatment repeat least every 42 day 4 course absence disease progression sufficient neutralize antibody . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos recombinant BL22 immunotoxin maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose 1 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A maximum 46 patient accrue study within 3 year .</detailed_description>
