	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn whether change type anti-HIV drug call protease inhibitor ( PI ) another type anti-HIV drug help lower amount fat sugar blood . PIs effective keep HIV viral load ( amount HIV blood ) . However , people take PIs high normal level fat and/or sugar blood . Doctors believe switch anti-HIV drug contain PIs improve abnormal side effect . This study test 3 different combination non-PI drug see may improve side effect keep viral load low .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Protease inhibitor ( PI ) -containing antiretroviral regimen potent suppressor HIV replication . Increasingly , metabolic abnormality hypercholesterolemia triglyceridemia associate PI use , reason cite switch PI-sparing regimen . Yet optimal switch regimen take account improvement side effect continue virologic suppression define . This study compare effect chemical metabolic abnormalities switch nucleoside regimen versus dual nucleoside plus nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) therapy . Determining effect regimen chemical metabolic abnormality maintenance virologic suppression define switch strategy study improve metabolic abnormality without compromise viral suppression . Patients stratified basis fast non-HDL cholesterol triglyceride level ritonavir- nonritonavir-containing pre-entry PI regimen . Patients assign randomly add pre-entry regimen 1 follow 3 treatment : Arm A - ABC ; Arm B - NVP ; Arm C - EFV . Patients discontinue pre-entry PIs Day 14 . Patients follow determine effect maintenance regimens fast non-high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) , cholesterol , triglycerides Week 24 . Fasting total cholesterol , HDL cholesterol , direct low-density lipoprotein , triglyceride measure Weeks 12 , 24 , 48 . Fasting glucose , insulin , C-peptide , apolipoproteins A-1 B , lipoprotein , homocysteine measure Weeks 24 48 . Anthropometrics , body mass index , body image measure Weeks 12 , 24 , 48 . HIV viral load measure Weeks 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 32 , 40 , 48 . If HIV RNA stay 200 copies/ml , therapy continue unchanged . If confirm HIV RNA 200 copies/ml high found , HIV genotype obtain provide viral load sufficient yield result , best medical therapy institute ( supply study ) , treatment/on study follow-up continue . If patient intolerant study drug , alternate study drug ( ABC , EFV , NVP supply study ) permit switched treatment/on study follow-up continue , best medical therapy institute ( supply study ) , treatment/on study follow-up continue . Patients follow last patient enrol complete 48 week study .</detailed_description>
