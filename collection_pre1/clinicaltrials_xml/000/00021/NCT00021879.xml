	<brief_title>Visceral Adiposity CVD Risk Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Obesity associate increased morbidity mortality . Concern obesity increase prevalence severity increase age onset decrease . It also become clear location fat may play important role determine risk associate obesity . Intra-abdominal fat show particularly adverse consequence relate cardiovascular risk factor . Of interest fact number study show impact overall adiposity differs race . For unit increase adiposity , black appear less increase blood pressure triglycerides less decrease HDL cholesterol compare white . This racial difference relationship adiposity cardiovascular risk status may relate difference distribution fat . It hypothesize give level increase total body fat ( measure DEXA ) black woman less intra-abdominal fat ( measure magnetic resonance imaging ) . The cohort study define group black white woman initially recruit study child age nine 10 year part National Heart , Lung Blood Institute National Growth Health Study . The cohort maintain study continuously past 11 12 year 75 percent original cohort remain . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Subjects study age 23 age 25 year . At examination , subject measurement total fat ( DEXA ) , intra-abdominal fat ( MRI ) , fast lipid lipoprotein , insulin glucose , blood pressure , leave ventricular mass ( echocardiography ) . In addition , time pubertal maturation dietary intake fat sucrose evaluate potential determinant intra-abdominal fat use data previously collect age nine year age 22 year . Study cohort provide unique opportunity evaluate whether difference deposition intraabdominal fat relate racial difference relationship adiposity cardiovascular risk factor . It also allow evaluation childhood adolescent determinant adult intra-abdominal adiposity . The result investigation may provide insight prevention intra-abdominal fat accumulation ultimate lowering risk cardiovascular disease .</detailed_description>
