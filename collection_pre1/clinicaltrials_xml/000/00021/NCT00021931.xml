	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Asthma chronic inflammatory disease . T lymphocytes essential initiate maintain asthmatic inflammatory immune response . Corticosteroid treatment target several inflammatory response , include T lymphocytemediated response . In addition , leukotriene receptor antagonist ( LTRA ) may influence T cell activation . To investigate effect two controller agent treatment asthma airway function goal IMPACT clinical trial mild chronic adult asthmatic . The Improving Asthma Control Trial ( IMPACT ) one trial within NHLBI-supported Asthma Clinical Research Network ( ACRN ) . IMPACT double-blind , randomize , parallel group design clinical trial determine best long-term strategy treat adult mild asthma experience symptom occasionally . The trial test whether patient take anti-inflammatory medication daily basis whether new class medication provide benefit old drug . In IMPACT study , 234 adult mild asthma occasional symptom enrol six clinical research center . Following initial evaluation , patient randomize receive either twice daily inhale corticosteroid , twice daily anti-leukotriene , placebo . All patient receive treatment symptom occur . The result demonstrate whether medication require daily basis patient , , whether inhaled corticosteroid leukotriene modifier equally effective . Recruitment begin May , 2000 . The trial expect completed 2003 . The study response initiative `` Ancillary Studies Heart , Lung , Blood Disease Trials '' release National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute June 2000 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A total 39 patient , 13 arm , randomize inhaled steroid , leukotriene receptor antagonist placebo follow 18 month change T-cell costimulatory pathway . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
