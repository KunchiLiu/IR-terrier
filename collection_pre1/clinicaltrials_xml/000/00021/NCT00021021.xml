	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response rate patient metastatic renal cell cancer treat RPI.4610 . II . Determine percentage patient stable disease 16 week start treatment drug . III . Assess safety tolerability drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive RPI.4610 subcutaneously daily . Treatment continue 16 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable respond disease may continue treatment 16 week . Patients follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
