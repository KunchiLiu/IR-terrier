	<brief_summary>This study test safety effectiveness inhale interferon gamma-1b oral antibiotic treat mycobacterium avium complex ( MAC ) infection lung . Patients 18 year age old MAC infection lung 1 ) previously treat MAC , 2 ) moderate severe lung disease due MAC previously treat may eligible study . Participants randomly assign one two treatment group . Group 1 receive 500 microgram interferon gamma-1b 3 time week 48 week inhalation . Group 2 inhale placebo ( inactive substance ) accord regimen . In addition , patient receive standard MAC treatment three antibiotics-clarithromycin azithromycin , ethambutol rifampin rifabutin-taken mouth time week . Patients come clinic screening visit , baseline visit , 1 month begin treatment , 3-month interval thereafter end study . During various visit , undergo follow test procedure : - Medical history physical examination , include height weight measurement , heart rate , breathe rate , blood pressure temperature - Possibly compute tomography ( CT ) X-ray lung - Sputum sample - Pulmonary function study - Blood urine test Patients ' eye examine monthly check side effect ethambutol , hear balance test check side effect clarithromycin azithromycin . At baseline visit , patient caretaker train use nebulizer ( special breathing device ) take study medication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized , Double-Blinded , Placebo-Controlled , Phase II Inhaled Interferon Gamma-1b Antimycobacterials Treat Pulmonary Mycobacterium Avium Complex Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nontuberculous mycobacterial infection due Mycobacterium avium complex ( MAC ) grow problem among old Americans , especially woman . These organism relatively resistant antituberculous medication frequently persist recur . In patient disseminated infection , interferon gamma show critical cytokine resistance therapy infection . Previous experience inject interferon gamma relatively disappointing , clinical response rate conventional therapy-refractory patient 20 % . Aerosol administration interferon gamma show rapidly convert sputum smear negative multidrug resistant tuberculosis one case MAC infection . However , short-term experiment , culture remain positive patient clinical relapse . In addition , aerosol administration interferon gamma significantly less systemic activation side effect systemic administration . Therefore , propose administer interferon gamma aerosol lung patient MAC infection persist despite adequate conventional therapy . This aerosol deliver 3 time weekly patient . This trial randomize double blind . The period therapy 48 week follow another 48 week . All patient must conventional therapy time organisms macrolide sensitive . Screening treatment conduct NIH Clinical Center well multiple collaborative site . This study clarify therapeutic role aerosolize interferon gamma treatment nontuberculous mycobacterial infection .</detailed_description>
