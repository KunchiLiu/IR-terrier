	<brief_summary>This study examine whether experimental drug R115777 ( Tipifarnib ) shrink slow growth plexiform neurofibromas child young adult neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) determine side effect relate treatment . Plexiform tumor arise nerve ; effective treatment surgical removal . Often , however , tumor remove , number location . Patients NF1 reduce amount protein neurofibromin . Neurofibromin think help control activity another protein , call ra , regulates cell growth . Too little neurofibromin , therefore , may allow uncontrolled cell growth tumor formation . R115777 interfere function ra protein . In test tube animal study , R115777 block growth cancer cell . This study examine whether drug effective plexiform tumor . Patients NF1 progressive plexiform neurofibromas 3 25 year age may eligible study . Patients whose tumor successfully remove surgically may participate study . Candidates screen medical history physical eye examination , blood urine test , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Photographs take tumor visible body surface . Study participant randomly assign receive either R115777 placebo ( inactive substance ) . They take R115777 placebo tablet every 12 hour 21 day , follow 7-day rest period . This constitute one 28-day treatment cycle . Treatment continue long tumor remain stable shrink side effect tolerable . The treatment switch ( example , placebo R115777 ) stop tumor grow side effect become unacceptable . Patients ( parent ) keep record side effect . For first 3 treatment cycle , patient physical examination blood test every week . Blood test also do start treatment , one time point least 14 day treatment measure effect R115777 proteins blood cell . A blood sample obtain start treatment cycle 4 , 7 10 every 6 cycle measure level substance call nerve growth factor . The analysis nerve growth factor use determine predict patient might risk develop side effect R115777 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>R115777 ( Tipifarnib ) farnesyltransferase inhibitor block post-translational isoprenylation ra farnesylated protein . The ras proteins integral cell signal pathway , farnesylation essential function mutant non-mutant ra protein . Patients neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) increase risk develop tumor central peripheral nervous system , standard treatment option , surgery , available tumor . Neurofibromin , product NF1 gene , contain domain significant homology ra GTPase-activating protein ( GAP ) . Although NF1 patient lack germline ra mutation , decrease level neurofibromin show associate constitutively activate ras-GTP status . Thus , upstream inhibition ra farnesylation may inhibit growth tumor NF1 patient . A randomized , cross-over , double-blinded , placebo-controlled pediatric phase II trial oral R115777 perform child young adult NF1 , progressive , plexiform neurofibroma ( ) determine effect novel anticancer drug rate growth neurofibroma . The endpoint trial time progression . R115777 administer orally dose 200 mg/m ( 2 ) twice daily cycle 21 day follow 7 day rest period base result prior pediatric phase I trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Age : 3 year 25 year age . Diagnosis : Patients neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) progressive plexiform neurofibromas potential cause significant morbidity , ( limit ) head neck lesion could compromise airway great vessel , brachial lumbar plexus lesion could cause nerve compression loss function , lesion could result major deformity ( e.g. , orbital lesion ) , lesion extremity cause limb hypertrophy loss function , painful lesion . Histologic confirmation tumor necessary presence consistent clinical radiographic finding , clinically suspect . In addition plexiform neurofibroma ( ) , study subject must least one diagnostic criterion NF1 list ( National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Consensus Conference [ 9 ] ) : 1 . Six cafeaulait spot ( 0.5 cm prepubertal subject 1.5 cm postpubertal subject ) . 2 . Freckling axilla groin ; 3 . Optic glioma ; 4 . Two Lisch nodule ; 5 . A distinctive bony lesion ( dysplasia sphenoid bone dysplasia thin long bone cortex ) ; 6 . A first degree relative NF1 . In study plexiform neurofibroma define neurofibroma grow along length nerve may involve multiple fascicle branch . A spinal plexiform neurofibroma involve two level connection level extend laterally along nerve . Measurable disease : Patients must measurable plexiform neurofibroma ( ) . For purpose study measurable lesion define lesion least 3 cm measure one dimension . There must evidence recurrent progressive disease document increase size presence new plexiform neurofibroma MRI . Progression time study entry define : 1 . A measurable increase plexiform neurofibroma ( 20 % increase volume , 13 % increase product two long perpendicular diameter , 6 % increase long diameter ) last two consecutive scan ( magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) compute tomography ( CT ) ) , time period approximately one year prior evaluation study . 2 . Patients underwent surgery progressive plexiform neurofibroma eligible enter study surgery , provide plexiform neurofibroma incompletely resect measurable . Prior therapy : Patients NF1 eligible time recurrence progression inoperable plexiform neurofibroma . A surgical consultation obtain prior enrollment study evaluate tumor resection feasible option . Patients eligible complete tumor resection feasible , patient surgical option refuse surgery . Since standard effective chemotherapy patient NF1 progressive plexiform neurofibroma , patient may treat trial without receive prior therapy . Patients must recover toxic effect prior therapy enter study . The Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program Common Toxicity Criteria ( CTC ) Version 2.0 use toxicity assessment . A copy CTC version 2.0 download CTEP home page : http : //ctep.cancer.gov . Recovery define toxicity grade le 2 , unless otherwise specify Inclusion Exclusion Criteria . Patients must last dose radiation therapy least six week prior study entry , last dose chemotherapy least four week prior study entry . Patients receive growth colony stimulate factor ( GCSF ) prior cycle chemotherapy must GCSF least one week prior enter study . Performance Status : Patients life expectancy least 12 month Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance score 0 , 1 , 2 . Patients wheelchair bound paralysis consider 'ambulatory ' wheelchair . Hematologic Function : Patients must absolute granulocyte count 1,500/ uL , 9.0 gm/dl , platelet count 150,000/uL study entry , normal fibrinogen . Hepatic Function : Patients must bilirubin within normal limit serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) 2x upper limit normal . Patients Gilbert syndrome exclude requirement normal bilirubin . ( Gilbert syndrome find 310 % general population , characterize mild , chronic unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia absence liver disease overt hemolysis ) . Renal Function : Patients must ageadjusted normal serum creatinine OR creatinine clearance ( 70 mL / min / 1.73 m^2 ) . Informed Consent : All patient legal guardian ( patient le 18 year old ) must sign institutional review board ( IRB ) approve document inform consent ( screen protocol ) prior perform study obtain exclusively determine patient eligibility . After confirmation patient eligibility patient legal guardian must sign protocol specific inform consent document understand investigational nature risk study protocol relate study perform ( study perform determine patient eligibility ) . When appropriate pediatric patient include discussion . Per institutional guideline , age appropriate assent form child 7 12 year , child may develop , appropriate , sign pediatric patient order obtain write assent . Durable Power Attorney ( DPA ) : All patient 18 year age offer opportunity assign DPA another person make decision medical care become incapacitated cognitively impaired . Ability undergo MRI examination . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Pregnant breast feeding female exclude , toxic effect pharmacology R115777 fetus newborn unknown . Clinically significant unrelated systemic illness ( serious infection significant cardiac , pulmonary , hepatic organ dysfunction ) judgement Principal Associate Investigator would compromise patient 's ability tolerate R115777 likely interfere study procedure result . Prior treatment great 1 prior myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimen . An investigational agent within past 30 day . Evidence optic glioma , malignant glioma , malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor cancer require treatment chemotherapy radiation therapy .
