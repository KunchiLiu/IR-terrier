	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Asthma major public health problem United States , particularly high prevalence rate among Hispanic group . Genetic linkage study disease potentially great utility identification risk , search new pharmaceutical treatment , design intervention prevent development asthma . Study power greatly enhance relatively isolated , homogeneous population significant prevalence asthma identify . Such population exist among Hispanics United States available Central Valley Costa Rica . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study concentrate genetically isolate Hispanic population high asthma prevalence live Central Valley Costa Rica . A genome screen conduct large pedigree multiplex asthma linkage analysis perform seven intermediate phenotype relate asthma include airway responsiveness ; FEV1 ; bronchodilator responsiveness ; skin test reactivity common aeroallergens ; serum total allergen-specific IgE ; peripheral blood eosinophil count . A genome screen also conduct parent-child trio , ancestral haplotype reconstruct identify region influence asthma-associated phenotype . Within candidate region demonstrate linkage extend pedigree asthma and/or asthma-related phenotype significant linkage disequilibrium within unrelated asthmatic subject , fine mapping perform test genetic association single nucleotide polymorphism within positional candidate gene .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Selection Extension Family Pedigrees Probands select basis physician diagnosis asthma ; history recurrent asthma attack least 2 respiratory symptom ; either airway hyperresponsiveness methacholine significant response bronchodilator ( Albuterol ) administration . At least 15 family , least two sibling one parent physician diagnosis asthma ascertain enrol study Costa Rica . All available first seconddegree relative proband enrol , include affect unaffected individual . Probands recruit 72 asthmatic child age 612 yr participate phase II International Study Asthma Allergies Childhood ( ISAAC ) . The Principal Investigator study Costa Rica , Dr. Manuel SotoQuiros , collaborate u year pilot study genetics asthma Costa Rica . Informed consent study approve IRB Hospital Nacional de Ninos ( San Jose , Costa Rica ) Costa Rican Ministry Health , approval obtain Institutional Review Board Brigham Women 's Hospital genotyping data analysis . The parent child provide information respiratory health status child . Lineages 72 child ( probands ) trace back least three generation . All child least 6 greatgrandparents Central Valley origin , therefore descend primarily original founder population Central Valley Costa Rica . After determine eligibility , Dr. SotoQuiros contact parent eligible child . If unable recruit 15 family 72 family participate Phase II ISAAC , apply criterion selection family pedigree 315 parentchild trio enrol propose study . We , however , exclude trio select pedigree extension analysis plan parentchild trio recruit present study . Parents eligible child contact Dr. SotoQuiros mail phone , accord preference . Once asthmatic child 's family select extension , give copy brief study description proband 's parent , keep copy distribute others interested relative . We ask proband 's parent ask relative permission contact regard study . Relatives give u permission contact proband 's parent call telephone explain study set interview . ParentChild Trios Probands select use criterion outline . 1,200 asthmatic child parent ( 3,600 individual ) ascertain enrol study Central Valley Costa Rica . Probands recruit approximately 3,500 schoolchildren age 612 yr Central Valley Costa Rica . A short screening questionnaire administer parent child obtain information child 's respiratory health status last names his/her parent . The parent instruct child take complete questionnaire back school seal envelope . Based information , anticipate select 800 child physician diagnosis asthma ; either &gt; /= 2 respiratory symptom history recurrent asthma attack ; high probability &gt; /= 6 greatgrandparents Central Valley origin , determine genealogist . Once asthmatic child 's family select , ask permission parent conduct methacholine challenge test index child determine whether true asthmatic . Inclusion Criteria A family eligible inclusion study asthmatic proband family meet follow criterion . Each proband must : 1 . Be least 6 year age 2 . Have physician diagnosis asthma either &gt; /= 2 respiratory symptom history recurrent asthma attack 3 . Have either airway hyperresponsiveness methacholine ( PD20 &lt; /= 16 mg/ml ) ( FEV1 &lt; /= 65 % predict ) significant bronchodilator response ( increase least 12 % baseline FEV1 ) 4 . Have least 6 greatgrandparents born Central Valley Costa Rica 5 . Have his/her parent give voluntary write consent participate study 6 . Give his/her assent participate study . 7 . Have least 2 sibling physiciandiagnosed asthma one parent physician diagnosis asthma All first seconddegree relative proband , affect unaffected enrol study 15 large , multigenerational family pedigree available willing participate . The natural mother father proband enrol study 600 parentchild trio available willing participate . Exclusion Criteria A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply . Each subject must : 1 . Be adopt 2 . Have chronic respiratory disorder asthma ( e.g. , active tuberculosis , bronchiectasis ) . Inactive tuberculosis exclusion criterion 3 . For study large , multigenerational pedigree : Have familial relationship remain fourteen ( 14 ) family last four generation . Subject reconsideration Inclusion Subjects fulfil follow exclusion criterion may eligible inclusion study later date provide study physician feel participation adversely influence result study . 1 . Subjects take antibiotic respiratory disease within one month respiratory infection within 6 week visit .</criteria>
