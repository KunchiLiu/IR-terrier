	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Squalamine lactate may stop slow growth ovarian cancer stop blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining squalamine lactate carboplatin may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combine squalamine lactate carboplatin treat patient recurrent refractory stage III stage IV ovarian cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Squalamine Lactate Plus Carboplatin Treating Patients With Recurrent Refractory Stage III Stage IV Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response rate time progression patient recurrent refractory stage III IV ovarian cancer treat squalamine lactate carboplatin . II . Determine safety profile regimen patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive carboplatin IV 15-30 minute day 1 squalamine lactate IV continuously day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow approximately 1 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 45 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
