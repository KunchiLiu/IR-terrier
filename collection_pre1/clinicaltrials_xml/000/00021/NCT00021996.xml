	<brief_title>Valdecoxib Treating Chronic Pain Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I. Assess analgesic efficacy valdecoxib administer addition opioid medication patient chronic pain due cancer prior cancer therapy . II . Assess safety drug patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study . Patients stratify accord baseline average pain intensity score ( 2-4 v 5-11 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Patients undergo pretreatment period 3-14 day determine daily dose sustain release immediate release opioid medication require adequately control pain tolerable side effect . Arm I : Patients receive oral valdecoxib twice daily addition opioid medication . Arm II : Patients receive oral placebo twice daily addition opioid medication . Treatment continue maximum 12 week absence inadequate pain control unacceptable toxicity . Patients record daily pain assessment total daily opioid consumption . Patients also contact telephone weekly assessment pain , opioid use , adverse effect . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A maximum 260 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
