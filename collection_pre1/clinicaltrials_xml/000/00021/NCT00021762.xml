	<brief_summary>The purpose study see whether HIV vaccination help body control amount HIV virus blood ( viral load ) patient take anti-HIV medicine . Doctors sure body fail control HIV viral load people infect HIV . The vaccine Remune show boost part body 's immune response HIV patient whose viral load lower anti-HIV drug . This study test ability Remune improve body 's immune response lower HIV viral load patient stop take anti-HIV drug short period time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Immunization With HIV-1 Immunogen Plus Anti-HIV Treatment Interruption Levels HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators pathogenesis HIV infection agree one critical question HIV disease immune response control HIV replication vast majority infect individual . More specifically , absence large lymphocyte proliferation response ( LPR ) HIV antigens individual , presence long-term nonprogressors ( LTNPs ) low viral load , require investigation whether causal relationship exist LPR HIV control HIV replication . Immunization Remune show induce large LPR HIV antigen administer patient HIV replication suppress antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) . A5120 evaluate ability immunization HIV-1 Immunogen STIs enhance immune response may control HIV replication absence antiretroviral drug . Patients remain treatment arm ( vaccine versus adjuvant placebo ) randomize entry protocol A5057 , participant investigator remain blind assignment . Patients may receive 3 injection vaccine/adjuvant control 1 follow 2 group . Arm A : HIV-1 immunogen study entry Week 9 Step 3 Step 5 . Arm B : HIV-1 immunogen placebo study entry Week 9 Step 3 Step 5 . ART required Steps 1 , 3 , 5 , 8 provide study . The study organize follow series step . Step 1 ( ART injection ) : receive injection vaccine/adjuvant control . Patients remain ART 6 8 week . Step 2 ( first STI ) : ART stop 8 week careful monitoring viral load CD4 T cell . Patients whose viral load control may remain Step 2 additional 6 week . Step 3 ( resumption ART ) : restart ART 14 week . Eligible patient receive immunization vaccine/adjuvant control Week 9 . Step 4 ( second STI ) : identical Step 2 . Step 5 ( resumption ART ) : identical Step 3 . Step 6 ( analytical treatment interruption [ ATI ] ) : analytical `` read-out '' discontinuation ART 14 week . Step 7 ( long-term follow-up without ART ) : open patient control viral load agree participate continue treatment withdrawal . Step 8 ( final resumption ART ) : patient follow 8 week ART document effect restart ART suppression viral load . Patients advance step criterion HIV RNA level , CD4 count , treatment meet . Patients regular clinic visit medical/medication history , physical examination , laboratory test viral load immunological parameter .</detailed_description>
