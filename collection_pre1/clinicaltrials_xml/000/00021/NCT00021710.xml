	<brief_summary>This study try elucidate learning process associate motor train weak arm stroke patient compare healthy control . Results previous clinical trial indicate training may enhance motor function healthy volunteer , perhaps also stroke patient , even 1 year stroke . Normal , healthy volunteer stroke patient 18 year age old may eligible study . Study subject physical examination participate 6 additional clinic visits-training test session study day 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 5 , final testing session day 12 . During session , perform series motor task , include writing , pick object , turn card , stack checker move can , time videotaped . Each session divide block 10 trial task , separate 2-minute rest period . Before training day 1 , 2 , 5 12 , subject transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) determine brain change associate learn motor task . For procedure , patient seat comfortable chair , insulated wire coil place scalp skin . A brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . These pulse generate small electrical current brain cortex , briefly disrupt function brain cell stimulate area . The stimulation may cause muscle twitch tingle scalp , face , limb . During stimulation , subject may ask slightly tense certain muscle perform simple action . Electrical nerve stimulation electromyography do record muscle response stimulation . A nerve stimulate place wire skin nerve passing brief electrical current wire . Electromyography involve tap metal electrode skin muscle . Before session , subject ' muscle strength test pinch gauge . They also ask make mark line draw paper , rate test performance level attentiveness fatigue .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol characterize dynamic motor learn 5-day period chronic stroke patient relative healthy age-matched control . Motor learn assessed improvement Jebsen-Taylor test , validate tool widely use rehabilitation measure upper extremity function . Additionally , intend evaluate change excitability primary motor cortex associate learn use transcranial magnetic stimulation .</detailed_description>
