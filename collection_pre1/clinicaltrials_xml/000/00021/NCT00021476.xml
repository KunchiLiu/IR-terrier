No previous study seek intervene first three month MVA behavioral physical exercise program encourage activity discourage continue fear movement , pain disability . This study consist two primary component : ( 1 ) To compare effectiveness two anxiety-reduction treatment standard care reduce pain activity limitation patient WADs 2 3 month follow MVAs . ( 2 ) To test whether psychological response initial trauma , fear avoidance , fear injury , negative affectivity , discriminate symptomatic WAD patient WAD sufferer whose symptom resolve 2 3 month post-MVA .</detailed_description>
