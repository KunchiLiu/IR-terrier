	<brief_title>ZD0473 Treating Patients With Progressive Relapsed Non-Small Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine anti-tumor effect ZD0473 patient progressive relapse non-small cell lung cancer fail first-line platinum-based chemotherapy . II . Assess safety tolerability drug patient . III . Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . IV . Determine efficacy drug , term time death , time disease progression , disease control , duration response , patient . V. Assess therapy outcome index , term disease-related symptom relief , patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord time relapse progression completion first-line platinum-based chemotherapy ( 12 week less vs 12 week ) . Patients receive ZD0473 IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline , begin course , every 6 week 1 year completion study . Patients follow 30 day study completion every 6 week 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 32-73 patient ( 23-56 per stratum 1 9-17 per stratum 2 ) accrue study within approximately 9 month .</detailed_description>
