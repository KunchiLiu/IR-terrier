	<brief_summary>The purpose study show dose T-20 add anti-HIV combination ( choose specifically patient ) lower viral load least certain level 24 week compare anti-HIV combination ( choose specifically patient ) alone . Another purpose show patient response T-20 maintain 48 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>T-20 HIV Patients With Prior Drug Treatment and/or Resistance Each Three Classes Anti-HIV Drugs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An OB regimen select initiated baseline physician patient . The OB regimen base patient 's prior treatment history well result first screen visit HIV-1 genotypic phenotypic ( GT PT ) resistance test prior GT/PT antiretroviral resistance testing ( available ) . Prior current laboratory abnormality , include triglyceride cholesterol , also take account select OB regimen . Patients stratified respect follow : 1 ) screen viral load ( less 40,000 40,000 copies/ml ) ; 2 ) number allow investigational antiretrovirals ( 0 , 1 , 2 ) . Patients randomize receive 1 follow treatment 48 week : OB regimen OB plus T-20 regimen . Patients see evaluation efficacy safety Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 , every 4 week Week 24 , every 8 week Week 48 . In addition , efficacy evaluate Weeks 6 , 10 , 14 . Patients also may see additional visit study plasma HIV-1 RNA measurement potentially confirm virological failure . Patients initially randomize OB arm meet criterion virological failure switch OB plus T-20 Week 8 follow new ( `` switch '' ) schedule assessment . Patients encourage change OB regimen time switch . Patients initially randomize OB plus T-20 arm meet criterion virological failure may continue receive OB plus T-20 patient physician feel sufficient benefit . Patients encourage change OB regimen Week 8 choose continue OB plus T-20 despite meet criterion virological failure . Patients OB OB plus T-20 arm meet criterion virological failure wish either switch T-20 ( patient initially randomize OB arm ) continue T-20 ( patient initially randomize OB plus T-20 ) allow remain study maximum 1 month . At end 48 week treatment , patient allow participate 1 follow treatment extension : ) roll-over receive OB plus T-20 ( patient receive OB alone ) ; b ) continue take OB plus T-20 ( patient already receive OB plus T-20 ) , maximum additional 48 week ( plus 4 week safety follow-up period ) , 12 week commercial availability T-20 country treat , whichever come first . All patient follow maximum 100 week initial baseline visit date .</detailed_description>
