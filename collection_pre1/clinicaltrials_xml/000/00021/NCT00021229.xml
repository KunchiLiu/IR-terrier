	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) imatinib mesylate completion radiation child newly diagnose poor prognosis brainstem glioma . ( Phase I , stratum I close accrual 5/28/04 . ) II . Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) imatinib mesylate child recurrent high-grade intracranial glioma stratify accord use enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant drug ( EIACDs ) . ( Phase I , strata IIA IIB close accrual 8/15/03 8/15/04 , respectively ) III . Determine safety efficacy drug patient newly diagnose diffuse intrinsic brainstem glioma . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Explore neuroimaging biological correlative therapeutic activity regimen patient . ( Phase I , stratum close accrual 8/15/04 ) II . Determine pharmacokinetics regimens patient overall enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant drug ( EIACDs ) ( Phase I , stratum close accrual 8/15/04 . ) III . Estimate progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) newly diagnose diffuse intrinsic brainstem glioma treat drug . ( Phase I II ) OUTLINE : This phase I dose-escalation , multicenter study follow phase II . Patients stratify accord tumor type ( newly diagnose intrinsic brainstem glioma v recurrent/refractory intracranial high-grade glioma ) . Patients stratum II ( phase I ) stratify accord concurrent use enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant drug ( EIACDs ) ( yes v ) . Patients assign one three stratum phase I study . - Phase I - Stratum I ( newly diagnose brainstem glioma ) : Patients undergo radiotherapy daily five day week 6 week . Beginning 1-3 week completion radiotherapy , patient without evidence intratumoral bleed receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily . Imatinib mesylate treatment repeat every 4 week 13 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ( Closed accrual 5/28/04 . ) - Stratum II A ( recurrent refractory high-grade intracranial gliomas/no concurrent EIACDs ) : Patients receive imatinib mesylate stratum I . ( Closed accrual 8/15/03 . ) - Stratum II B ( recurrent refractory high-grade intracranial glioma concurrent EIACDs ) : Patients receive imatinib mesylate stratum I . ( Closed accrual 8/15/04 . ) Cohorts 2-3 patient receive escalate dos imatinib mesylate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose estimate 20 % patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . MTDs independently estimate stratum . For stratum I , newly diagnose brain stem glioma , dose level least 5 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity dose use efficacy safety phase ( phase II ) . - Phase II : ( Open accrual 5/28/04 . ) - Stratum I : Patients undergo radiotherapy phase I . Patients receive imatinib mesylate MTD establish phase I . Patients enrol phase I portion treat MTD follow short 1 ) three month last protocol base treatment 2 ) date therapy initiate . Stratum I patient treat MTD phase I portion patient phase II portion study follow death withdrawal study PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 140 patient accrue study within 2 year .</detailed_description>
