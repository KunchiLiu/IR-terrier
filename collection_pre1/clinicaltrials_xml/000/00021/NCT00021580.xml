	<brief_summary>The experience Edmonton Group islet transplantation use `` Edmonton Protocol '' provide much promise T1DM patient . However , need use 2 donor pancreas achieve freedom insulin shot limit widespread use protocol . Two class oral antidiabetic drug improve insulin action reduce amount insulin need normal blood sugar . The first part propose project ( Group 1 ) use drug conjunction Edmonton Protocol allow successful islet transplantation islet isolate single pancreas . The Edmonton Protocol treatment , cure . It require long-term use powerful immunosuppressive drug expensive increase risk infection cancer . T1DM patient function kidney transplant already use immunosuppressive drug , still risk recurrent diabetic kidney disease complication diabetes . Islet transplantation patient rarely successful past part usual immunosuppressive drug use kidney transplantation cause diabetes actually harm transplant kidney way . The immunosuppressive drug use Edmonton Protocol less likely cause diabetes also less harmful kidney . In second part project ( Group 2 ) , transplant islet kidney transplant patient switch immunosuppressive medication use Edmonton Protocol . Even patient get islet transplant still need insulin shot islet transplantation , expect see improvement kidney function blood glucose control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Modification `` Edmonton Protocol '' Allow Successful Islet Transplantation From Single Pancreas Extension `` Edmonton Protocol '' Kidney Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We anticipate successful islet transplantation establish group islet cell transplant patient normal blood sugar need insulin injection . Some group receive kidney transplant well . All patient study great detail along investigator islet cell program understand good mechanism efficacy side effect islet transplant new immunosuppressive drug .</detailed_description>
