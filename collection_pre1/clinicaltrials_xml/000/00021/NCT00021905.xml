	<brief_title>Atrial Fibrillation Incidence , Risk Factors Genetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Prevention treatment atrial fibrillation ( AF ) significant public health issue . Atrial fibrillation affect 9 percent person age 80 89 . It associate elevate risk stroke death . The condition likely increase survival rate myocardial infarction continue improve , prevalence congestive heart failure grow , treatment approach evolve . The study assess safety commonly use medication relation risk incident atrial fibrillation , assess association several genetic polymorphism stroke risk AF onset . Several line evidence suggest beta-blockers ACE inhibitor may prevent inhibit atrial electrical remodeling allow AF become establish maintained . Withdrawal medication may associate increase risk AF individual risk . Genetic polymorphism promote thrombosis associate increase risk venous thrombosis , study , arterial thrombosis include stroke myocardial infarction . Although several recently publish trial indicate warfarin aspirin treatment patient AF decrease risk stroke , little know risk stroke complication AF relation genetic variant affect clot . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The main task case-control study : 1 ) identification case incident AF control ; 2 ) review outpatient inpatient medical record assess eligibility collect information risk factor medical history ; 3 ) classification medication use time ; 4 ) AF patient , telephone interview collection blood sample ; 5 ) blood specimen processing , DNA extraction , genotyping ; 6 ) data analysis association medication use genotype AF onset stroke complication .</detailed_description>
