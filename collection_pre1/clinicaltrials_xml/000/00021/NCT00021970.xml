	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Supplemental vitamin E associate reduce risk recurrent myocardial infarction , efficacy related dosage duration treatment . Its effect may enhance vitamin C , antioxidant regenerate vitamin E activity . Theoretically vitamin E C ( VitE/C ) accumulate vascular wall concurrent reduction oxidative damage , primary feature atherosclerotic lesion . Estrogen/hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) also may reduce oxidative damage , may enhance effect vitamin E C. These hypothesis support study define oxidation-dependent accumulation lipid develop atherosclerosis ; detection oxidative damage product , oxidized-LDL particle , human atherosclerotic lesion ; clinical study associate antioxidant estrogen supplementation reduction oxidative damage cardiovascular disease . Nevertheless , human study evaluate effect long-term VitE/C treatment , report effective prevention factor epidemiologic study , specific . biochemical marker oxidative damage concurrently association recurrent cardiovascular disease . In addition , study characterize effect long-term HRT marker oxidative damage HRT 's potential synergistic effect VitE/C therapy . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study assay specific biochemical measure oxidative damage ( marker closeout nitrotyrosine chlorotyrosine also baseline ) Women 's Angiographic Vitamin Estrogen ( WAVE ) Trial , randomize 420 38-86 year old woman prior cardiovascular disease event placebo , Vitamin E/C , hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) combination VitE/C HRT . WAVE determine efficacy treatment quantitative angiographic evaluation minimal coronary artery diameter perform baseline final visit complete first 10 month 2001 . The ancillary study measure oxidation product several class compound ( lipids F2-isoprostanes , protein nitrotyrosine chlorotyrosine , DNA 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine ) , thereby study several major pathway may lead atherogenesis . In addition , inflammation C-reactive protein , platelet activation p-selectin , alter lipid metabolism lipid profile characteristic study population integrate assessment oxidative damage WAVE . By measure various factor assess oxidative damage several class compound , author test relationship among specific pathway oxidative damage , supplemental VitE/C and/or HRT risk factor upon progression establish macrovascular disease .</detailed_description>
