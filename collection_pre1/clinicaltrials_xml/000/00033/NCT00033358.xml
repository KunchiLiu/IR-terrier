	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . The primary objective evaluate effect progesterone therapy versus combination estrogen progesterone therapy potential surrogate endpoint biomarkers ( SEBs ) relevant endometrial carcinogenesis . II . To evaluate change histology ultrasound appearance endometrium woman HNPCC 3 month progesterone therapy versus combination estrogen progesterone therapy compare baseline . III . To establish point estimate baseline frequency endometrial abnormality look histological molecular marker cohort female carry HNPCC gene mutation . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . All patient undergo baseline transvaginal ultrasound endometrial biopsy . Arm I : Patients receive medroxyprogesterone intramuscularly day 1 . Approximately 90 day injection , patient undergo repeat transvaginal ultrasound endometrial biopsy . Arm II : Patients receive oral contraceptive pill ( OCP ) comprise ethinyl estradiol norgestrel daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 3-4 course ( 3-4 pack OCP ) absence unacceptable toxicity . Approximately 1 week start fourth pack OCP , patient undergo repeat transvaginal ultrasound endometrial biopsy . Patients follow 6 week encourage return 6 month participate continue endometrial screening .</detailed_description>
