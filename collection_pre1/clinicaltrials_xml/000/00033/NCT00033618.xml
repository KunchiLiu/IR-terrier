	<brief_title>Ixabepilone Treating Patients With Metastatic Recurrent Squamous Cell Cancer Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate toxicity BMS-247550 give two dose schedule taxane-na√Øve taxane-exposed patient . II . To provide information response rate toxicity BMS-247550 give two dose schedule . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To measure survive expression correlate therapeutic responsiveness BMS-247550 . II . To determine change tumor vascular density endothelial cell apoptosis response therapy correlation change outcome . OUTLINE : This randomize study . Patients stratify accord prior taxane therapy ( yes v ) ECOG performance status ( 0 vs 1 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive ixabepilone IV 1 hour day 1-5 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Arm II : Patients receive ixabepilone IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . In arm , patient achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 2 additional course past CR minimum 6 course administer . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
