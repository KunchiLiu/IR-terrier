	<brief_summary>This study investigate area brain primarily involve responsible tic patient Tourette 's syndrome chronic motor disorder . Tourette 's syndrome neuropsychiatric disorder characterize motor vocal tic associated behavioral emotional disturbance , include symptom attention deficit hyperactivity disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder . Chronic motor disorder characteristic Tourette 's syndrome , except patient vocal tic . Healthy normal volunteer patient Tourette 's syndrome chronic motor tic disorder 18 65 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical neurological examination . Participants undergo positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan study tic three conditions- spontaneous tic , suppression tic , sleep-to determine area brain responsible generation tic . For procedure , subject inject H215O , radioactive substance similar water . A special camera detect radiation emit H215O , allow measurement brain blood flow . Subjects receive 20 injection H215O scan . Participants ask sleep entire night test . Before scan , patient volunteer EEG electrode place head record electrical activity brain . Patients also EMG electrode place area body tic occur . A small catheter ( plastic tube ) place arm vein inject radioactive tracer , mask place face help keep head still scan . The mask large opening eye , nose mouth , interfere talk breathe . The entire test take 4 hour . During time , subject sleep 1.5 hour either begin end scan . For 2.5 hour , scan do every 10 minute 1 minute different condition tic suppression release tic . On separate day , participant also undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , diagnostic test use magnetic field radio wave produce image brain . For procedure , subject lie still stretcher move scanner ( narrow cylinder contain magnet ) . ...</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Tics Patients With Tourette 's Syndrome Chronic Motor Tic Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine area brain responsible tic patient Tourette 's syndrome chronic motor tic disorder use [ 15O ] H2O . Previous neuroimaging study look brain activity tic use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , positron emission tomography ( PET ) , major drawback study lay difficulty distinguish activity brain responsible tic generation versus activity motor-related structure due tic movement . We plan overcome difficulty paradigm use two rest condition without movement . One state patient suppress tic second sleep state , tic usually cease least infrequent . 23 adult patient DSM-IV-TR ( American Psychiatric Association 2000 ) diagnosis tic disorder frequent tic study . These two rest state compare condition tic allow occur spontaneously . The differential activation brain area three condition help elucidate/define region brain responsible generation tic .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Patients clinically document Tourette 's syndrome chronic motor tic disorder define DSMIVTR evaluation tic severity use Yale Tic Scale . This criterion establish preliminary screening NINDS Movement Disorders Outpatient Clinic . Regarding comorbid disorder ADHD OCD , accept mild degree ADHD mild moderate degree OCD . These disorder establish psychiatrist use list scale criterion . In order participate study , patient ask stop medication influence central nervous system 2 week prior exam . Patients take fluoxetine ask stop 4 week prior exam . Stopping medication Tourette syndrome tic , OCD ADHD may lead worsen symptom . Any change patient ' medication must first discussed doctor doctor responsible taper medication . Patients ask abstain alcohol one week study . Patients age range 18 65 . Patients may male female . Female patient childbearing potential pregnancy test specific interview prior study ensure pregnant patient participate study . Patients ask stop medication influence central nervous system ( CNS ) one week prior exam . Twenty three normal control include ; control screen NINDS Movement Disorders Outpatient Clinic , neurological physical examination . Controls chronic illness , take medication affect CNS exclude . EXCLUSION CRITERIA Patients young 18 old 65 year old exclude study . We exclude patient old 65 year possibility agerelated neurological disorder stroke dementia . Patients MRI finding consistent brain tumor , stroke , trauma AVMs exclude . Patients progressive neurological disorder TS chronic motor tic disorder significant pathology exclude . Patients history significant medical disorder , require chronic treatment drug , stop , exclude . Patients cancer exclude . Patients capable give informed consent exclude . Patients pregnant exclude .</criteria>
