	<brief_title>Celecoxib With Without Eflornithine Preventing Colorectal Cancer Patients With Familial Adenomatous Polyposis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine relative efficacy celecoxib plus eflornithine ( DFMO ) versus celecoxib plus DFMO placebo participant familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) , evidence percent change baseline number polyps focal area ( ) colorectum participant 5 &gt; = 2mm colorectal polyp without duodenal polyp baseline . II . To determine relative tolerability safety celecoxib + DFMO FAP study participant . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine percent change polyp size focal area ( ) colorectum II . To determine change global colorectal polyp burden III . To determine percent change area plaque-like duodenal polyp participant present duodenal disease baseline . IV . To analyze effect agent follow panel mucosal biomarkers : antigen identify monoclonal antibody Ki-67 ( Ki-67 ) , mitotic index ( number spatial distribution mitoses ) , phosphorylated histone H3 , cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A ( p21/WAF1/Cip1 ) , apoptosis ( Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end label [ TUNEL ] ) , apoptotic index , BCL2-associated X protein ( Bax ) , B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 ( Bcl-2 ) measurement drug effect colonic polyp normal tissue cyclooxygenase ( cyclooxygenase-1 [ COX-1 ] , cyclooxygenase-2 [ COX-2 ] ) protein level , prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) , ornithine decarboxylase polyamines . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients receive celecoxib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) placebo PO daily . ARM II : Patients receive celecoxib PO BID eflornithine PO daily . In arm , treatment continue 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion treatment , patient follow 1-2 month .</detailed_description>
