	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Lometrexol may stop slow growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary tumor cell growth . Folic acid may effective prevent lessen side effect lometrexol . Combining lometrexol folic acid may effective treatment non-small cell lung cancer . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combine lometrexol folic acid treat patient stage IIIB stage IV non-small cell lung cancer previously treat .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lometrexol Plus Folic Acid Treating Patients With Stage IIIB Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine overall response rate patient previously treat stage IIIB IV non-small cell lung cancer treat lometrexol folic acid . - Determine complete response rate , duration response , time progression patient treat regimen . - Determine 1-year survival rate overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine safety profile regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral folic acid daily day -7 6 . Patients also receive lometrexol IV 30-60 second day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 2 month removal study every 3 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 50-100 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
