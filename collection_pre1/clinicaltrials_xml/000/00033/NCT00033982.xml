	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety effectiveness posaconazole treat invasive fungal infection . New therapy infection need patient respond , tolerate , standard treatment . These patient include immune defect significant side effect treatment amphotericin antifungal . Patients 13 year age old primary NIH protocol invasive fungal infection 1 ) respond standard antifungal therapy ; 2 ) effective therapy ; 3 ) develop serious side effect current treatment ; 4 ) organ dysfunction permit use standard antifungal treatment may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , include review current previous antifungal treatment , pregnancy test woman childbearing potential , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , detailed neurologic examination . Participants take either 200 mg ( 1 teaspoonful ) liquid posaconazole mouth four time day 400 mg ( two teaspoonful ) twice day period 28 day 24 month . ( The physician determine duration treatment . ) Patients monthly follow-up visit treatment period 1 month treatment complete following procedure : - Detailed neurologic exam every 3 month - Blood test every month - EKG every month - Imaging study , include chest x-ray , compute tomography ( CT ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) radionuclide scan ultrasound , every month infection stable three determination . Thereafter , image study do every 3 month long infection remain stable improves . On last day study treatment period , participant detail neurologic exam review medication medical complaint since last visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We seek use experimental triazole antifungal , Posaconazole , treatment patient invasive fungal infection resistant refractory best available treatment , unable tolerate best available treatment . We observe significant short long term toxicity amphotericin various preparation patient chronic granulomatous disease ( CGD ) Hyper IgE recurrent infection syndrome ( HIE Job 's ) . We 5 CGD patient dialysis , several progressive renal failure , think due high dose , prolong amphotericin . In addition , many severely affected CGD patient multiple thoracic surgery , lead reduce lung capacity . Several HIE patient persistent fungal lung infection clear extensive therapy amphotericin and/or new triazole antifungal . Therefore , agent high tolerability high potency still desperately need . Posaconazole broad spectrum action large number mold fungi easily achievable concentration plasma . It favorable toxicity profile perform well clinical trial date . This drug administer orally twice daily . Close monitoring tolerance , toxicity , efficacy perform . We anticipate enrollment 50 patient next 2 year .</detailed_description>
