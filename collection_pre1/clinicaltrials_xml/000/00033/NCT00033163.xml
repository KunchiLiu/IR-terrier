	<brief_summary>Control hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection difficult HIV infect people take antiviral lamivudine ( 3TC ) . These people may HBV become resistant 3TC . Adefovir dipivoxil ( ADV ) show promising anti-HBV activity clinical trial ; tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) use treat HIV may also effective HBV . The purpose study find add ADV TDF highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) regimen include 3TC effect HBV infection patient coinfected HIV HBV . The tolerability safety drug examine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HBV present worldwide health crisis difficult treat patient 's HBV strain longer responsive 3TC . Given significant incidence 3TC-resistant HBV patient receive drug part antiretroviral regimen , agent anti-HBV activity need . ADV show promising anti-HBV activity preclinical assessment Phase I , II , III clinical trial . TDF , develop treatment HIV infection , vitro activity HBV . This study compare TDF/3TC combination therapy ADV/3TC combination therapy determine treatment regimen effective patient coinfected HBV HIV . This study include two population patient . Patients Population A stable HAART include TDF either Group I ( compensate liver disease ) Group II ( decompensated liver disease ) . All patient Population A randomly assign one two arm : Arm 1 patient receive 10 mg ADV daily TDF placebo ; Arm 2 patient receive ADV placebo 300 mg TDF . Patients Population B stable HAART never take TDF part HAART . Population B patient receive 300 mg TDF daily course study . Study visit occur every 4 week 96-week study period . Targeted clinical medication assessment blood work assess clotting time , liver function , blood chemistry conduct study visit . HIV HBV DNA viral load test every 12 week . CD4 cell count test Weeks 24 , 48 , 72 , 96 .</detailed_description>
