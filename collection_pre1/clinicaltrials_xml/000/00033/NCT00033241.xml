	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Erlotinib may interfere growth tumor cell slow growth tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining erlotinib gemcitabine may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase I trial study effectiveness combine erlotinib gemcitabine treat patient newly diagnose locally advanced metastatic pancreatic cancer solid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib Combined With Gemcitabine Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Locally Advanced Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Other Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine maximum tolerate dose erlotinib combination gemcitabine patient recently diagnose , gemcitabine-naive , locally advanced metastatic pancreatic carcinoma potentially responsive solid tumor . - Determine safety tolerability regimen patient . - Determine pharmacokinetics regimen patient . - Determine objective antitumor response rate response duration patient treat regimen . - Determine time disease progression duration overall survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study erlotinib . Patients receive gemcitabine IV 30 minute day 1 week 1-7 oral erlotinib daily begin day 3 week 1 continue 8 week ( course 1 ) . Patients receive subsequent course therapy comprise gemcitabine weekly 3 week erlotinib daily . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos erlotinib maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Once MTD determine , 12 additional patient accrue treated MTD . Patients follow 30 day . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A maximum 30 patient accrue study within 3 month .</detailed_description>
