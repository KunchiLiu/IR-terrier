	<brief_summary>This study try learn complex regional pain syndrome , CRPS ( previously know reflex sympathetic dystrophy , spread neuralgia , sympathalgia ) , examine release small protein blood patient condition . Patients CRPS usually three type symptom : - Sensory abnormality increase sensitivity pain painful reaction harmless stimulus - Perfusion abnormality alteration blood flow , temperature abnormality , swell , decrease increase nail growth , hair skin change - Motor abnormality weakness , guard ( Holding limb fashion minimize accidental intentional contact possible source pain ) , atrophy ( waste ) The cause CRPS unknown , definitive diagnostic test condition . Because early treatment improve prognosis CRPS , test enables early diagnosis would important optimal medical management . The finding study may contribute development test possibly new drug treatment . Normal healthy volunteer patient age complex regional pain syndrome otherwise good general health may eligible study . Participants medical history , physical examination collection blood sample . They fill several questionnaire , provide information health , personality , mood , pain level , symptom . Participation study require one outpatient clinic visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Proteins Associated With Complex Regional Pain Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The etiology Complex Regional Pain Syndrome ( CRPS ) unknown patient typically present triad clinical finding : sensory abnormality , perfusion abnormality alteration motor function . Since finding see disease state , diagnosis often clear . A response sympathetic ganglion block ( stellate lumbar ) also suggestive disorder . However , definitive diagnostic test CRPS . Experience show early aggressive treatment improve prognosis . Therefore , test facilitate early diagnosis would important clinical implication . Advances laboratory technique allow analysis clinical sample identify protein pattern protein change associate disease state . Patients suffer CRPS currently see pain clinic ask participate study . The subject complete brief symptom survey , examine co-investigator document sensory , temperature trophic change , blood sample collect protein gene expression ( RNA ) analysis . Blood sample age-matched control collect non-CRPS patient . Fifty patient sample collect group analyze use teach diagnostic software additional 20 sample ( 10 control , 10 CRPS patient ) use validate diagnostic accuracy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Male female patient refer physician diagnosis CRPS criterion outline StantonHicks et al . OR Healthy volunteer screen accord eligibility criterion specify appendix ( see Healthy Subject Eligibility ) . Age restriction : Patients volunteer must ( Bullet ) 18 year age time enrollment . There upper limit age inclusion . Good general health ( disease state could may confound result see exclusion criterion ) Willing blood drawn Willing behavioral measure Willing provide direct medical history There expect great number female male recruit study since much high occurrence CRPS woman . Additionally , expect equal across ethnic group . However , anticipate require special recruiting strategy specific gender ethnic group . EXCLUSION CRITERIA Contraindication blood screen Advanced disease CRPS ( cardiovascular , liver , kidney disease ASA III exclude CRPS ) may cause theoretical inclusion sample result confound result . Pregnant lactating woman . No exclusion make base race , gender , religion .</criteria>
