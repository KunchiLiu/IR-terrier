	<brief_summary>This study examine whether infliximab ( Remicade ) safe effective treatment dermatomyositis polymyositis . Infliximab block effect protein call tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) , associate harmful inflammation many disease . Patients 18 year age older active dermatomyositis polymyositis respond adequately treatment methotrexate corticosteroid may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test , chest x-ray , pulmonary function test , skin test tuberculosis , HIV test , electromyography ( describe ) , manual muscle testing , functional assessment . Magnetic resonance imaging ( describe ) do assess degree location inflammation involve limb . An electrocardiogram echocardiogram do recent one available . Patients qualify study ask undergo two muscle biopsy ( surgical removal analysis small piece muscle tissue ) , one initiation treatment another 16th week . Participants randomly assign receive either 3 mg/kg body weight infliximab placebo ( inactive substance ) infusion vein 2 hour . The infusion give begin treatment period ( week 0 ) week 2 , 6 14 . At week 16 , strength assess manual muscle test . Patients improved treatment continue infusion dose week 18 , 22 , 30 , 38 . Those improve assigned random allocation receive either 5 mg/kg body weight 10/mg/kg body weight infliximab week 18 , 22 , 30 38 . Those improve previously placebo infusion receive extra dose either 5 mg/kg 10 mg/kg body weight infliximab week 16 , patient previously 3 mg/kg body weight infliximab fail meet improvement criterion receive infusion contain medication week 16 . Patients admit hospital infusion week 0 , 14 38 ; rest give outpatient basis . After 38th week , infusion stop patient assess 40th week . Participants undergo follow test evaluation treatment : - Blood test every week look antibody see muscle inflammation . Some blood sample store later test , include genetic study find genetic difference relate inflammation . - Skin test tuberculosis - Chest x-rays beginning study ( recent one available ) week 16 40 look active infection , detect sign past exposure infection diseases tuberculosis , assess presence lung disease might relate myositis . - MRI ( usually legs ) begin study week 16 40 measure disease activity extent muscle involvement . This also give idea response treatment . This test use magnetic field radio wave produce image body tissue . During procedure patient lie bed surrounded metal cylinder ( scanner ) . - Muscle biopsy begin study diagnose muscle inflammation week 16 evaluate response treatment . - Electromyography patient EMG previously . For test , small needle insert muscle assess electrical activity muscle - HIV test Patients whose disease worsen treatment develop serious drug-related side effect take study refer back primary care physician therapy . Patients improve refer back primary physician end study possible continued treatment . Participants ask return follow-up visit every 6 week total 30 week monitor long-term effect drug</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Infliximab ( Remicade ) Treat Dermatomyositis Polymyositis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) , cytokine implicate pathogenesis many disease include inflammatory disorder , find elevate muscle patient dermatomyositis ( DM ) polymyositis ( PM ) . A subset patient DM PM respond readily conventional therapy . Therefore , control trial use infliximab , chimeric IgG ( 1 ) kappa monoclonal antibody TNF , may provide therapeutic option advance understanding pathogenesis disease . This study design determine safety efficacy infliximab patient DM PM . We plan enroll maximum 28 patient randomize 1:1 ratio 2 group , placebo vs. infliximab 5 mg/kg body weight . In first phase study placebo infliximab infusion give week 0 , 2 , 6 14 . Primary outcome assessment do week 16 . Those respond accord criterion set improvement MMT give option remain infusion ( i.e . placebo infliximab 5 mg/kg body weight ) week 22 , 30 38 . Placebo non-responders give infliximab 5 mg/kg body weight open label fashion week 16 , 18 , 22 , 30 38 . Patients initially 5 mg/kg body weight infliximab fail respond base criterion set place infliximab 7.5 mg/kg body weight open label fashion week 22 , 30 38 . Pharmacokinetic model do phase study . A muscle biopsy do treatment 16 week treatment . Microarray gene expression profile muscle biopsy specimens do treatment 16 week . Clinical , functional serological evaluation perform every visit ass response treatment . Patients follow 30 week study termination evaluate long-term effect drug .</detailed_description>
