	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining one drug give surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . It yet know combination chemotherapy regimen effective treating resect stage I stage II breast cancer . PURPOSE : Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness different combination chemotherapy regimens treat woman resect stage I stage II breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Treating Women With Resected Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare disease-free overall survival woman completely resect stage I II breast cancer adjuvantly treat fluorouracil , epirubicin , cyclophosphamide ( FEC ) epirubicin follow cyclophosphamide , methotrexate , fluorouracil ( EPI-CMF ) versus FEC follow sequential docetaxel . - Compare acute toxicity regimens patient . - Compare quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord participate center , estrogen receptor status ( positive v negative ) , nodal status . Within 8 week definitive surgery , patient randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients assign 1 2 standard adjuvant chemotherapy regimen . - Regimen A : Patients receive fluorouracil , epirubicin , cyclophosphamide ( FEC ) IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 8 course . - Regimen B : Patients receive epirubicin IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 4 course . Patients receive cyclophosphamide orally day 1-14 IV day 1 8 methotrexate IV fluorouracil IV day 1 8 ( CMF ) . Treatment CMF repeat every 4 week 4 course . - Arm II : Patients receive 4 course adjuvant chemotherapy FEC arm I , regimen A . Patients receive sequential docetaxel IV 1 hour every 3 week 4 course . Beginning within 4 week completion adjuvant chemotherapy , patient concurrently enrol Standardization Breast Radiotherapy ( START ) trial receive localize radiotherapy daily , 5 day week , 3-5 week , accord local practice . Beginning within 4 week completion adjuvant chemotherapy , patient estrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor positive receive oral tamoxifen daily least 5 year . Quality life assess baseline , course 5 , 3-4 week course 8 , 9 , 12 , 18 , 24 month initiation adjuvant chemotherapy . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month thereafter . Peer Reviewed Funded Endorsed Cancer Research UK PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 3,340 patient ( 1,670 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 2 year .</detailed_description>
