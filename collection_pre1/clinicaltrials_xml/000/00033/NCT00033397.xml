	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Support accrual ACRIN-6657/CALGB-150012 magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) correlative science study . - Determine whether molecular marker , alone combination MRI , time diagnosis early course therapy , predict 3-year disease-free survival ( DFS ) woman locally advance breast cancer receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy . - Identify two group participant statistically different 3-year DFS , base 1 biomarkers , include MRI . - Determine whether biomarkers , combination MRI , early course chemotherapy , improve prediction 3-year DFS least good predictor DFS residual disease time surgery patient . - Determine whether molecular marker associate specific image pattern see MRI patient . - Predict response MRI result marker data cell cycle check point , proliferation , angiogenesis , hormone receptor , molecular profile patient . Secondary - Determine molecular predictor lack radiologic complete response ( CR ) HER-2/neu negative patient ( immunohistochemistry [ IHC ] score 0 , 1+ , 2 fluorescence situ hybridization [ FISH ] amplify ) neoadjuvant anthracycline-based regimen . - Determine molecular predictor lack radiologic CR HER-2/neu positive patient ( IHC 3+ FISH amplify &gt; 2.0 ) neoadjuvant anthracycline-based regime follow taxane alone regimen combination trastuzumab . - Determine molecular predictor complete magnetic resonance image radiologic response neoadjuvant anthracycline-based regimen gene expression profile perform sequential , real-time fashion . OUTLINE : This diagnostic , multicenter study conduct concurrently CALGB-150012/ACRIN-6657 image protocol concurrently neoadjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy . Patients receive injection gadopentetate dimeglumine undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) breast initiation , 1-3 day initiation , completion neoadjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy prior surgery . Patients previously receive taxane also undergo additional contrast-enhanced MRI scan . Patients undergo biopsy initiation time surgery . Patients also undergo blood draw time first biopsy prior surgery . Serum tissue sample use assess biomarkers genetic instability , cell cycle progression cellular proliferation predictor anthracycline responsiveness , marker apoptotic potential predictor taxane responsiveness vivo , angiogenesis , hormone receptor , molecular profile use immunohistochemical method . Mammograms possibly ultrasounds performed prior chemotherapy ( surgery ) . Patients follow every 6 month 5 year annually 10 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 384 patient accrue study within 3 year .</detailed_description>
