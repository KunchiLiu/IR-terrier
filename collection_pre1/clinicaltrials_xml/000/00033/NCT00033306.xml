	<brief_title>BMS-247550 Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine clinical activity BMS-247550 , measure tumor response rate , patient metastatic colorectal cancer previously treat fluoropyrimidine irinotecan . - Determine safety drug patient . - Determine response duration , time progression , survival patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive BMS-247550 IV 1 hour day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 18 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 4 additional course treatment beyond CR . Patients follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 19-55 patient accrue study within 6 month .</detailed_description>
