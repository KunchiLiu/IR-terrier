	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose gefitinib give together radiation therapy without cisplatin treat patient stage III stage IV head neck cancer . Biological therapy gefitinib may interfere growth tumor cell slow growth cancer . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining gefitinib radiation therapy cisplatin may kill tumor cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gefitinib Radiation Therapy With Without Cisplatin Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish safety profile daily oral administration ZD1839 ( `` Iressa '' , AstraZeneca , Inc. ) give concurrent irradiation alone combine concurrently weekly cisplatin previously untreated patient locally advanced HNSCC , AJCC clinical stage III-IVB , deem suitable surgery . Hence , maximum-tolerated dose ZD1839 determine . II . To delineate quantitate dose-dependent local systemic toxicity ZD1839 give concurrently irradiation combine concurrently weekly cisplatin patient locally advance , HNSCC , AJCC stage III-IVB , deem suitable surgery . III . To determine feasibility toxicity profile protract continuous daily dose ZD1839 begin 8 week completion head neck radiation therapy period exceed 2 year . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Secondary endpoint include determination response rate , relapse-free survival rate overall survival rate group patient . II . To perform correlative study assess biological effect ZD1839 within primary tumor . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study gefitinib . All patient receive oral gefitinib daily begin least 7 day continue throughout radiotherapy chemoradiotherapy absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients enter 1 5 level . Level I : Patients undergo concurrent boost radiotherapy 5 day per week comprise daily radiotherapy 3.5 week follow twice daily radiotherapy 2.5 week . Level II : Patients receive escalate dose gefitinib undergo radiotherapy level I . Level III : Patients receive original dose gefitinib , undergo standard fractionation radiotherapy comprise daily radiotherapy 5 day per week 7 week , receive cisplatin IV 30-60 minute begin week radiotherapy . Level IV : Patients receive escalate dose gefitinib level II undergo radiotherapy chemotherapy level III . Level V : Patients receive maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) gefitinib , radiotherapy 5 day week 6 week , chemotherapy level III . Patients clinical radiologic evidence residual disease require undergo neck dissection approximately 8 week completion radiotherapy chemoradiotherapy . Patients resume oral gefitinib daily begin 8 week completion radiotherapy chemoradiotherapy ( 12 week patient undergo neck dissection ) continue 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient enrol sequentially begin level I MTD gefitinib determine . The MTD dose precede least 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Twelve additional patient receive MTD gefitinib combination radiotherapy without cisplatin . Patients follow every 6 month least 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
