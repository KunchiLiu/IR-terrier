	<brief_summary>Serotonin chemical involve regulation emotion , anxiety , sleep , stress hormone , body function . The purpose study use procedure call tryptophan depletion study function serotonin people depression healthy volunteer . Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) associate reduced functioning central serotonergic system . Tryptophan depletion ( TD ) procedure use investigate relationship serotonergic function depression . Evidence suggest mood lower effect TD depend upon family history difference gene specific protein call 5-HTTLPR . Healthy female particular gene 5-HTTLPR family history mood disorder appear great risk development depressive symptom TD . This study use positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan brain investigate effect variant 5-HTTLPR genotype response TD . The relationship 5-HTTLPR genotype effect TD brain activity individual different 5-HTTLPR gene determine . This study also examine reduce serotonin function occur MDD affect brain 's response sensory stimulation . Participants study screen telephone psychiatric medical history , current emotional state , anxiety sleep pattern , family history psychiatric disorder . At study entry , participant interview , physical examination , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , blood laboratory test . Menstruating woman pregnancy test test determine menstrual phase time ovulation . At second clinic visit , participant undergo test intelligence cognitive ability magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan brain . Prior Visits 3 4 , participant collect saliva urine . Menstruating woman pregnancy test . At Visits 3 4 , participant undergo TD study PET scan . During one visit , participant take capsule amino acid . On day , take lactose capsule . Throughout study , participant ask emotional state , anxiety , ability concentrate , well .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) associate abnormally reduce function central serotonergic system various type evidence . One instructive paradigm investigate relationship serotonergic function depression involve mood response tryptophan depletion ( TD ) , achieve oral load essential amino acid except 5-HT precursor , tryptophan . We obtain preliminary evidence mood lower effect TD depend upon genotype functional polymorphism promoter region 5-HT transporter ( 5-HTT ) , designate 5-HTTLPR , well upon family history . In healthy female s-allele positive family history mood disorder appear additive risk factor development depressive symptom TD . The current study employ quantitative PET image cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) glucose metabolism investigate effect variant 5-HTTLPR genotype neurophysiological response TD . The current study examine relationship 5-HTTLPR genotype TD effect PFC metabolic activity . We determine whether TD reduction PFC metabolism response TD occur great extent subject s/s allele , subject single allele plus family history depression . We also examine whether reduction PFC metabolic activity unique subject develop depressive symptom TD . In addition , base upon evidence 5-HT inhibits neuronal activity amygdala , modulate transmission emotionally-salient sensory information sensory cortex amygdala , test hypothesis MDD , reduce serotonin function associate TD may disinhibit amygdala response sensory stimulation . This hypothesis explore assess physiological response amygdala sensory stimulus normally activate amygdala , namely picture human face show fearful sad emotional expression . We particularly interested determine whether amygdala CBF response emotional stimulus TD prominently increase subject carry s-allele 5-HTTLPR , whether unique subject develop depressive symptom TD . Twenty-four unmedicated-remitted subject MDD 24 healthy control study double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomize ( accord 5-HTTLPR genotype ) crossover study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA MDD Samples : 36 subject rMDD ( age 1860 ) select . Remission define period least three month subject take antidepressant agent , Hamilton Depression Rating Scales ( HDRS ; 21item ) score nondepressed range ( le 8 ) , one clinically significant depressive symptom . Additional 17 subject current MDD select GABA MRS study . INCLUSION CRITERIA Healthy Control Samples : Twentyfour healthy subject ( age 1860 ) without know personal family history psychiatric disorder firstdegree relative select . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects must take antidepressant medication likely alter monoamine neurochemistry cerebrovascular cardiovascular function least 3 month prior study . However , effective medication discontinue purpose study . Subjects also exclude : 1. form past current psychosis ; 2. medical neurological illness likely affect physiology anatomy , i.e . hypertension , cardiovascular disorder ; 3. history drug ( include benzodiazepine [ BZD ] ) alcohol abuse within 1 year lifetime history alcohol drug dependence ( DSM IV criterion ) long 2 year ; 4. current pregnancy ( documented pregnancy test screening day challenge study ) ; f ) current breast feeding ( tryptophan depletion ) ; g ) smoker ; h ) current suicidal ideation behavior ; ) general MRI exclusion criterion . Subjects must exhibit moderate alcohol use . Subjects current excessive use alcohol ( great 8 ounces/day men great 6 ounces/day woman ) ineligible participation . j ) current axis I diagnose beside unipolar major depressive disorder ; k ) lactose intolerance ( tryptophan depletion ) . Subjects beyond age 60 exclude . Subjects whose first major depressive episode arise temporally medical psychiatric condition also exclude .</criteria>
