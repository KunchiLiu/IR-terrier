	<brief_summary>Randomized phase III trial compare effectiveness radiation therapy without thalidomide treat patient brain metastasis . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Drugs thalidomide may stop growth brain metastasis stop blood flow tumor . It yet know whether radiation therapy effective without thalidomide treat brain metastasis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy With Without Thalidomide Treating Patients With Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare overall survival patient multiple brain metastasis treat radiotherapy without thalidomide . II . Compare time tumor progression patient treat regimen . III . Compare time neuro-cognitive progression patient treat regimen . IV . Compare cause death distribution patient treat regimen . V. Compare frequency toxic effect regimens patient . VI . Evaluate compare quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord recursive partitioning analysis class ( I vs II ) plan chemotherapy whole brain irradiation ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients undergo radiotherapy daily 5 day week 3 week . Arm II : Patients undergo radiotherapy arm I . Beginning first day radiotherapy , patient receive oral thalidomide daily . Treatment thalidomide continue 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline , completion radiotherapy , every 2 month 1 year . Patients follow every 2 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 332 patient ( 166 per treatment arm ) accrue study within 14.5 month .</detailed_description>
