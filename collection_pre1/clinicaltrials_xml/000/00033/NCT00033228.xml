	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine maximum tolerate dose intranodal Synchrovax SEM plasmid DNA vaccine patient stage IV melanoma . - Determine safety tolerability drug patient . - Determine immunological response , measure change frequency T cell specific vaccine-encoded epitope treatment , patient treat drug . - Determine clinical response , measure lactic dehydrogenase level radiologic assessment lesion , patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study . Patients receive Synchrovax SEM plasmid DNA vaccine continuous intranodal infusion day 1-4 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 4 course absence unacceptable toxicity . Patients evidence stable respond disease eligible 4 additional course treatment . Cohorts 6 patient receive escalate dos Synchrovax SEM plasmid DNA vaccine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede least 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Patients follow 10 day last dose study drug . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 6-18 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
