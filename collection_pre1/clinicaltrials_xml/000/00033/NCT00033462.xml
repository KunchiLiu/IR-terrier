	<brief_title>Erlotinib Treating Patients With Unresectable Liver , Bile Duct , Gallbladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate proportion patient unresectable hepatocellular biliary carcinoma treat OSI-774 progression-free 24 week . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate toxicity profile treatment patient group . II . To evaluate objective response rate patient hepatocellular biliary carcinoma treat OSI-774 . III . To evaluate overall progression-free survival . IV . To assess EGFR protein level explore association clinical outcome . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients assign 1 2 group accord cancer type ( hepatocellular v biliary ) . Patients receive oral erlotinib daily . Treatment repeat every 28 day least 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
