	<brief_summary>This study investigate genetic cause Birt Hogg-Dube ( BHD ) syndrome relationship disorder kidney cancer . BHD rare inherit condition characterize papule , bump benign tumor involve hair follicle head neck . People BHD increase risk develop kidney cancer . Scientists identify chromosome ( strand genetic material cell nucleus ) contain BHD gene region gene chromosome . This study try learn : - The characteristic type kidney tumor associate BHD - The risk kidney cancer people BHD - Whether one gene cause BHD - The genetic mutation ( change ) responsible BHD Patients know suspected Birt Hogg-Dube syndrome , family member , may eligible study . Candidates screen family history review medical record , include pathology report tumor , film compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . Participants may undergo various test procedure , include follow : - Physical examination - Review personal family history cancer doctor , cancer nurse , kidney surgeon , genetic counselor - Chest x-rays - Ultrasound ( image study use sound wave ) - MRI ( image study use radiowaves magnetic field ) - CT scan chest abdomen ( image study use radiation ) - Blood test blood chemistry genetic test - Skin evaluation , include skin biopsy ( surgical removal small skin tissue sample microscopic evaluation ) - Cheek swab mouthwash collect cell genetic analysis - Lung function study - Medical photography skin lesion These test do outpatient basis either one day 3 4 day . When study complete , participant receive counsel finding recommendation . Patients kidney lesion may ask return periodically , every 3 36 month , base individual condition , document rate progression lesion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background - BHD rare , autosomal dominantly inherit disorder confers susceptibility develop multifocal , bilateral renal cancer , spontaneous pneumothorax fibrofolliculomas . - BHD cause mutation BHD gene locate Chromosome17p11.2 . - Defining genetic biochemical pathway lead renal tumorigenesis BHD may lead development new molecularly target drug . Objectives - To define type characteristic ( include pattern growth ) renal cancer associate BHD . - To determine risk renal cancer , lung cyst fibrofollicullomas patient BHD . - To define natural history BHD relate renal tumor . - To determine gene contribute BHD . - Identify genotype / phenotype correlation . Eligibility - Patients histologically confirm fibrofolliculomas . - Patients clinical evidence multiple skin papule consistent fibrofolliculomas , family history spontaneous pneumothorax kidney cancer . - A relative patient confirm diagnosis BHD . - Patients know germline BHD mutation . Design - These rare family recruit genetically confirm diagnosis , determine size location renal tumor , size presentation , growth rate metastatic potential renal tumor . - Genetic testing offer gain appreciation effect mutation BHD gene assess relative activity various germline somatic mutation . - We determine relationship mutation disease phenotype .</detailed_description>
