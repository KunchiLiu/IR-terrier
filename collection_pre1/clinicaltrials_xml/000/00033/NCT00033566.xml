	<brief_title>S-3304 Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine maximum tolerate dose safety profile S-3304 patient advance solid tumor . - Determine pharmacokinetic profile drug patient . - Estimate start dose drug subsequent phase II efficacy study . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients receive oral S-3304 twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 6-8 patient receive escalate dos S-3304 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 3 8 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Patients follow 30 day . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 6-28 patient accrue study within 1 year .</detailed_description>
