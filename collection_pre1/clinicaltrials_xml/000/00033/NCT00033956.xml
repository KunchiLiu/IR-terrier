	<brief_summary>The clinical use IL-2 currently limit development dose-dependent hypotension ( systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) &lt; 90 mm Hg ) . The overall outcome constant across site 20-50 % patient require ICU management unresponsive hypotension hyporeactivity ( loss response vasoconstrictor ) . Because dose-limiting side effect , duration IL-2 dose frequently curtail . Thus , hemodynamic toxicity limit usefulness IL-2 therapy . M40403 prevent hypotension hyporeactivity associate IL-2 treatment preclinical study . This trial study safety efficacy M40403 prevention reduction hypotension patient receive IL-2 therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation M40403 Prevention Dose Limiting Toxicities High Dose IL-2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High-dose interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) therapy currently indicate treatment metastatic renal cell carcinoma metastatic malignant melanoma , associate 5-15 % long-term clinical response . In addition , IL-2 therapy show promise treatment acute myelogenous leukemia , non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , breast cancer , improve immunologic function patient AIDS . However , major dose-limiting toxicity IL-2 , hypotension , severely limit usefulness IL-2 therapy . Because unresponsive hypotension loss response exogenously administer vasopressor , 20-50 % patient receive high dose IL-2 therapy require ICU management . These dose-limiting side effect frequently necessitate curtail full period IL-2 dosing order reverse hypotension prevent subsequent renal dysfunction . Thus , hemodynamic toxicity limit usefulness IL-2 therapy . A course IL-2 therapy require long hospitalization intense patient monitoring administration . As consequence , despite favorable long-term response , sit offer treatment . The availability agent prevent IL-2-induced hypotension without adversely affect therapeutic mechanism IL-2 , would markedly facilitate IL-2 administration minimum , would maximize number patient could receive full regimen IL-2 . The reduction IL-2 toxicity may also enable high dos and/or frequent dose IL-2 use , potential high success tumor response . Because M40403 may decrease toxicity IL-2 , co-administration M40403 may make possible broaden clinical use IL-2 condition currently indicate . The indication study use prevention reduction hypotension associate interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) therapy patient metastatic melanoma renal cell carcinoma . The study divide sequential dose escalation phase follow expansion select dose double-blind , placebo-controlled , evaluation phase . Patients metastatic inoperable melanoma renal cell carcinoma receive high dose IL-2 per approve label two 5-day sequence . M40403 administer intravenous infusion 30 minute prior intravenous administration high dose IL-2 . Sequential panels patient receive increase dos M40403 along IL-2 active dose determine MTD reach . Patients follow determine effect M40403 development marker IL-2 dose-limiting toxicity include hypotension , tachycardia , index renal perfusion , cumulative dose pressor require cumulative dose IL-2 administer . Approximately 48 patient study .</detailed_description>
