	<brief_summary>This study collect quantity white blood cell patient infected hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) research interaction HCV human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) people infected agent . Several study show infection HIV adversely affect liver disease due HCV . Patients 18 year age older infect HCV HIV HCV alone may eligible study . Candidates must liver failure must undergo treatment HCV time enrollment . Participants undergo leukapheresis collect white blood cell . This procedure allow collection large number cell would possible simple blood drawing . For procedure , blood remove needle vein one arm spun machine separate blood component . The white cell extract rest blood re-infused needle needle arm . The procedure take approximately 1-3 hour , depend amount white cell collect . A maximum three leukapheresis procedure do . If additional procedure require , patient sign new consent form . Procedures limit three time year , every 4 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) Hepatitis B ( HBV ) infection know cause morbidity mortality especially among coinfected Human Immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . HCV infected individual also coinfected HIV rapid progression liver disease , abnormal diagnostic serology , high level HCV viremia , markedly low level therapeutic response standard combination therapy peginterferon ribavirin . The underlying immunopathogenesis HCV HBV infection , progression liver disease , interaction HIV yet clearly understood . A clear understanding immune correlate protection HCV HBV important development vaccine HCV novel immune-based therapeutic cure HBV . This study recruit individual coinfected HIV HCV and/or HBV well monoinfected HCV HBV . The study enroll 2 group . Participants first group ( hereafter refer Group 1 ) consist participant recruit research clinical relate blood draw , leukapheresis , liver biopsy long term study participation . Participants second group ( hereafter refer Group 2 ) consist participant know suspected HCV and/or HBV need assistance diagnosis treatment . Participants Group 1 apheresed undergo blood draw several time enrollment may follow 10 year . Participants Group 2 evaluate HBV and/or HCV infection complication , receive treatment . The expectation may follow one year . Leukapheresis use Group 1 order obtain sufficient cell pursue follow objective : delineating B cell response CD4+ T cell help , delineate CD8+ T factor associate suppression viral replication normalization immune function , characterize natural killer function relative HCV and/or HBV disease , identify biomarkers progression liver disease . The required number mononuclear cell need perform experiment easily safely obtain use leukapheresis procedure Clinical Center Apheresis Unit . Participants meet apheresis criterion may participate routine blood draw contribute research . All participant Group 1 may also receive liver biopsy NIH ( every 3 year HIV/HCV coinfected HBV infect every 5 year HCV monoinfected subject ) assess progression liver disease . Treatment plan Group 2 HBV and/or HCV accordance standard medical practice , number length additional visit diagnostic evaluation vary accordingly .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR BOTH GROUPS : Adult ( 18 year old old ) Either monoinfected HCV coinfected HCV HIV Willingness give inform consent . Willing undergo genetic test Willing sample store future research . Must refer physician clinic continue provide medical care . Note : An HCV/HIV coinfected individual define individual following : 1 ) Positive ELISA western blot test HIV , 2 ) Positive serology and/or positive HCV RNA test ; An HCV monoinfected individual define individual following : 1 ) Positive serology and/or positive HCV RNA test , 2 ) Negative ELISA test HIV INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR GROUP 1 : Must willing able make follow visit leukapheresis blood draw least next 6 month INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR GROUP 2 : Must refer physician purpose confirm HCV diagnosis , complication HCV , standard HCV treatment management . EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR BOTH GROUPS Have condition , investigator considers contraindication study participation . EXCLUSION FOR GROUP 1 : Evidence liver failure liver biopsy , abdominal ultrasound , liver function blood test Receiving HCV therapy time enrollment Platelet count &lt; 50,00 per mL Hematocrit &lt; 28 percent .</criteria>
