	<brief_summary>This study test safety effectiveness combination three drug follow long-term treatment one drug prevent organ rejection kidney transplant patient . Current anti-rejection medicine completely effective prevent rejection . This trial test well Thymoglobulin , Tacrolimus , Sirolimus work together post-transplant treatment reduced time control rejection either Tacrolimus Sirolimus alone . Candidates kidney transplantation National Institutes Health Clinical Center may participate 5-year study . Patients screen eligibility medical history , physical examination , blood test . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Central line placement : A large intravenous catheter ( plastic tube , IV line ) place vein chest neck local anesthesia transplant surgery . The line remain place time hospitalization administer Thymoglobulin , antibiotic , blood , need . The line also use collect blood sample . - Leukapheresis : This procedure collect white blood cell do transplant . The cell study evaluate patient 's immune system . Whole blood withdrawn catheter arm vein central line direct machine separate blood component spin . The white cell remove red cell plasma return body . - Kidney transplant : Patients undergo kidney transplant surgery general anesthesia . - Immunosuppressive therapy : Patients receive thymoglobulin vein 4 day start 1 day transplant . They also take Tylenol , Benadryl steroid ( methylprednisolone ) help reduce side effect Thymoglobulin . After transplant , patient receive Tacrolimus Sirolimus mouth day 6 month either Tacrolimus Sirolimus alone indefinitely . In addition , take medicine help prevent viral fungal infection 6 month immunosuppressive therapy leave vulnerable infection . - Follow-up visit : After hospital discharge , patient return Clinical Center twice week 4 week , every 6 month 1 year , yearly another 4 year . At visit , patient 's vital sign check blood urine sample collect . Periodically , patient also question feel transplant affect quality life . Kidney biopsy ( removal small amount kidney tissue thin needle ) do patient begin single-drug immunosuppression ( generally 6 month transplantation ) 1 year . The biopsied tissue examine evaluate well kidney respond treatment determine proceed therapy . - Routine laboratory test : Routine test , coordinate patient 's local physician , do 2 3 time week first 2 3 month transplantation , weekly several month , least monthly life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This protocol facilitate development method determine whether transplant recipient develop immune hyporesponsiveness tolerance towards allograft . These method involve study peripheral blood biopsy tissue obtain regular interval patient receive kidney combine kidney-pancreas allograft NIH Clinical Center . In addition , patient previously receive kidney combine kidney-pancreas allograft evaluate use assay require peripheral blood mononuclear cell and/or biopsy . Assays develop protocol use subsequent protocol assess effect immune modulate treatment regimen may eventually use direct clinical care guide withdrawal immunosuppressive agent . However , patient enrol protocol change treatment base solely assays develop without enrol additional study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Candidates kidney transplant Clinical Center . Willingness legal ability give inform consent . Availability donor tissue test . This could include splenic peripheral blood lymphocyte cadaveric donor willing living donor consent periodic phlebotomy peripheral blood lymphocyte isolation . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Immunosuppressive drug therapy time 2 month prior enrollment . Specifically , candidate may take prednisone , cyclosporine , tacrolimus , azathioprine , mycophenolate mofetil , antilymphocyte agent , cyclophosphamide , methotrexate , agent whose therapeutic effect immunosuppressive . Any active malignancy history hematogenous malignancy lymphoma . Patients primary , cutaneous basal cell squamous cell cancer may enrol provide lesion appropriately treat prior transplant . Any known immunodeficiency syndrome , condition , opinion investigator , would likely increase risk protocol participation confound interpretation data . Any history sensitization rabbit extensive exposure rabbit , define symptomatic allergic response upon exposure rabbit . Inability unwillingness comply protocol monitor therapy include , among others , history noncompliance , circumstance compliance protocol requirement feasible due living condition , travel restriction , access urgent medical service , access antirejection drug research protocol complete . Peak Panel Reactive Antibody great 20 % , historically positive crossmatch due HLA ( human leukocyte antigen ) specific antibody . HLA ( human leukocyte antigen ) identity donor recipient . Pregnancy unwillingness practice approve method birth control . Acceptable method birth control may include barrier method ( condom and/or diaphragm spermicide ) , oral contraceptive , Norplant , DepoProvera partner sterility .</criteria>
