	<brief_summary>This study examine brain control movement patient certain type cerebral palsy . In healthy people , one side body usually control movement side body . In patient cerebral palsy , pattern may alter , one side brain may control movement side body . Information obtain study may lead improved rehabilitation therapy strategies patient cerebral palsy . Healthy volunteer patient cerebral palsy 6 18 year age may eligible study . All candidate screen medical history , physical examination , psychological testing . In addition , patient cerebral palsy hearing vision test , review medical record , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan one do within past year . For test , patient lie table slide narrow metal cylinder strong magnetic field ( scanner ) . The scanning time usually last 45 90 minute . Patients enrol study also evaluate physiatrist physical occupational therapist . They examine muscle stiffness reflex . Their gait movement ( e.g. , pick glass water ) evaluate . They ask ability perform activity around house school whether wheelchair walker need get around . Patients may also ask deal movement problem affect caregiver . All participant undergo three test , describe , evaluate movement control . The first two test use electrode ( small metal disc ) tap skin muscle hand measure muscle activity . A small disc place finger detects measure hand movement . The third test use magnetic pulse stimulate brain study brain control movement . 1 . Quantitative test fine motor function : For test , subject taps button different speed box attach computer . The test similar playing simple computer game . 2 . Long latency reflex : For test , subject 's hand lightly strap holder hold hand still motor move index finger sudden small movement . These reflex may also test use gentle shock finger deliver ring electrode . 3 . Transcranial magnetic stimulation : For test , subject sits comfortable chair . An insulated coil hold scalp . A magnetic pulse coil stimulate brain . The subject may hear click feel snap pull sensation scalp coil . The stimulation may also cause twitch muscle arm leg . During stimulation , subject may ask move certain muscle perform simple action .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although capacity immature nervous system recover injury superior adult brain , child cerebral palsy carry great burden morbidity entire life . Functional outcome may determine characteristic lesion ( size , location , time ) also response brain lesion ( cortical re-organization ) . Little known underlying limitation , inefficient cortical re-organization , affect functional outcome response therapy child cerebral palsy . Because , individual rehabilitation strategy base solely level function rather underlying impairment . Research demonstrate novel rehabilitation strategy manipulate plasticity motor cortex , way , improve functional outcome adult suffer stroke . There preliminary evidence treatment may also benefit patient cerebral palsy . However , cortical re-organization injury develop brain may similar occurs stroke adult brain . It would benefit great understand impairment arise inefficient cortical re-organization child cerebral palsy . It also important research methodology assess effect novel treatment order measure true benefit . Cortical re-organization lead enhance participation unaffected hemisphere via anomalous ipsilateral corticofugal motor projection . Recent evidence suggest form neural re-organization may efficient . Three different type ipsilateral projection think exist : 1 ) fast-conducting developmental ipsilateral projection persist beyond age normally disappear ; 2 ) slow-conducting ipsilateral tract present healthy subject become accessible injury ; 3 ) fast-conducting projection arise de novo ipsilateral primary motor cortex injury develop brain . Each type distinct neurophysiologic profile characterize use transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) electromyography ( EMG ) . To date , relationship anomalous ipsilateral corticofugal motor projection functional outcome examine detail . There preliminary evidence presence anomalous ipsilateral projection associate poor outcome , suggest represent inefficient cortical re-organization process . In addition , anomalous projection arise de novo ipsilateral primary motor cortex appear bad prognosis . The propose research study characterize anomalous ipsilateral corticofugal motor projection group child spastic hemiplegia spastic diplegia subtypes cerebral palsy use TMS EMG . We evaluate functional limitation hand child examine relationship type ipsilateral pathway functional outcome . In way , possible determine anomalous ipsilateral projection associate poor function patient cerebral palsy . This study increase understand functional significance ipsilateral projection make possible identify ipsilateral projection individual child . The neurophysiologic technique develop study provide essential research methodology ass brain re-organization novel therapeutic approach .</detailed_description>
