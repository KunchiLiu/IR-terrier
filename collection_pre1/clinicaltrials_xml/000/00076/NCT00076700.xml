	<brief_summary>This study determine brain region blind people would normally involve vision use instead remember touch . Blind people enhanced sense touch compare sighted people , also perform good test certain kind memory . This study examine compare result touch memory test blind sight people determine brain area involve respond touch . Blind people sight volunteer 18 80 year age psychiatric problem neurological problem ( blindness ) may eligible study . Candidates screen medical interview examination . Participants undergo one follow procedure : Behavioral experiment Sighted participant blindfold experiment . Subjects sit comfortably front table . They present number surface place table one time give 10 second feel surface index finger dominant hand . They must concentrate memorize surface best . After 15-minute break , present series surface give 10 second feel one . This time , must say quickly possibly whether surface one touch previously new surface . Functional MRI MRI use strong magnetic field radio wave obtain image body organ tissue . In study , subject undergo MRI scan brain perform touch test described . For MRI , subject lie table slide scanner . The MRI machine detects change brain region involve perform task .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enhanced Tactile Memory Blind</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In blind , area brain would normally respond visual stimulus instead process information sensory modality somatosensory auditory domain . Recent study show visual cortex blind participates higher-order process auditory information include verb generation retrieval verbal memory . Because tactile information play similarly crucial role vision miss ( i.e . read Braille ) , suggest ability encode recall tactile information blind superior sight . OBJECTIVES : The first objective protocol determine tactile memory superior early blind subject relative late blind sight control subject . The second objective determine visual cortex blind people participate higher-order processing tactile information tactile encode recognition . STUDY POPULATION : Our experiment make use early blind , late blind , sight control subject . DESIGN : Experiment 1 : We quantify ability study population encode retrieve episodic tactile memory . Subjects presented series surface palpate commit memory , rest ten fifteen minute . The old surface present number new surface randomly interleave . Subjects discriminate old new surface . Experiment 2 : We identify cortical area associate successful tactile memory encode retrieval blind individual sight control use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . Subjects perform memory task Experiment 1 MRI machine . OUTCOME MEASURES : Experiment 1 : The primary outcome measure recognition memory , correct measure number old stimulus correctly remember . Experiment 2 : The primary outcome measure number voxels significantly activate primary visual cortex early blind subject compare late blind subject sight control . We expect magnitude visual cortex activation early blind tactile memory task correlate superior performance task .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Early Blind Subjects : Only compliant early blind subject age 18 80 year little visual perception due disease affect peripheral component visual system , i.e. , blind subject without neurological problem , normal MRI brain scan , select . Late Blind Subjects : Only compliant late blind subject lose vision age 4 year due disease affect peripheral component visual system , i.e. , blind subject without neurological problem , normal MRI brain scan , select . Sighted control : Only compliant adult healthy volunteer age 18 80 year history neurological psychiatric illness able concentrate perform simple attention task eligible . Blind subject : Early late blind subject ( age 18 80 ) include protocol . Sighted subject : Healthy sight ( normal correctedto normal vision ) match age , sex , handedness early blind subject . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Exclusion criterion study ny current medical surgical condition psychiatric neurological illness . Furthermore , individual medication potential influence nervous system function , history surgery metallic implant know history metallic particle eye , cardiac pacemaker , intracardiac line , neural stimulators , cochlear implant , pregnancy , history drug abuse exclude study .</criteria>
