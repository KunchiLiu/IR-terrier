	<brief_summary>This study examine healthy individual patient aphasia ( language disturbance usually cause stroke , brain disease , injury ) part brain involve naming everyday object . In people , language speech originate leave side brain . When side brain damage , language function often impaired . Often , however , function partly recovers , possibly right half brain take language function leave half injured . Healthy volunteer patient aphasia due stroke may eligible study . All candidate must 18 year age old . Patients ' aphasia must occur result stroke occur 12 month enter study . In addition , stroke must affect brainstem cerebellum . Candidates screen medical history , brief physical examination , questionnaire handedness . Participants undergo follow test procedure : Session 1 : Magnetic resonance scanning ( MRI ) MRI diagnostic research tool use strong magnetic field radio wave obtain image body organ tissue , include brain . The subject lie cylindrical machine 60 minute . Loud thumping noise occur radiofrequency circuit switch ; noise muffle use earplug . Sessions 2 3 : Picture name transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) For transcranial magnetic stimulation , wire coil hold subject 's scalp . A brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . The subject hears click feel pull sensation skin coil . There may also twitch muscle arm leg . During TMS , subject ask name picture common everyday object appear computer screen . They ask name fast accurately possible . Their voice record determine accuracy answer time take answer . Subjects may also ask tense certain muscle slightly perform simple action TMS position coil properly .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Aphasia , language impairment usually induce stroke , typically result damage leave hemisphere . Severity disorder vary across patient , well degree impairment various level linguistic process . However , one consistent symptom aphasia anomia ( dysnomia ) word find deficit . Given reliable presence anomia , picture name common task use clinically experimentally probe linguistic processing . Functional image study suggest right hemisphere may recruit compensate loss leave hemispheric language region . However , could assess functional significance observe activation . In previous experiment ( NIDCD protocol 92-DC-0178 ) , identify area activate association language function ( picture name ) patient chronic stroke partially recover initially severe aphasia healthy , age- gender-matched control . The preliminary outcome increase involvement right hemisphere picture name recovered aphasic . Objectives : In present protocol , plan test hypothesis right hemispheric homologues traditional leave hemispheric anterior posterior language area neural substrate mediating recovery language function patient chronic stroke . This investigation important provide novel evidence plasticity language function chronic stroke . Study Population : We plan include chronic stroke patient suffer aphasia , healthy , age- gender-matched control . Design : We test inhibitory transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) right-hemispheric cortical area ( inferior frontal gyrus - IFG , superior temporal gyrus - STG , middle temporal gyrus - MTG ) activate picture name result decrease task performance ( picture name latency ) chronic stroke patient , comparison stimulation leave hemispheric area aphasic , right-hemispheric homologue area healthy control . The TMS experiment necessary identify cause-effect link right hemispheric activation recovery language function chronic stroke . Stereotactic application TMS picture name task implement six cortical site group : leave IFG , leave STG , leave MTG , right IFG , right STG , right MTG . Outcome Measures : The outcome measure performance picture name task ( primary outcome measure reaction time ) TMS function subject group stimulation site .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : We include patient thromboembolic nonhemorrhagic hemispheric lesion hemorrhagic hemispheric lesion ( document CT MRI ) least 12 month stroke . We choose subject chronic stable aphasia , initially present severe aphasia partially recover . Assessment initial functional state take either patient report medical record . All aphasic patient already know investigator NIDCD . EXCLUSION CRITERIA HEALTHY CONTROLS : Unable perform task ( name everyday object less 10 ) . History alcohol drug abuse psychiatric illness like depression . Epilepsy . Are less 18 year age . Pregnant breast feeding child . EXCLUSION CRITERIA PATIENTS : Unable perform task ( name everyday object less 10 ) . History alcohol drug abuse psychiatric illness like depression . Epilepsy . Are less 18 year age . Pregnant breast feeding child . Patients cerebellar brainstem lesion . Patients subject severe uncontrolled medical problem ( e.g . cardiovascular disease , severe rheumatoid arthritis , active joint deformity arthritic origin , active cancer renal disease , kind endstage pulmonary cardiovascular disease ) . Patients subject increase intracranial pressure evaluate clinical mean . Individuals receive drug act primarily central nervous system .</criteria>
