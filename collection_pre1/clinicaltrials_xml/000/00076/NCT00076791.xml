	<detailed_description>The majority perinatally infected infant infect labor delivery process , recent study suggest additional factor , postexposure prophylaxis , likely involved prevention MTCT HIV . It possible antiretroviral dose labor short-term dose newly bear infant would sufficiently effective prevent MTCT HIV . TDF nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor demonstrate significant effectiveness prevent MTCT simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) primate model HIV . FTC/TDF combination two NRTIs study combination potential prevent MTCT , protect mother develop resistance may develop single drug therapy . This study evaluate safety , tolerance , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) single dos TDF FTC/TDF HIV infect pregnant woman newborn infant . Cohort 1 close . Each participant Cohort 1 receive single 600 mg oral dose TDF start active labor 4 hour prior C-section , concurrent administration standard intravenous zidovudine ( ZDV ) prophylaxis and/or antiretrovirals prescribe physician . The infant Cohort 1 receive standard 6 week oral ZDV prophylaxis postpartum . PK blood sample take mother predose 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 hour postdose time delivery ; PK blood sample take infant 12 , 24 , 36 hour birth . Pregnant woman HIV infection enter study assign Cohort 2 , infant Cohort 1 complete 6 8 week study visit Cohort 1 data reviewed . Mothers Cohort 2 receive single dose 900 mg TDF combine 600 mg emtricitabine , along standard ZDV prophylaxis and/or antiretrovirals prescribe physician . Infants receive single dose TDF 4 mg/kg combine 3 mg/kg emtricitabine soon possible delivery within 6 hour age well standard 6 week oral ZDV prophylaxis birth . Blood sample mother infant take Cohort 1 . Mothers follow 12 week postpartum 2 year give birth viral resistance TDF FTC/TDF demonstrate Weeks 1 , 6 , 12 . In addition PK study , blood collection occur around time delivery , screening , study entry , delivery , delivery various time Week 12 . Physical exam do screening , study entry , delivery , delivery various time Week 8 . Infants follow age 2 . Blood collect physical exam do birth various time Week 96 . Mothers encourage coenroll PACTG P1025 , Pharmacokinetic Study Anti-HIV Drugs During Pregnancy .</detailed_description>
