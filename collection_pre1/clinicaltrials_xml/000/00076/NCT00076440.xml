	<detailed_description>ALADDIN clinical trial investigate safety effectiveness leuprolide ( hormone drug ) improve cognitive function slow progression Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . The study include treatment men 65 year old mild moderate Alzheimer 's disease reside community . The objective evaluate safety efficacy two different dos leuprolide improve cognitive function slow progression AD , measure ADAS-COG Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) . Measures behavioral disturbance , quality life caregiver make also . The study design randomize , double blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group design 2:1 randomization drug placebo . Sample size include 90 participant multiple test site . Following initial screen baseline visit , participant caregiver visit site 8 time total 10 visit 48 week . The drug administer via injection every 3 month . Safety assessment complete psychometric test do . Participant 's memory , behavior , global functioning assess participant caregiver interview . Each visit take approximately 2 hour .</detailed_description>
