	<detailed_description>Immune prim cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) successfully achieve live attenuate virus live virus vector vaccine . Recombinant canarypox vaccine excellent safety record induce HIV neutralize antibody CTLs early clinical trial . This study evaluate use HIV lipopeptides ( LIPO-5 ) alone combination canarypox-based HIV vaccine [ ALVAC-HIV ( vCP1452 ) ] increase CTL activity . Participants study randomly assign one five group . Participants Groups A B receive four injection 6 month . Participants Group A receive four injection either LIPO-5 placebo . Participants Group B receive four injection either ALVAC-HIV ( vCP1452 ) placebo . Participants Groups C , D , E receive six injection 6 month . Participants group receive either ALVAC-HIV ( vCP1452 ) LIPO-5 placebo . Participants receive vaccine combination receive four injection dose ALVAC-HIV ( vCP1452 ) two injection LIPO-5 . The dose LIPO-5 different participant Groups C , D , E. Participants 11 study visit 18 month ; total duration study 30 month . The length visit vary may last 3 hour .
