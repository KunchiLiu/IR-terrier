	<brief_summary>This study examine compare blood sample healthy volunteer patient Parkinson 's disease identify abnormality associate Parkinson 's disease . Disease symptom include slowness movement , hand leg shaking , stiffness . Some patient difficulty balance . Information study may provide information Parkinson 's disease affect brain body , may help lead test early diagnosis . Healthy volunteer patient Parkinson 's disease 18 year age old may enroll study . Participants undergo follow procedure : - Physical examination , include evaluation strength , feeling , coordination , balance - Blood drawing : 150 milliliter ( 10 tablespoon ) blood drawn - Personal family medical history - Consent access medical record research purpose Blood sample examine : - Genetic analysis - Study specific protein lipid - Study mitochondrion ( part cell make energy )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study want focus mitochondrial defect associate Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) relate alpha-synuclein ( SNCA ) expression function . Individuals family inherit Parkinson 's disease ( affected risk member ) , well normal individual , enrol . All subject ask provide blood sample order study bioenergetic function mitochondrion platelet . These study include genotyping determination polymorphism subject ' mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) order delineate significant abnormality may associate particular group . Cardiolipin level obtain fee service Lipomics . Basic respirometry , enzyme activity , somatic cell hybridization perform PI 's lab . Protein analysis perform proteomics facility NIMH .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Individuals age 18 family inherit form parkinson 's disease apparent enrol . These patient already enrol Genetic linkage analysis protocol 97HG0173 . The diagnosis Parkinson 's disease must support accept clinical criterion include : tremor , bradykinesia , rigidity responsiveness LDOPA . Unaffected family member find risk , also enrol . The normal control group comprise anonymous platelet donor NIH Department Transfusion Medicine individual age 18 know neurological disorder normal neurological examination match age sex may actively recruit . Individuals Lewy Body disease ( LBD ) meet current criterion diagnosis ( hallucination , diurnal variation , dementia associate extrapyramidal symptom within one year period ) also include study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Because medication alter mitochondrial function , patient MAO inhibitor , antidiabetic sulfonylurea benzodiazepine exclude study . No person age 18 enrol study . This due fact , except rare occasion , Parkinson 's disease affect adult .</criteria>
