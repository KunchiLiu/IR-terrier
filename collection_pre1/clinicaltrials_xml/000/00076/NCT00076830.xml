	<brief_summary>This study offer evaluation treatment patient suspect connective tissue disorder . The protocol design test new treatment ; rather , patient receive standard care . The study design : 1 ) allow NICHD 's staff learn connective tissue disorder , 2 ) train physician evaluation treatment disorder ; 3 ) establish pool patient may eligible NICHD protocol connective tissue disorder . ( Participants protocol require join another study ; decision voluntary . ) Patients age suspect connective tissue disorder unaffected family member may eligible study . Participants undergo diagnostic procedure may include medical history , physical examination , X-ray study , eye examination , blood drawing , well specialized test , need . Additional test may include : - Blood test DNA genetic analysis - Skin biopsy : Removal small piece tissue microscopic examination . The area skin select biopsy numbed small circle skin , usually upper arm , remove surgical cookie cutter-like instrument . - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) : This test use strong magnetic field radio wave show structural chemical change tissue . The patient lie table slide narrow cylinder contain magnetic field . Ear plugs worn muffle loud knock thump sound occur electrical switch magnetic field . - Computed tomography ( CT ) scan : This test allow doctor view organ inside body small section . The patient lie doughnut-like machine . Scanning do different angle , allow three dimensional picture part body study . It may do without injection contrast material . - Referral appropriate sub-specialists potential complication find .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients suspect connective tissue disorder unaffected family member eligible inclusion protocol . Patients clinically severe bone dysplasia , lack specific diagnosis collagen mutation undetectable standard collagen testing , family experience unexplained fetal infantile death attribute type II OI , and/or consanguinity , admit protocol clinical evaluation genetic analysis . They admit inpatient outpatient discretion Principal Investigator , base upon research interest expertise . Patients one month age admit good health require admission Clinical Center confirmation presumptive diagnosis base upon family history . There three nonprofit institution provide test recessive OI , lab Section Heritable Disorders Bone Extracellular Matrix NICHD , Genetics department lab Baylor College , Pathology Department Washington University Seattle . Additionally , tissue specimen donate volunteer purpose serve normal control sample also fall protocol . This enhance ability confirm diagnosis affect proband .</criteria>
