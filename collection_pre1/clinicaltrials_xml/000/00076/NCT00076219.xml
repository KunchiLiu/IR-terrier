	<brief_summary>This multi-center , prospective , randomize , parallel-group trial intensive strategy vs conventional strategy renal replacement therapy treatment acute renal failure secondary acute tubular necrosis critically ill patient . The primary hypothesis intensive strategy reduce 60-day cause mortality 10 % compare conventional strategy - i.e. , reduction 55 % conventional arm 45 % intensive arm . Secondary outcome 60-day in-hospital all-cause mortality , 1-year cause mortality , recovery renal function day 28 . The study recruit 1164 patient period 3 year , 8 month patient actively follow 60 day .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Hypothesis : An intensive management strategy renal support critically ill patient acute renal failure decrease mortality compare less intensive ( conventionally recommend ) management strategy renal replacement therapy . Secondary Hypotheses : An intensive management strategy renal support critically ill patient acute renal failure shorten duration ARF , decrease incidence duration non-renal complication cost-effective compare less intensive ( conventionally recommend ) management strategy renal replacement therapy . Primary Outcomes : 60-day all-cause mortality . Secondary Outcomes : All-cause hospital mortality ; 1-year cause mortality ; recovery renal function ; duration renal support ( dialysis-free day ) ; ICU hospital length stay ( ICU-and hospital-free day ) ; non-renal organ system failure ( organ-failure-free day ) ; discharge `` home '' dialysis . Study Abstract : The optimal management renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) acute renal failure ( ARF ) uncertain . The VA/NIH Acute Renal Failure Trial Network ( ATN Study ) design test hypothesis strategy intensive renal support decrease mortality critically ill patient ARF compare less intensive ( conventionally recommend ) management . In multicenter , prospective trial , patient ARF due acute tubular necrosis randomize equally intensive conventional management strategy RRT . In arm , RRT initiate use criterion . Hemodynamically stable patient ( SOFA cardiovascular score : 0-2 ) receive intermittent hemodialysis ( IHD ) hemodynamically unstable patient ( SOFA cardiovascular score : 3-4 ) treat continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration ( CVVHDF ) sustain low-efficiency hemodialysis ( SLED ) . Patients convert modality therapy hemodynamic status change time . The intensity therapy IHD SLED vary group base treatment frequency ; treatment provide 6-times per week intensive management strategy arm 3-times per week conventional management strategy arm . In CVVHDF , intensity therapy vary base effluent flow rate prescribe flow rate 35 mL/kg/hour intensive management strategy arm 20 mL/kg/hour conventional management strategy arm . Protocol therapy continue renal function recovers day 28 . The primary study end-point 60-day all-cause mortality . Other end-points include hospital 1-year mortality , recovery renal function , duration renal support , ICU hospital length stay , hospital discharge dialysis development/recovery non-renal organ failure . An economic analysis perform assess cost relative cost effectiveness two strategy . The planned total enrollment 1164 patient 27 institution 44 month select provide power 0.90 detect reduction mortality 55 % 45 % alpha=0.05 assume dropout/loss-to-follow-up rate 10 % . Study enrollment begin November 2003 close 44 month July 2 , 2007 . Total enrollment 1124 subject . Fewer 3 % subject withdraw protocol therapy . Follow-up primary study endpoint ( 60-day all-cause mortality ) conclude August 31 , 2007 ; one-year follow-up conclude July 2008 . A type dialysis solution use study IND No . 67,631 granted Center Drug Evaluation Research FDA .</detailed_description>
