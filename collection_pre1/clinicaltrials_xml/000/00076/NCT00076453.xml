	<brief_title>A Study Orthotic Shoe Inserts Controlling Osteoarthritic Knee Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) chronic disease cause deterioration joint cartilage formation bone spur margin joint . Knee OA cause substantial pain , suffering , disability , well enormous economic burden patient ; unfortunately , treatment provide relief cure . The majority patient symptomatic knee OA attain satisfactory long-term relief , even recent advance pain reliever . Analgesic treatment may relieve pain improve biomechanics may even aggravate OA . Although OA complex completely understood , disease onset progression least partly related response bone cartilage biomechanical loading . Devices promote pressure reduction medial knee may provide pain relief simultaneously protect joint degeneration ; one device lateral wedge orthotic shoe insert . When worn weight-bearing activity , insert show reduce load medial compartment may provide pain relief . This study evaluate effectiveness orthotic shoe insert control relieve knee OA . The study also assess improvement load biomechanics knee . This 3-year study . Patients randomly assign one two group ; first group receive lateral wedge orthotic insert second group receive standard orthotic insert . There 10 study visit course study . Patients undergo X-rays bone mineral density testing ( DEXA ) 3 blood collection course study .</detailed_description>
