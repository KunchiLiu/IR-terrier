	<brief_summary>This study evaluate treat child adult inherit developmental eye condition . It allow specialist pediatric ophthalmology , genetic ophthalmology , ocular motility National Eye Institute ( NEI ) learn course various pediatric , genetic , developmental , eye movement diseases thorough long-term observation treatment . It also serve first step determine eligibility patient may wish enroll NEI clinical research study undergo standard eye treatment . Children eye condition , especially inherited developmental condition , adult eye disorder begin childhood likely genetic developmental component may eligible study . Participants undergo follow procedure : - Medical history , include family history . - Physical examination possibly routine blood test , x-rays test , standard eye movement recording , questionnaire , specialize procedure need . - Complete eye examination , include vision test , visual perception , eye pressure ( possible ) , dilation pupil examine back eye ( lens , vitreous , retina ) . - Photographs eye . - Oculography ( eye movement recording ) patient test aid diagnosis . This test do either goggles place eye contact lens place eye . When goggles lenses place , subject look series red target computer screen . - Electroretinography ( ERG ) patient suspect retinal degeneration . This test electrical function eye . Before test , patient sit dark room 30 minute eyes patch . A small electrode ( silver disk ) tap forehead . The eye patch remove , eye numb drop , contact lens place eye . The contact lenses sense small electrical signal generate retina light flash . During ERG recording , patient look inside large empty bowl . A light flash , first dark light turn inside bowl . The test take 1 hour less . Participants follow 6 time year 3 year , depend diagnosis treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol allow pediatric ophthalmology , genetic ophthalmology , ocular motility specialist National Eye Institute gain additional knowledge course various pediatric , genetic , developmental ocular motility disease . Heretofore , spectrum disease refer pediatric ophthalmology disease . We wish evaluate effect standard treatment disease , use non- minimally-invasive technology understand pathogenesis disease , collect blood easily obtain biologic sample ( e.g. , urine , saliva , hair , cheek swab , stool ) future laboratory study diseases . The information gain protocol also allow maintenance population patient specific pediatric eye disease strabismus may eligible future protocol . In addition , allow care patient spectrum disease , protocol valuable training pediatric eye disease , ocular genetics , ocular motility fellow . The pediatric , genetic , eye movement specialist National Eye Institute choose ophthalmology disease base train research need NEI program . While primary focus protocol study eye disease child , adult disease begin childhood may inherit eye disease unaffected first-degree relative may also evaluate protocol . This protocol design test new treatment . Any evaluation treatment protocol base standard-of-care patient 's disease . All alternative evaluation care review patient patient 's family . Patients evaluation treatment protocol evaluate potential eligibility new NEI clinical trial epidemiological protocol develop . If eligible , patient may ask participate new protocol . However , require enter new protocol decision participate entirely voluntary .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects able enroll : 1 . Are pediatric patient , age , ophthalmic condition , especially inherited developmental condition , OR 2 . Are adult patient eye disorder begin childhood likely genetic/developmental component , OR 3 . Are unaffected firstdegree relative believe aid diagnosis future research objective , AND 4 . Have ability understand sign inform consent OR legal parent/guardian ability . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects eligible : 1 . Are unable followup clinically indicate . 2 . Have severe systemic disease compromise ability provide adequate examination and/or treatment .</criteria>
