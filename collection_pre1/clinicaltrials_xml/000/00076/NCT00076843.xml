	<brief_summary>This study examine use humanize Mik-Beta-1 ( Hu Mik- ( SqrRoot ) 1 ) monoclonal antibody patient HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis ( HAM/TSP ) . Some patient infect human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) virus develop HAM/TSP , disease immune response HTLV-1 becomes direct person 's body call autoimmune response . Hu-Mik-Beta-1 genetically engineer antibody block action chemical produce body infection inflammation call interleukin 15 ( IL-15 ) . Blocking IL-15 may prevent autoimmune response result HAM/TSP . Patients 18 year age old HAM/TSP may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood urine test , electrocardiogram . Participants undergo follow procedure : 1 . Baseline visit ( ) : Repeat physical examination blood urine test , well follow : - Lumbar puncture : A local anesthetic inject numb skin lower back . A needle inserted space bone cerebrospinal fluid bathe brain spinal cord circulate spinal cord . About 4 tablespoon fluid collect needle . - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) : This test use radio wave magnet produce image body tissue organ . The patient lie table slide metal cylinder surround strong magnetic field . During part scan , contrast agent inject brighten image . - Apheresis : This procedure use collect large quantity white blood cell . Whole blood collect needle arm vein direct machine separate component spin . The white cell plasma remove rest blood ( red cell platelet ) return body needle . 2 . Hu Mik-Beta-1 treatment : Infusions Hu Mik-Beta-1 give vein every 3 week nine dos . The first treatment require least overnight hospital stay ; subsequent infusion give outpatient clinic . 3 . Blood urine test physical examination every treatment visit skin test one treatment visit . 4 . Research test end 24-week treatment period , include lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) , MRI scan , apheresis . 5 . After complete treatment , patient three follow-up clinic visit blood urine test , skin test one follow-up visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : In phase I/II trial wish determine toxicity provide preliminary clinical response information follow administration humanize MiK-beta-1 ( Hu MiK-Beta1 ) , monoclonal antibody direct toward IL-2/IL-15R Beta ( CD122 ) , patient HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis ( HAM/TSP ) . This antibody block action IL-15 , cytokine involve pathogenesis HTLV-I associate disease autoimmune disorder rheumatoid arthritis multiple sclerosis . Study Population : HAM/TSP affect 1 % patient infected human T lymphotropic virus type 1 ( HTLV-I ) , manifest progressive myelopathy . Several feature immune response HAM/TSP indicate IL-15 may critical pathogenesis . HTLV-I transactivates IL-15 IL-15 R alpha expression tax protein , support activation lymphocyte HAM/TSP , evidence spontaneous proliferation ex vivo culture . We show antibody HuMiK-Beta1 could inhibit spontaneous lymphoproliferation . In addition , IL-15 show preferential positive effect survival CD8+ T-cells , especially memory phenotype . In HAM/TSP , extraordinarily high frequency tax specific CD8+ T-cells peripheral blood cerebrospinal fluid postulate participate damage central nervous system . We demonstrate addition Hu MiK-Beta1 ex vivo cell HAM/TSP patient lead marked decline tax specific CD8+ T-cells . Design Study Outcome Parameters In single center , open label trial , four subject HAM/TSP receive 0.5 mg/kg Hu MiK-beta1 dose every three week total five dos , two subject HAM/TSP receive placebo ( normal saline ) dosing schedule . In addition , follow completion 0.5 mg/kg dose administration four subject HAM/TSP , dose escalation study perform three subject HAM/TSP receive 1.0 mg/kg Hu MiK-beta1 three week interval total five dos per subject , three subject HAM/TSP receive 1.5 mg/kg Hu MiK-beta1 three week interval total five dos per subject A Total 10 subject receive study drug/placebo . We anticipate consent eighteen subject allow eight dropout . Participants withdraw voluntarily ( due toxicity ) initiation study consider dropout . If occurs prior receive three dos study medication subject replace three follow-up evaluation four-week interval follow last dose study drug . Patients voluntarily drop receive least 3 dos study drug remain study continue protocol-specific evaluation . Toxicity assess use standard criterion . The clinical response evaluate use standardized scale include expand disability status scale , Scripps neurologic rating scale ambulation index . In addition , viral immunologic outcome measure include assay spontaneous lymphoproliferation analysis HTLV-I tax tetramer specific CD8+ cell , HTLV-I proviral load determination T-cell phenotype analysis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must least 18 year old . Patients must diagnosis HAM/TSP define WHO criterion , include positive HTLVI EIA confirmatory pattern Western Blot analysis . Other cause chronic progressive myelopathy exclude test serum B12 level , Lyme disease serology , RPR , antinuclear antibody ( ANA ) , extractable nuclear antigen ( ENA ) screen magnetic resonance image brain spinal cord . At least 7 % patient 's peripheral blood mononuclear cell population must react antiCD122 immunofluorescent cell stain . Spontaneous lymphoproliferation HTLVI specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte response must demonstrate patient 's peripheral blood mononuclear cell ex vivo culture . Patients must willing comply aspect dose evaluation procedure include take required medication willing return followup visit . Patients must able provide write , informed consent prior test protocol , include screen baseline investigation consider part routine patient care . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : EDSS great equal 7 ( unable walk beyond approximately 5 meter even aid , essentially restructed wheelchair ) . Any contraindication monoclonal antibody therapy , include serious adverse event related prior monoclonal antibody therapy . Patients receive prior antibody therapy pertinent medical record review study investigator . Subjects prior monoclonal antibody use ( especially murine MiK Beta 1 ) allergy/sensitivity murine MiK Beta 1 exclude . Any vaccination within 30 day prior study entry . Any chronic bacterial , mycobacterial , viral ( e.g . herpes virus ) , fungal , parasitic protozoal infection . History malignancy ( active within previous 5 year ) . History sign immunodeficiency Subjects preexist cardiac disease , abnormal baseline echocardiogram significantly abnormal ECG undergo evaluation cardiologist , exclude , opinion cardiologist , participation study would compromise safety patient .
