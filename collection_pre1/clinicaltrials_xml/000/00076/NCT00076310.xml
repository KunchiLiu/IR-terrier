	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn give new drug , Tarceva® ( OSI-774 ) , combination Platinol® ( cisplatin ) Taxotere® ( docetaxel ) effective treatment metastatic recurrent head neck cancer . The safety treatment also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>OSI-774/Cisplatin/Taxotere Head &amp; Neck Squamous Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OSI-774 drug help block activity enzyme believe play important role cell growth . It hop block enzymes slow tumor growth . Both cisplatin docetaxel commonly use chemotherapy drug . These drug design target destroy cancer cell . Before study , physical exam , blood test ( around 2 teaspoon ) , electrocardiogram ( ECG - test measure electrical activity heart ) . You also chest x-ray CT scan . If diagnosis yet confirm , biopsy tumor may need do . Women able child must negative blood urine pregnancy test . During treatment , take OSI-774 mouth day . Once every 3 week , give docetaxel cisplatin . Docetaxel give continuous infusion vein 1 hour . This follow infusion vein cisplatin 2 hour . Treatment docetaxel cisplatin give every 3 week 18 week . You continue take OSI-774 disease worsens , side effect become severe , doctor think longer benefit . If time study disease become bad experience intolerable side effect , take study doctor discus treatment option . During study , blood drawn ( around 2 teaspoon ) week . These sample use routine lab test . Every 3 week , physical exam vital sign weight measure . You also ask side effect may experience . If doctor feel necessary , may frequent check-up visit . Every 6 week treatment , blood test ( around 2 teaspoon ) , image test . The imaging test include chest x-ray CT scan head neck area . You may also CT scan area body . These test do check status disease . You may continue receive OSI-774 long cancer respond study treatment . If continue receive OSI-774 , every 3 month physical exam ( include measurement vital sign ) , routine blood test ( 2 teaspoon ) , performance status test ( test look ability perform everyday activity ) , chest x-ray , CT MRI scan . Your doctor may decide take study experience significant side effect medical condition worsens . This investigational study . OSI-774 approve FDA treatment NSCLC patient relapse . Its use study consider investigational . Docetaxel cisplatin FDA approve commercially available . There total 50 patient take part study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Have histologically cytologically confirm metastatic recurrent head neck squamous cell carcinoma primary lesion and/or lymph node oral cavity , oropharynx , hypopharynx , larynx . 2 . Have measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; = 20 mm conventional technique &gt; = 10 mm spiral CT scan . See section 9.2 evaluation measurable disease . 3 . Have receive prior systemic chemotherapy metastatic recurrent head neck squamous cell carcinoma . If patient receive prior combine modality therapy , must therapy least 6 month . 4 . Be &gt; = 18 year age . 5 . No acute intercurrent illness infection . 6 . ECOG performance status = &lt; 2 ( Karnofsky = &gt; 60 % ) . Have normal organ marrow function define : leukocytes= &gt; 3,000/uL ; absolute neutrophil count= &gt; 1,500/uL ; platelet = &gt; 100,000/uL hemoglobin &gt; = 8g/dl ; total bilirubin within normal institutional limit ; AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) = &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal alkaline phosphate &lt; ULN OR alkaline phosphatase may 4x ULN transaminase &lt; ULN ; creatinine = &lt; 2.0 xULN OR creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m**2 patient creatinine level institutional normal 7 . The effect OSI774 develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason , therapeutic agent use trial know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 3 month completion therapy . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 8 . History nonmelanoma skin cancer , malignancy treat 5 year prior current tumor , patient remain continually diseasefree , eligible . 9 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 10 . Inclusion woman minority . Both men woman member ethnic group eligible trial . The propose study population consist patient ethnic background either gender , treat MD Anderson Cancer Center Houston , Texas . 1 . Patients chemotherapy nonpalliative radiotherapy recurrent metastatic head neck cancer . 2 . Patients may receive investigational agent . 3 . Brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . 4 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition OSI774 agent use study . 5 . Patient receive prior biologic therapy target EGFR . 6 . Signs symptom acute infection require systemic therapy . 7 . Exhibits confusion , disorientation , history major psychiatric illness may impair patient 's understanding informed consent . 8 . Requires total parenteral nutrition lipid . 9 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 10 . Histology squamous cell carcinoma . 11 . Refusing sign inform consent . 12 . History severe hypersensitivity reaction Taxotere® . 13 . Preexisting peripheral neuropathy NCI CTC grade 2 worse . 14 . Pregnant lactate woman exclude study OSI774 unknown Class agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother OSI774 , breastfeed discontinue mother treated OSI774 . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . 15 . Because patient immune deficiency increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy , HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction OSI774 , cisplatin , docetaxel agent administer study . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate .</criteria>
