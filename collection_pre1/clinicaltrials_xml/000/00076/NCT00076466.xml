	<brief_summary>This study determine : 1 ) whether learn task dominant hand accompany change area brain control hand movement , 2 ) brain able make change . Previous study show practice motor task change brain excitability , know well brain excitability change motor learning . This study measure change activity part brain control hand movement , , exercise hand response pad . Healthy normal volunteer 18 40 year age may eligible study . Candidates evaluate NIH within past year screen brief interview current state health clinical neurological examination . Participants undergo follow procedure : Learning finger movement/reaction time task For procedure , participant sit front computer monitor index , middle , ring , little finger place flat four correspond button response pad . They ask press one four button fast response asterisk display monitor . The position asterisk indicate button push . Subjects perform nine set 120-button push 15-minute rest set . During rest period , subject undergo transcranial magnetic stimulation ( describe ) , cause twitch hand muscle . The electrical activity correspond twitch record attach electrode ( small metal disk ) skin hand muscle . Transcranial magnetic stimulation For test , insulate wire coil hold scalp . A brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse electrically stimulate brain . The subject hears click may feel pull sensation scalp coil . The stimulation may also cause twitch muscle face , arm , leg . During stimulation , subject may ask tense certain muscle slightly perform simple action .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : We aim show development implicit knowledge motor task associate decrease intracortical GABA-related inhibition ( ICI ) train muscle ( accompany increase MEP amplitude ) increase ICI non-trained neighboring muscle , knowledge becomes explicit , ICI modifications become less prominent . It would useful know role ICI learning . As intervention drug know modify GABA activity , study may even provide rationale use intervention drug enhance plastic change patient impaired motor learn capability . Several study show learn motor task one hand transfer contralateral hand ( 37 , 43 , 45 , 46 , 47 ) . Studies demonstrate learning finger sequence task ( Serial Reaction Time test , SRTT ) dominant-hand ( train ) transfer contralateral hand ( un-trained ) ( 43,49,50 ) . In additional experiment propose investigate effect disrupt M1 ( use 1 Hz TMS , inhibitory effect ) motor learn trained hand ( dominant ) un-trained hand ( non-dominant ) . Evidence show transcallosal connection M1 hemisphere ( 40 ) . Since M1 active implicit learning ( 41 , 42 ) expect 1 Hz TMS stimulation ( inhibitory effect ) M1 deteriorate implicit learning trained hand ( dominant ) well un-trained hand ( non-dominant ) . This evaluated assess effect reaction time accuracy motor performance hand . Study Population : 72 healthy volunteer , age 18-40 participate study . Subjects randomly assign either test session control session . Design : Subjects complete unique session . They perform serial-reaction-time task . The subject instruct push button 4-button pad response visual GO signal ( appear 4 different position ) use appropriate digit appropriate button . There 9 block 120 trial . In test group , block 1 , 4 7 Go signal appear random order ; block 2-3 , 5-6 8-9 12-trial sequence repeat 10 time . In control group Go signal appear random order block . Subjects wo n't inform sequence ask notify anything noticed task . If notice report sequence consider explicit knowledge . Between block subject receive transcranial magnetic stimulation ass ICI . ICI assess subject rest . Outcome Measures : Behavioral effect motor training assess measure mean reaction time ( RT ) digits II V percentage correct responses block . Implicit learn assessed difference RTs block 3 4 block 6 7 . Time explicit learning occurs assess verbal report degree explicit learn number correct item repeat sequence . Implicit learn assess trained hand ( dominant ) ( see ) un-trained hand . The un-trained hand test ask subject repeat two random block ( familiarization ) two sequence block . One sequence block repetition sequence learn dominant hand . The sequence block new sequence contain number character previous sequence . Implicit learn un-trained hand assess difference RTs , random block sequence block . In addition , implicit learn un-trained hand evaluate test difference two sequence block repeat un-trained hand . The time explicit learning occurs assess verbal report degree explicit learn number correct item repeat sequence . Intracortical inhibitory process assess measure amount ICI train muscle ( first dorsal interosseus : FDI adductor digit minimi : ADM ) non-trained muscle ( opponens pollicis brevis : OPB ) .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Normal volunteer ( age 18 40 year ) willing participate participate yet protocol use serial reaction time task ( SRRT ) piano player . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects current use history alcohol drug abuse , psychiatric disorder require hospitalization prolong treatment , head injury loss consciousness , epilepsy , neurological disease . Subjects receive drug act primarily central nervous system . The following exclusion criterion due use trans cranial magnetic stimulation : Subjects cardiac pacemaker , intracardiac line , implant medication pump . Subjects eye , blood vessel , cochlear , eye implant , subject increase intracranial pressure evaluate clinical mean , subject metal cranium except mouth , subject dental brace , metal fragment occupational exposure surgical clip near brain . Since protocol utilizes pair pulse stimulation , reason exclude pregnant woman . However , woman last trim pregnancy study likely uncomfortable three hour train .</criteria>
