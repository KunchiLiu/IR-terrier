	<brief_title>Safety Effectiveness Administering HIV Vaccine Groin Versus Arm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV commonly transmit via mucosal surface . The mucosal line potential site humoral cellular protection activity B lymphocytes , activate memory T lymphocytes , secretory IgA , antigen present cell . In addition systemic immunity , preventive HIV vaccine induce immune response mucosal surface portal HIV entry body . Targeted lymph node immunization involve vaccine injection subcutaneous tissue near lymph node . This strategy proven effective simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) /rhesus macaque model . The iliac inguinal lymph node groin primary drain lymph node genitourinary rectal tract . This study evaluate compare safety immunogenicity ALVAC-HIV ( vCP205 ) administer subcutaneously groin intramuscularly deltoid region . ALVAC-HIV ( vCP205 ) canarypox virus vector vaccine express portion gp120 , Gag , Pol gene . Participants study randomly assign receive vaccine placebo injection groin area upper arm . All participant three baseline visit blood test sigmoidoscopy measure baseline immune function . After visit , participant receive weekly injection 4 week . Groin injection give subcutaneously ( skin ) upper arm injection give intramuscularly ( muscle ) . Participants follow-up visit 5 11 month last immunization . Participants blood draws sigmoidoscopy receive HIV risk reduction counsel throughout study . Total length participation approximately 14 month . Participants may continue contact study HIV test study-related concern 1 year study participation .</detailed_description>
