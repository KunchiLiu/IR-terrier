	<brief_title>A Study Safety Effectiveness Infliximab ( Remicade ) Patients With Giant Cell Arteritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study see infliximab safe effective treating GCA . Currently , treatment GCA prednisone . GCA long lasting inflammatory disease . The cause unknown . It may affect artery , focus big vessel around heart , vessel neck head , major branch . It lead vision loss , blindness , stroke , stenosis ( narrow blood vessel ) aneurysms ( weaken line blood vessel wall , may eventually lead rupture blood vessel ) . The damage artery cause immune response . A naturally occur substance immune system call `` tumor necrosis factor alpha '' ( TNFa ) play significant role immune response blood vessel . This response think cause long-lasting inflammation ( irritation swell vessel ) . By block effect TNFa think may reduce sign symptom associate GCA . This trial study patient stable prednisone treatment evaluate whether infliximab control symptom dose prednisone reduce . Patients receive infusion either 5mg/kg infliximab placebo week 0 , 2 , 6 , 14 , 22 , 30 , 38 , 46 . Safety evaluation perform specify interval throughout study consist laboratory test , vital sign ( blood pressure ) , physical examination occurrence severity adverse event well study specific procedure . Patients receive receive infusion either 5mg/kg infliximab placebo infusion week 0 , 2 , 6 , 14 , 22 , 30 , 38 , 46 .</detailed_description>
