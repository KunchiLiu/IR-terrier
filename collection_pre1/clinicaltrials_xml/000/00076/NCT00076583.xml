	<brief_summary>This study test spinal cord reflex call reciprocal inhibition , , learn motor skill see reflex becomes strong learning movement . People learn new motor skill throughout life . At first , perform new skilled movement rid bicycle take effort clumsy , practice , become relatively automatic . The motor cortex ( part brain ) active new skilled movement learn , become less active movement over-learned . This study determine whether spinal cord help coordinate pattern activity group muscle motor skill learn . Healthy volunteer 21 65 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history neurological examination . Participants divide two group . Group 1 movement training session Group 2 movement training session physiology session , follow : Movement training session For 15 minute every weekday , participant practice move wrist back forth make cursor computer screen follow target . Activity arm muscle monitor surface electrode tap skin . The session continue participant perform movement well . Group 1 participant return clinic week last session perform movement see skill level change . Each session last 20 30 minute . Physiology session In three separate session , reflex reciprocal inhibition measure several time movement task . This do nerve conduction study . A probe place skin delivers low-intensity electrical stimulus . Wires taped skin record nerve impulse . To measure reciprocal inhibition , several dozen stimulus give two nerve combination . Each session last 2 3 hour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Once skilled movement thoroughly learn , perform relatively automatically . The motor cortex active learn new motor skill , become less activated skill become over-learned . We hypothesize learn skilled movement associate efficient use subcortical motor circuit . Subcortical motor circuit coordinate feature intend movement timing pattern activation different muscle . The goal study determine whether learn motor skill strengthen spinal interneuron circuit facilitate movement . Subjects learn perform movement consist alternate wrist movement . The strength reciprocal inhibition antagonist muscle test . Study Population : 22 healthy adult volunteer Design : The study two experiment . Both experiment use within-subjects design . The purpose first experiment determine whether learn accurately perform alternate wrist flexion extension movement task associate reduce co-contraction wrist flexor extensor muscle . Subjects practice make accurate wrist flexion extension keep cursor target fifteen-minute session every weekday able obtain 95 % accuracy . Activity arm muscle monitor session surface electrode arm muscle . The first experiment also determine best training parameter learn task . In second experiment , second group subject learn task use best training parameter . The strength reflex reciprocal inhibition measure , train . Reciprocal inhibition also measure movement become highly learned . Outcome measure : In first experiment , outcome percent movement time co-contraction occurs , record surface electrode , subject learn perform movement 95 % accuracy . In second experiment , outcome measure strength spinally mediate reciprocal inhibition , measure use reflex .</detailed_description>
