	<brief_summary>This study examine new approach treat patient severe systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) involve collect stem cell ( cell produce bone marrow develop blood cell ) patient , completely shut patient 's immune system , give back patient 's stem cell . SLE chronic , inflammatory disorder immune system affect many organ . It call autoimmune disease patient 's lymphocyte ( white blood cell normally protect invade organism ) , go control attack body 's tissue . Patients 15 40 year age severe SLE affect major organ resistant standard treatment may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood urine test , skin tuberculin test , radiology study evaluate extent disease . They endocrinology , nutrition , dental , social work consultation , ultrasound MUGA ( multi-gated acquisition scan ) scan heart imaging , electrocardiogram lung function test , bone marrow biopsy , lymph node aspirate . Depending organ affect , patient may additional test , lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) , kidney lung biopsy , MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) brain spinal cord , PET ( positron emission tomography ) scan . They also complete quality life questionnaire disability functional test neurocognitive ( think ) assessment . Participants central venous line ( plastic tube ) insert neck chest vein administer stem cell medicine draw blood . They undergo seven apheresis procedure course study collect stem cell transplant research . For apheresis , whole blood collect needle arm vein direct cell-separating machine white cell extract rest blood return patient needle . Patients prim three medication ( methylprednisolone , rituximab , cyclophosphamide ) central line help control disease . In addition , medication call G-CSF ( growth colony stimulate factor ) inject skin several day boost production stem cell . After enough stem cell collect transplantation ( infusion central line ) , patient admit hospital 8-day conditioning regimen follow transplantation . The conditioning treatment consist rituximab , fludarabine , cyclophosphamide eliminate white blood cell blood bone marrow . The stem cell infused patient closely monitor team physician nurse . When stem cell engraft , bone marrow recover , patient feel well enough - usually 2 3 week transplant - patient discharge hospital . Prednisone taper begin soon feasibly possible , later 28 day transplant . Patients return National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Clinical Center frequent follow-up visit first 2 3 month follow transplant . The time visit extend every 3 month first year , every 6 month second year , least yearly 5 year transplant . These visit include physical examination , blood urine test , lumbar puncture ( central nervous system involvement ) , appropriate biopsy test need monitor patient 's health , short apheresis procedure collect blood research purpose , quality life questionnaire . Some select procedure optional . Bone marrow biopsy lymph node aspirate do begin 6 , 12 , 24 month transplant . PET scan do 1 , 6 , 12 , 24 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lymphocyte Depletion Stem Cell Transplantation Treat Severe Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) systemic autoimmune disease involve almost organ range severity mild life-threatening . In spite significant improvement survival SLE patient last 20 year , small significant portion patient still develop progressive therapy-refractory disease impairs organ function overall survival . - Since 1996 , 500 patient treat worldwide pilot trial autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( autoHSCT ) autoimmune disease , include 80 patient SLE . - The rationale autoHSCT autoimmune disease ablate autoreactive immune effector allow reconstitution new self-tolerant immune system hematopoietic stem cell . Studies demonstrate acceptable safety promise short term efficacy high-dose cyclophosphamide-based ( 200 mg/kg ) autoHSCT 60 % patient advanced refractory SLE reacquisition sensitivity conventional drug demonstrate many case . However , trial design address primary endpoint safety inadequate assess disease response . -Numerous question true efficacy autoHSCT , optimal transplant regimen , patient selection mechanism action remain unaddressed . Objectives : - The primary objective ass rate continuous relapse-free complete clinical response 24 month post-transplant , statistical power 84 % detect , great 70 percent patient meet primary endpoint . - The long-term goal research develop basis future transplant protocol would incorporate new cellular immunotherapeutic intervention improve result transplant ultimate goal cure SLE . Eligibility : -Subjects age 15-40 year fulfill least 4 11 criterion SLE define American College Rheumatology -Have severe active lupus , refractory immunosuppressive therapy . Included subject nephritis , central nervous system ( CNS ) lupus , pulmonary lupus hematologic disease Design : - Fourteen patient active standard dose cyclophosphamide-resistant SLE enrol phase II pilot study . - Study design intend improve efficacy autoHSCT . A lymphoablative conditioning regimen ( rituximab , fludarabine cyclophosphamide ) explore first time autoimmune disease . - The treatment schedule consist two part ; prim regimen prior stem cell mobilization collection , condition regimen transplant . - In contrast study , study precisely define eligibility disease response criterion strict schema taper immunosuppression allow accurate interpretation treatment result . - The study include carefully choose battery laboratory research study design investigate SLE biology mechanism post-transplant response .</detailed_description>
