	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Age : great equal 3 year Less equal 21 year age . Required body surface area ( BSA ) : great equal 0.31 m^2 . 2 . Diagnosis : Patients NF1 progressive plexiform neurofibromas potential cause significant morbidity , ( limit ) head neck lesion could compromise airway great vessel , brachial lumbar plexus lesion could cause nerve compression loss function , lesion could result major deformity ( e.g. , orbital lesion ) significant cosmetic problem , lesion extremity cause limb hypertrophy loss function , painful lesion . Histologic confirmation tumor necessary presence consistent clinical radiographic finding , consider malignant degeneration plexiform neurofibroma clinically suspect . In addition plexiform neurofibroma ( ) , study subject must least one diagnostic criterion NF1 list ( National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Consensus Conference ) : 1 . Six cafeaulait spot ( great equal 0.5 cm prepubertal subject great equal 1.5 cm postpubertal subject ) 2 . Freckling axilla groin 3 . Optic glioma 4 . Two Lisch nodule 5 . A distinctive bony lesion ( dysplasia sphenoid bone dysplasia thin long bone cortex ) 6 . A firstdegree relative NF1 In study plexiform neurofibroma define neurofibroma grow along length nerve may involve multiple fascicle branch . A spinal plexiform neurofibroma involve two level connection level extend laterally along nerve . 3 . Measurable disease : Patients must measurable plexiform neurofibroma ( ) . For purpose study measurable lesion define lesion least 3 cm measure one dimension . There must evidence recurrent progressive disease document increase size presence new plexiform neurofibroma MRI . Progression time study entry define : A . A measurable increase plexiform neurofibroma ( great equal 20 % increase volume , great equal 13 % increase product two long perpendicular diameter , great equal 6 % increase long diameter ) last two consecutive scan ( magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) compute tomography ( CT ) , time period approximately one year prior evaluation study . B . Patients underwent surgery progressive plexiform neurofibroma eligible enter study surgery , provide plexiform neurofibroma incompletely resect measurable . 4 . Prior therapy : Patients NFI eligible time recurrence progression inoperable plexiform neurofibroma . Patients eligible complete tumor resection feasible , patient surgical option refuse surgery . Since standard effective chemotherapy patient NF1 progressive plexiform neurofibroma , patient may treat trial without receive prior medical therapy . Patients receive prior medical treatment plexiform neurofibroma ( ) must recover toxic effect prior therapy enter study . The Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE3 ) Version 3.0 use toxicity assessment . A copy CTCAE version 3.0 download CTEP home page ( http : // ctep.cancer.gov ) . Recovery define toxicity grade le 2 , unless otherwise specify Inclusion Exclusion Criteria . Patients must last dose radiation therapy least six week prior study entry , last dose chemotherapy least four week prior study entry . Patients receive GCSF prior cycle chemotherapy must GCSF least one week prior enter study . 5 . Performance Status : Performance Status : Patients life expectancy least 12 month . Patients great 10 year must Karnofsky performance level great equal 50 , child less equal 10 year must Lansky performance level great equal 50 . Patients wheelchair bound paralysis consider ambulatory wheel chair . 6 . Hematologic Function : Patients must absolute granulocyte count great equal 1,500/uL , hemoglobin great equal 9.0 gm/dl , platelet count great equal 150,000/microliter study entry ( transfusion independent ) . 7 . Hepatic Function : Patients must bilirubin within normal limit serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) less equal 2x upper limit normal . Patients Gilbert syndrome exclude requirement normal bilirubin . ( Gilbert syndrome find 310 % general population , characterize mild , chronic unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia absence liver disease overt hemolysis ) . 8 . Renal Function : Patients must ageadjusted normal serum creatinine ( see table ) OR creatinine clearance great equal 70 mL/min/1.73 m^2 . Age Maximum Serum Creatinine ( year ) ( mg/dl ) less equal 5 0.8 5 less age less equal 10 1.0 10 less age less equal 15 1.2 great 15 1.5 9 . Informed Consent : All patient legal guardian ( patient less 18 year old ) must sign Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approve document inform consent ( screen protocol ) prior perform study determine patient eligibility . After confirmation patient eligibility patient legal guardian must sign protocol specific inform consent document understand investigational nature risk study protocol relate study perform ( study perform determine patient eligibility ) . When appropriate , pediatric patient include discussion . Age appropriate assent form child 7 12 year , child 13 17 year develop sign pediatric patient , appropriate , order obtain write assent . 10 . Durable Power Attorney ( DPA ) : All patient great equal 18 year age offer opportunity assign DPA another person make decision medical care become incapacitated cognitively impaired . 11 . Patients must able take pirfenidone mouth . Capsules open content mixed food easy consumption small child . 12 . Patients ( male female ) must willing practice birth control ( include abstinence ) two month treatment , childbearing age . For purpose protocol , patient great 9 year age show pubertal development consider childbearing age . 13 . Ability undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) contraindication MRI examination follow MRI protocol outline . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Pregnant breast feeding female exclude , toxic effect pharmacology pirfenidone fetus newborn unknown . 2 . Clinically significant unrelated systemic illness ( serious infection significant cardiac , pulmonary , hepatic organ dysfunction ) , judgment Principal Associate Investigator would compromise patient 's ability tolerate pirfenidone likely interfere study procedure result . 3 . An investigational agent within past 30 day . 4 . Ongoing radiation therapy , chemotherapy , hormonal therapy direct tumor , immunotherapy , biologic therapy ( example interferon ) . 5 . Inability return followup visit obtain followup study require assess toxicity response therapy . 6 . Prior treatment pirfenidone . 7 . Evidence optic glioma , malignant glioma , malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor , cancer require treatment chemotherapy radiation therapy</criteria>
