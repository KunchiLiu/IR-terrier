	<brief_title>The Effect Fish Oil Plus Fenofibrate Triglyceride Levels People Taking Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ( HAART )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) decrease morbidity mortality cause HIV infection , use associate lipid abnormality , particularly elevation serum triglyceride . Hypertriglyceridemia risk factor development cardiovascular cerebrovascular disease well pancreatitis . Lipid-lowering drug call fibrates part recommend treatment elevate triglyceride , response fibrates incomplete large proportion people . Fish oil capsule contain large amount omega-3 fatty acid show decrease serum triglyceride . However , fish oil supplement fibrates alone often inadequate treat hypertriglyceridemia people take HAART . This study determine whether combination two therapy low serum triglyceride people HAART effectively either therapy alone . This study comprise two step . In Step I , participant randomly assign receive either fish oil supplement fenofibrate . Participants evaluate treatment response Week 8 . Those respond treatment remain original single agent therapy Week 18 . Those respond treatment Week 10 move Step 2 begin combination therapy fenofibrate fish oil Week 18 . All participant return Week 22 follow-up visit . Except Week 10 visit , participant expect fast prior study visit . Participants remain individual HAART regimens duration study .</detailed_description>
