	<brief_summary>This study use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) examine area brain involve perform certain cognitive task . MRI use strong magnetic field radio wave produce image body tissue organ provide information structure function tissue . Healthy normal volunteer 21 40 year age may eligible study . Candidates must native English speaker must right-handed . They must history nervous system disease psychiatric disorder . Candidates screen questionnaire neurological examination . Participants undergo functional MRI scanning . For procedure , subject lie stretcher move scanner - metal cylinder surround strong magnetic field . During scan , ask make various decision whether word relate . Two word present visually , separate variable time delay . The subject read word , decides quickly accurately possible whether two word relate , indicate answer press button . The test take 2 hour . When complete , subject completes write questionnaire concern experience scanner .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective . The purpose protocol extend structured event complex ( SEC ) model develop principal investigator . Grafman ( Grafman , 1995 ) propose action sequence represent form SECs human prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) . An SEC goal-oriented set event sequentially structure represent thematic knowledge , moral , abstraction , concept , social rule , event feature , event boundary , grammar . There temporal semantic associative relation subcomponents SEC knowledge . We investigate hypothesis regard role different region within PFC process associative relation . We also investigate SECs differ psychological dimension temporal duration , complexity , familiarity represent activated PFC . We examine temporal semantic organization SEC subcomponents investigate goal outcome structure event knowledge represent activated PFC . Further , investigate temporal location event within SECs represent activated PFC . We also investigate goal outcomes specify temporal order duration SEC subcomponents process within PFC . Additional objective ( 1 ) investigate neural representation human emotion decision-making base utility estimation ; ( 2 ) investigate relationship cognitive neural substrate moral emotion judgment ( Moll et al. , 2002a ; Moll et al. , 2002b ) SEC model develop principal investigator ( Grafman , 1995 ) ; ( 3 ) probe new construct cognitive dimension incorporate critical explanatory variable social cognition moral emotion social event knowledge . Study Population . In nineteen separate study , healthy , normal adult volunteer participate experiment deal different kind associative relation SECs use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . Design . The experiment conduct employ within-subject , rapid event-related fMRI design determine whether different type SEC associative type relation store dissociable network PFC . In nineteen experiment ; hope automatically activate lexical , event-based temporally-based associative type relation SECs . Outcome Measures . The data collect consist accuracy response time measure cognitive performance reflect automatic prim associative relation fMRI activation image correspond kind associative relation , accuracy response time measure cognitive performance reflect temporal duration , complexity , familiarity represent activate . Experiments 10 11 also record donation choice make subject . The result gain protocol provide evidence modifying , support , reject aspect SEC model , provide evidence modifying , support , reject aspect framework social cognition moral behavior social event knowledge .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : In study , subject consist healthy , native Englishspeaking , righthanded volunteer , measure Edinburgh Handedness Inventory . Subjects range age 21 40 year old include regardless race gender . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Nonnative English speaker nonright handers exclude mention , nonneurologically normal volunteer . Subjects young 21 old 40 exclude . A pregnancy test employ woman childbearing age . The result must negative order proceed MRI . Subjects follow : aneurysm clip ; implant neural stimulator ; implant cardiac pacemaker autodefibrillator ; cochlear implant ; ocular foreign body , e.g . metal shaving ; permanent eyeliner ; insulin pump ; irremovable body pierce exclude study due possible dangerous effect magnet upon metal object body . Subjects take central nervous system active medication exclude .</criteria>
