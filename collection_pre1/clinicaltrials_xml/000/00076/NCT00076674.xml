	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect levetiracetam ( Keppra ( Trademark ) Parkinson 's disease symptom dyskinesias ( involuntary movement ) develop result long-term treatment levodopa . Levetiracetam block certain protein receptor brain cell thus change spread brain signal believe affected patient Parkinson 's disease . Patients 30 80 year age relatively advance Parkinson 's disease dyskinesia due levodopa therapy may eligible 6-week study . Screening baseline evaluation - Participants evaluate medical history , physical examination neurologic evaluation , blood test , urinalysis , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , 24-hour holter monitor ( heart monitoring ) , cardiology consultation . A chest x-ray MRI CT scan brain do need . If possible , patient stop take antiparkinsonian medication except levodopa ( Sinemet ) one month ( 2 month take Selegiline ) study begin throughout duration . ( If necessary , patient may use short-acting agent , Mirapex , Requip Amantadine . ) Dose-finding phase - Patients admit NIH Clinical Center 2 3 day levodopa `` dose-finding '' procedure . For test , patient stop take Sinemet instead levodopa infused vein . During infusion , drug dose increase slowly parkinsonian symptom improve unacceptable side effect occur maximum study dose reach . Symptoms monitor frequently . ( Patients dose infusion last 3 month undergo phase study . ) Active study phase - Patients randomly assign take levetiracetam placebo ( `` sugar pill '' ) twice day 6 week . At end week 1 , 2 4 , 5 , patient come clinic blood test , EKG , review adverse side effect . At end week 3 6 , patient hospitalize study response treatment . They stop take Sinemet selegiline ability perform motor task evaluate . They place L-dopa infusion 10 hour . Placebo may infuse various time instead L-dopa . Motor symptom evaluate several time infusion . Blood drawn infusion research study . Lumbar puncture - Patients undergo lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) end week 1 4 measure certain brain chemical drug level . For test , local anesthetic give needle inserted space vertebra low back . About 2 tablespoon fluid collect needle . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) - Patients change disease activity may undergo MRIs baseline , end week 1 end study show change brain . The patient lie narrow cylinder ( scanner ) use radio wave magnetic field produce image brain , show structural chemical change . Follow-up - 2 week study end , patient contact phone review side effect return clinic evaluation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Levetiracetam Treatment L-dopa Induced Dyskinesias</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Parkinson 's disease progressive degenerative disease unknown etiology . Its treatment symptomatic successful approach replace miss dopamine administration precursor levodopa . As disease progress usefulness approach gradually diminish motor complication become source significant disability . Although number pharmacological strategy attempt improve situation , none yet prove fully satisfactory . The mechanism levetiracetam exert beneficial effect unknown . Recently , PD monkey model levetiracetam find moderate dyskinesia motor complication , possibly due effect striatal GABAergic transmission . Objective : To evaluate acute ability levetiracetam safely ameliorate dopaminomimetic-treatment-associated dyskinesia relate motor complication parkinsonian patient without compromise antiparkinsonian response . Study Population : 22 moderately advanced parkinsonian patient enrol randomize , placebo control , double-blind proof-of-principle study . Levetiracetam efficacy assess use validate motor function scale . Safety monitor mean frequent clinical evaluation laboratory test . Anticipated Risks Benefits : The potential risk associate study amount minor increase minimal risk primarily associate adverse reaction medication involve . Levetiracetam market drug wide margin safety . Patients receive drug could benefit improvement symptom , placebo also medication adjust , lead improve quality life . Outcome Estimate Potential Meaning Field : This study understand mechanism contribute motor disability patient PD may lead development improve therapeutic intervention disorder associate motor response complication .</detailed_description>
