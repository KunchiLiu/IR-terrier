	<brief_title>NINDS Parkinson 's Disease Neuroprotection Trial CoQ10 GPI 1485</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) affect nearly million Americans , number increase come decade population age . While available medical therapy usually effective control symptoms initial year follow diagnosis , high dose multiple agent required time , increase side effect incomplete control symptom . Although treatment dramatically improve life patient PD initially , address underlying cause disease inevitable disease progression . This multi-center , randomize , double-blind trial involve 42 trial center United States Canada , enroll 195 people PD . The primary objective neuroprotection trial identify agent capable slow progression PD . In trial , investigator assess impact CoQ10 , antioxidant , GPI 1485 , novel immunophilin compound , progression PD determine futile non-futile proceed study agent . In study , subject early , untreated PD equally randomize one three study arm : 1 . ) group receive active CoQ10 placebo instead GPI 1485 ; 2 . ) group receive active GPI 1485 placebo instead CoQ10 ; 3 . ) group receive placebo instead CoQ10 GPI 1485 . Subjects remain blinded study drug 12 month .</detailed_description>

Presence atypical Parkinson 's syndrome due drug ( e.g. , metoclopramide , flunarazine ) , metabolic identify neurogenetic disorder ( e.g. , Wilson 's disease ) , encephalitis , degenerative disease ( e.g. , progressive supranuclear palsy ) . Use CoQ10 GPI 1485 90 day prior baseline . Use minocycline creatine 90 day prior baseline . Receipt investigational drug within 90 day prior baseline . Presence freezing . Impairment postural reflex ( pull test score &gt; 0 ) . Any clinically significant medical condition ( e.g. , active GI illness , angina , active neoplasm ) laboratory abnormality , would judgment investigator interfere subject ability participate study follow . History stereotaxic brain surgery PD ( e.g. , pallidotomy , deep brain stimulation , fetal tissue implantation ) . Clinically significant structural brain disease investigator believe would interfere study evaluation . Significant psychiatric disorder may interfere comply protocol .
