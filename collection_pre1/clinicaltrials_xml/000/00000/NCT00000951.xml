In addition investigate antifungal treatment relate fluconazole-refractory infection , study evaluate host factor organism-related factor order increase understand pathogenesis oropharyngeal candidiasis fluconazole-refractory infection . Prior randomization long-term management strategy use fluconazole , patient stratify one three group accord baseline CD4+ count ( cells/mm3 ) : 0-49 , 50-100 , 101-150 . Patients without oropharyngeal candidiasis ( thrush present ) enrollment patient respond ( thrush present ) initial acute therapy active infection randomize 1:1 one two management strategy fluconazole : Arm A ( episodic therapy ) Arm B ( chronic suppressive therapy continuous fluconazole ) . Patients follow duration 24 month enrollment last subject .
