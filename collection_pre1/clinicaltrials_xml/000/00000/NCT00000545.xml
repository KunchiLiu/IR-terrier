The intervention last three year . A single cohort child progress third , fourth , fifth grade . Schools unit randomization . Forty-one school four center stratify within field center median percent body fat ( PBF ) end second grade use data baseline measurement . Schools within field center rank median PBF . Once stratify , coordinate center randomly assign half school within stratum intervention ( 21 ) half control ( 20 ) . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
