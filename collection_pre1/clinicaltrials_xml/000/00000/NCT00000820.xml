	<brief_summary>PRIMARY : To examine effect aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) viral activity blood . To determine safety low-dose IL-2 combination antiretroviral therapy versus antiretroviral therapy alone . SECONDARY : To examine delay type hypersensitivity responses skin test antigens antibody response protein polysaccharide vaccine . The profound immune impairment result HIV-1 infection due , least part , loss CD4+ T cell cytokine cell secrete , especially IL-2 interferon-gamma . Antiretroviral agent directly address problem immune impairment . Replacement IL-2 nontoxic dos may prevent delay clinical immunosuppression attendant opportunistic infection . Also , since patient HIV-1 infection respond suboptimally routine protein polysaccharide immunization , IL-2 may provide adjuvant effect vaccine response .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The profound immune impairment result HIV-1 infection due , least part , loss CD4+ T cell cytokine cell secrete , especially IL-2 interferon-gamma . Antiretroviral agent directly address problem immune impairment . Replacement IL-2 nontoxic dos may prevent delay clinical immunosuppression attendant opportunistic infection . Also , since patient HIV-1 infection respond suboptimally routine protein polysaccharide immunization , IL-2 may provide adjuvant effect vaccine response . Patients randomize initially receive antiretroviral therapy alone combination IL-2 24 week , group cross treatment assignment ( i.e. , IL-2 either add deleted regimen ) additional 24 week . Patients vaccine eligible receive influenza , tetanus diphtheria toxoid , meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine week 4 , receive pneumococcal vaccine prior study entry receive week 8 .</detailed_description>
