	<brief_title>Thalassemia ( Cooley 's Anemia ) Clinical Research Network ( TCRN )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Cooley 's anemia ( beta-thalassemia major , hereafter refer thalassemia ) severe , inherit blood disorder characterize quantitative defect synthesis beta chain hemoglobin cause 1 100 known mutation around beta globin gene cluster . The disease characterize severe anemia begin first 6 12 month life . If untreated , life expectancy le 5 year age . Chronic red blood cell transfusion maintain hemoglobin level 9 11 gm/dl ( `` hypertransfusion '' ) alleviate anemia partially suppress erythropoiesis . The regular administration red blood cell also improve growth , delay prevents enlargement liver spleen , prevents development bone abnormality cause fracture well disfigure change know Cooley 's facies . Transfusions carry risk alloimmunization , iron overload , blood-transmitted infection . In absence effective iron chelation therapy , iron overload lead numerous complication , include delay absent sexual development , diabetes mellitus , cirrhosis , cardiac arrhythmia , congestive heart failure . Nonchelated poorly chelate patient usually die heart disease 20 30 year age . The addition chelation therapy deferoxamine ( DFO ) treatment Cooley 's anemia dramatically improve outcome affect patient . With regular chelation therapy , accumulation excessive iron prevent . Studies demonstrate well-chelated patient normal modest increase liver iron , improved growth , sexual development , importantly , markedly reduce chance develop iron-induced heart disease . In past year , several new approach treatment thalassemia include marrow stem cell transplantation ; use young red blood cell ( `` neocytes '' ) transfusion ; maintenance high pretransfusion hemoglobin level ; new iron chelators ; use drug hydroxyurea , erythropoietin , butyrate compound . It recognize even clinical network , number patient Cooley 's anemia enrol research protocol likely small . Therefore , although randomize clinical trial may prefer way assess clinical benefit new therapy , may feasible instance , even use biomarkers surrogate outcome measure . Depending upon specific question address , study design might appropriate . These might include pre- post-treatment assessment historical control study . In case , propose design , include sample size , would evaluate Protocol Review Committee . There urgent need evaluate new exist therapeutic approach person thalassemia disseminate finding health care professional , patient , public . There several reason thalassemia clinical research network accelerate clinical research meet need . The highly variable sometimes complicate clinical manifestation thalassemia often make difficult accumulate large number comparable patient one center . Furthermore , uniformity treatment protocol may reduce number patient need clinical center . Also , TCRN mechanism help pool necessary clinical expertise administrative resource facilitate conduct multiple novel therapeutic trial timely , efficient manner . This , turn , would promote rapid dissemination research find health care professional . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The network originally fund 2000 extend June 2010 perform interventional clinical trial key area thalassemia care . Two major trial propose : First , randomize , control trial examine effect DFO alone versus DFO plus deferiprone cardiac disease due transfusional iron overload ; second , randomized trial arginine versus sildenafil pulmonary hypertension , important problem thalassemia intermedia hemolytic state . Goals provide infrastructure development , launch , prompt completion small , innovative trial thalassemia improve assessment phenotype clinical outcome thalassemia facilitate current future clinical trial . This accomplish two study : The Thalassemia Longitudinal Cohort ( TLC ) study Iron Burden Study , detail study iron-related organ damage compare measure iron burden heart , liver , pancreas outcomes iron-related organ dysfunction . Combined clinical trial ability perform detail genotype/phenotype correlation , improve phenotype outcome measure powerful tool enhance knowledge thalassemia clinical care .
