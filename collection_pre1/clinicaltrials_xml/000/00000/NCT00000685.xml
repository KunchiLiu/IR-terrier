	<detailed_description>AZT antiviral agent demonstrate effectiveness patient severe HIV infection . Persons HIV infection may additional health problem , one diseased kidney due infection kidney , side effect therapy . The benefit risk AZT patient diseased kidney unknown . It hop study allow understand metabolism excretion AZT patient kidney disease . AZT pharmacokinetics study patient mild , moderate , severe renal disorder . Patients receive AZT mouth first day . After take AZT , blood sample take catheter several urine sample collect 24-hour period . During time , patient remain hospital 24 hour may choose go home 12 hour take AZT dose return last blood sample next morning . Following study day 1 , patient receive AZT every 4 hour , include middle night , keep diary time take AZT , well use medication , tobacco , alcohol . A return appointment make 8-15 day later . On day , patient receive AZT mouth , blood test urine sample take . Patients receive hemodialysis participate 1 additional day pharmacokinetic study arrange one hemodialysis session . Patients Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis ( CAPD ) study separately participate procedure group . AZT give single oral dose begin first morning exchange follow pharmacokinetic study . Chronic AZT dose initiate follow first exchange . After minimum 7 day AZT therapy maximum 14 day last dose AZT administer repeat pharmacokinetic study do . All patient see 1-2 week complete last pharmacokinetic study .</detailed_description>
