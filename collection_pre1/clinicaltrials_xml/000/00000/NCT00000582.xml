Treatment patient severe inhibitor consequent bleeding remain problem . Management include protracted treatment Factor VIII , use immunosuppressive agent prothrombin complex ( Factor IX ) concentrate . The rationale Factor IX bypass defect Factor VIII cause inhibitor . This method therapy attract wide popularity , success greatly debate . It intend outset Factor VIII study therapeutic trial involve patient inhibitor would prime function , study would monitor necessary . A controlled trial Factor IX concentrate therapy strongly advise DBDR Advisory Committee . Accordingly , fiscal year 1978 , protocol double-blind control study develop Factor VIII inhibitor group . The trial begin spring 1978 , intervention terminate one year later . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Double-blind study ; patient serve control . A total 51 patient receive single large dose Konyne , Proplex , dilute albumin ( control ) . Joint bleeding elbow , knee , ankle evaluate six hour dose .</detailed_description>
