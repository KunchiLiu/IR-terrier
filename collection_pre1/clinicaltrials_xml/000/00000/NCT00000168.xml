	<brief_title>Longitudinal Study Ocular Complications AIDS ( LSOCA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ocular abnormality patient AIDS first report 1982 . The common finding non-infectious `` HIV retinopathy '' , characterize cotton wool spot , intraretinal hemorrhage , and/or microaneurysms . These change occur approximately 50 percent patient AIDS . HIV retinopathy alone typically associated clinical loss vision , functional deficit patient AIDS without ocular complication may due phenomenon . CMV retinitis clinical importance associate complication AIDS . It commonly see late stage AIDS , even treat potential cause substantial loss vision . CMV retinitis also costly AIDS-related opportunistic infection ; mean monthly cost treatment estimate $ 7,825 . The incidence CMV retinitis vary change therapeutic prophylactic strategy AIDS complication . It decline recent year relate increase use highly active anti-retroviral therapy ( HAART ) . Other ocular complication AIDS ocular toxoplasmosis , herpes zoster retinitis , pneumocystis choroidopathy occur less frequently CMV retinitis HIV retinopathy . Their frequency also change course AIDS epidemic . Because epidemiology AIDS rapidly evolve , HIV become like chronic disease , new information need incidence course ocular complication . We little information effect HAART therapy time change immune status risk ocular complication AIDS . More information also need determine risk develop ocular complication AIDS , treatment affect visual function , quality life , survival . The Longitudinal Study Ocular Complications AIDS ( LSOCA ) prospective observational study patient AIDS . Patients prior diagnosis AIDS accord 1993 Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) criterion without ocular complication enrol 4 year period . Approximately 2,000 patient enrol study . Enrollment patient CMV retinitis baseline 300 600 patient . Followup visit patient without ocular complication schedule every 6 month . Followup visit patient ocular complication baseline diagnose followup every 3 month . Followup data include eye examination , fundus photograph , visual function testing , medical history , hematology serum chemistry , collection plasma blood cell banking . Analysis bank specimen include HIV RNA level CMV DNA level .</detailed_description>
