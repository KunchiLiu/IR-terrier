	<brief_title>Trial Reduce Alloimmunization Platelets ( TRAP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Between 1971 1980 , 598 percent increase use platelet concentrate 0.41 million 2.86 million annually . In contrast , red cell transfusion United States rise concurrently 6.3 million annually 9.9 million , increase 58 percent . Although red cell transfusion level even decrease slightly past several year , use platelet continue increase rate least 5 10 percent year . This dramatic continued increase use platelet concentrate largely result treat thrombocytopenic cancer patient . In addition , open heart surgery patient others give massive transfusion also receive substantial platelet support . Nevertheless , chronically transfuse thrombocytopenic patient frequently develop platelet alloimmunization account large percentage increase demand platelet . A recent survey large transfusion service indicate 8 percent patient receive 35 percent random-donor pool platelet concentrate . Although alloimmunized patient support HLA-matched , apheresis-donor platelet , suitably match donor available sufficient number every patient . Thus , platelet transfusion program could prevent , least delay platelet alloimmunization would substantial benefit . Limited study suggest several approach may reduce prevent platelet alloimmunization : reduce number foreign antigens recipient expose provide single donor platelet apheresis product ; provide leukocyte-poor blood product ; inactivate donor antigen present cell ( APC 's ) , type lymphocyte contain within transfuse platelet product , ultraviolet ( UV ) irradiation platelet concentrate . The initiative recommend Blood Diseases Resources Advisory Committee May 1987 approve National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council September 1987 . The Requests Applications release June 1988 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , double-blind . There three treatment arm one control arm . Patients treatment arm receive either leukocyte-poor filter pooled random donor platelet , ultraviolet irradiate pooled random donor platelet , leukocyte-poor filter single donor apheresis platelet . Patients control group receive routinely pool , random-donor platelet . Patients remain assigned treatment transfusion eight week . Assigned transfusion discontinue event severe adverse reaction platelet transfusion , granulocyte transfusion , bone marrow transplant , withdrawal informed consent , death . Pre- post transfusion count obtain platelet transfusion . Each patient follow one year . Recruitment continue March 1995 . Data analysis end July 1997 . The study completion date list record obtain `` Completed Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System .</detailed_description>
