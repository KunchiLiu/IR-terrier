	<brief_title>The Anti-HIV Effects Saquinavir Soft Gelatin Capsules Versus Indinavir Patients Who Have Used Saquinavir Hard Gelatin Capsules One Year</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Resistance anti-HIV agent occurs increase duration use . In vitro study show cross-resistance occurs among protease inhibitor , although clinical trial conduct examine antiretroviral activity sequential use protease inhibitor determine whether saquinavir resistance overcome high concentration drug . Patients currently receive hard capsule saquinavir randomize continue receive hard capsule saquinavir switch soft gelatin capsule saquinavir indinavir . At week 8 , patient receive hard capsule formulation switch open-label indinavir week 8-24 . Patients two arm remain assigned regimen entire 24 week unless virologic response week 8 , case crossed-over open-label therapy alternative drug ( i.e. , either soft gelatin capsule saquinavir indinavir ) . AS PER AMENDMENT 12/23/96 : Viral RNA week 16 24 assayed batch week 24 . Patients exhibit antiviral response base assay allow continue current drug assignment total 12 month . AS PER AMENDMENT 5/7/97 : Based interim analysis perform 72 patient complete 8 week therapy , study close March 7 , 1997 . Patients currently enrol may stop participation trial seek anti-retroviral therapy may continue study . Patients hard capsule saquinavir remain study switch indinavir 8 week . Patients soft gel capsule saquinavir may switch immediately indinavir , result HIV RNA CD4 cell count available , may choose switch indinavir remain soft gel capsule saquinavir . Patients receive indinavir continue agent . Follow-up patient end 7/4/97 .</detailed_description>
