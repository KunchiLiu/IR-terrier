	<brief_summary>The purpose study see change sugar fat level blood patient take anti-HIV therapy many year . Another goal test memory mental concentration determine anti-HIV drug protect brain damage cause HIV . ( The purpose study change original version . ) HIV-infected patient low CD4 cell count risk get opportunistic ( AIDS-related ) infection . CD4 cell cell immune system help fight infection . Anti-HIV therapy may increase CD4 count , may lead decrease AIDS-related infection . Problems anti-HIV therapy associate include metabolic problem , neurologic problem , abnormal opportunistic infection , cancer . Patients ACTG 362 exposed anti-HIV therapy longer large group ACTG . These patient appear benefit therapy , also suffer problem . Observation patient provide information long-term anti-HIV treatment may detect unexpected problem . ( This study change . More information reason conduct study add . )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The currently available data clinical event patient receive potent antiretroviral therapy suggest alteration presentation MAC disease may see rate MAC disease may reduce patient respond antiretroviral therapy . However , extent protection time protection initiation therapy remain unknown . The current study provide validate measure immune restoration clinical data guide prophylaxis decision many patient respond therapy year immune depletion . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 11/16/99 : The low rate MAC ACTG 362 patient average 1 year follow-up suggest prophylaxis specifically MAC disease azithromycin necessary patient experience immune reconstitution . Prolonged follow-up define durability antiretroviral response experience opportunistic condition , neurologic disease , survival , especially whose CD4 count drop 50 cells/mm3 . It also allow assessment level CD4 cell number vulnerability opportunistic infection recur . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 03/18/03 : During extension ACTG 362 , serious complication HAART become well defined , include metabolic complication , neurologic problem , atypical opportunistic infection , malignancy . Patients ACTG 362 exposed HAART longer large group ACTG , appear benefit suffer complication therapy . Continued observation provide estimate expect complication durability long-term potent antiretroviral treatment , may detect unanticipated problem . ] Patients stratified baseline prior use MAC 3 group : prophylaxis , prior azithromycin prophylaxis , MAC prophylaxis . Patients randomize receive azithromycin ( Arm I ) match placebo ( Arm II ) weekly follow every 8 week study closure 18 month ( 72 week ) last patient enrol . Patients develop drop CD4 count 50 cells/mm3 2 measurement least 4 week apart offer open-label azithromycin . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 06/24/98 : Patients remain open-label azithromycin regardless subsequent CD4 count . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 11/16/99 : The phase Version 1.0 Version 2.0 patient receive blinded-study medication refer Step I . The phase Version 1.0 Version 2.0 patient receive open-label azithromycin refer Step 2 . Patients currently open-label azithromycin provide study enter Step 3 discontinue study drug , remain blinded original treatment follow 16-week interval study closure occur April 2002 ( 3 year follow enrollment last study participant ) . Any patient develops drop CD4 count 50 cells/mm3 2 measurement least 4 week apart offer open-label azithromycin . Patients currently receive open-label azithromycin patient Step 3 initiate open-label azithromycin enter Step 4 . ] Patients undergo regular clinical laboratory evaluation include physical examination , CD4 count , viral load . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 11/16/99 : Patients undergo clinical laboratory evaluation every 16 week 160 week include physical examination , CD4 count , viral load well neuropsychologic cardiovascular assessment . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 01/18/01 : All patient enrol study follow April 2002 . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 03/18/02 : All patient currently participate ACTG 362 invite continue follow additional 5 year . Patients currently receive open-label azithromycin enter Step 5 . Patients currently receive open-label azithromycin enter Step 6 , continue receive open-label treatment throughout study . Any patient enters Step 5 develops drop CD4 50 cells/mm3 2 consecutive measurement least 4 week apart offer open-label azithromycin enters Step 6 . Patients assess metabolic , cardiovascular , neurologic complication evaluate opportunistic infection , CD4 count , viral load . Study visit occur 32-week interval study closure . ]</detailed_description>
