	<brief_title>Complications Age-Related Macular Degeneration Prevention Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Complications age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) lead cause severe vision loss among people age 65 United States many Western country . Most , ( approximately 90 percent ) , vision loss due neovascular ( wet ) form AMD . The word neovascular describes development new , abnormal blood vessel back eye . Unfortunately , majority new vessel amenable currently available treatment . The first sign eye may develop AMD presence drusen , yellowish deposit retina . Current data suggest eye large drusen increase risk develop vision threaten complication AMD . Since 1970s investigator report consistently laser photocoagulation cause reduction large drusen . However , result effect laser treatment preventing late complication AMD le consistent base relatively small number patient . Further study ability treatment prevent vision loss advance form AMD would profound public health implication . A treatment could reduce risk develop neovascularization 30 percent might reduce risk blindness AMD one half . The Complications Age-related Macular Degeneration Prevention Trial ( CAPT ) ass whether treat drusen laser photocoagulation reduces risk loss visual acuity . The CAPT multi-center , prospective , randomized clinical trial design assess safety effectiveness low-intensity laser treatment prevent vision loss among patient large drusen eye . A total 1052 participant enrol study . Participants one eye randomly assign laser treatment perform CAPT-certified ophthalmologist . The eye treat . Both eye observe carefully change period five year . The effectiveness treatment assess use follow criterion : Change visual acuity ( primary outcome measure study ) Incidence complication AMD neovascularization , serous detachment pigment epithelium , geographic atrophy Changes contrast threshold critical print size reading Quality life assessment patient , use Visual Function Questionnaire 25 ( VFQ-25 ) , conduct time enrollment 5 year . STUDY RESULTS : Follow-up patient excellent ; le 3 % visual acuity examination miss . At 5 year , 188 ( 20.5 % ) treat eye 188 ( 20.5 % ) observe eye visual acuity score ≥3 line worse initial visit ( p= 1.00 ) . The cumulative 5-year incidence rate treat observed eye CNV 13.3 % 13.3 % ( p=0.95 ) , respectively ; GA 7.4 % 7.8 % ( p=0.64 ) , respectively . The contrast threshold double 23.9 % treated eyes 20.5 % observed eye ( p=0.40 ) . The critical print size double 29.6 % treated eyes 28.4 % observed eye ( p=0.70 ) . Seven ( 0.7 % ) treat eye 14 ( 1.3 % ) observe eyes adverse event ≥6 -line loss visual acuity absence late age-related macular degeneration cataract . As applied CAPT , low intensity laser treatment demonstrate clinically significant benefit vision eye people bilateral large drusen .</detailed_description>
