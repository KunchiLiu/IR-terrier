	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness give healthy volunteer new oral HIV vaccine incorporate bacterial cell . This oral vaccine ( HIV-1 LAI gp120 ) give without different injected HIV vaccine ( HIV-1 MN rgp120 ) . Vaccines preparation introduce body try prevent infection create resistance infection . This study examine new oral vaccine see improve immune system 's ability fight HIV virus give alone another injected vaccine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety Effectiveness HIV-1 LAI gp120 ( HIV Vaccine ) Given With Without HIV-1 MN rgp120 ( Another HIV Vaccine ) HIV-Negative Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although recent advance make antiviral therapy AIDS , cure HIV-1 infection AIDS , drug therapy expensive affected population . The development safe , effective vaccine prevent HIV-1 infection AIDS worldwide global priority . One promise approach development HIV-1 vaccine utilizes live vaccine vector express HIV-1 antigen . The potential advantage live vector approach include ability live vector recombinant induce long-lasting humoral cell-mediated immunity ( particularly neutralize antibody CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell activity ) relatively low cost production . Moreover , live vector recombinant vaccine administer orally might able stimulate production secretory IgA vaccine-specific antibody locally relevant mucosal site . Part I study conduct open-label , dose-escalation trial . The first 5 volunteer ( Group A ) receive single oral dose Salmonella typhi CVD 908-HIV-1 LAI gp 120 ( VVG203 ) . If typhoid fever-like illness see volunteer least 14 day follow-up , next 5 patient ( Group B ) receive single dose VVG203 . If high dose well-tolerated , Phase II study initiate Phase I volunteer assess safety least 21 day . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 11/07/97 : Groups A B expand 10 patient . ] Part II study randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind trial . Nine volunteer randomize treatment group , oral VVG203 give alone sequentially HIV-1 SF-2 rgp 120 MF59 ( SF ) give intramuscularly . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 11/07/97 : Randomization VVG 203 alone sequentially HIV-1 MN rgp120 alum ( MN ) . ] A total 3 vaccination administer within 9-person cohort , 1 volunteer serf control receive sodium bicarbonate buffer rather VVG203 vaccine placebo rather SF . Group C receive VVG Month 0 SF Months 2 6 . Group D receive VVG Months 0 , 2 , 6 . Group E receive SF Months 0 2 VVG Month 6 . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 11/07/97 : MN give place SF Groups C , D , E . ]</detailed_description>
