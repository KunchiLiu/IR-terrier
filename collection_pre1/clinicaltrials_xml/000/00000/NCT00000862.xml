	<brief_summary>To obtain pharmacokinetic profile oral ZDV determine whether oral administration Zidovudine ( ZDV ) labor delivery provide similar profile obtain use IV ZDV ACTG 082 . To evaluate tolerance oral ZDV population , defined ability take oral dos lack vomit within 30 minute receive oral study dos . The worldwide use constant intrapartum ZDV infusion prevent transmission practical feasible . Approximately 18 % woman ACTG 076 trial miss IV ZDV infusion , even experience ACTG site . There urgent need establish practical method deliver ZDV labor delivery , minimum , approximate rate ZDV administration utilize ACTG 082 .

	<detailed_description>The worldwide use constant intrapartum ZDV infusion prevent transmission practical feasible . Approximately 18 % woman ACTG 076 trial miss IV ZDV infusion , even experience ACTG site . There urgent need establish practical method deliver ZDV labor delivery , minimum , approximate rate ZDV administration utilize ACTG 082 . In future , would enable woman start intensive ZDV regimen early labor , even prior reach hospital . Cohort 1 : Women active labor receive 3 dos oral ZDV 3 hour apart follow PK sample . After PK sample post 3rd oral dose , 8 cm dilation ( whichever come first ) , woman receive IV ZDV delivery . The cord blood analyze serum ZDV PK level infant 's infection status determine . If dose ZDV adequate achieve target maternal serum drug level Cohort 1 oral dosing tolerate cohort , Cohort 2 begin enrollment . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 08/03/01 : Cohort 1 complete Cohort 2 open enrollment . ] Cohort 2 : [ AS PER AMENDMENT 08/03/01 : Women active labor receive initial load dose oral ZDV , another dose oral ZDV 3 hour later , dos follow PK sample . After PK sample post second oral dose , 8 cm dilation ( whichever come first ) , woman receive IV ZDV delivery . The cord blood analyze serum ZDV PK level infant 's infection status determine . ]</detailed_description>
