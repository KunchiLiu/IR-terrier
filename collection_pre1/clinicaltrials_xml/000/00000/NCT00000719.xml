	<detailed_description>AIDS serious infectious disease cause new family retrovirus spread primarily sexual contact administration blood blood product . Individuals infect HIV could therefore benefit therapy effective anti-AIDS virus agent . AZT ddC test antiviral agent potentially beneficial effect may limit time- dose-dependent toxicity . A combination regimen use shorter course AZT ddC might therefore able sustain treatment without produce toxicity . In addition , since two drug exhibit major toxicity different organ system , cumulative additive toxicity would expect . There six study regimen . Four alternate regimen : A 2-week cycle consist 1 week AZT follow 1 week ddC 8-week cycle consist 4 week AZT follow 4 week ddC . All patient alternate regimen receive AZT alone standard dose orally every 4 hour either 1 4 week . After AZT stop , patient receive ddC orally every 4 hour either 1 4 week , completes treatment cycle . One two dos ddC study alternate regimen . Both dos must test optimal dose inferred test already do . AZT administer first hope AZT-mediated reduction p24 antigen load may reduce occurrence acute ddC toxicity . Two intermittent regimen also study included assess contribution drug alternate regimen . One program consist 1 week AZT follow 1 week drug . The consists 1 week ddC follow 1 week drug . Drug dose continue total 48 week unless toxicity develops . Patients complete 48 week therapy follow 4 additional week therapy . Patients remove study toxicity follow 4 week toxicity resolve . If study participant complete 48 week therapy meet criterion efficacy , study drug regimen may continue additional 32 week . A 4 week wash-out period drug require patient continue study . AMENDED 09/24/90 Drug dose discontinue 11/30/90 .</detailed_description>
