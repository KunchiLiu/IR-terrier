	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Asthma increasingly serious cause morbidity mortality United States . There approximately 12 million asthmatic , disease affect sex impact racial ethnic group . It recognize asthma complex disease vary etiology , trigger number factor ( e.g. , allergen , drug , chemical , exercise , cold air , infection , emotion ) , make asthma therapy difficult sometimes complicate . Multiple drug , include medication treat control symptom ( bronchodilator agent beta-adrenergic agonist , theophylline , anticholinergic ) medication think control underlie airway inflammation ( e.g. , inhaled systemic corticosteroid , cromolyn sodium , nedocromil ) , often require . Despite major advance understand etiology pathophysiology asthma development new therapeutic modality , prevalence , severity , mortality asthma age group increase past decade . Mortality rate disproportionately high urban rural minority population . Hospitalizations asthma doubled adult increase five-fold child past 20 year . Asthma continue place heavy burden patient family , health care system , society whole . Therefore , new approach need help alleviate grow problem . A particularly important need juncture mechanism rapid evaluation new exist therapeutic approach asthma dissemination laboratory clinical finding health care community . The Asthma Clinical Research Network ( ACRN ) program seek accomplish development network interactive asthma clinical group conduct clinical study employ common protocol coordinate multidisciplinary setting . This ensure ready access adequate number well characterized patient diverse population age group . It also bring together coordinate necessary clinical expertise administrative resource conduct multiple therapeutic study . Centralized protocols promote high quality design , decrease variability supportive modality , reduce redundant utilization resource require rapidly conduct multiple independent clinical study . The separate data coordinate center support protocol questionnaire development , sample size calculation , complete data analysis , overall study coordination . The initiative develop Pulmonary Diseases Advisory Committee work group , approve full committee February 1992 meeting , give concept clearance National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute ( NHLBI ) Advisory Council May 1992 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The Beta-Agonist ( Bags ) study compare safety efficacy regular plus `` need '' use inhale albuterol `` need '' use inhale albuterol 255 patient asthma mild severity . A total 230 patient complete study . The study randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled parallel group . Following 6-week single-blind run-in period , patient randomize double-blind manner treat 16 week . There 4-week withdrawal , run-out , period . Changes lung function asthma symptom assess determine whether regular `` need '' beta-agonist use beneficial treatment mild asthma . Specific outcome measure include morning ( AM ) PEF , airway responsiveness , spirometric value , even ( PM ) AM PEF difference index , asthma symptom , quality life measure , use rescue medication , episode adverse asthma control . Recruitment begin December 1994 . The study complete result publish . The Colchicine Moderate Asthma ( CIMA ) study examine colchicine offer therapeutic benefit management 71 patient moderate asthma corticosteroid discontinue . The study randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled two parallel group . A 2-week run-in inhale corticosteroid follow 2 week inhale corticosteroid colchicine placebo , 6 week inhale corticosteroid colchicine placebo . There 6-week single-blind run-out . Outcome measure include treatment failure cessation inhale corticosteroid , FEV1 change , PM AM PEF difference index , airway responsiveness , asthma symptom , quality life measure , use rescue medication , episode adverse asthma control . The protocol approve April 1994 . Recruitment run February 1996 August 1996 . Results publish . The Salmeterol Corticosteroids ( SOCS ) study randomize , double-blind study determine utility treat patient moderately severe asthma long-acting beta-agonists place inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) . A total 164 patient randomize one follow three treatment arm ( double-blind double-dummy ) : 1 ) placebo ; 2 ) inhale corticosteroid triamcinolone alone ; 3 ) beta-agonist salmeterol alone . Treatment continue 16 week , follow 6-week run-out period patient place placebo . The purpose run-out period evaluate effect treatment cessation asthma control . To compare efficacy therapy , primary outcome variable change AM PEF final week run-in period final week double-blind treatment period . To compare duration benefit , primary outcome variable AM PEF , comparison change final week run-in period second final week run-out period . Secondary endpoint include marker asthma severity ( e.g. , FEV1 , symptom diary , beta-agonist rescue , quality-of-life score , methacholine responsiveness , asthma exacerbation ) . To evaluate marker inflammation , sputum induction perform patient , bronchoalveolar lavage bronchial biopsy perform subset patient . Enrollment begin February 1997 end July 1998 . Results publish . The SalmeterolÂ± Corticosteroids ( SLIC ) study examine addition long act beta-agonist , salmeterol , schedule basis patient moderate asthma whose symptom sub-optimally control use inhale beta-agonist `` need '' basis inhale corticosteroid schedule basis . The study determine addition salmeterol schedule basis permit reduction dose , and/or elimination inhale corticosteroid time , without concomitant increase asthmatic symptom decrease bronchoprotective effect aerosolize methacholine . Recruitment randomize patient moderate asthma begin January 1997 . Additional patient randomize Harlem Center , center add network December 1995 . The enrollment 175 patient end July 1998 last patient visit complete January 1999 . Results publish . The Dose Inhaled Corticosteroids Equisystemic Effects ( DICE ) study estimate dose-response curve respect adrenal suppression six distinct inhaled corticosteroid . The inhaled steroid delivery system characterize term systemic effect dose produce `` equi-systemic '' effect could subsequently compare future efficacy study , include efficacy study `` Measuring Inhaled Corticosteroid Efficacy '' ( MICE ) . In DICE , total 156 ( 58 % male 31 % minority ) patient mild moderate asthma baseline visit placebo run-in period practice take schedule dos ( 4 puff twice day ) meter dose inhaler 1 week . At second visit , patient randomize placebo one follow six steroid arm , include : 1 ) beclomethasone dipropionate meter dose inhaler ( MDI ) ; 2 ) budesonide dry powder ; 3 ) flunisolide MDI ; 4 ) fluticasone propionate MDI ; 5 ) fluticasone propionate dry powder ; 6 ) triamcinolone acetonide MDI . The study address follow question : 1 ) Were dose-response relationship suppression overnight plasma cortisol various inhaled corticosteroid delivery system ? ; 2 ) If dose-response relationship exist , dose comparable systemic effect evident determine suppression overnight plasma cortisol ? ; 3 ) If dose-response relationship exist , dose produce 10 % , 20 % , 30 % , 40 % suppression adrenal steroid secretion ( cortisol ) inhale steroid delivery system ? DICE initiate September 1998 complete November 1999 . Results publish . The Measuring Inhaled Corticosteroid Efficacy ( MICE ) pilot study approve Protocol Review Committee August 1998 . MICE use dos inhaled corticosteroid full MICE protocol derive DICE , induce minimal cortisol suppression ( high deliverable dose cause less 5 % cortisol suppression ) , 20 % 30 % cortisol suppression , 40 % 60 % cortisol suppression . The intent determine different inhaled corticosteroid , equisystemic effect , differential salutary therapeutic effect chronic asthma , therapeutic efficacy parallel systemic effect . MICE 24-week , randomize , open-label , prospective , multi-center study examine effect inhale beclomethasone dipropionate ( BDP ) fluticasone propionate ( FP ) Opti-Chamber spacer device . The inhaled corticosteroid administer 30 patient dose increase systemic effect examine correspond effect pulmonary function , bronchial hyper-responsiveness , asthma control , resolution airway inflammation patient persistent asthma . The intent compare estimate systemic effect BDP FP , derive DICE pilot study BDP FP administer 1-week interval , occur BDP FP dose administer 3- 6-six week interval incremental dos . MICE also explore efficacy/systemic relationship , , suggest may difference two prototype inhale corticosteroid , BDP FP . Recruitment complete spring 2000 . Results publish . The Beta Agonist Response Genotype ( BARGE ) study review Protocol Review Committee December 1998 . Recruitment start September 1999 . BARGE 54-week randomize , double-blind , crossover study compare effect regularly schedule use inhale albuterol ( 2 puff four time day ) placebo . Two group 36 participant included individual mild moderate asthma differ genotype codon 16th amino acid B2-adrenergic receptor . A total 36 participant harbor B16-Arg/Arg genotype 36 harbor B16-Gly/Gly genotype B2-adrenergic receptor . Qualified participant enter 6-week single-blind run-in period treat inhaled placebo ( 2 puff 4 time day ) give inhaled ipratropium bromide use rescue medication . Asthma control characterize AM PEF , spirometric value , AM/PM PEF variability index , asthma symptom , quality life , use rescue medication , occurrence event adverse asthma control . Baseline data obtain airway responsiveness , protective effect albuterol methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction , maximum bronchodilator effect albuterol , exhale nitric oxide . Participants randomize 16-week double-blind treatment phase receive either inhale albuterol placebo ( two puff 4 time day ) . Asthma control monitor indicator time . At end blind treatment period , participant return single-blind regular use placebo inhaler ( 2 puff 4 time day ) 8-week run-out period . Following cross-over double-blinded treatment albuterol placebo , 8-week run-out period also serve run-in period second stage study . Asthma control monitor indicator first stage . At end second blind treatment period , participant return single-blind regular use placebo inhaler ( 2 puff 4 time day ) 8-week run-out period . During entire study , participant use inhaled ipratropium bromide rescue medication avoid confound effect B2-adrenergic stimulation outcome variable monitor . In event episode adverse asthma control respond incompletely ipratropium , albuterol use supersede rescue medication . Comparisons asthma control , within genotypic group period randomize treatment , assess difference change outcome variable end Stage 1 randomize treatment end Stage 1 run-in , end Stage 2 randomize treatment end Stage 1 run-out . The study complete result publish . The Improving Asthma Control Trial ( IMPACT ) double-blind , randomize , parallel group design clinical study determine best long-term strategy treat adult mild asthma experience symptom occasionally . The study test whether patient take anti-inflammatory medication daily basis whether new class medication provide benefit older drug . In IMPACT study , 225 adult mild asthma , occasional symptom , enrol six clinical research center . Following initial evaluation , patient randomize receive either twice daily inhale corticosteroid , twice daily anti-leukotriene , placebo . All patient receive treatment symptom , , occur . The primary outcome AM PEF . Other outcome include FEV1 bronchodilator treatment , frequency exacerbation , degree asthma control , number symptom-free day , quality life . Recruitment end 2003 . Study result publish April 14 , 2005 issue New England Journal Medicine . In April 2001 NHLBI initiate ancillary study IMPACT entitle `` Modification Allergic Immunologic Response Leukotriene Antagonists '' R01HL67684 . The ancillary study site database . The Smoking Modulates Outcomes Glucocorticoid Therapy Asthma ( SMOG ) study randomize , double-blind , cross-over study , compare effect inhale corticosteroid treatment deliver twice daily 8 week follow two group patient persistent asthma : 1 ) smoker ; 2 ) non-smokers . Smokers non-smokers match pair accord gender FEV1 status prior run-in period . Each member match pair randomize together crossover sequence . There 96 patient age 18 35 . The primary outcome change pre-bronchodilator FEV1 8-week treatment period smoker compare non-smokers . Secondary outcome AM PM PEF , PC20 methacholine , marker inflammation induce sputum . A secondary comparison examine effect 8 week treatment leukotriene receptor antagonist asthmatic smoke . An additional analysis compare response inhale corticosteroid response leukotriene receptor antagonist . The study complete result submit journal publication . The Salmeterol Leukotriene Modifiers versus ICS Treatment ( SLIMSIT ) study initiate recruitment September 2002 . The goal randomize 180 participant . SLIMSIT 36-week , double-blind , placebo-controlled , cross-over study , time treatment failure primary endpoint . Prior double-blind treatment phase , participant underwent 4-week run-in period combine inhaled beclomethasone HFA leukotriene receptor antagonist ( LTRA ) montelukast . This follow 14 week double-blind treatment . During initial 4-week run-in period , participant meet National Asthma Education Program criterion moderate persistent asthma receive controller regimen obtain baseline information symptom , beta-agonist use , PEF use define treatment failure participant duration study . The final visit run-in period serve baseline comparison study variable measure initial treatment phase . At end initial run-in , participant stable asthma symptom randomize one follow two treatment regimens 14 week : 1 ) daily oral placebo , twice daily inhalation salmeterol 50 mg dry powder inhaler ( DPI ) , twice daily inhalation beclomethasone HFA 80 mg MDI ; 2 ) daily oral montelukast 10 mg , twice daily inhalation salmeterol 50 mg DPI , twice daily inhalation placebo . Active beclomethasone HFA beclomethasone HFA placebo give via MDI delivery device , salmeterol give DPI DiskusÃ¢ . A computer interface randomize participant two treatment group , stratify clinical center FEV1 randomization visit ( le 80 % versus great 80 % predict FEV1 ) . During first treatment period , participant make three visit clinic 14 week . These visit include re-assessment study variable careful monitor increase asthma symptom potential treatment failure . Subsequently , participant enter second run-in period receive single-blind treatment inhale beclomethasone HFA oral montelukast first run-in period . At end second run-in period , participant cross alternate treatment regimen second 14-week treatment phase , include three visit clinic . These visit include re-assessment study variable careful monitor increase asthma symptom potential treatment failure . DSMB recommend termination study prior target enrollment sufficient data primary outcome obtain . SLIMSIT result present May 2005 American Thoracic Society Annual Meeting . The data analysis subsequent publication . The Predicting Responses Inhaled Corticosteroid Efficacy ( PRICE ) study follow-up study look additional predictive biomarkers response inhale corticosteroid . The study also evaluate whether short-term response inhale corticosteroid predict asthma control exacerbation rate , whether correlate elastic recoil upstream resistance . In study , adult history asthma underwent 6 week ICS treatment , stratify response randomize double-blind fashion continue ICS therapy receive placebo 16 week . ACRN investigator find 6 week ICS therapy , patient good ( 15 % ) versus poor ( less 5 % ) increase FEV1 experience significantly good asthma control continue ICS treatment . Interestingly , nitric oxide concentration exhale breath airway sputum eosinophil , generally consider biomarkers airway inflammation , significantly correlate ICS treatment response . Explanation divergence finding unclear . PRICE result present May 2005 American Thoracic Society Annual Meeting In Genetics Asthma Latino Americans ( GALA ) study , two ACRN center compare asthma-related clinical characteristic 684 Mexican Puerto Rican asthmatic recruit San Francisco , New York City , Puerto Rico , Mexico City .
