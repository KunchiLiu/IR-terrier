	<brief_summary>To test feasibility efficacy nutritional intervention primary prevention hypertension individual predispose development hypertension ; specifically , test hypothesis reduction weight and/or decrease sodium intake obese individual , decrease sodium intake without increased potassium intake ( men woman , regardless weight ) would prevent elevation blood pressure incidence hypertension .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypertension Prevention Trial ( HPT ) Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The nature essential hypertension mass public health problem throughout United States , internationally well , recognize generally . Prevalence estimate exceed l5 percent adult population . Further , result Hypertension Detection Follow-up Program ( HDFP ) demonstrate efficacy antihypertensive therapy even 90-l05 mmHg level , comprise 72 percent total hypertensive population . The Joint National Committee Detection , Evaluation Treatment High Blood Pressure recommend treatment mild hypertension pharmacologic non-pharmacologic therapy low diastolic pressure consistent safety tolerance . The recommendation consonant goal blood pressure guideline baseline pressure 90-99 mmHg . Hence , appear grow consensus reduction blood pressure level low 80 mmHg might desirable optimal cardiovascular health . The Joint National Committee recommend , young patient uncomplicated mild hypertension , benefit pharmacologic therapy must weigh cost , inconvenience , possible side effect . There , therefore , grow concern need pharmacologic management hypertension public health implication course action . These recommendation toward intervention mild hypertension set firm basis primary prevention hypertension . The association obesity elevate blood pressure widely recognize . Among hypertensive individual , numerous study show short term weight reduction caloric restriction result reduction blood pressure . Results several report long-term follow-up weight reduction effort indicate long-term control weight level compatible objective HPT feasible . A number investigator achieve level one year treatment despite minimal intervention effort follow-up period . There strong circumstantial evidence relate sodium intake hypertension . Most impressive evidence come study 'low-salt tribe ' , subsist low sodium intake . They fail develop hypertension , even gradual rise blood pressure age . Many study publish effect lower sodium intake blood pressure hypertensive patient positive . In one investigation , blood pressure fell approximately 9 ( systolic ) /6 ( diastolic ) mmHg sodium intake reduce approximately l80 l00 mEq/day . Reduction sodium intake level 70-l00 mEq/day appear within capability people maintenance period two year indicate minimal follow-up procedure . The role potassium intake development treatment hypertension less clear . As noted , primitive culture study epidemiologically low sodium intake associate low prevalence incidence hypertension culture also consume high level potassium . It suggest ratio sodium potassium may important determinant blood pressure . Hygienic intervention increase potassium intake free-living population least studied procedure use HPT . Potassium intakes &gt; l00 mEq could achieve without use dietary supplement individual consume large quantity fruit vegetable . This natural intake could also increase use potassium-based baking powder seasoning . The study carry four clinical two resource center ( Coordinating Center Nutrition Educational Resource Center ) . It Phase l long-term intervention trial determine whether development hypertension could prevent population special risk . The initial phase study direct towards test feasibility intervention , alternative mode recruitment , quantification sodium potassium intake , trend blood pressure , pre-testing various study procedure . Each four clinical center recruit 200 eligible 25 49 year old individual ( total 841 ) , either identify number multiple community source , index hypertensive case . The clinical investigator aid statistical data process support Data Coordinating Center intervention support special Nutrition Education Resources Center , form collaborative group test work hypothesis . The study protocol complete fall 1982 . Recruitment end September 30 , 1983 . The three-year follow-up period end August 1986 . Analysis data end December 1988 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A randomized , non-blind design three treatment group ( non-obese ) five group ( obese ) , include no-treatment group weight stratum . Intervention method dietary , include sodium restriction , sodium restriction plus potassium supplementation ( obese non-obese ) , weight reduction , weight reduction plus sodium restriction ( obese ) . This pilot study measure feasibility include recruitment success , dietary adherence , blood pressure difference among treatment group .</detailed_description>
