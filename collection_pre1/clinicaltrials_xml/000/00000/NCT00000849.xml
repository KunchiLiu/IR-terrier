	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety maximum tolerate dose ( high dose give safely ) recombinant Interleukin-2 ( rIL-2 ) HIV-infected child . This study also evaluate effect rIL-2 immune system patient . IL-2 substance naturally produce body 's white blood cell play important role help body fight infection . HIV-infected patient produce enough IL-2 , hop use rIL-2 may improve immune system function patient . First , necessary determine safety effectiveness drug HIV-infected child .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Test Safety Recombinant Interleukin-2 ( rIL-2 ) HIV-Infected Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According study record , IL-2 test HIV-infected child . Experience IL-2 pediatric population extremely limited . Pahwa et al . give 30,000 units/kg daily IV child severe combine immunodeficiency . This dose well tolerated patient improve clinically well immunologically . Part A necessary determine maximum tolerate dose IL-2 infected child . Part B determine efficacy maximum tolerate dose infected child . Part A : Children receive rIL-2 intravenously 5 day every 8 week 3 cycle . The study enroll 4 patient 3 dose level . Dose escalation may occur 4 patient dose level tolerate therapy without evidence Grade 3 ( high ) toxicity . If 1 4 subject dose level experience least Grade 3 toxicity , 2 additional patient enrol dose level . If 1 2 additional patient experience least Grade 3 toxicity , dose escalation proceed . NOTE : Once Part A complete maximum tolerate dose establish , child participate Part A receive less maximum tolerate dose offer additional therapy consist 3 cycle rIL-2 maximum tolerate dose . Part B : Children receive rIL-2 intravenously maximum tolerate dose establish part A . Treatment give 5 day every 8 week 3 cycle . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 6/4/98 : Children receive rIL-2 intravenously low dose 5 day every 8 week 6 cycle . Patients receive dose part A also offer regimen . ]</detailed_description>
