	<detailed_description>Results several study show high percentage people infect HIV eventually develop AIDS ARC unless effective treatment find . Because AZT know prolong survival patient AIDS severe ARC acceptable toxicity advance disease , reasonable try less advanced case . Patients enter study randomly assign one two dos AZT placebo ( inactive medication ) . Patients take 3 capsule 5 time day ( every 4 hour 8 12 pm ) . The capsule contain either AZT placebo identical appearance neither patient physician know treatment patient receiving . The high dose corresponds dose find useful patient AIDS severe ARC . Patients visit clinic every 2 week first 16 week , month evaluation . Treatment continue result study analyzed , could long 3 year . If side effect occur , dose study medication decrease temporarily stop . If side effect severe , study medication stop permanently . AMENDED : Effective Version 4 ( 900226 ) , dose ALL patient Phase 2 study drug , regardless CD4+ substudy , proceed open-label AZT . Original treatment assignment employ &gt; 500 cells/mm3 substudy period August 16 , 1989 release new version . Also , toxicity management dose modification AZT patient receive Phase 2 study drug change .</detailed_description>
