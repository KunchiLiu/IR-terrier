	<brief_title>Evaluation Study Congestive Heart Failure Pulmonary Artery Catheterization Effectiveness ( ESCAPE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Congestive heart failure constitute one major category morbidity , particularly elderly , responsible utilization significant resource , include large number hospitalization ( estimate 800,000 2.3 million per year ) relate health care cost . In 1993 , 4.7 million Americans carried diagnosis CHF , 400,000 new case diagnose every year . It estimate 800,000 1.2 million CHF patient NYHA class III-IV symptom . The diagnosis treatment CHF episodes decompensation facilitate pulmonary artery catheter use , efficacy highly dependent physician 's experience treatment patient . Recently , concern raise benefit PAC , also know Swan-Ganz catheterization . In response concern benefit safety PAC , NHLBI Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) co-sponsored workshop August 1997 entitiled `` Pulmonary Artery Catheterization Clinical Outcomes ( PACCO ) '' . The purpose workshop provide objective assessment state-of-the-science PAC various us . Experts critical care , pulmonary medicine , cardiovascular medicine , surgery , pediatric cardiology , nursing , biostatistics , ethic , medical economics identify several important clinical area priority clinical trial ; persistent/refractory congestive heart failure ( NYHA class IV ) receive top priority test whether PAC-directed treatment strategy achieve good less costly long-term outcome compare non-invasive treatment strategy . In addition provide data outcome , hospital utilization , cost , study would additional benefit . For example , would provide clear benchmark test technology , developmental stage , could supplant PAC future . Finally , study would provide basis develop competency requirement physician , nurse , others insert use pulmonary artery catheter , strong recommendation PACCO Workshop . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Patients randomize two treatment arm : A total 218 patient assign treatment strategy without PAC hemodynamic monitoring ( Usual Group ) 215 patient treatment strategy guide PAC ( Hemodynamic Group ) . The primary endpoint combine endpoint rehospitalization death . For patient randomize , therapy tailor ultimate goal discharge oral medical regimen provide good relief CHF symptom , reduce fill pressure maintain adequate perfusion . These goal group , Usual Group therapy adjust accord clinical assessment alone , PAC-directed group , actual measurement hemodynamics use supplement clinical assessment . The oral medical regimen discharge design attend heart failure physician base standard available medication angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( ACEI ) , nitrate , hydralazine , furosemide diuretic agent . Intravenous diuretic use major diuresis desire subsequent change oral diuretic least 48 hour discharge . Physicians could also use low dose infusion dopamine dobutamine facilitate diuresis . Intravenous nitroprusside could use either group . In Usual Group , therapy tailor following goal : ) absence evidence elevate intracardiac filling pressure ; relief orthopnea ; relief abdominal discomfort attribute hepatosplenchnic congestion ; resolution peripheral edema , ascites , rale ; reduction jugular venous distension 5 cm less sternal angle ; b ) adequate peripheral perfusion ; warm extremity , could achieve , pulse pressure 25 percent , , less , great could achieve . Either hemodynamic monitoring , therapy could adjust achieve clinical goal adjust , necessary maintain adequate blood pressure renal function patient . Patients therapy adjust without hemodynamic monitoring could crossover hemodynamic monitoring time reach certain criterion . The criterion crossover include : need add intravenous inotropic agent 3 mcg/kg/minute prevent symptomatic hypotension ; repeat inability discontinue low-dose inotropic agent ; renal insufficiency . In PAC-directed hemodynamic arm , therapy adjust achieve specific hemodynamic goal addition clinical goal Usual Group . These goal could include : pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ( PCWP ) 15 mm Hg le ; right atrial pressure 8mm Hg less unless PCWP 15 mm Hg le ; maintenance systolic blood pressure 80 , except occasional transient decrease low level oral medication . Regardless goal therapy adjust hospital , follow condition meet prior discharge : 24 hour oral medication alone without major medication change except anticoagulation , 48 hour discontinuation intravenous inotropic medication ; stable fluid balance ; patient education ; home service follow-up appointment . Post-discharge management group , accord standard practice . Patients follow adjustment CHF medication heart failure clinic one two week , four week , three month , six month often clinically indicate . There minimum six month follow-up . Data collection include : blood pressure weight visit ; electrocardiogram pre-randomization visit hospitalization ; serum electrolytes ; echocardiogram randomization , hospitalization discharge , six month follow-up ; exercise stress test index hospitalization six month follow-up ; natriuretic hormone profile randomization , discharge , six month follow-up ; medical history , endpoint , side effect , hospitalization quality life ; compliance protocol . The study consist Clinical Coordinating Center include network 26 clinical unit , echocardiographic core laboratory . The Protocol develop extend six month , patient recruitment extend 48 month , follow-up six month , data analysis six month . The NHLBI award R01HL67691 April 2001 ancillary study . The study entitle `` ESCAPE Mechanistic Substudies '' site database .</detailed_description>
