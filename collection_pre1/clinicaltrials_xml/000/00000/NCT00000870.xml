	<detailed_description>The poor responsiveness late stage HIV-infected patient rhIL-2 thought occur low T cell regenerative capacity high viral burden . If mean available effectively suppress virus replication , indigenous immune restorative response host may stimulate enhance rhIL-2 . The use protease inhibitor nucleoside-analogue combination regimens appear effective control virus replication . High-dose intermittent rhIL-2 administer either intravenously subcutaneously show effective inducing CD4 responses number study . All patient receive HAART consist two nucleoside analogue ( least one new patient ) protease inhibitor indinavir 12 week . At Week 10 , HIV RNA do . Patients 5,000 copies/ml take study . Patients 5,000 copies/ml less continue study stratify antiretroviral combination , randomize one three treatment arm . Patients Arm I continue HAART alone additional 72 week . Patients Arm II continue HAART plus intermittent rhIL-2 continuous intravenous ( CIV ) administration additional 72 week ( 9 course ) . Patients achieve least 25-percent increase least 100-cell increase CD4 count prerandomization baseline switch subcutaneously administer rhIL-2 3 course ( 24 week ) 6 course ( 48 week ) CIV therapy remainder treatment course . Patients Arm III continue HAART plus subcutaneous rhIL-2 additional 72 week ( 9 course ) . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 10/31/97 : When protocol ACTG 928 activate , patient randomize ACTG 328 stratify base whether registered ACTG 928 . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 10/30/98 : For 4 week immediately prior randomization , patient must receive continuous HAART therapy . Exceptions may make protocol chair short ( i.e. , less 48 hour ) interruption antiretroviral therapy period . Also per amendment , two substudies add : A5033s A5046s . Patients choose enroll substudy A5046s must Week 60 ACTG 328 . However , patient already beyond Week 60 beyond Week 84 ACTG 328 A5046s becomes available , he/she still encourage participate A5046s . For patient , ACTG 328 treatment extend beyond Week 84 patient complete 24 week A5046s . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 4/23/99 : Patients choose enroll substudy A5046s must Week 64 ACTG 328 later Week 104 . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 9/16/99 : Patients choose enroll A5046s must Week 64 later Week 128 . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 1/22/99 : A 16-week treatment extension provide patient reach Week 84 ACTG 328 intend enroll either A5051 A5046s ( currently available ) . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 4/23/99 : Therapy extend 24 week beyond original 84 week . Study treatment patient await co-enrollment A5046s continue 20 week co-enrollment completion A5046s ( 24 week ) . Study treatment continue 24 week beyond Week 84 patient await enrollment A5051 chosen participate A5046s . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 6/3/99 : A 24-week treatment extension add patient reach Week 100 intend enroll A5046s . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 9/16/99 : A treatment extension add 44 week beyond Week 84 completion A5046s ( 24 week ) on-study/on-study treatment patient intend co-enroll A5046s . Patients intend enroll A5051 A5046s remain ACTG 328 study treatment eligible treatment extension Week 84 Week 108 . Patients intend co-enroll A5046s remain ACTG 328 study treatment eligible treatment extension Week 108 Week 128 . All patient await co-enrollment A5046s must continue receive assign ACTG 328 treatment regimen . Study treatment ACTG 328 patient await co-enrollment A5046s continue 44 week completion A5046s ( 24 week ) . Each patient follow every 8 week duration treatment extension period monitor safety collect cell plasma storage . No substudy evaluation perform 24-week extension . ]</detailed_description>
