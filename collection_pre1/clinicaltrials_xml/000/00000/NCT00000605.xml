	<brief_title>Estrogen Graft Atherosclerosis Research Trial ( EAGER )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Coronary atherosclerosis major cause death woman United States . Although coronary artery bypass surgery decrease symptomatic clinical evidence ischemia , alter underlie process . Patients may present several year later recurrent symptom may result occlusion saphenous vein graft , development atherosclerotic disease vein graft , progression underlying disease . Any intervention reduce rate progression coronary atherosclerosis follow bypass surgery would provide significant benefit woman follow bypass surgery possibly woman atherosclerotic disease . Observational study suggest postmenopausal estrogen replacement therapy associate reduction cardiac morbidity . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study randomize , double-blind , control trial . Subjects randomize conjugated estrogen daily medroxyprogesterone placebo within two week bypass surgery . Graft occlusion development vein graft atherosclerosis measure compare quantitative coronary angiographic vascular ultrasonic assessment disease severity extent perform six month three half year randomization . The primary outcome variable include occurrence graft occlusion six month change severity extent atherosclerosis saphenous vein graft three year . The trial determine influence hormone replacement therapy primary outcome variable . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
