	<brief_title>High Frequency Ventilation Premature Infants ( HIFI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In early 1980s , increase concern dramatic improvement survival immature infant accompany increase incidence pulmonary complication , seriously cripple eventually fatal . Both barotrauma oxygen toxicity consider pathogenesis disorder ; circulatory disorder result failure closure ductus arteriosus fluid overload also propose contributory factor . Reports successful application principle high frequency ventilation ( HFV ) treatment infant RDS particularly severe interstitial emphysema raise hope technique might prevent barotrauma lung stimulate physician engineer develop new equipment useful ventilate small infant . Although HFV evaluate either regard efficacy safety although result fundamental study provide good understanding gas exchange occur HFV , considerable interest introduce type ventilatory support neonatal intensive care . HFV involve use small tidal volume , deliver respiratory frequency range 1 40 Hz aid , example , piston pump high speed jet gas . Compared conventional mechanical ventilation , HFV offer several potential advantage , include reduce intrapulmonary pressure swing fluctuation alveolar pressure possibility lower level inspire oxygen . At time , theory suggest HFV produce pattern flow enhance gas mix 'homogenized ' distribution ventilation . Experimental observation adult animal ( cat , dog rabbit ) healthy newborn lamb show HFV effective promote gas exchange without apparent adverse effect . Studies prematurely deliver subhuman primate , develop RDS subsequently bronchopulmonary dysplasia indistinguishable human infant , support notion HFV could provide good oxygenation lower C02 level conventional mechanical ventilation similar mean airway pressure . The HIFI trial provide badly need control data safety efficacy HFV premature infant . Phase I , Planning Phase , initiate August 1984 . Recruitment intervention begin February 1986 end March 1987 . Follow-up study continue thru September 1988 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Subjects randomize either standard mechanical ventilation high frequency ventilation . The principal endpoint incidence bronchopulmonary dysplasia define : need supplemental oxygen 28th postnatal day 21 first 28 day birth ; abnormal chest radiographic finding persist 28th day age . Other endpoint include need ventilatory support , incidence crossover one form ventilatory support , mortality rate 28th day postnatal age . Adverse effect consider pulmonary air leak , severe intracranial hemorrhage , periventricular leukomalacia .</detailed_description>
