	<brief_summary>AS PER AMENDMENT 10/24/96 : To develop domain/construct-driven neuropsychological neurological battery . Scaling instrument allow measurement function infancy early adulthood ; establish reliability validity new instrument develop NIMH Neurodevelopmental Battery . Downward extension cognitive domain infancy early childhood . To describe compare outcome assess level development versus rate change . Describe compare outcomes global assessment neurodevelopment ( e.g. , standardized I.Q . score ) versus discrete assessment ( e.g. , functional domain motor language skill ) . Develop guideline multicultural neuropsychological neurological assessment within clinical trial design . Describe nature impair developmental ability course disease infants child . The assessment child sustain central nervous system ( CNS ) insult require approach differ several way adult-based assessment . The rapid change occur develop CNS well behavior reflect underlie process growth development .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The assessment child sustain central nervous system ( CNS ) insult require approach differ several way adult-based assessment . The rapid change occur develop CNS well behavior reflect underlie process growth development . This study conduct nested substudy within ACTG 152 . AS PER AMENDMENT 10/24/97 : ACTG 188 originally nest study within ACTG 152 , three-arm clinical drug trial , , due recruitment limitation , expand include protocol non-protocol child HIV-1 infection . It include 225 HIV-infected patient ACTG 152 , well additional 450 non-infected participant recruit two comparison group , one consist seronegative infant child perinatal exposure HIV second group without perinatal exposure HIV . AS PER AMENDMENT 10/24/96 : Patients HIV-unexposed uninfected group discontinue study remain patient reassign two new age group : 3 month 41 month 30 day 42 month 9 year , 11 month , 30 day . Patients 33 month old less 42 month discontinue study , patient le 33 month time enrollment graduate study age 42 month . A neurological assessment battery evaluate follow domain : growth , sensory , tone , motor , posture , locomotion , hand use , deep tendon reflex , abnormal movement , language , behavior . Participants ask different kind activity talk , listen , drawing , play game involve walk , jumping , concentration , memory . All participant assess clinic visit follow 72 week . AS PER AMENDMENT 10/23/97 : A modified version neurological battery discontinue interim follow-up evaluation administer one last time part exit evaluation .</detailed_description>
