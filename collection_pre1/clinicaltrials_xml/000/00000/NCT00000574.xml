	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) multifactorial disorder commonly occur secondary sepsis syndrome . Sepsis syndrome occur 250,000 500,000 patient per year approximately one-third develop ARDS organ failure . Extensive study utilize sheep endotoxin model ARDS well data human pilot study suggest cyclooxygenase inhibitor ( particular , ibuprofen ) would useful prevention reversal many pathophysiological abnormality relate sepsis . Animal study ibuprofen treatment give prior endotoxin show ibuprofen improve oxygenation , pulmonary systematic hemodynamics , airway mechanic , lung lymph flow . Importantly , animal study also show establish airway mechanic abnormality pulmonary hypertension reverse ibuprofen even give 2.5 hour post endotoxin . Pilot study ibuprofen patient sepsis syndrome show temperature heart rate significantly reduce suggest airway mechanic oxygenation improve , shock reverse change temporally relate prostaglandin level urine plasma . The result multicenter study ibuprofen intervention patient sepsis perform two medical center 1985 1987 demonstrate antipyretic effect ibuprofen accompany decrease heart rate , reduction peak airway pressure time intervention , evidence urine assay reduce vivo production PGI2 TxA2 . Results suggest PGI2 production correlate inversely systemic vascular resistance TxA2 production correlate directly pPA airway resistance . Several parameter indicate beneficial effect tend toward improvement ibuprofen intervention . The study conduct seven North American clinical center include coordinate center prostaglandin laboratory . Planning completion protocol manual operation take place first six month study . Patient accession extend three half year . Data analysis conduct last year . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter . Recruitment seven clinical site begin October 1989 end March 1995 . A total 224 patient randomize double-blind fashion ibuprofen give intravenously every six hour total eight dos 231 patient randomize placebo . The major endpoint mortality rate 30 day randomization . Before first dose study drug , baseline medical history take physical examination perform document presume cause , site , time onset sepsis syndrome . Blood obtained culture least two site . Infection classify occur lung , peritoneum , urinary tract another site unknown site . Chest radiograph obtain entry score chest radiologist indicate presence severity pulmonary edema . Baseline characteristic ibuprofen placebo group balance respect variety measure correlate mortality morbidity . The mean interval elapse time patient meet entry criterion administration study drug 10.7 +/- 0.6 hour ibuprofen group 11.3 +/- 0.6 hour placebo group . The predominant site infection lung . In group , infection associate positive blood culture consider treated appropriate antibiotic 96 percent case . Rates organ dysfunction ( organ failure ) similar two group time randomization , except renal dysfunction significantly common placebo group . The method calculate Acute Physiology Chronic Health Evaluation ( APACHE II ) score modify score represent point time -- , calculated baseline data rather bad value obtain first 24 hour care intensive care unit . Data obtain entry every four hour thereafter first 44 hour 72 , 96 , 120 hour include patient 's temperature , mean systemic blood pressure , respiratory rate , heart rate , urinary output ( hourly average ) , arterial-blood gas measurement requirement antipyretic agent . Values mean blood pressure calculate follow formula : ( 0.33 x systolic pressure ) + ( 0.67 x diastolic pressure . When pulmonary artery catheter present , cardiac output , pulmonary artery pressure , pulmonary wedge pressure , central venous pressure measure baseline 20 hour later . Blood lactate measure , delivery consumption oxygen calculate , baseline 20 hour . Blood sample obtain baseline 20 , 44 , 72 , 120 hour study entry measurement hemoglobin , total leukocyte count , platelet count , bilirubin , serum aspartate aminotransferase , lactate dehydrogenase , creatinine , blood urea nitrogen , electrolytes . Data record patient 's requirement blood transfusion , intensive care , mechanical ventilation .</detailed_description>
