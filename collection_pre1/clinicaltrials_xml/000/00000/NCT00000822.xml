	<brief_summary>To evaluate safety immunogenicity HIV-1 MN rgp160 ( Immuno-AG ) HIV-infected patient . To evaluate immunogenicity HIV-1 MN rgp160 immunogen lymphocyte proliferation , specific antibody response , DTH reaction . To describe durability immunogen patient respond first 7 injection boost every 8 week additional 6-12 month [ AS PER AMENDMENT 11/12/96 : stratum 1 patient ] . To describe ability immunogen induce response additional 6-12 month injection among patient respond first 7 injection [ AS PER AMENDMENT 11/12/96 : stratum 1 patient ] . HIV-specific cellular immune response appear play important role HIV disease progression since T helper cytotoxic function HIV decrease disease progression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Double-Blind Controlled Trial Determine Safety Immunogenicity HIV-1 MN rgp160 Immuno AG Vaccine Therapy HIV-Infected Individuals With Greater Than Equal 500/mm3 CD4+ T Cells 200-400/mm3 CD4+ T Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV-specific cellular immune response appear play important role HIV disease progression since T helper cytotoxic function HIV decrease disease progression . Patients CD4 count great equal 500 cells/mm3 randomize receive HIV-1 MN rgp160 ( Immuno-AG ) control . Patients CD4 count 50-499 cells/mm3 receive didanosine ( ddI ) randomize receive ddI plus vaccine control . Vaccine control give every 4 week 7 injection , every 8 week 6-12 month 1 year last patient randomize . AS PER AMENDMENT 11/12/96 : Stratum 1 compose 16 subject CD4+ T cell great equal 500 mm3 . These subject randomize vaccine therapy vaccine control . HIV-1 MN rgp160 vaccine control give every 4 week 7 injection ( Schedule 1 ) , every 8 week 52 week last subject randomize stratum 1 ( Schedule 2 ) . Stratum 1 patient receive ddI d4T CD4 cell count sustain decrease 2 consecutive occasion 10-14 day apart and/or HIV/RNA plasma viral load increase great 10,000 copies/ml 2 consecutive occasion 10-14 day apart . Stratum 2 compose 30 subject CD4+ T cell 200-400/mm3 ; accrual stratum activate base preliminary result stratum 1 ( close 4/5/97 ) . Patients stratum 2 ( open 3/4/97 ) initially receive ritonavir escalate dos 2 week . Subjects ddI d4T add regimen 7 week . Subjects randomized vaccine therapy vaccine control every 4 week 7 injection , ritonavir/ddI/d4T continued vaccine therapy . AS PER AMENDMENT 3/23/98 : As 6/1/98 vaccine consist sodium chloride injection ( USP ) .</detailed_description>
