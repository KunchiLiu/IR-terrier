	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Infection remain major cause death patient receive chemotherapy malignant disease . One approach problem septicemia high mortality patient therapeutic use granulocyte transfusion . Improvements collection technique , employ continuous flow centrifugation , permit collection granulocyte single , normal donor sufficient number study application treatment infection granulocytopenic patient . Studies demonstrate efficacy granulocyte transfusion adjunct therapy septicemia due gram negative microorganism associate granulocytopenia . The aim study determine ( 1 ) whether infection could prevent patient receive granulocyte prophylactically ( 2 ) whether recovery infection aid patient receive granulocyte therapeutically . Both trial utilize control receive granulocyte . Four contract award September 1976 . The protocol design evaluate efficacy prophylactic granulocyte transfusion complete close 1977 . The protocol therapeutic trial complete April 1978 . Approximately 90 patient randomize prophylactic trial 51 therapeutic trial . The Recruitment Intervention Phase end February 1980 . The trial conclude . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Prophylactic Trial Therapeutic Trial : randomize , non-blind , sequential . Eligible patient randomize daily granulocyte transfusion granulocyte transfusion .
