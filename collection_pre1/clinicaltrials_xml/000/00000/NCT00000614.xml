	<brief_title>Prevention Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism ( PREVENT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Venous thromboembolism associate 300,000 hospitalization result thousand death annually . Conventional therapy consist intravenous heparin follow oral anticoagulant usually give three six month . The recommended intensity oral anticoagulant ( warfarin ) derive clinical trial . Such therapy usually quite effective . However , patient develop recurrent disease oral anticoagulant stop . A recent randomized study evaluate optimal duration oral anticoagulant therapy . After acute treatment heparin , subject treat oral anticoagulant either six week six month target INR * 2 2.85 . There difference mortality two group . Recurrence see patient treatment . When anticoagulant stop , recurrent thrombosis document 18 percent patient treat six week 9.5 percent treat six month . The period great risk recurrence six week patient immediately therapy stop . There linear increase cumulative risk 5 6 percent per year treatment group follow 18 month . For patient experienced idiopathic venous thrombosis , risk recurrence may continue even several month conventional therapy . Further prophylactic therapy might beneficial patient risk late recurrence . But , presume risk bleed inconvenience monitor standard warfarin therapy , physician usually limit treatment three six month . In 1997 , Simioni show cumulative recurrence rate VTE 39.7 percent among factor V Leiden mutation , recurrence occur within three year , rate 2.4 time higher among individual without mutation . The factor V Leiden mutation find 4 6 percent Caucasians single important cause thromboembolism variety condition . Heterozygous carrier mutation VTE young age noncarriers . Among first VTE , prevalence mutation 15 40 percent among family history VTE , high 50 percent . However , large study men participate Physicians Health Study , individual mutation increase rate VTE time . These age-specific incidence rate difference range 1.23 5.97 age 70 old . These data suggest confounders genetic predisposition important development VTE . * The INR international normalize ratio ratio patient prothrombin control prothrombin multiply international sensitivity index . The INR introduce World Health Organization standardize control anticoagulant therapy internationally . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled . A total 253 patient randomize usual care plus placebo total 255 patient usual care plus three-to-four year regimen low-dose warfarin ( target INR 1.5 2.0 ) , initial titration require infrequent outpatient monitoring . Double-blind INR assessment dose adjustment perform every three month ensure patient safety monitor compliance . Primary endpoint include recurrent venous thromboembolism , major bleed episode , all-cause mortality . Separate analysis perform all-cause mortality total patient population factor V Leiden . The study consist 52 clinical center , laboratory coordinating center , clinical coordinating center , data coordinate center . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
