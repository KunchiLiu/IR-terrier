	<brief_title>Intravenous Streptokinase Acute Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Determination potential value thrombolytic therapy patient acute myocardial infarction issue major importance 1983 . An estimated 1.4 million heart attack occur year , 500,000 fatal . Reduction mortality require effective mean reduce infarct size . Studies indicate reperfusion represent potent mean achieve salvage ischemic myocardium . Pilot clinical study indicate reperfusion could achieve substantial percentage patient lysis coronary thrombosis intracoronary intravenous streptokinase administration . Intracoronary thrombolysis receive widespread clinical application many limitation . The intracoronary route take 90-120 minute longer administer intravenous route . Because intracoronary therapy require availability catheterization laboratories highly skilled invasive cardiologist , treatment available large number patient hospitalize small community hospital . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized design two group fix sample size . Control patient receive routine coronary care . The treatment group receive intravenous streptokinase plus conventional care . This follow intravenous heparin warfarin . The primary endpoint 14 day mortality . Secondary endpoint include angiographic patency involve coronary artery 10 14 day , leave ventricular function , segmental wall motion analysis , myocardial infarction size 30-45 day .</detailed_description>
