	<brief_title>A Study To Test An Anti-Rejection Therapy After Kidney Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Renal transplantation recognize treatment choice child chronic renal failure . However , patient graft survival rate young child unacceptably low . In preliminary study , OKT3 ( monoclonal antibody ) induction therapy receive post transplant successful standard immunosuppression alone improve graft survival . This study design assess impact induction therapy graft survival pediatric kidney transplant patient . Patients assign OKT3 induction induction 1:1 ratio . Randomization oral cyclosporine either Sandimmune Neoral also do 1:1 ratio . Group 1 receive OKT3 intraoperatively follow Neoral . Group 2 receive OKT3 intraoperatively follow Sandimmune . OKT3 administer 2.5 mg ( weight less 30 kg ) 5 mg ( weight 30 kg ) per day maximum 14 day . Group 3 receive IV cyclosporine follow Neoral . Group 4 receive IV cyclosporine follow Sandimmune . Oral cyclosporine administer masked preparation . The dose Sandimmune Neoral ; patient 6 year age old begin dose 15 mg/kg/day patient 6 year age receive 500 mg/m2/day . Patients receive concomitant medication include steroid ( IV po ) , Nifedipine , anti-CMV therapy , Bactrim , Azathioprine Mycophenolate Mofetil . Kidney function , incidence viral infection , graft survival , incidence malignancy measure assess role OKT3 induction role rejection graft failure . Graft function evaluate 1- , 2- , 4-year interval .</detailed_description>
