	<brief_title>Azithromycin Coronary Events Study ( ACES )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Cumulative evidence past study support prove causal association Chlamydia pneumoniae infection development progression atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease . Evidence support association raise question whether causal effect Chlamydia pneumonia infection , present , may ameliorate antibiotic treatment , result decrease CHD outcome . The ACES randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study determine whether treatment azithromycin decrease rate coronary heart disease event among patient stable documented coronary artery disease . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A randomized , double-blind , multicenter trial azithromycin versus placebo among adult document prevalent coronary artery disease . Patients enrol 18-month period total 28 center . Following enrollment , electrocardiogram obtain , patient prolong QT interval exclude . Eligible patient randomize receive either placebo azithromycin 600 milligram orally week year . At time enrollment , blood sample obtain C. pneumoniae antibody test . Patients contact one , three , six week , three , six , nine , twelve month . The patient follow mean four year composite primary outcome coronary heart disease death , non-fatal myocardial infarction , hospitalization unstable angina , requirement coronary artery bypass graft percutaneous revascularization . After first year study , patient contact every six month determine occurrence outcome . In addition , available , computerized hospitalization outpatient data review . Outcome event classify use standardized algorithm . The relationship antibody titer baseline efficacy azithromycin outcome secondary analysis . The primary analysis accord intent-to-treat principle . In addition therapeutic trial serologic follow-up substudy conduct 25 percent patient enrol therapeutic trial . The subset patient randomize obtain blood sample three six month , one two year , end study serology . The purpose substudy determine effect azithromycin serologic titer C. pneumoniae evaluate whether occurrence coronary heart disease event associated change antibody titer . Protocol plan take place first six month trial , follow one half year patient enrollment . Patient followup continue three year recruitment period final six month close analysis phase . The study completion date list record obtain `` Completed Date '' enter Query View Report System ( QVR ) .</detailed_description>
