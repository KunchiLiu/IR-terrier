	<brief_summary>To evaluate HLA-mismatched , unrelated-donor umbilical cord blood stem progenitor cell unit ( UCBU ) offer clinically acceptable alternative match unrelated-donor allogeneic bone marrow transplantation 180-day disease free survival endpoint . HLA type perform use DNA-base high resolution method determine HLA allele . Patients `` true '' HLA 3/6 4/6 match evaluate . In addition , separate study adult address problem limit cell dose engraftment failure . The study plan randomize comparative clinical trial . Instead , phase II/III efficacy study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Bone marrow transplantation effective therapy variety genetic hematologic disorder . Donated bone marrow , provide source stem progenitor cell bone marrow reconstitution , obtain either related donor , usually HLA-matched sibling , HLA-matched unrelated donor . Because limited availability HLA-matched related donor , HLA-matched unrelated donor frequently alternative source bone marrow transplantation . To provide matched volunteer bone marrow donor unrelated recipient , National Marrow Donor Program ( NMDP ) establish 1986 develop national Registry HLA-typed individual agree donate bone marrow need . More 3 million potential marrow donor enrol . A limitation registry approach time need identify donor complete necessary clinical evaluation laboratory test histocompatibility , infectious disease , general good health . Moreover , certain proportion potential donor change mind otherwise become unavailable time enter Registry time call preliminary match patient . Another disadvantage marrow harvest procedure require normal donor hospitalize give general anesthesia operating room . Finally , NMDP Registry consist potential donor primarily European Caucasian ancestry . Although great stride make increase number African-Americans , Hispanics , Asian-Americans , Native Americans , still difficult find match ethnic minority Caucasian patient . Human umbilical cord blood alternative source hematopoietic stem progenitor cell capable reconstitute bone marrow recipient variety disease . Cord blood stem progenitor cell related donor successfully transplant world-wide child genetic hematologic disease . These result suggest cord blood unrelated , HLA-matched donor also use patient need transplant n't relate donor . The exist problem unrelated-donor bone marrow transplantation donor recruitment , bone marrow harvesting , match antigen peculiar particular ethnic group would reduce typed , test , frozen umbilical cord blood could make easily rapidly available . Such system , could complement partially replace present process , show feasible . In NHLBI-sponsored program , investigator collect cryopreserved bank 9,000 human UCBUs . In addition , successful search match ( include many 4/6 antigen match ) result 900 unrelated-donor , UCBU transplant date . Preliminary data unrelated-donor related-donor cord blood transplant suggest less GvHD source graft adult bone marrow . The severity GvHD also seem less even highly mismatched recipient . One important question whether 3/6 HLA match transplant child acceptable 180-day disease free survival . It also remain determined graft-vs-leukemia effect also less unrelated-donor cord blood graft durable match , related-donors . Most transplant conduct thus far child . Hence another important question whether sufficient number stem cell cord blood support transplantation unrelated adult . The initiative propose Division Blood Diseases Resources staff approve February 1995 National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council . The Requests Proposals release June 1995 . Contracts award September 30 , 1997 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study multicenter , six Cord Blood Transplant Centers ( CBTCs ) , two collect storage center ( Cord Blood Banks -- CBBs ) one Coordinating Center . Each CBB use protocol recruiting donor , collect , processing , test , storage , retrieval storage , reprocess frozen state , shipping . Each participate CBTC use patient selection criterion , preparative regimen patient class , initial graft-versus-host disease ( GvHD ) prophylaxis , indication use cytokine , definition event complication , method evaluate immune reconstitution . The main study evaluate impact HLA 3/6 4/6 matching outcome . The primary endpoint 180-day disease free survival UCBU transplantation . Secondary endpoint include engraftment , frequency severity acute chronic GvHD stratification degree HLA match , overall survival , immunologic reconstitution . Data collect banked UCBUs define unit quality nucleate cell count flow cytometry surface marker identify effect patient outcome . Recruitment end December 31 , 2003 accrual 326 subject . .</detailed_description>
