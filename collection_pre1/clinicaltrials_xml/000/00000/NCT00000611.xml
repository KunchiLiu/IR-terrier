	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Prior 1991 , little research focus health issue unique , common , woman . This especially case study chronic disease prevention mature woman . These condition ( coronary heart disease , cancer , osteoporosis ) lead cause impairment quality life , morbidity , mortality post-menopausal United States woman . The WHI , mandate Congress , establish 1991 National Institutes Health locate Office Director ( OD ) . The Clinical Coordinating Center clinical trial/observational study fund September 1992 16 Vanguard Clinical Centers fund March 1993 . The initial protocol develop jointly Clinical Coordinating Center Program Office review approve Investigators Committee April 20 , 1993 . Additional clinical center fund 1994 . On October 1 , 1997 , administration WHI transfer NHLBI conduct consortium effort lead NHLBI cooperation National Institute Arthritis Musculoskeletal Skin Diseases ( NIAMS ) , National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) , National Institute Aging ( NIA ) . DESIGN NARRATIVE : As described objective , WHI three major component : randomize control clinical trial , observational study , study community approach develop healthful behavior . Recruitment WHI begin September 1993 end December 1998 . Six clinical center complete recruitment January 1997 . The remain 34 center complete recruitment December 1998 . CLINICAL TRIAL COMPONENT The clinical trial component consist three subtrials : hormone replacement trial , dietary modification trial , calcium /vitamin D supplementation trial . Approximately 27,500 woman age 50 79 participate HRT , test whether long-term HRT reduces coronary heart disease fracture without increase breast cancer risk . Women uterus randomize receive either estrogen plus progestin placebo . Progestin add protect woman uterus endometrial cancer . Women hysterectomy randomized receive either estrogen alone placebo . The estrogen plus progestin trial stop early July 8 , 2002 average follow-up 5.2 year recommendation Data Safety Monitoring Board . The estrogen alone study continue unchanged March 2 , 2004 NIH instruct participant stop take study pill begin follow-up phase study . . Participants estrogen alone study follow eight 12 year clinic visit every six month assure safety ass health . The dietary modification trial component study effect low-fat , high fruit , vegetable grain diet breast cancer , colorectal cancer heart disease 48,000 postmenopausal woman . Participants randomize comparison group maintain usual dietary habit dietary change group . Women dietary change group decrease fat intake 20 percent total daily calorie , increase fruit vegetable consumption five serving per day , increase grain six serving per day . Additionally , monitor food intake attend nutrition group meeting learn change diet first year . Thereafter attend four meeting per year . The calcium/vitamin D supplementation subtrial test whether calcium vitamin D supplement reduce risk hip fracture colorectal cancer postmenopausal woman . Women hormone replacement therapy dietary modification trial encourage join calcium/vitamin D supplementation study . Approximately 45,000 postmenopausal woman randomize one two study group . One group randomly assign receive 1,000 mg elemental calcium ( calcium carbonate ) 400 International Units vitamin Dâ‚ƒdaily . The second group receive matching placebo . Women already take calcium supplement continue take . Participants follow eight 11 year contact clinical center every six month assure safety ass health . Total number trial participant three subtrials 68,135 . OBSERVATIONAL STUDY The several goal study include : give reliable estimate extent know risk factor predict heart disease , cancer , fracture ; identify new risk factor diseases woman ; compare risk factor , presence disease start study new occurrence disease WHI study component ; create future resource identify biological indicator disease , especially substances factor find blood . The study enrol 93,726 postmenopausal woman track average nine year . Participants fill periodic health form visit clinic three year enrollment . They take medication change health habit . COMMUNITY PREVENTION STUDY The community prevention study consist 12 separate study conduct eight Centers Disease Control Prevention 's ( CDC ) University-based Prevention Research Centers cooperative agreement NIH CDC . The 12 study begin October 1995 continue additional five year . The collaboration support health promotion disease prevention research demonstration project community-based focus healthy behavior prevent major cause death disability promote health practice lead effective public health intervention . Each project provide research dissemination translation finding community intervention . Topics study include : attitude towards hysterectomy , oophorectomy , surgical menopause among African Americans ; reduce cardiovascular disease risk among Black woman ; environmental policy intervention increase physical activity among minority woman age 40 75 ; peer support intervention cardiovascular disease risk among African American woman , age 40 old ; assess effectiveness brief medical-provider educational intervention osteoporosis minority woman age 40 old ; improve delivery diabetes care woman minority group ; assessment moderate physical activity among woman .</detailed_description>
