	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Because difficulty quantitative measurement feasibility follow-up , control study prior SCRIP complete determine impact risk factor modification directly progression coronary atherosclerosis human . Suggestive evidence exist animal study , especially primates , diet exercise alter atherosclerosis result risk modification . But animal model accurately represent potential modifying coronary atherosclerotic process human . Some indirect evidence develop human study artery accessible coronary . In several preliminary study report use coronary arteriography study impact risk modification atherosclerosis , result encourage far definitive . One angiographic follow-up study vein bypass graft severely atherosclerotic coronary artery report improvement lipid lower therapy . None study include randomization patient systematic , intense , long-term risk reduction versus usual care prospectively identify coronary artery segment mild disease . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , fixed-sample . A total 300 patient randomize , 155 usual care ( UC ) community 145 special intervention ( SI ) . The SI group receive intensive effort direct reduce eliminate risk factor , include lower LDL-cholesterol increase HDL-cholesterol , reduce blood pressure , eliminate cigarette smoking obesity , increase exercise , decrease stressful life experience . The major endpoint rate coronary artery disease progression measure angiography , baseline forty-eight month . Follow-up four year .</detailed_description>
