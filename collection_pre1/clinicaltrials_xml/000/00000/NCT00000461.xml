	<brief_summary>To determine sequential coronary arteriography whether lipid-lowering diet without lipid-lowering drug could reverse coronary artery disease normocholesterolemic patient . Also , test whether fish oil supplement could improve human coronary atherosclerosis . Finally , determine effect combination therapy lipid-reducing drug patient coronary heart disease `` normal '' cholesterol level . At least three clinical trial conduct .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The prognosis patient coronary heart disease closely related degree coronary luminal obstruction . In population study , incidence severity coronary atherosclerosis angiography correlate diet plasma lipoprotein cholesterol . Previous clinical trial show treatment lower plasma concentration low density lipoprotein cholesterol benefit hypercholesterolemic patient coronary heart disease . No similar benefit demonstrate normocholesterolemic patient make majority patient coronary heart disease . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In cholesterol-lowering agent trial , patient receive Step 1 dietary instruction randomization every three month thereafter . Randomization stratify medical surgical treatment coronary disease ratio total HDL cholesterol . A total 39 patient assign placebo 40 active treatment pravastatin , nicotinic acid , cholestyramine , gemfibrozil stepwise need reach specify goal ( total cholesterol less equal 4.1 mmol/L , ratio LDL/HDL cholesterol less equal 2.0 ) . Lipid concentration measure every six week . Baseline angiogram compare angiogram take 30 month . In fish oil trial , 41 patient randomized fish oil capsule contain 6 gram n-3 fatty acid daily 39 patient randomized olive oil placebo capsule average duration 28 month . Each fish oil capsule contain 500 mg n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid compose 240 mg eicosapentaenoic acid , 160 mg docosahexaenoic acid , 100 mg mainly docosapentaenoic acid . Randomization stratify medical surgical treatment coronary disease ratio total HDL cholesterol . The primary outcome variable change minimal diameter coronary artery lesion express continuous variable . During initial hospital stay catheterization , dietary instruction provide every patient accord National Cholesterol Education Program ( NCEP ) Step 1 guideline . A seven-day diet record collect randomization visit every three month trial . Every twelve week , research nurse review patient side effect , diet , concomitant medication perform pill count . Every 24 week , patient receive interval medical history physical examination physician . A fasting blood sample obtain lipid analysis 12- 24-week visit every 24 week thereafter . If total cholesterol level patient increase 250 mg/dl ( 6.43 mmol/liter ) great two consecutive measurement , intensify dietary instruction give , follow drug therapy cholestyramine nicotinic acid need low total cholesterol le 250 mg/dl . Twenty-one patient complete protocol due death , refusal undergo second cardiac catheterization , development medical condition preclude participation , intolerance capsule , miss initial angiogram . In combination therapy trial , patient randomize usual care stepped-care drug therapy lipid-lowering agent include pravastatin , nicotinic acid , cholestyramine , gemfibrozil decrease total cholesterol level less 160 mg/dl ratio low density lipoprotein cholesterol high density lipoprotein cholesterol less 2.0 . Measurements include fast serum lipoprotein profile , fast apolipoprotein level , frequency adverse effect . Patients assess every six week drug titration every three month thereafter two -and-a-half year . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
