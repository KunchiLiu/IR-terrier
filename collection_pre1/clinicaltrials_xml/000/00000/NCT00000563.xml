	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome one leading cause disability death newborn . In United States , approximately 10 percent infant premature , year 50,000 case neonatal respiratory distress syndrome occur . Extensive study animal model respiratory distress syndrome demonstrate antenatal administration synthetic ( dexamethasone ) natural ( cortisol ) corticosteroid accelerate lung maturation significantly diminish occurrence RDS . Although variety condition newborn infant treat steroid past 20 year without adverse effect , investigation need short-term effect corticosteroid administer antenatally neonate mother long-term effect infant . The Planning Phase trial complete March 1977 , formulation common protocol manual operation . Patient screen enrollment begin August 1977 end March 1 , 1980 . Follow-up end August 1983 data analysis complete October 31 , 1983 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , double-blind , fixed sample . Six hundred ninety-six pregnant woman randomize four dos dexamethasone every 12 hour placebo . Endpoints incidence respiratory distress syndrome abnormality motor-neuro-intellectual development infant .</detailed_description>
