	<brief_summary>The purpose study collect information life span HIV-related illness multiple group HIV-positive patient vary anti-HIV treatment experience , include treatment . Anti-HIV treatment successful slow disease progression many patient . However , still question regard best way use anti-HIV drug . This study design provide long-term monitoring patient already receive anti-HIV treatment well patient begin treatment decide receive treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Long-Term Outcomes HIV-Positive Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) often result short-term benefit people HIV term reduce plasma viral level increase CD4 cell count . When use early stage HIV disease , however , clinical benefit HAART uncertain . Many question still remain regard optimal use antiretroviral therapy , time initial antiretroviral therapy composition best combination regimen use initially virologic failure . Randomized trial different start antiretroviral regimen ( e.g. , FIRST [ CPCRA 058 ] ) , different regimen initial virologic failure ( e.g. , PIP [ CPCRA 057 ] ) , different management strategy HIV infection ( e.g. , bis-POM [ CPCRA 039 ] , NvR [ CPCRA 042 ] , GART [ CPCRA 046 ] , IL-2 VL/Dose [ CPCRA 059 ] conduct CPCRA . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 2/28/01 : The MDR-HIV ( CPCRA 064 ) protocol include example different management strategy HIV infection , whereas bis-POM ( CPCRA 039 ) protocol longer include . ] This study provide mechanism long-term monitoring patient enrol trial well antiretroviral-naive patient either start treatment elect defer treatment . Patients divide 3 group . Group A consist patient currently enrol currently follow ongoing qualify study ( see Purpose CPCRA trial qualify ) . Group B consist patient previously enrol currently follow qualify study . Group C consist antiretroviral-naive patient enrol qualify study ( i.e. , patient start treatment outside FIRST study patient defer treatment ) . Patients Group A undergo monitoring select clinical laboratory parameter ( include plasma HIV RNA level CD4 cell count ) every 4 week begin completion follow-up appointment protocol enrol . Patients Groups B C undergo monitoring select clinical laboratory parameter ( include plasma HIV RNA level CD4 cell count ) every 4 month . Patients follow least 5 year . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 2/28/01 : Patients follow qualify protocol antiretroviral naive enrollment previously enrol FIRST ( CPCRA 058 ) protocol undergo blood draw enrollment annually measurement plasma HIV level CPCRA-approved laboratory future CPCRA-approved , HIV-related research . Patients relocate non-CPCRA affiliated site ask sign consent ongoing release ( every 4 month ) medical record new health care provider CPCRA . ]</detailed_description>
