	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : TIMI IIIA TIMI IIIB follow contract-supported clinical trial , Thrombolysis Myocardial Infarction ( TIMI I , TIMI IIA , TIMI II ) . Myocardial ischemic syndrome account large portion annual mortality morbidity cause industrialized country encompass wide clinical-pathologic spectrum . At one end spectrum patient chronic stable angina . When studied coronary arteriography , patient usually obstructive atherosclerotic disease evidence fresh thrombosis . At end spectrum patient acute myocardial infarction present discrete episode prolong chest pain accompanied persistent ST-segment elevation . Such patient high incidence thrombotic coronary artery occlusion early intravenous administration thrombolytic agent show re-establish perfusion , limit extent leave ventricular dysfunction , reduce early in-hospital late one year mortality group . Patients non-Q-wave myocardial infarction unstable angina fall two extreme . In day week follow onset disorder , prognosis survival well patient Q-wave myocardial infarction bad patient stable angina . Some patient unstable angina progress acute myocardial infarction , non-Q-wave infarction experience unstable course reinfarction . Although others recover acute episode without subsequent infarction reinfarction , frequently severe obstructive coronary artery disease may leave severe chronic stable angina . National summary hospital record indicate 750,000 patient hospitalize yearly unstable angina 250,000 non-Q-wave myocardial infarction . Once result creatine kinase measurement serial electrocardiogram available , identification patient experience non-Q-wave myocardial infarction relatively simple . Identification patient experience unstable angina difficult , since numerous definition condition offer . There agreement , however , two important feature unstable angina . First , ischemia usually develop rest precipitate minimal exertion ; differs chronic stable angina , ischemic episode precipitate physical exertion strong emotion resultant increase myocardial oxygen demand . Second , ischemia often associate transient ST-segment depression elevation , contrast persistent ST-segment elevation characteristic patient develop Q-wave infarction . It observe small number patient , unlike patient chronic stable ischemia , patient unstable angina non-Q-wave myocardial infarction frequently thrombus major coronary artery . Initial conventional therapy unstable angina consist bed rest , oxygen , nitrate , beta-blockers , calcium antagonist , aspirin . The use heparin widespread controversial . In many tertiary care hospital , angiography follow PTCA frequently perform , whereas community hospital patient often manage without angiography . Prior TIMI III trial , patient non-Q-wave myocardial infarction usually treat way patient Q-wave myocardial infarction treat prior advent thrombolytic therapy . Neither heparin therapy thrombolytic therapy routinely employ , although knowledge role thrombosis patient condition raise possibility one approach might helpful . Although early prognosis favorable , awareness longer-term prognosis serious follow Q-wave myocardial infarction lead increase use follow-up coronary angiography identify patient PTCA CABG might useful . Whether revascularization improve prognosis patient establish . Previous study thrombolytic therapy unstable angina non-Q-wave myocardial infarction limit number size . The result suggest benefit , significance benefit relation risk cost therapy remain answered . Also , value routine , early coronary angiography follow PTCA and/or CABG still unclear condition . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The two clinical trial initiate simultaneously different group TIMI III clinical center . All patient enrol study receive standard coronary care unit care , include bed rest oxygen . In TIMI IIIA , patient receive baseline angiogram randomize double-blind manner t-PA placebo . All patient receive intravenous heparin . The primary endpoint number patient successful result therapy , define improvement TIMI perfusion two grade ( 0 2 3 , 1 3 ) ten percent reduction severity stenosis . The reduction base comparison baseline angiogram follow-up angiogram obtain 18 48 hour later . Patients TIMI IIIA enrol nine month period . The total duration 24 month , include 12 month data analysis . In TIMI IIIB , total 1,473 patient see within 24 hour ischemic chest pain rest , consider represent unstable angina non-Q-wave myocardial infarction ( NQMI ) , randomize use 2 x 2 factorial design compare t-PA versus placebo initial therapy early invasive strategy consist early coronary arteriography follow revascularization anatomy suitable versus early conservative strategy consist coronary arteriography follow revascularization initial medical therapy fail . All patient treat bed rest , anti-ischemic medication , aspirin , heparin . The primary endpoint t-PA placebo comparison death , myocardial infarction , failure initial therapy six week . Randomization begin October 1989 conclude June 1992 . The primary endpoint early invasive early conservative strategy death , post randomization myocardial infarction unsatisfactory exercise tolerance test ( ETT ) six week . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
