	<brief_summary>To evaluate safety anti-HIV CTL therapy early stage patient verify safety combine antiviral therapy zidovudine/lamivudine/indinavir low-dose interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) . To compare effect plasma cell-associated viral load follow combination drug therapy without antiviral CTL early-stage patient . To study detail immune effect lower viral burden antiviral combination drug without T cell infusion antiviral CTL activity , viral suppression proliferation , circulate T cell phenotype , T cell apoptosis , CD4 cell number , DTH reaction , inflammatory cytokine level . In HIV-infected person , ongoing struggle HIV replication host immune control . In past decade therapeutic strategy target virus . This approach frustrate viral mutation evade drug sensitivity . Promising drug recently approve encouraging sustained result combination antiviral chemotherapy . However , even potent drug regimen seem curative , may eventually lead drug resistance may completely restore lose immune function . The addition immune-based therapy antiviral drug may lead good viral control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In HIV-infected person , ongoing struggle HIV replication host immune control . In past decade therapeutic strategy target virus . This approach frustrate viral mutation evade drug sensitivity . Promising drug recently approve encouraging sustained result combination antiviral chemotherapy . However , even potent drug regimen seem curative , may eventually lead drug resistance may completely restore lose immune function . The addition immune-based therapy antiviral drug may lead good viral control . This study 2 regimen 8 patient . Patients randomize CTL infusion . Patients stratify viral load ( le 10,000 copies/ml vs. great equal 10,000 copies/ml ) . All patient receive combination drug therapy AZT/3TC/indinavir 9 month time patient option continue study regimen another year change therapy . Patients T cell treatment regimen ( regimen 2 ) receive 2 infusion ex vivo expand autologous anti-HIV CTL 3 6 month begin AZT/3TC/indinavir therapy . The second infusion administer low-dose sc IL-2 1 day 4 day follow T cell infusion .</detailed_description>
