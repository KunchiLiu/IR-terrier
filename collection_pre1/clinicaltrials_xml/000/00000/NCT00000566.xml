	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In 1983 , reliable data incidence pulmonary embolism adult population group identify risk available sensitivity specificity diagnostic procedure determine . Estimates suggest half million episode pulmonary embolism hospitalize patient year United States . Deaths attributable pulmonary embolism would expect one third patient leave untreated . The clinical diagnosis pulmonary embolism subject high frequency false positive false negative . The definitive diagnostic procedure pulmonary angiography , invasive , expensive procedure without risk . It require specialized equipment highly trained personnel performance interpretation . Therefore , use diagnose pulmonary embolism major medical center . Another technique utilized method diagnose pulmonary embolism involve combination perfusion ventilation scanning ; method minimally invasive . A normal perfusion scan think considerable value essentially exclude diagnosis pulmonary embolism . In select patient population , abnormal perfusion scan combine normal ventilation scan substantial help diagnosis . Although acceptable validation use perfusion scan diagnosis pulmonary embolism , thousand patient evaluate pulmonary embolism base perfusion scan often use method image consider inadequate . In early 1980s , clinical practice interpret negative perfusion scan overwhelming evidence presence pulmonary embolus . This interpretation adequately test either prospective study long-term follow-up patient determine clinical outcome . With regard positive perfusion scan , data suggest many two-thirds positive perfusion scan could subsequently confirm pulmonary angiography . Prospective study timely angiograms use selective injection improve image technique need evaluate usefulness positive perfusion scan . Phase I initiate September 1983 . Protocols develop Phase I underwent independent assessment review April 1984 review approve May 1984 National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council . Recruitment intervention start January 1985 end September 1986 . Follow-up complete September 30 , 1987 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Patients suspect pulmonary embolism underwent ventilation-perfusion scan . Patients abnormal perfusion scan underwent angiography . All patient follow one year .</detailed_description>
