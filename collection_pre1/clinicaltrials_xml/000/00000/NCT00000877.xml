	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety give indinavir rifabutin time ( simultaneously ) v 4 hour apart ( stagger ) HIV-positive HIV-negative adult . It important determine medication HIV-associated disease , Mycobacterium avium complex ( MAC ) disease , give safely effectively anti-HIV drug . Indinavir rifabutin give simultaneously past good result . This study seek examine stagger dos make 2 drug effective . HIV-negative volunteer use study examine effect rifabutin indinavir effect stagger rifabutin dos . The effect rifabutin drug activity indinavir evaluate HIV-positive patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study How Indinavir ( Anti-HIV Drug ) Rifabutin ( Drug Used Treat MAC , HIV-Associated Disease ) Interact HIV-Positive HIV-Negative Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , rifabutin rifamycin administer indinavir . ACTG 365 first formal study pharmacokinetics dose combination regimen HIV seropositive patient . It hypothesize staggered administration rifabutin indinavir might minimize pharmacokinetic interaction . If intestinal tract play significant role presystemic clearance rifabutin , inhibitory activity indinavir rifabutin could depend either luminal concentration indinavir , systematic concentration indinavir , . If luminal concentration important , interaction 2 drug maximal administer simultaneously , minimal oral administration stagger . Finally , since indinavir half-life 1.8 hour , effect rifabutin 's systematic clearance may much less administration drug stagger 4 hour compare simultaneous administration rifabutin . If interaction rifabutin minimize , rifabutin level may suboptimal treatment tuberculosis patient administer 2 drug simultaneously . It , therefore , important define magnitude effect stagger vs simultaneous drug administration order clarify dose regimen recommendation HIV-infected patient tuberculosis also require protease inhibitor therapy . Study Arm A multiple-dose , 3-period , sequential study 18 evaluable HIV-infected indinavir-naive male female volunteer [ AS PER AMENDMENT 11/16/98 : Arm A assessed 18 evaluable HIV-seronegative patient ] . Patients receive 3 different treatment consist 14 day administration : rifabutin alone ( Period IA ) ; indinavir plus rifabutin ( Period IIA ) ; indinavir plus rifabutin ( Period IIIA ) . Study Arm B multiple-dose , 2-period , sequential study 10 evaluable HIV-infected male female volunteer . Patients receive 2 different treatment , consist 14 day administration ; indinavir alone ( Period IB ) ; indinavir plus rifabutin ( Period IIB ) . Patients arm take dose study medication water . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 8/8/97 : Patients treat Arm A randomized , following Period IA therapy , Period IIA IIIA therapy 14 day , crossed alternate regimen 14 day . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 4/17/98 : After completion therapy Arm A B , patient continue therapy indinavir alone 7 day . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 11/16/98 : The final 7 day indinavir dose eliminate patient Arm A . Also per amendment , ensure compliance , Arm A patient ' rifabutin supply dispense container fit electronic monitoring cap device . ]</detailed_description>
