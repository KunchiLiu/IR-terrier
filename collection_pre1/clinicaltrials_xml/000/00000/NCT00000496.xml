	<brief_title>Platelet Drug Trial Coronary Disease Progression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Coronary atherosclerosis lead cause death country develop country world . Although modern coronary care unit result markedly decreased hospital mortality acute myocardial infarction , especially patient enter hospital early , overall impact limit since two-thirds patient die coronary disease reach hospital . When trial initiate 1979 , new approach medical treatment coronary disease complication need effort direct towards prevention progression prevention complication medical therapy . This prevention could save significant health care dollar long-term especially need aortocoronary bypass graft surgery incidence myocardial infarction could reduce . Early identification patient risk develop coronary disease early coronary artery lesion would allow great impact successful intervention therapy . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , double-blind . The patient experimental group treat dipyridamole aspirin five year . Patients control group receive lactose placebo . The primary endpoint angiographic evidence progression coronary artery disease development new coronary disease . Secondary endpoint include total mortality , cardiac mortality , mortality due myocardial infarction , incidence new myocardial infarction . Recruitment end December 1982 . The study completion date list record obtain statement immediately ( `` Recruitment end December 1982 '' ) confirm Query/View/Report ( QVR ) System .</detailed_description>
