	<brief_summary>This study look different anti-HIV drug regimen see work best keep level HIV ( viral load ) blood low possible maintenance therapy . You assign randomly ( like toss coin ) 1 3 group : Group 1 : Didanosine plus stavudine plus hydroxyurea ( ddI/d4T/HU ) . Group 2 : Didanosine plus stavudine plus efavirenz ( ddI/d4T/EFV ) . Group 3 : This group patient remain current drug regimen . This study last approximately 3 year ; receive study medication duration study . Anti-HIV drug regimen include protease inhibitor ( PIs ) good lower viral load . However , patient rise HIV level PI maintenance . It may possible keep HIV level low use another class drug maintenance easy take less expensive PIs . If viral load increase patient take second group drug , may possible restart PI drug regimen decrease HIV level .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Compare Effectiveness Different Anti-HIV Drug Regimens Keeping Levels HIV Blood Low Possible</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Combination antiretroviral therapy use protease inhibitor ( PIs ) capable suppress plasma HIV RNA undetectable level . However , approximately 10 % patient achieve undetectable viral load experience detectable rise HIV RNA year . When HIV replication suppress low level , may possible consolidate antiretroviral therapy simpler potentially less toxic `` maintenance '' regimen without PI . Such regimen would ideally potent enough continue maintain viral suppression use agent well tolerate , easily salvage , less expensive , and/or convenient PI-containing regimen . Subsequent rise HIV viremia non-PI maintenance regimen may respond resumption pre-maintenance PI-containing regimen , extend use potent PI class . Patients randomize 1:1:1 treatment ddI/d4T/HU ( Arm A ) versus ddI/d4T/EFV ( Arm B ) versus continuation pre-entry PI-containing regimen ( Arm C ) . Viral load measure Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , every 8 week 3 year . Upon virologic failure ( plasma HIV RNA great equal 200 copies/ml ) , drug intolerance , patient maintenance regimen ( Arms A B ) restart pre-entry PI-containing regimen . Patients Arm C manage accord best medical judgment primary care provider event virologic failure .</detailed_description>
