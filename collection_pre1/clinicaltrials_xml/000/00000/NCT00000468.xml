	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In past , patient acute myocardial infarction treat put bed . It felt symptom electrocardiographic sign acute myocardial infarction occur , process complete heart patient rest would allow illness run course heart heal . The focus treatment Coronary Intensive Care Unit prevent complication acute myocardial infarction , primarily arrhythmia lead cardiac arrest treatment cardiac arrest . Acute phase morbidity mortality relate loss myocardium infarction change . Post-discharge mortality morbidity , large part , related occurrence congestive heart failure , secondary loss myocardium infarction . Efforts preserve myocardium pharmacologic intervention limit demand , result significant benefit . It recognize infarction complete presentation , occur wavefront period four six hour , 80 90 percent patient , infarction due thrombus infarct-related artery . Therefore , reperfusion jeopardize myocardium window four six hour could result salvage myocardium resultant decrease acute mortality well acute chronic morbidity mortality myocardial failure . The international streptokinase trial establish feasibility intravenous coronary thrombolysis streptokinase demonstrate decrease acute morality range 18 percent 50 percent , depend upon interval onset chest pain initiation thrombolytic therapy . Furthermore , preservation ventricular function , reflect ejection fraction , great early administration . The TIMI trial tissue plasminogen activator ( TPA ) , clot-specific streptokinase , substantiate effectiveness . The initiation thrombolytic therapy TPA early possible onset symptom offer advantage , therefore , term reduction acute mortality salvage ischemic myocardium . Although thrombolysis perform community hospital enroute hospital specially trained team use helicopter transport , one major study report systematically evaluate benefit early on-the-scene thrombolysis . This study document significant benefit term salvage myocardium patient thrombolytic therapy initiate arrival hospital , direct function time . This program use physician ambulance evaluate indication contraindication thrombolytic therapy field . The propose study would evaluate ability paramedic , physician remote control , accurately evaluate patient field term indication contra-indications thrombolytic therapy , ass possible benefit term salvage myocardium patient transport hospital paramedic squad oppose arrive ordinary mean . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In Phase I , paramedic take electrocardiograms patient meet definition case administer abbreviated questionnaire . This phase test feasibility paramedic make diagnosis acute myocardial infarction basis clinical history support computerize electrocardiogram , come appropriate decision initiate thrombolytic therapy basis field database , recognize appropriate contraindication thrombolytic therapy without remote physician supervision . An analysis conduct pre-hospital selection patient thrombolytic therapy . Criteria approval move Phase II include correct identification appropriate case treatment 75 percent time , less five percent inappropriate case contraindication thrombolytic therapy , one percent select case find initial life-threatening hemorrhagic condition . Beginning November 1988 , Phase II compare initiation thrombolysis tissue plasminogen activator ( TPA ) field initiation hospital . During Phase II , last 24 month , one half patient meet case definition receive paramedic administration intravenous thrombolytic therapy one half receive pre-hospital diagnostic step treatment administer transport hospital . The 360 patient symptoms six hour less , risk factor serious bleeding , ST-segment elevation , select paramedic remote physician inclusion trial . They allocate aspirin alteplase treatment initiated hospital arrival . Intravenous sodium heparin administer group hospital . Nineteen hospital Seattle King County area participate . The primary endpoint rank composite score ( combine death , stroke , serious bleeding , infarct size ) . The relation time treatment outcome ( composite score , infarct size , ejection fraction , mortality ) also assess . In Phase II , myocardial infarction registry establish include patient hospitalized area discharge diagnosis acute myocardial infarction . The registry place trial finding community-based perspective aid interpretation trial finding assess proportion case seek paramedic care determine characteristic patient contrast arriving hospital mean . The record patient admit directly coronary care unit Seattle King County survey . Study personnel examine difference , , paramedic transport group regard clinical history , treatment , complication , hospital discharge rate . Of case registry , 300 arrive hospital mean paramedic transport compare paramedic-transported case respect incidence new Q-wave infarction first last electrocardiogram , interview determine onset , severity , duration symptom , reason choose one type care emergency situation .</detailed_description>
