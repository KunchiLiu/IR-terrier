	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The Trial Antihypertensive Intervention Management extension NHLBI-supported Dietary Intervention Study Hypertension ( DISH ) conclude March 1984 show either weight reduction sodium restriction diet reduce relapse rate hypertensives received long-term drug treatment withdrawn drug . TAIM initiate April 1984 continue four year three center add DISH art evaluate combine drug dietary treatment . COTAIM continue three clinical site July 1988 . Analysis COTAIM result continue November 1994 grant R01HL40072 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : TAIM patient randomly assign one three diet one three drug regimen . The dietary intervention consist weight loss program , sodium reduction increase potassium intake , change diet . The drug regimen consist beta-blocker ( atenolol ) , thiazide-like diuretic ( chlorthalidone ) , placebo . The major endpoint change diastolic blood pressure six month intervention . Individuals reach goal blood pressure six month receive additional drug . Other endpoint include total risk factor score change , psychological function , lifestyle change . COTAIM consist two study total 600 subject . COTAIM I compare TAIM weight loss group randomly select half usual diet group . The primary endpoint COTAIM I degree control blood pressure initial TAIM therapy TAIM baseline end COTAIM , five year period . COTAIM II add weight loss regimen sodium restriction/potassium supplementation group half usual diet group . The primary outcome control blood pressure initial TAIM therapy COTAIM baseline end COTAIM , two-year period .</detailed_description>
