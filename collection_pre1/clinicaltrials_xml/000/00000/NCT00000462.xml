	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The management patient symptomatic coronary heart disease evolve considerably past twenty year application invasive technique ever increase proportion patient . With refinement CABG surgery past twenty year , operative myocardial revascularization feasible patient myocardial ischemia . Several multicenter , randomize trial report , compare medical surgical management patient coronary artery disease . Based three large trial extensive observational literature , consensus appear emerge regard circumstance medical surgical management appear method choice . It clear CABG relieve angina vast majority patient severe symptom . It also apparent procedure perform low risk experience operative team . Thus , CABG indicate patient suitable coronary anatomy severe angina refractory medical therapy significant obstruction leave main coronary artery . The timing operative intervention patient less severe angina point dispute present . It , however , apparent certain category patient improved survival elective bypass surgery . These category include patient leave main coronary stenosis , triple vessel disease modestly impair ventricular function , possibly clinically define high risk patient . The remain patient mild , symptomatic coronary disease , would appear , afford defer operative intervention time symptom worsen require palliation . Long-term information available patient CABG early 1970s . By ten year substantial progression disease present native coronary circulation bypass graft . Investigators report many two-thirds vein bypass graft close narrowed intrinsic coronary disease progress many one-half non-bypassed vessel 10 year follow surgery . The timing surgery less severely symptomatic patient , strategy decrease disease progression graft vessel native circulation , renew interest use internal mammary artery revascularize heart active research issue present . PTCA first apply human coronary disease 1977 . There major advance catheter design , balloon construction , identification high low risk patient procedure . Experienced angioplasty team successfully dilate severe lesion 90 percent patient attempt . This success rate achieve less one percent operative mortality less five percent myocardial infarction and/or emergent coronary artery bypass graft surgery . However , many one-third successfully dilated patient experience return angina within follow six month one year , reflect restenosis dilate lesion . Most individual successfully undergo second dilatation . Thus , two quite effective intervention available patient symptomatic coronary artery disease sufficient require palliation mechanical mean . Each strengths weakness . PTCA relatively noninvasive , require initially few hospital day less intensive care , preserve vein mediastinum CABG require later . However , lesion present patient multivessel disease dilate . There substantial risk restenosis recurrence symptom , small finite risk undergo immediate CABG surgery follow fail PTCA , considerably increase risk surgery . CABG surgery result complete revascularization relatively low short-term graft closure , do acute risk approximately equal PTCA . However , apparent surgical intervention change patient 's propensity atherosclerosis ; ten year two-thirds graft compromise atherosclerosis thrombosis progression atherosclerosis native , non-bypassed coronary circulation roughly one-half patient . Second operation considerably difficult technically , carry high operative risk , result less dramatic relief symptom . There substantial population patient severe , symptomatic , multivessel coronary disease unclear whether PTCA CABG apply first . In September 1984 , Workshop Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery recommend consideration clinical trial involve surgery angioplasty . An NHLBI Task Force , establish January 1985 , recommend clinical trial multivessel coronary artery disease consider Institute . The Cardiology Advisory Committee unanimously recommend design execution trial . In September 1985 , National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council discuss clinical trial initiative recommend enthusiastically . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Patients receive coronary arteriography clinical unit severe angina unstable angina , without antecedent myocardial infarction , ask participate study . A total 2,013 eligible patient refuse randomization 422 ineligible basis angiographic finding ask participate follow-up registry . The remain patient randomize , 914 CABG 915 PTCA , August 1988 August 1991 . Baseline data include clinical profile , 12-lead electrocardiogram , information coronary angiographic feature , angina functional status , medication , risk factor , quality life . Initial revascularization perform within two week randomization . Angiograms ( baseline sub study direct 1 year 5 year ) , ECG 's interpreted respective core laboratory . Scheduled multiple stage PTCA count single procedure . New interventional device , stent , use initial revascularization . Follow-up visit conduct clinic week four fourteen study entry one , three , five year , telephone contact six month two four year . The importance risk factor modification emphasize throughout study patient primary physician . The primary end point mortality cause . The trial extend November 2002 complete minimum ten-year followup BARI patient , determine relative efficacy PTCA versus CABG subgroup woman , Blacks , diabetic , elderly , assess public health impact BARI . In followup , currently enrol patient annual telephone interview . At ten year , electrocardiogram obtain patient blood lipid level perform randomized patient . All hospitalization occur since last contact identify annual telephone contact . Angina assess precede six week . At patient contact , patient instruct behavior modification area smoke cessation , exercise , diet . Angiographic study also conduct part ten-year follow-up . The four center participate first phase BARI activity conduct angiogram . Patients consist establish cohort drawn randomize participant complete one five year angiogram . A substudy BARI , Study Economics Quality Life ( SEQOL ) , initially fund Robert Wood Johnson Foundation ass impact specific revascularization quality life , functional economic ( hospital physician charge ) outcomes patient randomized BARI , examine factor treatment affect outcome . Beginning July 1997 , support SEQOL assume NHLBI grant R01HL58324 . The grant , end June 2002 , extend follow-up randomized SEQOL substudy cohort ( 752 subject survive May 1 , 1996 ) ten year study long-term determinant cost quality life develop model project impact technologic change outcomes cost CABG PTCA . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
