	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether high-quality protein food supplement help HIV-positive patient maintain , possibly gain , muscle mass . Many HIV-positive patient lose weight unable regain . This may patient eat enough protein eat right kind protein . The protein eat food ( meat , egg , bean ) may able make amount protein lose due HIV infection .

	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate High Protein Supplementation HIV-Positive Patients With Stable Weight Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In many HIV-infected individual prior weight loss , failure regain weight lean tissue least part consequence inadequate protein intake ingestion poor-quality protein rather total caloric intake . Dietary source protein presumably inadequate meet high metabolic need cause HIV infection . To achieve target protein intake range ( 1.5 2.0 g/kg/day ) demonstrate catabolic disease necessary achieve positive nitrogen balance generate substantial anabolic effect , study administer supplement contain high-quality protein . Two group 28 patient randomly choose receive either oral nutritional supplement ( Optimune ) contain increased amount high-quality protein ( whey ) , rich cysteine glutamine , isocaloric , identical-tasting supplement without add whey protein amino acid supplementation . Weight , body composition , anthropometry , dietary intake , general physical health assess baseline Weeks 6 12 . Plasma cysteine , glutathione , C-reactive protein , prealbumin , along urine IL-6 , sTNFrII , IL-1ra , assess baseline Week 12 .</detailed_description>
