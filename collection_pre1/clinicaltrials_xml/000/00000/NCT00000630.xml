	<brief_summary>To determine priming ( give first vaccination ) vaccinia recombinant ( HIVAC-1e ) provide significant advantage immunogenicity ( production antibody ) compare prim soluble recombinant protein ( gp160 ) ; learn safety combination use two HIV envelope vaccine utilize study . Recent study AIDS vaccine unit show safety two candidate HIV vaccine , HIVAC-1e gp160 . Specific question address part study include : Does combination vaccination result synergistic ( add ) response predict addition second vaccination , synergism depend unique prim effect vaccinia recombinant , combination ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recent study AIDS vaccine unit show safety two candidate HIV vaccine , HIVAC-1e gp160 . Specific question address part study include : Does combination vaccination result synergistic ( add ) response predict addition second vaccination , synergism depend unique prim effect vaccinia recombinant , combination ? Volunteers randomize one four group . Group A ( 20 volunteer ) receive gp160 ( VaxSyn ) follow two month later repeat dose . Group B ( 20 volunteer ) receive VaxSyn follow two month later HIVAC-1e . Group C ( 20 volunteer ) receive HIVAC-1e follow two month later VaxSyn . Group D ( 10 volunteer ) receive HIVAC-1e follow two month later HIVAC-1e . For volunteer Groups A , B , C react initial vaccination , second attempt obtain reaction may make 7 day follow initial inoculation . Per addendum , two additional booster inoculation give : one 6 month later post initial inoculation ( Groups A , C , D receive VaxSyn Group B receive HIVAC-1e ) another 12 month later ( Groups receive VaxSyn ) .</detailed_description>
