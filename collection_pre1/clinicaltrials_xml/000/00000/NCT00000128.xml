	<brief_summary>To test hypothesis correction bifocal spectacle lenses rather single-vision lens slow progression myopia child near-point esophoria . The primary outcome variable cycloplegic refraction measure automated refractor . Axial length measure ultrasound order test corollary hypothesis use bifocals slow ocular growth myopic child . We also examine amount close work perform subject degree parental myopia factor may influence myopia progression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Bifocals Myopic Children With Esophoria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About 25 percent person United States myopic . The common form myopia childhood myopia , begin age 6 progress rapidly age 16 . Myopia progression result excessive growth eye , primarily enlargement vitreous chamber . Excessive elongation eye major risk factor retinal detachment . Previous prospective study fail show use bifocals effective slow myopia progression . However , study separate subject near-point phoria randomization . Retrospective study David Goss indicate bifocals slow myopia progression almost 50 percent child near-point esophoria effect child exophoria . A small , prospective pilot study , complete investigator trial , also support hypothesis bifocals slow myopia progression child near-point esophoria . Thirty-two myopic child , show near-point esophoria , enrol 18-month study . Twenty-eight child complete study , 14 randomize bifocals 14 single-vision lens . Cycloplegic automate refraction perform every 6 month . Over course whole study , small , statistically insignificant difference rate myopia progression : 0.57 diopter per year ( D/yr ) ( S.E . = 0.11 ) single-vision lens compare 0.36 D/yr ( S.E . = 0.12 ) bifocals ( p = 0.26 ) . However , significant seasonal effect myopia progression demonstrate , result also suggest beneficial effect bifocals may take several month develop . During first 6 month , include school year , myopia progression rapid bifocal group ( 0.61 D/yr ) single-vision group ( 0.68 D/yr ) . During second 6 month , include summer vacation , myopia progression slow group , 0.32 0.26 D/yr bifocal wearer single-vision wearer , respectively . During last 6 month , i.e. , second school year , myopia progress slowly bifocal wearer ( 0.37 D/yr ) rapidly ( 0.80 D/yr ) single-vision wearer . A repeated-measure analysis variance demonstrate significant seasonal effect ( p &lt; 0.002 ) significant interaction season type correction ( p &lt; 0.043 ) . The apparent effectiveness bifocals child near-point esophoria lack effectiveness child may explain great lag accommodation child esophoria . This lag might cause slightly blur retinal image bifocal may sharpen . Other mechanism might also involve . Eighty myopic child , near-point esophoria measure baseline von Graefe prism current myopic correction place phoropter , randomly assign wear either single-vision spectacle lenses lenses +1.50 D add flat-top 28-mm segment . Subjects visit one two site , either private optometry practice Tulsa optometry clinic Northeastern State University , every 6 month . Data collect visit include automate refraction cycloplegia 1 percent tropicamide , biometry A-scan , estimate amount study close work mean questionnaire administer subject parent . We also obtain measure degree myopia biological parent . The myopic correction change spherical component refraction either eye change 0.5 diopter change cylinder power axis improve vision either eye three letter . The study continue 30 month include six visit subject .</detailed_description>
