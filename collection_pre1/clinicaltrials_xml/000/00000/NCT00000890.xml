	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether HIV-positive patient extremely low viral load ( level HIV blood ) great gain lean tissue anti-HIV ( antiretroviral ) therapy patient higher viral load . Many HIV-positive patient experience change body composition ( muscle , fat , etc . ) antiretroviral therapy . However , weight gain take antiretrovirals mostly fat . A patient 's viral load may affect whether weight gain result increase fat increase muscle . A large-scale study need closely evaluate effect antiretroviral therapy body composition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Effect Anti-HIV Therapy Lean Tissue ( Muscle ) HIV-Positive Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Effective antiretroviral therapy , measure decrease HIV-1 RNA level , may sustain improve important component body composition , perhaps decrease underlie pro-inflammatory activity rest energy expenditure . Moderate weight gain report associated HAART . Meaningful increase total body weight , however , may need comprised augmentation lean body mass ( primarily muscle ) , since mortality HIV cancer waste associate sizable decrease lean body mass ( LBM ) evidence increase fat cell mass protective . To date , large-scale prospective evaluation effect HAART body composition . Nor determine whether increase body weight specific component body composition ( fat lean body mass ) person lose substantive amount weight protects AIDS-defining complication prolongs survival . This 48-week , observational study lean body mass , appetite , functional performance , systemic marker inflammation highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) patient co-enrolled ACTG antiretroviral study . Patients stratify body mass index ( BMI ) 2 cohort : le 23 kg/m2 versus great equal 23 28 kg/m2 . At select study visit , time antiretroviral medication change , follow diagnosis AIDS-defining event , follow assess : height ( screen visit ) , weight , lean body mass , appetite ( questionnaire ) , functional performance ( questionnaire ) , marker systemic inflammation .</detailed_description>
