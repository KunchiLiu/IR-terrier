	<brief_title>Familial Atherosclerosis Treatment Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : For several decade , clinical trial address question whether treatment hyperlipidemia reduces risk cardiovascular event . Substantial evidence support idea cardiovascular benefit relate degree reduction low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level perhaps degree increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level . In trial , change lipid level usually small overall clinical benefit limit . The appearance 1980s effective treatment hyperlipidemia , new arteriographic method assess atherosclerosis , new insight atherogenesis permit objective investigation whether progression atherosclerosis retard reversed lipid-lowering agent . The clinical trial support subproject within program project grant . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled . Baseline arteriogram perform fast lipid sample draw heparinization . Patients stratify age 45 year , cigarette smoking within previous month , lipid pattern include familial hypercholesterolemia triglyceride level . Patients give dietary counseling randomly assign one three treatment : lovastatin ( 20 mg twice day ) colestipol ( 10 g three time day ) ; niacin ( 1 g four time day ) colestipol ( 10 g three time day ) : conventional therapy placebo ( colestipol LDL cholesterol level elevate ) . The primary endpoint measure change severity disease proximal coronary artery measure quantitative arteriography .</detailed_description>
