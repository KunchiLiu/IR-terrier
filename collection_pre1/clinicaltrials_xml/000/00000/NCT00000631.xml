	<brief_summary>Primary : To determine whether additional boosting soluble recombinant gp160 vaccine ( VaxSyn ) prim vaccinia-HIV envelope recombinant ( HIVAC-1e ) provide significant advantage degree duration immunogenicity . Secondary : To learn safety combination use two HIV envelope vaccine study ( VaxSyn HIVAC-1e ) . Recent Phase I trials conducted AIDS Vaccine Units show antibody persist recipient 6 month boost , response seem significantly high persistent response achieve two dos soluble protein vaccine alone two dos HIVAC-1e alone . This study test previously recruit cohort volunteer whether additional boosting soluble recombinant gp160 result increase immunogenicity longer duration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recent Phase I trials conducted AIDS Vaccine Units show antibody persist recipient 6 month boost , response seem significantly high persistent response achieve two dos soluble protein vaccine alone two dos HIVAC-1e alone . This study test previously recruit cohort volunteer whether additional boosting soluble recombinant gp160 result increase immunogenicity longer duration . Twelve volunteer previously receive two dos HIVAC-1e ( DryVax ) two dos gp160 receive additional boost gp160 12-20 month last boost additional dose HIVAC-1e least 9 month final gp160 boost .</detailed_description>
