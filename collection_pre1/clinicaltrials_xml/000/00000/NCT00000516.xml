	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Approximately two million Americans suffer heart failure . Since prevalence congestive heart failure know increase age , improvement average life expectancy would expect increase magnitude problem next decade . While advance treatment hypertension , coronary artery disease , surgical treatment congenital valvular heart disease prolong survival , many patient ultimately develop heart failure later life . The therapy congestive heart failure undergone rapid change . Until early 1970s , mainstay therapy patient acute chronic congestive heart failure digitalis diuretic . The use digitalis patient heart failure secondary ischemic heart disease severe leave ventricular failure either nonischemic ischemic origin , however , controversial . Controversy acute long-term effect digitalis lead introduction variety alternative supplemental therapeutic approach patient heart failure . In mid 1980s , wide spectrum vasodilator available . New , time , inotropic agent , also find application alternative supplement digitalis administration . Although drug show benefit management patient chronic heart failure , inadequate information long-term hemodynamic effect agent practically information regard effect survival . The recognition patient congestive heart failure often elevate peripheral vascular resistance lead introduction vasodilator therapy . Of vasodilator , angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor appear promise show counteract major adverse hormonal vasoconstrictor mechanism , relieve symptom , diminish cardiac dilatation myocardial infarction , improve exercise capacity ejection fraction . SOLVD initiated 1986 primarily evaluate effect enalapril , angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor . Two consideration influence design SOLVD : possible drug treatment give patient already manifest congestive heart failure might beneficial initiate treatment asymptomatic leave ventricular dysfunction patient ; early treatment asymptomatic patient might less beneficial , patient might measurable activation renin-angiotensin axis . The Request Proposals release August 1984 first award make July 1985 . A second Request Proposals additional clinical center release March 1985 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Both trial randomize double-blind . Prior randomization , patient receive enalapril , placebo two week enable early detection non-compliant patient , unable tolerate drug , early side-effects . After completion pre-randomization period , participant allocate enalapril placebo use permuted block randomization within clinical center . Follow-up visit schedule two six week randomization four , eight , twelve month . Thereafter , clinic visit schedule four-month interval . Patients follow minimum two year maximum five year . Primary outcome trial all-cause mortality . Secondary endpoint include cardiovascular mortality , sudden death due worsen congestive heart failure , hospitalization congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction , stroke , need cardiac transplantation , quality life . Onset congestive heart failure additional outcome Prevention Trial . Seven substudies conduct among subset participant include : diastolic function ; echocardiography ; exercise ; neurohumoral ; quality life ; radionuclide ; sudden death . Patient recruitment begin July 1986 . Recruitment Treatment Trial end six month ahead schedule February 1989 , follow-up end February 1991 . The Prevention Trial end recruitment April 1990 complete follow-up July 1991 . Data analysis continue November 1994 . The trial also include registry enrol 6,300 patient study influence number patient characteristic mortality . Eighteen clinical center participate . Data collect consecutive patient ejection fraction less .45 radiologic evidence congestive heart failure twelve month period . At one year , patient 's vital status ascertain mail , necessary , telephone follow-up . One year follow-up complete registry patient May 1990 . Longer term follow-up do National Death Index .</detailed_description>
