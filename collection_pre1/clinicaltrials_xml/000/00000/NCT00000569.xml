	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , fourth lead cause death United States major cause morbidity , spectrum chronic lung disease include clinical diagnosis chronic bronchitis , emphysema , combination . Varying degree bronchoreactivity occur entire spectrum . Asthma COPD many feature common . Distinction usually dependent clinical feature clinical course . The diagnosis asthma exclude patient designation COPD study , although criteria exclusion include recent ( within six month ) use inhaled oral steroid intent exclude clearly predominantly bronchospastic . The morbid anatomy COPD well describe include many feature acute chronic inflammation . There well support evidence literature inflammatory process may important pathogenetic mechanism development emphysema . On basis , rationale use corticosteroid well justified . There various publish study suggest inhaled steroid reduce bronchial lavage marker inflammation , variously influence short-term bronchial hyperreactivity , improve lung function acutely short-term , slow rate decline lung function . Most study ask improvement rather stability . However , despite study support contention lack long-term information , inhaled steroid COPD become widely use clinical practice . It intent clinical trial ass long-term efficacy treatment therapy become accepted community practice , make impractical impossible conduct clinical trial . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Subjects recruit Lung Health Study I randomize 1200 microgram triamcinolone daily divide dos placebo . Pulmonary function evaluate every six month . Bronchial activity test baseline , nine month , three-and-a-half year use methacholine inhalation challenge . Mean duration follow-up 40 month . The primary outcome measure rate decline pulmonary function assess post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) value . Other outcome measure include death , respiratory symptom , quality life , side-effects toxicity , adherence , bronchial hyperreactivity , atopic status , smoke status . Recruitment initiate November 1994 end November 28 , 1995 allow 3.5 4.5 year follow-up April , 1999 . The investigator initiate dose monitor ( puff counter ) protocol nine center among fair satisfactory compliers ( 4 9 puff versus ideal 12 puff per day ) test whether memory aid would enhance inhaler compliance . Consenting participant randomize Group 1 could see display puff counter 12 month Group 2 counter three month , counter record display three month , counter display six month . There bone densitometry adrenal suppression ancillary study , fund Rhone-Poulenc-Rorer , assess effect inhale corticosteroid bone density adrenal function .</detailed_description>
