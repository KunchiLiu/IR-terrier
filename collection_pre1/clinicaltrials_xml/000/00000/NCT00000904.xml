	<brief_summary>The purpose study find whether three different anti-HIV vaccine safe whether help prevent HIV infection . These vaccine call vCP205 , vCP1433 , vCP1452 . Some patient also receive another anti-HIV vaccine , gp160 . The vaccine make small piece HIV , help body learn recognize destroy HIV . You get HIV vaccine . There two different way vaccine protect body infection . First , vaccine may help immune system make antibody , protein recognize invade virus bacteria . Second , vaccine may help body make immune cell destroy infected cell . The second type vaccine powerful HIV . In study , doctor see whether vCP205 , vCP1433 , vCP1452 , gp160 good vaccine see whether help body make immune cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Previous study human show immunization certain vaccine combination ( , ALVAC-HIV construct envelope subunit vaccine ) elicit CTL activity , antibody-dependent cellular toxicity ( ADCC ) , neutralize antibody , antibody response often high level either vaccine alone . This study examine improve vaccine candidate elicit broad , longer-lasting CTL activity majority vaccine recipient . Volunteers randomize one four group . Group I receive vCP205 . Group II receive vCP1433 . Group III receive vCP1452 . Group IV receive ALVAC rabies vaccine , control . Immunizations administer Months 0 , 1 , 3 , 6 . At Months 3 6 , patient Groups I , II , III also receive gp160 MN/LAI-2 , subunit boost vaccine . Group IV receive another placebo vaccine . Participants regular clinic visit blood drawn determine humoral cellular immune response vaccine . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 10/23/98 : A cell-mediated immunity substudy add select institution follow fourth vaccination 6 month ; study assess new assay CD8+ T cell kinetic response follow immunization . The 6-month immunization may reschedule 14 day accommodate clinical , laboratory , volunteer schedule issue . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 6/17/99 : Three study arm add . Group V receive vCP1452 Months 0,1,3 , 6 . Group VI receive vCP205 Months 0,1,3 , 6 . Group VII receive placebo Months 0,1,3 , 6 . Patients Groups V , VI , VII receive subunit boost , gp160 MN/LAI-2 . Consenting volunteer enrol three new group Johns Hopkins University undergo PET scan part ancillary study . ]</detailed_description>
