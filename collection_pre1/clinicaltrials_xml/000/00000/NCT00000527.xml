	<brief_title>Recurrent Carotid Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Following endarterectomy , platelet adhere aggregate endarterectomized surface release platelet-derived growth factor induces smooth muscle cell migration proliferation may result restenosis . Many patient treat aspirin dipyridamole , control trial . The Recurrent Carotid Stenosis Study establish whether antiplatelet therapy beneficial prevention recurrent carotid artery stenosis . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , double-blind . Eighty-three patient ( 90 endarterectomy ) randomly assign receive 325 mg oral aspirin plus 75 mg dipyridamole , begin 12 hour pre-operatively , follow second dose administer within eight hour operation , give three time daily thereafter one year . Eighty patient ( 85 endarterectomy ) receive placebo . After adequacy surgical procedure confirm intraoperative angiography , restenosis endarterectomy site evaluate use serial duplex ultrasound hospital discharge three-month interval postoperatively one year .</detailed_description>
