	<brief_summary>To determine whether early treatment ( oral acyclovir ) herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) ulceration corneal epithelium prevents progression blind complication stromal keratitis iridocyclitis . To determine efficacy low-dose oral acyclovir prevent recurrent HSV eye infection patient previous episode herpetic eye disease . To determine role external factor ( ultraviolet light corneal trauma ) behavioral factor ( life stress ) induction ocular recurrence HSV eye infection disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Herpetic Eye Disease Study ( HEDS ) II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infection eye herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) lead cause corneal blindness United States country . The infection lead corneal scar neovascularization , permanent endothelial dysfunction corneal edema , secondary glaucoma , cataract . Despite availability topical antiviral agent highly active HSV keratitis , still know effective method reduce frequency recurrence severity stromal keratitis iridocyclitis . In addition , prognosis poor recovery good vision follow penetrate keratoplasty actively inflame highly vascularize herpetic cornea . On basis animal human study , antiviral agent acyclovir may treat prevent recurrence HSV disease . However , consensus yet exist use acyclovir management prevention herpetic eye disease . HEDS-II consist two randomized , placebo-controlled trial assess role oral acyclovir management herpetic eye disease one epidemiologic study investigate risk factor , include stress , development ocular recurrence disease . The organizational structure consist national coordinating center , eight regional coordinate clinical center , approximately 60 clinical site . The clinical site patient enrol followed include university-based community-based practice . Herpes Simplex Virus Epithelial Keratitis Trial : HEDS-EKT evaluated benefit oral acyclovir give treatment acute HSV keratitis ( dendritic geographic keratitis ) prevent occurrence later blind complication . Patients enter trial within 7 day onset . All patient receive standard treatment topical antiviral randomize receive either oral acyclovir ( 400 mg five time day 21 day ) placebo . Patients eight visit within 12-month followup period . The primary outcome time first occurrence stromal keratitis iridocyclitis study eye ( eye epithelial keratitis time study entry ) . The HEDS-EKT recruitment goal 502 patient . Acyclovir Prevention Trial : HEDS-APT evaluated benefit long-term acyclovir treatment patient recent history HSV eye disease current active disease . To eligible , patient must experience kind ocular herpes simplex infection ( blepharitis , conjunctivitis , keratitis , iridocyclitis ) precede year . The infection must inactive untreated least previous 30 day . Patients randomize receive either oral acyclovir ( 400 mg twice day ) placebo 1 year . Five followup visit occur 1-year treatment period additional three followup visit 6-month post-treatment period . Episodes recurrent HSV eye disease trial treat topical corticosteroid antiviral indicate , patient continue receive oral acyclovir placebo entire 365-day period . The primary outcome time first recurrence type HSV eye disease either eye . The recruitment goal 696 patient . Ocular HSV Recurrence Factor Study : HEDS-RFS evaluate effect psychological , environmental , biological factor recurrences herpetic eye disease . Patients recruit HEDS-APT trial eligible participate HEDS-RFS 18 year old . At entry , subject fill questionnaire estimate negative affectivity trait measure . Subjects also fill short questionnaire every week 52 week track acute chronic stressor ( e.g. , illness , injury , menstrual period , sun exposure , emotional financial stress ) . The investigator ensure patient privacy patient 's mailing weekly log directly HEDS National Coordinating Center .</detailed_description>
