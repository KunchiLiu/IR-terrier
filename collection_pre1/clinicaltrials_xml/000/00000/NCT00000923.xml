	<brief_summary>This study examine long-term effect interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) combination anti-HIV drug , highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) . The purpose study see IL-2 increase number CD4 cell ( cell immune system fight infection ) HIV-infected patient complete ACTG 328 . HAART often successful decrease viral load ( level HIV blood ) , drug able restore immune system HIV-infected patient . IL-2 substance naturally produce body 's immune cell . In ACTG 328 , IL-2 test see increase number CD4 cell `` boost '' patient 's immune system . This study follow-up ACTG 328 patient benefit IL-2 continue take patient control group receive IL-2 start taking .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment With Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) Plus Combination Anti-HIV-Drug Therapy ( HAART ) Patients Formerly ACTG 328</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV disease characterize progressive decline CD4 cell increase viral burden . Although antiretroviral therapy successful control viral level , effect CD4 cell count modest . Intermittently administer IL-2 presence HAART show increase CD4 cell count , decrease lymphocyte activation marker , increase certain lymphocyte functional activity patient early-stage HIV infection . ACTG 328 evaluate effect intravenous and/or subcutaneously administer IL-2 conjunction HAART group advance HIV-infected patient 18- 22-month period . As patient enrol study 18-month period , follow-up protocol require provide continued IL-2 therapy patient respond IL-2 patient control group wish receive drug . This study enroll patient participate ACTG 328 . Patients Arm I ACTG 328 ( control group receive HAART ) viral load 5,000 copies/ml less register Step II . Patients Step II receive subcutaneous [ SC ] IL-2 combination HAART . IL-2 administer 5 day every 8 week first 3 cycle . For subsequent cycle , interval cycle may extend 8-week increment maximum 24 week , provide patient 's bimonthly CD4 count exceed 500 cells/mm3 . Patients Arm I viral load great 5,000 copies/ml register Step I require change antiretroviral therapy . Patients achieve viral level 5,000 copies/ml less may begin receive IL-2 earlier 4 week later 12 week change HAART regimen . Patients whose viral load remain 5,000 copies/ml 12 week change drug regimen discontinue study . Patients Arms II III ACTG 328 ( IL-2-containing arm ) 25 percent great increase CD4 cell count Week 11 value viral load 5,000 copies/ml less continue SC IL-2 HAART . Patients meet CD4 criterion whose viral load 5,000 copies/ml change HAART regimen . After minimum 4 week maximum 12 week , patient may receive IL-2 provided viral load 5,000 copies/ml less . For study , HAART define one protease inhibitor two nucleoside analogue . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 9/16/99 : All patient must receive protease inhibitor , permission chair , nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) plus either two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) another protease inhibitor NNRTI . ] The protease inhibitor provide study indinavir ( IDV ) . The nucleoside analogue combination provide study follow : zidovudine ( ZDV ) plus didanosine ( ddI ) , ZDV plus lamivudine ( 3TC ) , stavudine ( d4T ) plus 3TC , d4T plus ddI . Other antiretroviral drug may use provide study . Patients monitor CD4 count bimonthly interval first IL-2 dose . CD4 count plasma storage HIV RNA do within 96 hour prior cycle IL-2 . Safety laboratory evaluation obtain prior conclusion IL-2 course . TSH ( thyroid-stimulating hormone ) , DTH skin testing , real-time plasma HIV RNA obtain 6-month interval .</detailed_description>
