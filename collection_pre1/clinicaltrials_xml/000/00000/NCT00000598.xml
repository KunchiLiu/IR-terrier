	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The NCEP major public education program provide advice physician public management prevention coronary heart disease . However , data support advice derive primarily middle-aged men , less data available woman old individual . Furthermore , recent report low saturate fat diet NCEP Step One NCEP Step Two diet , follow , HDL-cholesterol lower well LDL-cholesterol . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , control , factorial design power men woman separately . One hundred eighty postmenopausal woman , 45 64 year age , 197 men , 30 64 year age , low high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol level ( &lt; =59 mg per deciliter woman &lt; =44 mg per deciliter men ) moderately elevated level low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol ( &gt; 125 mg per deciliter &lt; 210 mg per deciliter woman &gt; 125 mg per deciliter &lt; 190 mg per deciliter men ) enrol . The subject randomly assign aerobic exercise , NCEP Step 2 diet , diet plus exercise , control group , receive intervention . The four intervention deliver one year : usual care ( write dietary material delay intervention optional ) , exercise ( supervise , progressive aerobic exercise program least three time per week ) , diet ( group individual dietary instruction NCEP Step One/Step Two diet deliver registered dietitian ) , diet plus exercise . At baseline end one year , measurement make blood lipid lipoprotein , plasma glucose insulin , glucose tolerance , blood pressure , body composition hydrostatic weigh waist hip circumterences , aerobic fitness ( VO2 max ) , five unannounced 24-hr . recall . The primary outcome measure HDL-cholesterol , major secondary endpoint include LDL-C , LDL-C/HDL-C ratio , triglyceride .</detailed_description>
