	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Mortality rate heart failure high , five year survival rate approximate 30 40 percent patient mild moderate symptom 0 20 percent survival patient severe symptom . The patient class IV heart failure one year survival rate 40 50 percent . This despite advance medical therapy availability ACE inhibitor . While cardiac transplantation viable form treatment patient , limited complication chronic immunosuppression , development graft coronary artery disease serious shortage donor organ . As many 16,500 patient per year may suitable candidate heart transplantation . The actual number donor heart procure past year , however , remain relatively constant 2,000 . Thus , strong rationale therapeutic application leave ventricular assist device ( LVADs ) alternative cardiac transplantation . With respect LVAD efficacy , patient support period long 344 day pneumatic system 503 day electromechanical device . Experience TCI pneumatic system 75 LVAD patient show improve one year survival transplantation LVAD patient oppose patient receive LVAD despite selection criterion . Experience vent electric LVADs bridge patient show transplant survival rate similar pneumatic device . LVADs also show favorable effect circulatory hemodynamics exercise capacity . Among 53 patient survive TCI LVAD procedure , 90 percent improve New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) functional class I 10 percent functional class II . With respect safety , principal adverse effect associate LVADs include bleed , hemolysis , organ dysfunction , thromboembolism , infection , right heart failure , mechanical failure . Thromboembolic complication low TCI device despite lack systemic anticoagulation . The overall mechanical failure rate small , less 1 percent 26 patient year use . The vented electric pneumatic device experience date indicate device similar respect adverse event rate . Thus , 1997 strong rationale randomize control trial compare benefit cost vent electric LVADs medical treatment . The need perform randomize control study emphasize lack rigorous data survival , quality life , cost effectiveness compare LVAD support medical therapy . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Unblinded , randomize , multicenter . Patients randomize either Thermo Cardiosystems , Inc. ( TCI ) vent electric ( VE ) LVAD optimal medical therapy ( OMM ) follow least two year . If randomize LVAD therapy , patient receive LVAD implantation within 12 hour randomization . If randomize medical therapy , patient receive optimal medical management include use digoxin , diuretic , ACE ( Angiotensin Converting Enzyme ) inhibitor maximally tolerate dos . The primary endpoint all-cause mortality . Secondary endpoint include cardiovascular mortality , exercise capacity ( six-minute walk test ) health-related quality life , adverse effect , relative cost-effectiveness LVADs versus medical management . Recruitment end June , 2001 .</detailed_description>
