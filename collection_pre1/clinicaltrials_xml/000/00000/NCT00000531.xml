	<brief_title>Antiarrhythmics Versus Implantable Defibrillators ( AVID )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Sudden cardiac death believe account substantial proportion death patient evidence cardiovascular disease . The exact proportion cardiac death classify sudden varies depend population , underlie disease , definition sudden death . Various estimate suggest 500,000 sudden cardiac death occur annually United States alone . The majority sudden cardiac death think due ventricular fibrillation ( VF ) tachycardia ( VT ) . The common approach prevent sudden cardiac death use drug suppress ventricular ectopy . The rational approach base upon association presence frequency ventricular arrhythmia subsequent mortality several study . None randomize controlled study numerous 'classical ' antiarrhythmic agent ( beta-blockers , modest effect arrhythmia suppression ) demonstrate reduction sudden non-sudden cardiac mortality . Indeed , recent Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial ( CAST ) , two class Ic anti-arrhythmic agent demonstrate 2.5 fold increase risk sudden non-sudden cardiac death despite excellent suppression ventricular arrhythmia . Given disappointing result pharmacologic approach prevent sudden death , many investigator turn non-pharmacologic approach surgery ( endocardial resection , stellate ganglionectomy ) implantation device recognize VT VF deliver shock . The great interest generate work implantable cardiac defibrillator . The study review ad hoc work group , Clinical Applications Prevention Advisory Committee , several member Cardiology Advisory Committee prior review approval National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council September 1991 . The Request Proposals release February 1992 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : At approximately 28 clinical site , patient ventricular tachycardia ventricular fibrillation screen . Those ventricular fibrillation serious ventricular tachycardia enter registry long-term mortality follow-up use National Death Index . Patients prospect long-term benefit ICD and/or antiarrhythmic drug therapy without exclusion ICD amiodarone without transient correctible cause index event enter trial . Patients meet criterion randomize treatment ICD treatment antiarrhythmic drug therapy . Allocation stratify clinical site index arrhythmia , either ventricular fibrillation ventricular tachycardia . Patients assigned antiarrhythmic drug therapy without contraindication sotalol underwent subrandomization either empiric amiodarone sotalol , latter treatment guide either ambulatory monitoring electrophysiologic testing . Patients , subrandomization , low level ( less 30 beat per hour ) ventricular ectopic beat inducible ventricular arrhythmia electrophysiologic study treat sotalol instead receive empiric amiodarone . The AVID protocol allow usual clinical practice restrict intervention state-of-the art ICD device first-line antiarrhythmic agent amiodarone sotalol . Patients could take amiodarone include trial . The protocol encourage use concurrent drug angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor , aspirin , beta-blockers appropriate , administer randomization maintain throughout study . The primary endpoint total mortality . Secondary endpoint cost health care quality life . Nonlethal event ICD shock , sustain arrhythmia , syncope tabulate . Patients follow every three month assessment secondary endpoint , record therapy deliver ICD potential adverse effect ICD , ass compliance potential adverse symptom patient treated antiarrhythmic drug . A 12-lead electrocardiogram obtain every six month , appropriate laboratory pulmonary test perform six eighteen month patient receive amiodarone . The average follow-up expect 2.6 year . Analysis do intention-to-treat . The outcome primary interest subrandomization sotalol amiodarone time withdrawal assign therapy . After review data Data Safety Monitoring Board , AVID study stop early April 7 , 1997 finding one year , patient defibrillator group experience nearly 38 percent reduction death compare group patient take antiarrhythmic drug . The defibrillator group 25 percent reduction death year two three .</detailed_description>
