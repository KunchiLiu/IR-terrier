	<brief_title>Sorbinil Retinopathy Trial ( SRT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During last two decade , vision researcher study intensively role enzyme aldose reductase ( AR ) diabetic cataract diabetic complication . The potentially damaging effect AR diabetes first discover lens fiber cell . In cell , enzyme catalyzes reduction high level glucose sorbitol polyol pathway initiate sequence event eventually result opacification lens . Because sorbitol ( sugar alcohol ) fructose ( subsequent product glucose metabolism ) readily diffuse across cell membrane , become trapped lens fiber cell . There accumulate unusually high level exert significant osmotic stress , cause influx water swell lens fiber . Major electrolytic osmotic change occur lead lens opacity . More recently , detection AR pericytes retinal capillary -- cell involve early evolution diabetic retinopathy -- suggest enzyme may also play role pathogenesis disorder . Scientists know AR present nerve tissue , speculate diabetes induces depletion myo -inositol , lead lessen nerve conduction velocity diabetic neuropathy . Chemicals inhibit aldose reductase prove effective preventing damage lens , prevent thicken retinal capillary basement membrane diabetic animal , improve nerve conduction velocity value patient diabetic neuropathy . Therefore , possible AR inhibitor also may able prevent , delay , halt development progression diabetic retinopathy . To test hypothesis , AR inhibitor develop Pfizer Inc. , sorbinil , study clinical trial . ( Other AR inhibitor undergo study clinical trial sponsor Ayerst Alcon . ) Initially , 402 patient randomized double-masked treatment period use dosage schedule one 250-mg tablet daily . In 1985 , recruitment voluntarily halt Pfizer several serious hypersensitivity reaction among patient take sorbinil clinical trial United States Europe . In November 1985 , recruitment resume , use titrated dosage schedule 25 mg daily 2 week , follow 75 mg daily 2 week , 250 mg daily duration . A total 497 patient participate study . Followup visit schedule weekly first 4 week , monthly next 2 month , every 3 month thereafter . For patient assign titration protocol , additional visit make week 5 6 . A complete history record physical examination conduct every 15 month ; electrocardiogram record every 6 month . In addition , patient caution note sign hypersensitivity . Efficacy visit , schedule 9-month interval first visit 12 month , include fundus photograph , visual acuity examination accord Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) , red blood cell sorbitol measure , assessment coronary risk factor classification . The Sorbinil Retinopathy Trial ( SRT ) unique collaboration private industry Federal government designing , funding , conduct multicenter , randomize clinical trial . Pfizer Inc. support 10 11 participate Clinical Centers , provide medication , fund Data Coordinating Center Fundus Photograph Reading Center . The National Eye Institute fund Policy , Data , Safety Monitoring Committee participate Clinical Center .</detailed_description>
