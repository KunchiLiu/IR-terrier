	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : An estimate 58 million people United States elevate blood pressure ( systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) 140 mmHg great and/or diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) 90 mmHg great initial examination ) take antihypertensive medication . Perhaps one-half two-thirds sustain hypertension . Despite know etiologic relationship hypertension coronary heart disease , large-scale randomized clinical trial mild moderate hypertension fail demonstrate conclusively antihypertensive drug treatment , largely base thiazide-like diuretic , reduces occurrence coronary heart disease death non-fatal myocardial infarction . The pooled result nine trial , use primarily thiazide-like diuretic involve 43,000 subject , suggest 9 percent benefit , 95 percent confidence limit consistent 19 percent benefit 1 percent adverse outcome . This observed treatment effect compare maximum predicted effect coronary heart disease approximately 23 percent equivalent blood pressure difference , derive epidemiologic data . In contrast , observed beneficial effect stroke trial , 36 percent , almost exactly would predict epidemiologic data . A recent overview 14 trial participant level hypertension estimate somewhat large benefit 14 percent . While may over-estimate benefit , overviews include strongly positive result Systolic Hypertension Elderly Program ( SHEP ) , diuretic-based treatment reduce stroke incidence 36 percent major coronary heart disease event 27 percent . In early 1980s , two new class antihypertensive agent , calcium antagonist ACE inhibitor , develop license use chronic antihypertensive therapy . These agent cost old agent diuretic beta-blockers , evidence limit might justify use despite increased cost . The 1988 Joint National Committee Detection , Evaluation , Treatment High Blood Pressure recommend beta-blockers , calcium antagonist , ACE-inhibitors , diuretic equally acceptable first-line therapy . All four class drug find control diastolic blood pressure single agent 50 percent patient mild hypertension . Of drug class , beta-blockers compare directly diuretic large-scale , long-term clinical trial hypertension . Three trial complete Europe 1985-1986 show approximate equivalence effect morbidity mortality diuretic- beta-blocker-based regimen . Pooled analysis trial yield 6 percent low coronary heart disease mortality beta-blockers . These data contrast recent Medical Research Council ( MRC ) Trial Elderly , patient treat thiazide diuretic significantly low rate coronary heart disease compare beta-blocker treatment placebo , 45 percent . Circulating level cholesterol , specifically cholesterol associate low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) fraction , establish major etiologic factor coronary heart disease observational epidemiologic study , metabolic , pathologic , genetic study human select animal model , randomize clinical trial . The clinical trial demonstrate reduction coronary heart disease incidence lower LDL-cholesterol level conduct primarily middle-aged men hypercholesterolemia establish coronary heart disease . Experimental evidence efficacy cholesterol lower old men confine analysis small subgroup clinical trial lack woman age . The paucity clinical trial data lead National Cholesterol Education Program 's Expert Panel Detection , Evaluation , Treatment High Blood Cholesterol Adults 1987 Guidelines allow considerable physician judgement regard elderly . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Patients recruit office-based practice hypertension clinic reimburse Clinical Trials Center per-patient basis . Six hundred patient enter vanguard feasibility phase total 42,448 enter full-scale trial . The primary hypothesis antihypertensive trial combine incidence fatal coronary heart disease nonfatal myocardial infarction would lower hypertensive patient randomize amlodipine ( calcium antagonist ) , lisinopril ( angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor ) , doxazosin ( alpha adrenergic blocker ) compare randomize chlorthalidone ( thiazide-like diuretic ) . Secondary endpoint total cardiovascular mortality , major morbidity , all-cause mortality , health-related quality life . The primary hypothesis cholesterol-lowering trial mortality cause would lower subset hypertensive patient LDL cholesterol level 120 189 mg/dl ( 100 159 mg/dl know coronary heart disease ) randomize receive pravastatin ( HMG CoA reductase inhibitor ) plus National Cholesterol Education Program Step I cholesterol-lowering diet randomized receive usual care plus diet . Secondary endpoint combine incidence nonfatal myocardial infarction coronary heart disease death , major non-cardiovascular heart disease morbidity mortality , health-related quality life . Recruitment feasibility phase begin February 1994 . The clinical phase feasibility study end September 1994 . Recruitment full-scale trial begin October 1994 end January , 1998 . The mean follow-up 4.9 year . There 600 clinic 47 state , Puerto Rico , Virgin Islands Canada .</detailed_description>
