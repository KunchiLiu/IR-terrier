	<brief_summary>AMENDED : As 10/19/90 Children 0 3 month enrol . Original design : To determine whether experimental drug recombinant CD4 ( rCD4 ) , produce genetic engineering technology , safe well-tolerated child infect risk HIV infection . rCD4 may effective treatment HIV infection , base ability block infection human cell HIV laboratory test . However , activity rCD4 still need confirmed clinical trial . It hop test show rCD4 safe effective treat child infect risk infection HIV .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>rCD4 may effective treatment HIV infection , base ability block infection human cell HIV laboratory test . However , activity rCD4 still need confirmed clinical trial . It hop test show rCD4 safe effective treat child infect risk infection HIV . Children preliminary testing evaluation determine eligibility health . The dosage schedule varies dose . During course study , child monitor safety physical exam blood test . They blood withdrawn study response rCD4 measure activity rCD4 body . Children may receive immunization DPT ( diphtheria , pertussis , tetanus ) DT polio vaccine measure antibody response . If rCD4 beneficial , child may continue treatment . The study conduct four part : - Part A : Children 13 18 year old . - Part B : Children 3 month le 13 year old . - Part C : Full-term infant 3 month old . - Part D : Preterm infant le 3 month old . Parts C D start part A B complete .</detailed_description>
