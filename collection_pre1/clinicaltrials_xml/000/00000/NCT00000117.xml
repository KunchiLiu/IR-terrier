	<brief_summary>To determine whether high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg ) effective placebo restore lose visual function ( visual acuity ) optic neuritis ( ON ) . To determine time course recovery follow IVIg administration . If report IVIg-associated clinical improvement occur within 3 6 month follow treatment confirm , would provide indirect evidence IVIg may promote central nervous system ( CNS ) remyelination optic neuritis multiple sclerosis ( MS ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Optic neuritis lead cause transient , spontaneous , reversible visual loss young adult . Characteristically , patient present central visual loss peak within day often associate eye pain . Visual loss may complete . Spontaneous recovery usually begin within 4 week , mark recovery occurs within 1 3 month patient . Although clinical improvement rule , patient recover fully , many leave residual symptom . Although limited pathological study inflammatory ON , pathological change think virtually identical see MS , disruption blood-nerve ( brain ) barrier ; primary demyelination axonal sparing ; variable degree lymphocytic infiltration ; abundance macrophage around inflammatory demyelination lesion ; various degree remyelination ; , later , oligodendrocyte loss , axonal loss , gliosis . Remyelination oligodendrocytes occurs early MS lesion , document myelin sheath abnormally thin relative axon diameter . These thin myelin sheath often see prominently edge demyelinated plaque . A recent series study show within week initial event , extensive oligodendrocyte regeneration remyelination . These immature oligodendrocytes express series developmentally restrict antigen . This finding interpret suggest cell repopulate acute plaque affect remyelination newly generate residual , mature oligodendrocyte . These observation support possibility factor promote remyelination could use improve clinical recovery ON MS. Work Mayo Clinic , show immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) direct spinal cord antigens purified polyclonal mouse IgG administer systemically promote extensive remyelination SJL mouse chronically infect Theiler 's virus . In addition , tissue culture study suggest IgG direct CNS component may promote oligodendroglial proliferation differentiation . Thus , experimental evidence exists concept immunoglobulin may stimulate proliferation differentiation oligodendrocytes . It possible myelin component surface oligodendrocyte could function receptor component receptor . Antibodies could mimic endogenous ligand , thereby induce proliferation differentiation cell . In preliminary , open-label pilot study patient chronic , steroid-unresponsive ON , Drs . van Engelen , Hommes , colleague suggest improvement visual recovery could see follow IgG treatment patient chronic , stable ON . These encouraging preliminary basic clinical study prompt u design double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial IVIg patient recently acquire apparently permanent muscle paralysis MS ( NS31506 ) develop NEI-funded ON study ( U10EY1096301 ) . In randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind clinical trial , 60 patient assign receive either IVIg placebo period 3 month . In order eligible , patient meet inclusion criterion need stable loss visual function ( unchanged pre-enrollment screen visit enrollment visit ) . All patient wre re-examined 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month , primary outcome impact treatment visual acuity 6 month determine measurement retroilluminated Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study chart 4 meter . One group patient receive 0.4 g/kg Gammimmune N intravenously daily 5 day , thereafter month 3 month ( total : eight infusion ) . The group patient receive infusion 0.1 percent human serum albumin 10 percent maltose ( placebo ) accord identical protocol use Gammimmune N. The primary outcome measure improvement Logmar visual acuity average 0.2 6 month . The secondary outcome measure include change visual acuity 3 , 9 , 12 month , determine retroilluminated ETDRS chart 4 meter ; change visual field 6 12 month ; change visual evoked response 3 , 6 , 12 month ; change neurological examination ( EDSS , FS , AI ) 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month .</detailed_description>
