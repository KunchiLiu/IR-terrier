	<brief_title>The Collaborative Longitudinal Evaluation Ethnicity Refractive Error ( CLEERE ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Orinda Longitudinal Study Myopia ( OLSM ) start 1989 investigate normal eye growth development myopia 1,200 school-aged child date . Beginning 1997 , three parallel study phase conduct . Phase 1 investigates additional factor may predict onset juvenile myopia ( accommodative function , peripheral refractive error , intraocular pressure , school achievement ) . Phase 2 compare contrast optical ocular component refractive error profile ethnic group predominantly Caucasian Orinda database . Phase 3 conduct DNA-based study prevalent OLSM myope family use phenotypically well-characterized child panel candidate gene look evidence genetic factor . In parallel candidate gene association , family material use allele share approach identify loci use highly variable , PCR-based marker . In Phase 1 continue examine Orinda Union School District child grade 1 8 ( age 6 14 year ) annually . The measurement accommodative response , accommodative lag , phoria , response AC/A ratio , peripheral refractive error , intraocular pressure add exist protocol , photokeratoscopy two measure tonic accommodation eliminate minimize respondent burden . Parents child study contact permission release school achievement data ( Iowa Test Basic Skills ) . Phase 2 add major component add three clinical center assess influence ethnicity normal ocular refractive error development . Children three examine annually initial enrollment grade 1 8 use revise OLSM protocol describe . Increased prevalence myopia among child myopic parent , twin study , segregation analysis , preliminary analysis OLSM support genetic etiologic component myopia . In phase 3 , use phenotypic characterization child Orinda Longitudinal Study Myopia identify prevalent case myopia family . These well-defined phenotypic myope non-myopic sibling parent explore , seek develop panel candidate gene myopia conduct allele share analysis family The Collaborative Longitudinal Evaluation Ethnicity Refractive Error ( CLEERE ) Study multi-center , observational investigation ocular development refractive error development schoolchildren . It add three clinical center Orinda Longitudinal Study Myopia ( OLSM ) , begin 1989 , specifically describe normal ocular growth child age 6 14 year , develop ability predict juvenile onset myopia clinically evident . In addition 1,300 predominantly Caucasian child enrol OLSM , three additional clinical site enroll African-American , Hispanic , Asian child . The child examine annually least four year . Examinations include visual acuity , refraction variety method ( cycloplegic autorefraction primary outcome measure ) , cover test distance near , accommodative response assessment autorefractor , response AC/A ratio measurement , videophakometry , peripheral refraction , A-scan ultrasonography . Patients examine 4 clinical center . The clinical center enrol 3,493 patient April 28 , 1999 .</detailed_description>
