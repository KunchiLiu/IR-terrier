	<brief_summary>To quantitate HIV-infected population percentage patient demonstrate `` booster '' phenomenon ( attainment positive response second tuberculin purify protein derivative skin test first skin test negative ) ; determine relationship booster phenomenon CD4-positive lymphocyte cell count ; detect relationship booster phenomenon HIV exposure category . The accuracy skin test detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( MTb ) infection dependent upon host 's ability mount delayed-type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) reaction ; however , DTH response may impair absent patient impaired cell-mediated immunity , classic characteristic HIV infection . Patients immunity diminish , absent , may test negative first time purify protein derivative skin test MTb administer , skin test repeat , positive DTH response may elicit . This occurrence know `` booster '' phenomenon .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The accuracy skin test detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( MTb ) infection dependent upon host 's ability mount delayed-type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) reaction ; however , DTH response may impair absent patient impaired cell-mediated immunity , classic characteristic HIV infection . Patients immunity diminish , absent , may test negative first time purify protein derivative skin test MTb administer , skin test repeat , positive DTH response may elicit . This occurrence know `` booster '' phenomenon . Patients negative purified protein derivative ( PPD ) skin test M. tuberculosis within 7-28 day prior study entry receive second PPD test Mantoux method ( 5 TU intradermally volar aspect forearm ) . Skin test read 48-72 hour application . Patients positive skin test ( define induration , small hard knot , 5 mm great form beneath skin ) refer primary physician evaluation .</detailed_description>
