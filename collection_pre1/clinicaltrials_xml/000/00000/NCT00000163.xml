	<brief_title>Congenital Esotropia Observational Study ( CEOS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Congenital esotropia common form childhood strabismus . Despite common occurrence , limited information available early clinical course . Such data need determine early age surgery safely perform without concern esotropia likely resolve spontaneously . Although term congenital esotropia implies esotropia present birth , many case esotropia actually develop sometime first month life . It well recognize congenital esotropia persist 6 month age rarely ever resolve spontaneously therefore require surgical correction . However , clear often congenital esotropia occur resolve ( early age surgery necessary ) surgery require . Current clinical practice defer surgery congenital esotropia 6 12 month age . Assuming characteristic congenital esotropia 2 4 month age identify predict case require surgery , trial warrant determine whether perform early surgery enhances development binocular vision . The potential benefit early surgery support neurophysiologic research , show ( 1 ) congenital esotropes may bear innate ability develop binocular vision , ( 2 ) critical period development normal binocular function within first month life dependent alignment visual ax two eye , ( 3 ) ocular misalignment alone , regardless mechanism , without coexist primary cortical fusion deficit , account abnormal development binocular vision . Clinical report demonstrate surgical correction esotropia 6 12 month age provide enhanced development stereoacuity compare later surgery . However , limited data outcome infant surgical correction age 6 month . The protocol study identical usual clinical practice . Following informed consent , two followup visit conduct : one 2 4 week first examination child 28 32 week age . The examination identical pediatric ophthalmologist 's usual routine , additional procedure perform specifically study . Management refractive error amblyopia leave ophthalmologist 's discretion . A sample size 150 project study .</detailed_description>
