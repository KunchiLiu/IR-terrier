	<brief_summary>To determine fast ribavirin reach bloodstream , concentration ribavirin reach blood long remain blood ( pharmacokinetics ) give different route administration . To find maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) ribavirin . The effect ribavirin immune system , virus measure T4 cell count p24 antigen level . Early study ribavirin patient AIDS AIDS relate complex ( ARC ) show ribavirin appear inhibit spread virus . Determination much often give drug require knowledge pharmacokinetics toxicity drug patient AIDS ARC chronic virus carrier symptom .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Pharmacokinetic Tolerance Study Ribavirin Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) - Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Early study ribavirin patient AIDS AIDS relate complex ( ARC ) show ribavirin appear inhibit spread virus . Determination much often give drug require knowledge pharmacokinetics toxicity drug patient AIDS ARC chronic virus carrier symptom . Ribavirin give HIV-infected patient intravenously time 30-min infusion 1 5 single dos ; 2 week later , dos give orally single dose . Following least 2 additional week , 6 patient give ribavirin low dose twice day 16 week . They evaluate tolerance next group give high dose . Each successive group begin 3-week interval receive dos increase day MTD reach . Blood sample take periodically treatment period 8 week treatment stop used measure blood level ribavirin determine effect ribavirin HIV immune system patient .</detailed_description>
