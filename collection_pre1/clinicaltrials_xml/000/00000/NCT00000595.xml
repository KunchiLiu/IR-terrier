	<brief_title>Evaluation Subcutaneous Desferrioxamine Treatment Transfusional Hemochromatosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The prognosis congenital long-term anemia formerly limited complication blood transfusion , splenectomy , infection , problem largely overcome sophisticated clinical care . Lifespan determine rate myocardial iron deposition , death occur cardiac failure arrhythmia , usually age 15 25 . Endocrine complication hepatic enlargement also evident age . Deferoxamine increase urinary iron excretion chelator currently available chronic administration . Daily administration deferoxamine result negative iron balance patient age 10 ; study design determine whether onset cardiac complication delay life prolong iron removal . This trial begin 1978 . Its forerunner study involve deferoxamine ascorbic acid . Although ascorbic acid promote iron removal , administration follow cardiac deterioration several patient . In study , patient receive subcutaneous deferoxamine randomize receive either ascorbic acid placebo , thereby provide control test agent treatment iron overload . Sixty-five patient homozygous beta-thalassemia participate long-term chelation trial . Of , 49 randomize ascorbic acid trial . Several noninvasive technique develop evaluate organ function iron-overloaded patient , thereby facilitate assessment chelation therapy . These technique include chest x-ray , electrocardiogram , echocardiogram , 24-hour Holter monitoring ass cardiac function . Liver function evaluate standard liver function test , CAT scan , live biopsy . During last six year study , hepatic iron store measure magnetically dual channel superconducting quantum-interference susceptomer . Endocrine function also assess standard test . DESIGN NARRATIVE : All patient receive subcutaneous deferoxamine iron removal determine measurement serum ferritin periodic non-invasive measurement liver iron concentration . Clinical status evaluate non-invasive testing cardiac endocrine function . The study completion date list record infer last publication list Citations section study record .</detailed_description>
