	<brief_title>The Effects Light Reduction Retinopathy Prematurity ( Light-ROP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite progress past decade treatment ROP , disease still pose significant ( approximately 2.1 percent ) risk blindness extremely low birth-weight ( &lt; 1,251 gram ) preterm infant . Current estimate indicate 27,000 infant extremely low birth weight bear annually , 74 percent survive . As technique manage small less mature preterm infant continue improve , expect number infant risk blindness continue increase . For infant weigh less 1,251 gram birth , Cryotherapy Retinopathy Prematurity ( CRYO-ROP ) Study show risk develop severe , acute ( threshold ) ROP 6 percent . Although cryotherapy , applied time threshold ROP , reduce rate unfavorable visual outcome , 35 percent eye develop level severe , acute disease blind 1 year treatment . Moreover , cryotherapy destructive . Even cryotherapy prevents progression retinal detachment , associate peripheral retinal destruction may , case , associate subnormal central vision due high myopia and/or macular scarring . Corrective surgical treatment retinal detachment cause ROP proven little visual benefit . A preventive treatment ROP safe , efficacious , easily apply , inexpensive desirable . The investigator hypothesize reduce amount light reach eye preterm infant may effective prevent ROP . Although previous report use light reduction eye preterm infant nursery produce conflict result , sufficient reason believe strategy may effective reduce incidence severity ROP . These reason center role light production destructive free radical . Supplemental oxygen produce free radical , two mechanism may additive . In masked , control study , infant weigh less 1,251 gram birth prospectively randomize within 24 hour birth wear goggles wear goggles . Goggles contain 97 percent near neutral density filter wear infant reach either 31 week gestational age 4 week postnatal age , whichever longer . The goggled nongoggled infant expose ambient light condition within give Study Center . Eyes infant examine prescribed schedule certify examiner determine incidence confirm ROP . The primary objective study answer follow question : Does light reduction eye extremely low birth-weight infant decrease incidence confirm ROP ( least 3 contiguous clock hour , stage , zone ) ? The primary end point therefore ROP full vascularization . The secondary objective study evaluate follow question : Does light reduction eye extremely low birth-weight infant decrease incidence severe ROP ( prethreshold ROP -- secondary end point ) ? The study recruit approximately 400 infant , equally divide goggle-wearing control group . Since randomization must occur within 24 hour birth , investigator anticipate mortality rate 10 percent 20 percent enrollee prior outcome . The study followup phase regular ophthalmologic exam either ROP regression normal full retinal vascularization establish . A final exam occur adjust age 6 month .</detailed_description>
