	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Management strategy urgently need problem sudden cardiac death , common single , non-accidental cause death adult North America . Many consider problem sudden cardiac death reach epidemic proportion . Contemporary prophylactic management sudden cardiac death include identification high risk population , base underlying structural heart disease , degree leave ventricular dysfunction , evidence ventricular arrhythmia propensity . Populations high sudden death cardiac risk , notably patient resuscitate spontaneous episode sustain ventricular tachyarrhythmias , use test population development effective prophylactic approach . However , population , ethical consideration preclude use untreated control group . Furthermore , patient comprise small proportion total patient population could benefit effective prophylactic strategy . The large 'at-risk ' group patient coronary artery disease depress leave ventricular function , yet express , ventricular tachyarrhythmia propensity . The major advantage control trial prophylactic therapy latter population evaluation sudden death prophylaxis large 'at-risk ' population opportunity untreated control group . The 'window opportunity ' comparison close resuscitated patient time danger closing large population . The total absence control efficacy data ICD use despite 30,000 implanted unit expensive technology argue strongly timely acquisition control data large population therapy embrace . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , non-blind . Patients randomize surgery coronary artery bypass graft receive ICD , follow censored 42 month 35 center . The primary endpoint all-cause mortality . The trial describe morbidity ICD treatment , evaluate effect ICD therapy quality life , compare health care cost ICD treatment control group . Anti-arrhythmic treatment unsustained arrhythmia prohibit ; anti-arrhythmic drug use , indicate , document ; aspirin prescribed unless contraindication exist . Recruitment extend December 1995 order accrue 900 patient , instead original 800 project . As February 1996 , 900 patient recruit . In April 1997 , DSMB recommend trial stop sufficient evidence conclude difference treatment control group . Follow-up extend two year beyond original termination date . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter old format Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) .</detailed_description>
