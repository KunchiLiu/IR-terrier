	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Multiple mechanism involve deposition LDL-C arterial wall , prevention deposition well removal LDL-particles . Further , remain question regard cause exist plaque stable long period time become occlusive ulcerating may prevent . Prevention treatment almost certain become multifaceted complex use several complementary intervention preventive measure concomitantly . Multifactorial prevention treatment may particularly useful people peripheral arterial disease . PAD manifest intermittent claudication affect 0.5 1.0 percent individual age 35 , twofold predominance men . There strikingly increase incidence age sex , particularly age 50 . Mortality patient intermittent claudication show six time higher people similar age gender . The excess mortality primarily due ninefold increase cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) death . Those asymptomatic measurable PAD ( two two-and-a-half time many intermittent claudication ) , relative risk 3 4 total CVD mortality , respectively . Therefore , intervention prevent development progression atherosclerotic disease reduce arterial thrombosis reduce mortality morbidity due myocardial infarction stroke favorably affect morbidity directly associate PAD . The National Cholesterol Education Program ( NCEP ) include peripheral vascular disease ( PVD ) guideline risk factor Classification Decision Treatment Algorithm . This mean patient PVD elevate LDL-C one risk factor male gender , family history , cigarette smoking , hypertension , appropriate dietary intervention follow drug therapy need . Even guideline place since end 1987 , survey PVD patient refer major medical center clinic find patient lipid lower therapy , either diet drug . The reason primary care community modify lipid high risk patient may relate lack study demonstrate benefit lipid modification PVD . It anticipate many patient PAD require treatment elevate LDL-C . It clear whether intervention aim raise HDL-C result slow progression atherosclerosis population . Platelets show key role development occlusive atherosclerosis thrombosis relate coronary heart disease . Inhibition platelet function postulate slow progression atherosclerosis ; specifically , aspirin demonstrate reduce lipoprotein deposition arterial wall nonhuman primates . This deposition even reduce addition lipid lower regimen antiplatelet regimen . It remain unclear whether mini-dose , less intense anticoagulation appropriate antithrombotic therapy people PAD also receive lipid modifying agent . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Patients randomize control arm one three treatment arm , include lipid modification arm , antioxidant arm , antithrombotic arm . Patients lipid modification arm randomize placebo treat nicotinic acid increase HDL lower LDL level equally hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor pravastatin need intervention control group . Patients antioxidant arm assign daily dos 24 mg. beta-carotene , 800 IU vitamin E , 1.0 g vitamin C placebo . Patients antithrombotic arm receive 2 mg/day active placebo warfarin take daily fifth follow-up visit . Patients follow every six week entry one year follow-up . The primary endpoint study efficacy safety HDL-C raise along effective control LDL-C level , antioxidant therapy , antithrombotic therapy , combination . The secondary endpoint determine efficacy HDL-C raise arm achieve increase HDL-C treatment group also obtain equivalent reduction LDL-C treatment control group , assess dose-response niacin HDL-C raising , determine combination low-dose warfarin plus aspirin versus aspirin alone expect impact hemostatic system , determine combination antioxidant therapy ( vitamin E C beta carotene ) lead change biomarkers antioxidant , determine interaction lipid alter strategy antioxidant effect biomarkers antioxidant . Screening begin August 1 , 1993 , randomization begin December 1 , 1993 end December 31 , 1994 total 468 patient enrol . Support trial end September 1995 . Data analysis continue March 31 , 1999 contract N01HC35124 . The study completion date list record obtain `` Completed Date '' enter Query View Report System ( QVR ) .</detailed_description>
