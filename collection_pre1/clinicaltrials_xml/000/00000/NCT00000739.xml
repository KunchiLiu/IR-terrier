	<brief_summary>Primary : To compare toxicity daily versus weekly dapsone HIV-infected infant child ; study pharmacokinetics orally administer dapsone HIV-infected infant child . Secondary : To obtain information rate Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia ( PCP ) breakthrough child receive two different dose regimens dapsone . Prophylaxis Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia ( PCP ) recommend HIV-infected child consider high risk . Approximately 15 percent child intolerant trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole , first choice drug PCP prophylaxis . Since many child also unable take tolerate aerosolize pentamidine , dapsone second choice PCP prophylaxis . The favorable dose regimen dapsone establish .</brief_summary>
