	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine rIL-2 affect HIV-positive patient CD4 count 300 cells/mm3 anti-HIV drug therapy . The drug rIL-2 show increase CD4 cell count , help body fight HIV . There strong evidence rIL-2 increase CD4 cell count ( cell immune system fight infection ) . This study examine effect 2 different amount rIL-2 CD4 cell count amount HIV blood ( viral burden ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Effects Giving Proleukin ( rIL-2 ) HIV-Positive Patients With CD4 Counts Greater Than 300 Cells/mm3</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There substantial evidence rIL-2 increase CD4+ cell count . Whether rIL-2 delay progression AIDS extend survival currently unknown , clinical benefit rIL-2 establish large , long-term , randomized trial . This study examine effect two different rIL-2 dos HIV viral burden CD4+ cell count provide additional information optimal dosing , safety , antiviral activity rIL-2 . Patients randomize receive one two subcutaneous ( sc ) dose recombinant rIL-2 rIL-2 . Those patient take rIL-2 initially receive three course treatment . For study , course define eight calendar week , include five-day period sc rIL-2 administration . Additional course give ( frequently every 6 week ) order maintain CD4+ count least twice baseline level least 1,000 cells/mm3 . Follow-up continue patient common closing date 12 month follow enrollment last patient .</detailed_description>
