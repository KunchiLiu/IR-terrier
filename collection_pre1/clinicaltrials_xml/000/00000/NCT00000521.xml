	<brief_title>Sodium-Potassium Blood Pressure Trial Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Since 1970 , child adolescent hypertension detect increase frequency . Many think primary essential hypertension remain unclear manage . Additionally , since track blood pressure occur even early life , believe youngster blood pressure persistently upper decile age increase risk later hypertension . No clinical trial perform age group examine effect non-pharmacologic drug therapy lower blood pressure . The trial one first attempt examine effect nutritional intervention rate rise blood pressure late childhood early adolescence . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , partial-blind . After 19,542 fifth eighth grade student screen , 210 ( 105 boys 105 girl ) upper 15 percentile blood pressure distribution randomly assign one three group : low sodium diet ( 70 mmol sodium intake per day ) , potassium chloride supplementation ( normal diet plus 1 mmol/kg potassium chloride per day ) , placebo ( normal diet plus placebo capsule ) . Capsules potassium chloride placebo group administer double blind protocol . Blood pressure measure every three month three year . The effect intervention determine compare rate rise ( slope ) blood pressure among group use random-coefficient growth curve model .</detailed_description>
