	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The management patient acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) improve dramatically last three decade . Advances general coronary care unit environment , treatment beta blocker , aggressive attempt reperfusion contribute reduction mortality acute MI . Large randomize trial demonstrate aggressive reperfusion strategy conjunction aspirin reduce mortality patient suspect acute MI average 6.5 7.5 percent . However , mortality rate remain high two particular subgroup patient : receive thrombolysis ( 11.5 13 percent ) 65 year receive thrombolytic ( 13.5 24 percent ) . Recently , attention turn additional adjunctive pharmacologic treatment agent magnesium , nitrate , angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor determine potential reducing mortality . Of , magnesium appear particularly promising . It safe , even hand physician prior experience easily administer readily available hospital United States . Further , expect benefit high risk group describe , would become unusually cost-effective intervention , cost less $ 2,500 per year life save . Supplemental administration magnesium early onset acute myocardial infarction support abundant data indicate potential cardioprotective effect magnesium . Magnesium consider `` nature 's physiologic calcium blocker . '' This protect myocytes calcium overload inhibit calcium influx particularly important time reperfusion . In experimental model ischemia reperfusion , agent inhibit calcium influx improve post-ischemic recovery mechanical function give prior time reperfusion . On hand , little improvement mechanical function observe agent give 15-20 minute onset reperfusion . Reduced serum magnesium may also responsible maladaptive increase coronary tone increase response vasoconstrictor . In set acute myocardial infarction , increase serum magnesium might beneficial , actually decline free magnesium . This come sharp rise free fatty acid bring catecholamine induce lipolysis onset chest pain , result complete magnesium form insoluble soap . Thus , although total body magnesium decrease , magnesium available free form capable exert cardioprotective effect decline . Hence , strong theoretical rationale supplemental magnesium administration set . Since 1984 , least 10 randomize control trial ( RCTs ) intravenous magnesium acute MI report . Several statistical model exist pool data multiple RCTs meta-analysis estimate treatment effect magnesium . It important review essential feature model order place RCT finding proper perspective . The fixed effect model assume RCTs sample homogenous group trial . Under homogeneity assumption , RCT provide estimate true treatment effect difference estimate various RCTs due experimental error ( within-trial variability ) . The random effect model assume RCTs heterogeneous difference estimate treatment effect due experimental error ( within-trial variability ) real difference among trial trial design characteristic patient enrol ( between-trial variability ) . The random effect model generally favor since heterogeneity explain experimental error often exist among RCTs , model take heterogeneity account estimation hypothesis test . Meta-analyses seven RCTs publish 1984-199l provide estimate odds ratio ( OR ) mortality magnesium treat patient 0.44 ( 0.27-0.71 ) use fix effect model 0.45 ( 0.23-0.86 ) use random effect model . The Leicester Intravenous Magnesium Intervention Trial ( LIMIT-2 ) , publish 1992 , report 24 percent reduction mortality magnesium treatment ( P &lt; 0.04 ) , confirm benefit magnesium reduce mortality MI inspire many clinician advocate magnesium treatment program coronary care unit . The magnesium treat patient LIMIT-2 experience 25 percent low incidence congestive heart failure coronary care unit , suggest magnesium exert beneficial effect , least part , via direct protective action myocardium . Given potent predictive power leave ventricular function survival follow MI one would anticipate magnesium-treated patient LIMIT-2 would lower long-term mortality . This hypothesis appear confirmed recent long-term follow report LIMIT-2 show 21percent low rate ischemic heart disease relate mortality magnesium group median follow 2.7 year . The LIMIT-2 investigator recently examine mortality rate five year follow , continue document long term benefit magnesium administer acute phase infarction . The absence loss mortality benefit magnesium long term consistent significant myocardial protective effect achieve critical period myocardial reperfusion . The result ISIS-4 seem contradict result study . A total 58,043 patient enrol ISIS-4 , 29,009 allocate magnesium 29,034 control . There 2,196 death ( 7.6 percent ) 35 day magnesium group 2,079 death ( 7.2 percent ) control group ( OR 1.06 [ 0.99-1.13 ] ) suggest mortality benefit magnesium administration even possibility slight harm . The finding ISIS-4 trigger considerable controversy reason produce null effect magnesium reduce mortality suspect acute MI . When ISIS-4 add precede eight RCTs , fixed effect model ( drive heavily large sample size ISIS-4 ) indicate beneficial effect magnesium ( OR= 1.02 [ 0.96-1.09 ] ) random effect model take account heterogeneity among trial suggests magnesium may reduce mortality ( OR= 0.69 [ 0.47-1.02 ] ) . Thus , random effect model suggest one must search possible source difference ISIS-4 preceding trial . Two important difference appear act concert bias ISIS 4 towards null effect magnesium include : 1 . A low control group mortality rate . The control group mortality ISIS-4 7.2 percent . This probably result combination extensive use thrombolysis ( 70 percent patient ) antiplatelet agent ( 94 percent patient ) combine enrollment intrinsically low-risk patient ( 28 percent 70 year age , 17 percent history prior MI , 14 percent clinical congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , 2 percent systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) &lt; 100 mm Hg ) . Incremental mortality reduce effect magnesium difficult detect low background control mortality rate . The inability ISIS 4 detect overall benefit magnesium also apply specific subgroup 17,325 patient receive thrombolytic . ISIS 4 less 60 percent power detect even 10 percent reduction observe 9.3 percent control mortality subgroup . A detailed analysis relate mortality rate control group treatment effect magnesium observe clinical trial publish ISIS-4 show clearly benefit magnesium therapy increase control group mortality increase . Using relationship , predict trial control group mortality rate 7 percent would show benefit magnesium therapy , precisely result observe ISIS-4 . Of note , LIMIT-2 trial observe control group mortality 10.3 percent reduce 7.8 percent magnesium . The ISIS-4 control group mortality thus magnesium treat group LIMIT-2 . This analysis consistent result late RCT recently report Shechter colleague . They randomize 194 patient acute MI consider unsuitable thrombolysis control ( N=98 ) intravenous magnesium ( N=96 ) . In addition standard contraindication lytic therapy , reason exclusion thrombolysis include either presentation six hour and/or age great 70 year . Shechter et al report 17 death ( 17.3 percent ) placebo group 4 death ( 4.2 percent ) magnesium group correspond OR 0.21 ( 0.07-0.64 ) . Consistent hypothesis magnesium help reduce mortality direct myocardial protective effect data cause death late study . In placebo group , 11 patient die cardiogenic shock , 2 electromechanical dissociation , 2 myocardial rupture 1 cardiac arrest . In contrast , magnesium group 1 patient die cardiogenic shock , 1 myocardial rupture , 2 electromechanical dissociation . Particularly noteworthy finding subset 77 patient age 70 , group expect high short-term mortality acute MI . Indeed , 10 44 elderly patient treat placebo die ( 23 percent ) 3 33 elderly patient treat magnesium die ( 9 percent , p=0.09 ) . Also , especially high risk subgroup , incidence congestive heart failure reduce 25 percent placebo patient 18 percent magnesium patient . 2 . Magnesium administer late ISIS-4 . The ISIS-4 protocol require acute phase treatment MI , include lytic therapy , administer prior randomization initiation study drug therapy ( i.e . magnesium ) . By design , therefore , magnesium could administer `` early '' lytic phase ( e.g . first hour ) . Although time onset symptom randomization record ISIS-4 , time randomization actual administration magnesium NOT record . The median time randomization onset chest pain patient 8 hour ; subset patient receive thrombolytic therapy ( 30 percent trial patient ) median time randomization onset chest pain QUITE prolong 12 hours.. No detail distribution time randomization report ISIS-4 investigator . In effort answer concern , conduct retrospective survey 1,000 randomly select patient . This reveal among receive thrombolytic 50 percent receive magnesium within two hour follow start thrombolytic therapy . LIMIT-2 randomized patient median 3 hour onset chest pain , Schechter 's study 19 nonthrombolytic treat patient , average time chest pain initiation treatment seven hour treatment placebo group ( full five hour earlier non thrombolized group ISIS-4 ) Attempts subgroup analyse ISIS-4 also suffer critical lack precise information actual time administration magnesium . Thus although apparent benefit magnesium see 23,000 patient randomize within six hour onset chest pain , among 17,000 receive thrombolytic therapy ( include 9,000 randomize within 12 hour ) , since patient receive magnesium several hour randomization , one confident reperfusion ( pharmacologically induce spontaneous ) take place presence raise serum magnesium level subgroup . Experimental attempt aim ameliorate cellular calcium overload show calcium antagonist must administer reperfusion critical window minute follow reperfusion order minimize contractile dysfunction . Calcium flux inhibitor , magnesium , administer late reperfusion appear ineffective . The observation pertain subset patient allude ISIS-4 Investigators randomize within six hour symptom onset high multivariate prognosis score . In absence detail time administration magnesium , particular reference elapse time onset thrombolytic therapy , even high risk subgroup , finding ISIS-4 study remain compatible hypothesis early administration magnesium ( particularly reperfusion occurs ) associate reduction mortality acute myocardial infarction . The implication observation , prevent calcium overload reperfused myocytes , load dose magnesium administer thrombolytic therapy period spontaneous reperfusion likely occur patient receive thrombolytic . The design ISIS-4 permit condition meet . Further , prior study suggest low risk profile characterize ISIS-4 patient would likely preclude obtain much additional benefit . The result small trial report Schechter et al strongly support view high risk MI patient benefit early treatment magnesium infusion . However , definitive proof require large sample size propose MAGIC . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study randomise , double-blind trial 6213 patient acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) assign 2 g intravenous bolus magnesium sulphate administer 15 minute , follow 17 g infusion magnesium sulphate 24 hour ( n=3113 ) , match placebo ( n=3100 ) . The primary endpoint 30-day all-cause mortality . At randomisation , patient stratify eligibility reperfusion therapy . The first stratum include patient age 65 year older eligible reperfusion therapy , second stratum include patient age eligible reperfusion therapy . Analysis intention-to-treat . At 30 day , 475 ( 15.3 % ) patient magnesium group 472 ( 15.2 % ) placebo group died.. No benefit harm magnesium observe eight prespecified subgroup analyse patient 15 additional exploratory subgroup analysis . After adjustment factor show effect mortality risk multivariate regression model , benefit magnesium observe .</detailed_description>
