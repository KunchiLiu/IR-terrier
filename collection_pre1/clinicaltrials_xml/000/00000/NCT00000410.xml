	<brief_summary>This study test effectiveness different treatment three commonly diagnose lumbar ( low ) spine condition . The purpose study learn two commonly prescribed treatment ( surgery non-surgical therapy ) work well specific type low back pain . In part study , people lumbar intervertebral disc herniation ( damage tissue bone low spine , backbone ) receive either discectomy ( surgical removal herniated disc material ) non-surgical treatment . This study cover cost treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial ( SPORT ) - Intervertebral Disc Herniation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low back pain consider one widely experienced health problem United States world . This condition second frequent condition , common cold , people see physician lose day work . Estimated cost severely disable low back pain range $ 30-70 billion annually . Rates spinal surgery U.S. increase sharply time , researcher document 15-fold geographic variation rate surgery . In many case , one live one see problem appear determine rate surgery . Despite trend , little evidence prove effectiveness therapy non-surgical management . Overall , SPORT study multicenter , randomize , control trial three common diagnostic group spine surgery perform : lumbar intervertebral disc herniation ( IDH ) , spinal stenosis ( SpS ) spinal stenosis secondary degenerative spondylolisthesis ( DS ) . This arm trial deal patient first diagnostic group . The study compare commonly use standard surgical treatment commonly use standard non-surgical treatment . We conduct study 12 site throughout United States . The primary endpoint study change health-related quality life measure SF-36 health status questionnaire . Secondary endpoint include patient satisfaction treatment , utility current health order estimate quality-adjusted life year ( QALYS ) measure cost-effectiveness , resource use , cost . We follow patient 6 week 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 month determine health status , function , satisfaction , use health care . In arm trial , anticipate enrol randomly allocate total 500 participant . We track additional observational cohort ass health resource outcome ( 1000 participant ) . Enrollment Observational cohort complete February 2003 . We integrate data trial observational cohort formally estimate cost-effectiveness surgical versus non-surgical intervention IDH , SpS , DS . On basis result trial , first time , scientific evidence relative effectiveness surgical versus non-surgical treatment three commonly diagnose lumbar spine condition .</detailed_description>

Surgical screening : Persistent radicular pain provoke moderate exercise , sit , increase abdominal pressure , decrease mobility , list ( scoliosis ) , straight leg raise . Tests : MRI confirm diagnosis level ( ) . Previous lumbar spine surgery . Not surgical candidate reason : Overall health make spinal surgery lifethreatening appropriate alternative , dramatic improvement conservative care , inability ( reason ) undergo surgery within 6 month . Possible pregnancy . Active malignancy : A patient history invasive malignancy ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer ) ineligible unless treat curative intent AND clinical sign symptom malignancy least 5 year . Current fracture , infection , and/or deformity ( great 15 degree lumbar scoliosis , use Cobb measure technique ) spine . Age le 18 year . Cauda Equina syndrome progressive neurological deficit ( usually require urgent surgery ) . Unavailability followup ( plan move , telephone , etc . ) inability complete data survey . Symptoms le 6 week . Patient currently enrol experimental `` spine relate '' study .</criteria>
