	<brief_title>Randomized Trial Aspirin Cataracts U.S. Physicians</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cataract one common cause impaired vision well third lead cause blindness United States . Cataract surgery one safest successful operation . The National Eye Institute estimate progression cataract could slow enough delay need surgery even 10 year , current annual number could reduce 45 percent . Little known relative importance various potential risk factor development cataract . Most current information risk factor come anecdotal report relatively small case-control study . One major project , Framingham Eye Study , identify several factor significantly associate subsequent cataract formation , include diabetes dietary factor . Diabetes long thought increase risk develop cataract . Recently , aspirin propose drug prevent cataract formation slow progression . Aspirin may affect tryptophan level patient cataract , may inhibit aldose reductase , enzyme associate development diabetic cataract . Thus , data study seek determine whether one 325-mg aspirin tablet , take alternate day , protect cataract formation . The data also seek reveal additional cataract risk factor emerge simultaneous control variable . The primary objective trial ass antioxidant effect beta-carotene ( 50 mg alternate day ) cataract development . In addition , factor suggest cataractogenic assessed prospective cohort study . These factor include age , blood pressure , blood cholesterol , height , diabetes , medication use , cigarette smoking , history previous eye trauma surgery . In addition , possible association history vitamin E selenium intake cataract explore . This trial part Physicians Health Study , ongoing , randomize , placebo-controlled clinical trial aspirin prevention cardiovascular mortality beta-carotene prevention cancer . Following randomization , 22,071 physician enrol assign one four group take either aspirin placebo beta-carotene placebo . Follow-up questionnaire send 6 12 month randomization every 12 month thereafter . The randomized aspirin component trial terminate early ( January 1988 ) , average followup approximately 5 year , statistically extreme 44 percent reduce risk first myocardial infarction aspirin group . Since study conduct mail among physician nationwide , examination perform patient determine reach end point . Reported diagnosis cataract confirm medical record review . The primary analysis incidence cataract aspirin placebo group . In addition , Cox proportional hazard model use determine whether difference time cataract diagnosis two group . It postulate potent antioxidant property beta-carotene might make effective prevent cataract development . The investigator thus determine whether difference number cataracts beta-carotene/placebo group aspirin/placebo group .</detailed_description>
