	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Coronary artery disease lead cause death United States , account almost 500,000 death year . Studies confirm myocardial infarction relate occlusive coronary thrombus 80 percent patient . First second-generation thrombolytic agent ( include streptokinase rt-PA ) successfully use restore myocardial blood flow thrombus occlude infarct-related coronary artery . However , clinical investigation necessary determine suitable thrombolytic agent dose method administration , risk subsequent reocclusion , restenosis , and/or myocardial infarction , need additional therapy , likelihood benefit hemorrhagic complication . In 1983 National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute establish TIMI Study Group . The group consist 13 clinical center ( later expand 24 ) , Radiographic Core Laboratory , Radionuclide Core Laboratory , Data Coordinating Center . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The TIMI trial conduct two stage . In Phase I TIMI I , eligible patient randomize receive either 80 mg recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator ( rt-PA ) 1.5 million unit streptokinase intravenously determine relative safety efficacy . Following randomization , patient find angiographically document stenosis great 50 percent infarct-related artery receive thrombolytic therapy double-blind fashion , full anticoagulation , conventional care . Patients subsequently underwent repeat catheterization , radionuclide ventriculogram , pre-discharge , six-week six-month cardiovascular examination . TIMI I stop February 1985 statistically significant difference coronary reperfusion rate treatment group ; rt-PA find superior thrombolytic agent . Following TIMI Phase I , manufacturer rt-PA change large-scale production method rt-PA , new product find thrombolytic activity specificity vitro experimental animal comparable product manufacture old method . However , TIMI investigator conclude clinical evaluation would necessary prior initiation TIMI Phase II . Thus , TIMI Open Label Phase study initiate 1985 , aim establish safety efficacy 'new ' intravenous rt-PA. As Phase I , endpoint lysis coronary thrombus within 90 minute initiation treatment patient document total occlusion infarct-related coronary artery . Additional goal study determine reocclusion rate infarct-related artery 18-48 hour , well determine efficacy PTCA maintain perfusion infarct-related artery prevention recurrent myocardial infarction . The TIMI Open Label Phase study determine optimal coronary recanalization maintenance reperfusion occur 150 mg 'new ' rt-PA infuse six hour . However , subsequent hemorrhagic complication observe 150 mg rt-PA necessitated change dose rt-PA 100 mg . In TIMI II , patient entry begin April 1986 end June 1988 enrollment 3,534 patient . Patients treat intravenous rt-PA within four hour onset chest pain think cause myocardial infarction randomly assign invasive strategy conservative strategy . The primary endpoint survival free recurrent myocardial infarction six week one year follow-up . There 1,681 patient assign delayed invasive strategy catheterization perform 18 48 hour rt-PA therapy . If catheterization show great 60 percent subtotal stenosis infarct-related artery consider technically approachable , angioplasty attempt . Angioplasty perform 60.5 percent 1,500 patient underwent catheterization invasive strategy group . The remain 39.5 percent 593 patient angioplasty perform . There 1,658 patient assign conservative strategy cardiac catheterization reserve 587 patient spontaneous exercise-induced myocardial ischemia within 21 day infarction . A total 13.5 percent patient arm underwent coronary angioplasty , 7.6 percent underwent bypass surgery , 1.1 percent underwent procedure ; 77 percent patient conservative strategy group revascularization procedure within 21 day infarction . TIMI IIA , subtrial 586 patient , investigate whether immediate cardiac catheterization percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty , appropriate , would confer advantage procedure perform 18 48 hour later . All patient treat intravenous rt-PA within four hour onset acute myocardial infarction . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
