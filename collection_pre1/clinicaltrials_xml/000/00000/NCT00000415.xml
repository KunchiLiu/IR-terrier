	<brief_summary>Doctors recommend young child participate daily physical activity promote bone health . However , study adults show physical activity increase calcium intake cause noticeable benefit bone health factor occur together . The goal study find whether calcium intake change response bone activity child 3 4 year old . Children participate one two program conduct childcare center 5 day week 1 year . One program involve activity use large muscle ( gross motor activity ) . The involve activity use small muscle ( fine motor activity ) . We give calcium supplement ( 1 gram per day ) half child program give half inactive pill . We measure bone mass bone mineral density begin end study . We take measurement 12 month program 's completion see physical activity and/or calcium supplement long-term effect bone mineral density physical activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participation daily physical activity program young child currently recommend mean promote bone health . Results study adults indicate beneficial effect either physical activity calcium ( Ca ) intake may apparent factor present . Our result infant indicate physical activity combine low Ca diet may detrimental term bone mass accretion . The overall objective study determine whether Ca intake modifies bone response activity young child 3 4 year age . Our hypothesis ( 1 ) increase bone mass result physical activity program pronounce child randomize receive Ca supplement compare increase child randomize receive placebo ; ( 2 ) 12 month cessation activity program , bone mass remain high child randomize gross motor activity compare child randomize fine motor activity , beneficial effect Ca supplementation persist among child randomize gross motor activity . We test hypothesis randomize 2 x 2 factorial trial 3- 4-year-old child . We randomize child either gross motor fine motor activity program conduct childcare center 5 day week 1 year . We randomize child either Ca supplement ( 1 g/d ) placebo group . The primary outcome study bone mass accretion change bone mineral density , determine dual energy x-ray absorptiometry begin end study . We activity assessment throughout study period determine whether participation gross motor activity group also increase spontaneous activity child . Anthropometric measurement dietary information allow u statistically control potential confounders . We obtain additional bone mass physical activity measurement 12 month completion program determine intervention long-term effect bone mineral density physical activity . A finding beneficial effect Ca supplementation physical activity , either independent combination , lay groundwork devise prevention strategy within educational system optimize bone health begin early life . However , may find increased physical activity presence low moderate Ca intake may detrimental effect bone mass accretion period rapid growth .</detailed_description>
