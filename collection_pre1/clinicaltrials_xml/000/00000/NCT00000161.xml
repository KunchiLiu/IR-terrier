	<detailed_description>Cataract AMD two important cause visual impairment old Americans . Approximately 3.3 million people visual impairment due cataract . Cataract extraction , although one safe successful operation , frequently perform operation United States among person old 60 , cost estimate $ 1.5 billion annually . AMD lead cause new case blindness person age 65 old . Approximately 25 percent person age 65 year old sign AMD . The pathogenesis AMD , however , partly understood , etiology remain obscure . For patient , available treatment . The public health burden impose cataract AMD increase come decade U.S. population age . These randomize , double-masked , placebo-controlled trial test hypothesis supplementation antioxidant vitamins low-dose aspirin reduces risk age-related cataract AMD . The study population Women 's Health Study ( WHS ) Women 's Antioxidant Cardiovascular Study ( WACS ) . The WHS randomize , double-masked , placebo-controlled trial use 2x2 factorial design test low-dose aspirin ( 100 mg alternate day ) vitamin E ( 600 IU alternate day ) primary prevention cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) cancer . It conduct among 39,876 apparently healthy female health professional age 45 year old . The WACS randomize , double-masked , placebo-controlled secondary prevention trial use 2x2x2x2 factorial design test antioxidant vitamin ( vitamin E [ 600 IU alternate day ] C [ 500 mg daily ] , beta carotene [ 50 mg alternate day ] ) , combination folate ( 800 mg daily ) , vitamin B6 ( 25 mg daily ) , vitamin B12 ( 1 mg daily ) among woman high risk CVD morbidity mortality . It conduct among 8,171 female health professional , age 40 year old , either preexist CVD least three coronary risk factor therefore high risk development CVD . In addition randomize comparison , investigator also examine risk factor age-related cataract AMD two population . Factors examine include cigarette smoking , alcohol intake , blood pressure , blood cholesterol , cardiovascular disease , height , body mass index , diabetes , dietary factor . In study population , followup questionnaire send 6 12 month randomization every 12 month thereafter request information development relevant study end point include cataract AMD participant compliance study medication . Reported diagnosis cataract AMD confirm medical record review . The primary analysis randomize study incidence AMD cataract treatment placebo group . Survival analysis use determine whether difference time AMD cataract diagnosis .</detailed_description>
