	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Life expectancy Black Americans 10 percent less white . The lead cause excessive mortality old Blacks cardiovascular disease may largely due disproportionately high rate hypertension old Blacks . Conventional antihypertensive drug therapy frequently associate adverse effect quality-of-life ( QL ) low compliance rate , especially elderly minority population . The present study extension pilot study comparable sample 80 Black elderly . The previous study , first kind , yield result indicate TM PMR produce moderate reduction systolic diastolic blood pressure , TM produce significant improvement blood pressure quality-of-life . Dr. Schneider hypothesize related evidence TM prove effective therapeutic adjunct regular pharmacotherapy mild hypertension elderly Blacks , prove even effective foster compliance improve overall quality-of-life without unpleasant side effect anti-hypertensive medication . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized . Over 18-month period , 213 people screen inclusion study . Of , 127 initial diastolic blood pressure 90 109 mm Hg , systolic blood pressure 189 mm Hg le , final baseline blood pressure 179/104 less mm Hg randomize treatment . Of 127 participant , 16 complete follow-up blood pressure measurement . Thus , 111 subject complete study . All subject pretested four session baseline period clinic blood pressure , ambulatory blood pressure , cardiovascular emotional reactivity , quality-of-life measure . Subjects randomly assign , 36 TM , 37 PMR , 38 lifestyle modification education control follow monthly major post-tests three month eighteen month variable . The primary outcome variable change clinic systolic diastolic blood pressure value measure blindly . The secondary outcome change self-monitored home blood pressure compliance . The study extend July , 2007 additional 5 year followup cohort .</detailed_description>
