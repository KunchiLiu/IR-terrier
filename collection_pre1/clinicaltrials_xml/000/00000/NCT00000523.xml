	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Regular physical exercise associate low coronary heart disease mortality , favorably affect coronary risk factor , increase cardiovascular functional capacity . Fewer one-third Americans engage regular physical exercise 20 percent men 10 percent woman age 45 . This largely effective strategy increase exercise habit broadly-based segment Americans develop . This study apply physiological behavioral knowledge derive numerous laboratory past 10-15 year clinical setting . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Following stratification gender cigarette smoking status , subject randomize one four group : home exercise moderate intensity individually monitor ; home exercise high intensity individually monitor ; exercise high intensity group supervise ; program control group . The intervention program conduct one year follow one-year maintenance program . Main outcome measure include treadmill exercise test performance , exercise participation rate , heart disease risk factor . Variables measure two year include plasma lipid , lipoprotein , apoproteins , lipase activity , glucose insulin , sex hormone , cardiovascular reactivity psychological stress , cigarette smoking , nutrient intake , psychological status , cardiovascular functional capacity .</detailed_description>
