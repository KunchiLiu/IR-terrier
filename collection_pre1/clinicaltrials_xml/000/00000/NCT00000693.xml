	<brief_summary>To study use acyclovir ( ACV ) zidovudine ( AZT ) treatment cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) retinitis patient AIDS would otherwise treat ganciclovir ( DHPG ) alone . CMV retinitis one common opportunistic infection patient AIDS . DHPG present drug available widespread compassionate use United States . Although patient respond treatment DHPG , medication cure infection . Most patient relapse require retreatment DHPG . Because large relapse rate , people treat CMV retinitis place continuous treatment DHPG . There two major problem associate ongoing use DHPG : 1 ) The development low white blood cell ( WBC ) count ( leukopenia ) know side effect drug ; 2 ) increase risk leukopenia DHPG give together AZT , antiviral drug currently available treatment HIV infection . Therefore , patient take AZT DHPG time bone marrow toxicity make much severe drug give together . This result difficult decision whether forgo potential life-extending therapy AZT order preserve sight . An effective treatment CMV retinitis need allow patient also take AZT . ACV presently drug choice severe herpes virus infection . It show effective suppressing severe CMV disease patient receive bone marrow transplant .</brief_summary>
