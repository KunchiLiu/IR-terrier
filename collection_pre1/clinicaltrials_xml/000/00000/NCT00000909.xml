	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety tolerability give interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) alone HIV-positive patient CD4 cell count great 350 cells/mm3 wish receive anti-HIV ( antiretroviral ) therapy . This study also determine IL-2 give alone increase CD4 cell count decrease level HIV blood . IL-2 ( protein find blood help boost immune system ) result increase CD4 cell count ( immune system cell fight infection ) . IL-2 normally give combination antiretroviral therapy treat HIV infection ; however , HIV patient wish take antiretrovirals . This study ask safe effective take IL-2 alone treat HIV infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Effects Giving IL-2 Alone HIV-Positive Patients With CD4 Cell Counts Least 350 Cells/mm3 Who Do Not Wish Receive Anti-HIV Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous study show interleukin-2 , give skin , result CD4+ cell count increase , may impact upon disease progression . A Phase III trial next step development efficacy trial . One question , however , address previous IL-2 study : whether safe reasonable allow prospective IL-2 recipient autonomy choose whether take antiretrovirals addition cytokine therapy . This trial address concern . In open-label study , 36 patient randomize 1 3 treatment group 12 patient : Group I : IL-2 every 12 hour 5 day every 8 week . Group II : IL-2 every 12 hour 5 day every 8 week ( high IL-2 dose ) . Group III : Control group receive therapy . Patients must complete minimum 3 8-week cycle treatment . Twelve patient randomized arm . Following study completion , Group I II patient may elect continue receive IL-2 follow-up part additional protocol base result study . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 2/12/99 : Patients receive study medication and/or routine protocol visit procedure least 6 month acceptable compliance eligible continue follow-up extension phase . The extension phase continue least 1 year date last patient enrol extension phase . Patients originally randomize IL-2 may continue receive IL-2 extension period , IL-2 therapy guide individual basis . Patients originally randomize therapy may continue receive therapy extension phase . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 7/11/00 : Patients demonstrate acceptable compliance routine visit procedure initial treatment phase and/or extension phase may participate long-term follow-up phase require follow-up visit least every 4 month approximately 5 year . Patients originally randomize Group 1 2 may continue receive IL-2 , IL-2 therapy guide individual basis , long-term follow-up phase . Patients originally randomize Group 3 may continue receive therapy long-term follow-up phase . ]</detailed_description>
