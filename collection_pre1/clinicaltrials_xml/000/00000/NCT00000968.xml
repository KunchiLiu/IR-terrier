	<brief_title>A Phase I Multicenter Clinical Trial Evaluate Safety Immunogenicity Vaccinia-Derived HIV-1 Recombinant Envelope Glycoprotein ( gp160 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although recent advance make antiviral therapy AIDS , currently cure AIDS . It likely ultimate control disease depend development safe effective vaccine HIV . Healthy , adult volunteer without identifiable high-risk behavior HIV-1 infection vaccinate . In phase 1 , participate unit , four volunteer receive dose gp160 ( 12.5 mcg ) ; two volunteer receive placebo . Volunteers monitor 1 month proceed second phase . In phase 2 , four volunteer receive gp160 ( 50 mcg ) ; two volunteer receive placebo . Primary immunization two booster immunization day 30 day 180 do outpatient set . Volunteers closely monitor first 2 week postimmunization ( primary booster ) , extensively follow minimum 2 year . Volunteers may offer additional boost preparation 18 month . Per 07/28/92 amendment , 18 volunteer receive 200 mcg gp160 unblinded study . Volunteers phase 2 receive four dos 50 mcg gp160 receive additional boost 200 mcg gp160 18-19 month post initial vaccination . Per 05/13/94 amendment , volunteer phase 2 receive additional 200 mcg boost receive another 200 mcg boost 18-24 month last injection ( St. Louis University site ) .</detailed_description>
