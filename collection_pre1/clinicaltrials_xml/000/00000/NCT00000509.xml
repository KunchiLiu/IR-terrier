	<brief_title>Potassium Sodium Control Blood Pressure Hypertensives</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Appropriately increase interest concern high blood pressure major public health problem coincide indication risk hypertension-related morbidity mortality could reduce reduction blood pressure . Consensus suggestion individualize approach use treat patient mild hypertension stimulate investigation non-pharmacological method . Such investigation also considerable interest relation understand physiology blood pressure control well development less costly non-drug therapy . Interest heighten information suggest might distinctly harmful side effect related antihypertensive drug therapy , particularly thiazide diuretic , setting . Studies non-drug therapy include dietary modification primarily involve weight reduction sodium restriction increase recent concern factor alcohol intake , dietary fat , calcium , magnesium , potassium intake . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , double-blind . One hundred forty-five subject randomize low sodium placebo group sodium intake restrict 80 mEq/day , 142 subject potassium supplementation ( 96 mEq/day ) group whose sodium intake also restrict 80 mEq/day . After 12 week intervention , antihypertensive drug withdrawn . Follow-up participant least two year . The primary endpoint proportion subject require antihypertensive medication various point follow randomization .</detailed_description>
