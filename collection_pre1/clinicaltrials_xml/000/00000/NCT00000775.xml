	<detailed_description>It likely ultimate control AIDS depend development safe effective vaccine HIV-1 . SynVac synthetic candidate vaccine base eight V3-derived peptide attach heptalysyl core form radial octamers . In animal study , vaccine appear safe demonstrates capability produce immune response . Twelve volunteer enter one three dose level SynVac . At dose level , 10 volunteer receive vaccine two receive placebo . At least eight volunteer dose level must monitor 1 week subsequent volunteer enter next high level . Intramuscular injection give day 0 , 28 , 168 . Approximately 12 clinic visit require .</detailed_description>
