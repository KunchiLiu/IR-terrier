	<brief_summary>We study 300 people knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) receive medical care large health maintenance organization ( HMO ) Indianapolis . Our study evaluate comprehensive plan treatment knee OA primary care physician . Primary care physician provide standard care knee OA half study participant ( 150 people ) , use comprehensive treatment plan guideline treat half . The comprehensive plan include careful use medication along non-drug approach patient education , exercise , social support . People participate study receive care knee OA 1 year . We measure result ( outcome ) treatment start study 3 month , 6 month , 12 month patient join study .

	<brief_title>Effects Comprehensive Care Knee OA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anticipating trend toward generalism medicine , rheumatology community begin set forth guideline manage osteoarthritis ( OA ) . These guideline emphasize comprehensive approach toward nondrug treatment ( e.g. , patient education , exercise , social support ) conservative approach drug management minimize side effect nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) . Unfortunately , primary care physician provide conservative , comprehensive care OA promote recent rheumatology literature . Also , although researcher study individual element comprehensive approach OA care largely validated isolation , research support exist suggest uniformly adopt OA care guideline result well patient outcome and/or reduce cost care . In project , implement , control fashion , evaluate comprehensive plan treat patient knee OA primary care physicians manage care environment . Comprehensive care knee OA guide procedure design introduce reinforce ( ) array nondrug , self-care procedure intend combat joint pain preserve function ( b ) step protocol drug management knee pain minimizes risk adverse side effect NSAIDs . Participants 300 patient confirm clinical diagnosis knee OA receive medical care large health maintenance organization ( HMO ) Indianapolis , Indiana . We randomly allocate geographically discrete office HMOs experimental ( OA care algorithm ) control ( routine OA care ) condition ( 150 subjects/group ) . Patients enroll study location receive care knee OA 1 year guideline specify random assignment . We measure outcomes baseline 3 month , 6 month , 12 month enrollment , outcome include joint pain , physical function , drug side effect , quality life ( i.e. , general health status ) , satisfaction OA care , direct cost medical care . We think comprehensive care , guide algorithm , result significant improvement knee pain , physical function , patient satisfaction , low direct cost compare care deliver routine circumstance .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Study participant must treat chronic knee pain primary care physician participate HMO satisfy American College Rheumatology Clinical Criteria diagnosis knee OA . All subject able read write English , telephone , give informed consent . Significant hematologic , renal , hepatic , cardiovascular disease ( include mild/moderate hypertension ) serious medical condition might preclude subject 's ability participate fully project , keep clinic appointment , etc . Conditions knee OA limit low extremity function mobility and/or would confound evaluation knee pain function ( e.g. , clinically significant spinal hip arthritis , painful dysfunctional foot , peripheral vascular disease , lumbar radiculopathy , stroke , etc. ) . A know `` secondary '' cause OA , include acute chronic infectious arthritis ; crystalinduced arthritis ; systemic inflammatory connective tissue disease ( e.g. , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus ) ; osteonecrosis ; Paget 's disease ; metabolic disease , hemochromatosis , Wilson 's disease , ochronosis .</criteria>
