	<brief_title>Evaluation SC-V Versus Conventional CPR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Since 1960 's , development cardiopulmonary resuscitation result saving countless number live . More recently , emphasis increase CPR capability development prehospital emergency care system involvement lay public provision CPR . The effectiveness technique prehospital setting demonstrate several community study patient cardiac arrest survival rate range 11-17 percent . Additionally , patient ventricular fibrillation , proportion patient discharge alive range 14-30 percent five city outcome EMS program examine . These success , however , conceal many failure CPR could reverse death even though correctly apply within establish period arrest resuscitation . However , considerable potential exist improve CPR technique make additional inroad towards estimate 100,000 death year United States could reverse widespread application CPR . A major goal CPR maintain adequate peripheral perfusion ( particularly cerebral coronary circulation ) cardiac arrest attempt make restore normal cardiac function . Maneuvers increase intrathoracic pressure , total airway occlusion chest compression abdominal compression binding , show increase carotid blood flow dog . Sixteen period conventional CPR follow SC-V CPR return conventional CPR study 11 case in-hospital cardiac arrest Johns Hopkins University . The finding indicate simultaneous compression ventilation high airway pressure ( SC-V CPR ) greatly increase carotid flow velocity radial artery pressure value achieve conventional CPR . Maximum benefit achieve patient standard conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation least effective . The increase flow index note simultaneous compression ventilation 274 percent control . The success new method CPR demonstrate in-hospital clinical trial . The benefit method suggest need test technique prehospital set vast majority cardiac arrest occur . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Units Miami Dade County Rescue Squads utilized technique mid-point cross-over design . One three shift study rescue station thoroughly instruct SC-V CPR protocol . A second crew give intensive review conventional CPR methodology . The third shift initially receive conventional CPR review continue perform conventional CPR . After six month , third shift train SC-V CPR utilize technique one year . At cross-over point , crew train SC-V CPR receive intensive review conventional CPR crew . The conventional CPR crew , turn , train SC-V CPR . Total sample size 994 patient , 494 treatment group 500 control group . The study completion date list record obtain Query/View/Report ( QVR ) System .</detailed_description>
