	<brief_summary>To determine whether regular administration beta-blocker drug propranolol people least one document myocardial infarction would result significant reduction mortality cause follow-up period . Eligible volunteer patient recruited participate double-blind clinical trial within 21 day onset acute event . One-half patient randomly assign beta-blocking drug ( propranolol ) one-half placebo . The trial also evaluate effect propranolol incidence coronary heart disease mortality , sudden cardiac death , nonfatal myocardial infarction plus coronary heart disease mortality person document previous myocardial infarction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Survivors document myocardial infarction recognize high risk die relative general population . Serious arrhythmia , occur without evidence new infarction , common cause death population . Theoretically , agent ( 1 ) block sympathetic nervous activity think involve precipitate sudden death ( 2 ) non-neurogenic antiarrhythmic property would value people coronary heart disease . Propranolol , like beta- block agent , well property therefore might expect prevent retard complication coronary heart disease serious arrhythmia . This would reflect decrease mortality due coronary heart disease . A workshop chronic antiarrhythmic therapy review contemporary experimental data clinical practice recommend clinical trial undertake clearly show effect beta-blocking drug mortality . Subsequently , trial approve Clinical Applications Prevention Advisory Committee , Cardiology Advisory Committee , National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council . The study protocol review February 1978 recommend approval policy-data monitor board ad hoc member . The protocol approve Director NHLBI March 1978 . Recruitment start June 19 , 1978 , end October 1980 . A total 3,837 patient randomize . Units participate trial include 32 clinical center , EKG center , central laboratory , coordinate center , 1-hour ambulatory ECG center , 24-hour ambulatory EKG center , EKG tape quality control center . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A randomized , double-blind design single experimental control group . Patients recruit hospital acute myocardial infarction enrol study discharge . Eligible patient fulfil study definition acute myocardial infarction . The diagnosis base either electrocardiographic record show evolve QRS segment change ST segment T wave change together enzyme change appropriate clinical history . One-half patient place therapy use beta-blocking drug ( propranolol ) . The half receive placebo . The prescribed maintenance dosage propranolol either l80 240 mgs/day , depend upon serum drug level . Intervention duration average 25 month . The study completion date list record obtain `` Completed Date '' enter Query View Report System ( QVR ) .</detailed_description>
