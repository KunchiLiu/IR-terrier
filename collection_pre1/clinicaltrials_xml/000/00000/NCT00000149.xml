	<brief_title>Collaborative Initial Glaucoma Treatment Study ( CIGTS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent study challenge conventional wisdom treat newly diagnose open-angle glaucoma ( OAG ) eyedrops ; rather , study suggest effective control glaucomatous damage obtain immediate filtration surgery . In addition , increased attention impact therapy health-related quality life add another consideration decide upon appropriate treatment patient . The Collaborative Initial Glaucoma Treatment Study ( CIGTS ) , randomize , control clinical trial , conduct determine whether patient newly diagnose OAG best manage conventional approach topical pharmacologic agent immediate filtration surgery . Eligible patient randomize receive either stepped medication treatment regimen filtration surgery control OAG . Sample size requirement indicate 300 patient need treatment approach ; total 607 patient ultimately recruit CIGTS . Patients randomized medication treatment arm receiving step regimen topical medication , begin single agent ( typically beta blocker ) , additional medication add upon document lack intraocular pressure control evidence progressive visual field loss . If medication fail control patient 's OAG , series treatment step begin argon laser trabeculoplasty conclude trabeculectomy . In surgical treatment arm , patient underwent immediate trabeculectomy , documented failure , proceed argon laser trabeculectomy , conclude medication . Patients , rather eye , randomize two treatment arm ; eye eligible treatment , treatment course eye determine randomization . Following randomization , participate community ophthalmologist affiliate study allow manage medical surgical care study patient . However , patient see Clinical Centers standardize followup examination 3 6 month treatment every 6 month thereafter ; addition , patient randomize surgical arm receive , minimum , postsurgical followup 1 day , 1 week , 1 month . At Clinical Center visit , examination eye ( ) include evaluation visual acuity , visual field , intraocular pressure . The result test determine whether treatment change . In addition , regular interval treatment , patient interview telephone ass health-related quality life . A questionnaire include Sickness Impact Profile , Visual Activities Questionnaire , component use .</detailed_description>
