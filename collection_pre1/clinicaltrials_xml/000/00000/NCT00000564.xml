	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease major health problem United States . In 1975 , sixth lead cause death . The economic impact disease 1972 amount $ 803 million direct cost disability treatment , $ 3.05 billion disability cost , $ 645 million lose earnings due premature death . Motivated part significant toll disease , conference Scientific Basis Respiratory Therapy , co-sponsored American Thoracic Society Division Lung Diseases , examine current status use oxygen therapy chronic lung disease . The proceeding conference , publish American Review Respiratory Disease ( Vol . 110 , No . 6 , December 1974 ) , include recommendation clinical study would provide critical assessment role nocturnal oxygen therapy treatment patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Low-flow oxygen , administer continuously , know benefit patient chronic hypoxic lung disease . However , low-flow oxygen administration long periods time cumbersome , confining , expensive . If nocturnal oxygen administration could unequivocally demonstrate efficacious , advantage convenience cost would favorable impact treatment patient , rationale could develop test therapy large group patient . The Planning Phase trial initiate September 1976 . Patient recruitment begin May 1977 . The Recruitment Phase last 24 month . The 203 patient trial assign randomly nocturnal oxygen therapy ( home ) continuous low-flow oxygen therapy . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , fixed sample . Two hundred three patient randomly assign at-home treatment continuous oxygen therapy nocturnal oxygen therapy . Endpoints related quality life , neuropsychological function , respiratory function capacity . Intervention last 6 month 3 year , average intervention 19.3 month .</detailed_description>
