	<brief_summary>AMENDED 07/07/93 : To evaluate whether continuous infusion AZT impact neurodevelopmental deficit associate HIV infection alter rate encephalopathy progression child fail improve show progression deficit despite optimal AZT therapy . AMENDED : To assess whether didanosine ( ddI ) well tolerate AZT administer either continuous intravenous delivery oral administration ( ddI arm remove per amend version ) .To determine whether ddI achieve comparable clinical efficacy continuous intravenous route delivery AZT , ass whether either regimen superior achieve intermittent AZT dosage schedule . To determine whether difference patient parent ( guardian ) compliance three treatment regimen . Original design : To determine whether pharmacokinetic profile ( bloodstream level ) zidovudine ( AZT ) influence effectiveness HIV infection child . That , study seek find whether difference effect AZT give continuous intravenous infusion ( , available , oral sustain release dose ) compare intermittent ( continuous ) dose give orally every 6 hour . The study also plan determine ( 1 ) whether difference tolerance side effect associate AZT give intermittent schedule oppose steady-state schedule ; ( 2 ) extent variation patient patient AZT level whether plasma cerebrospinal fluid level AZT relate degree therapeutic effectiveness ; ( 3 ) whether difference response child acquire HIV infection perinatally ( , , time birth ) versus acquire HIV infection transfusion . One serious effect HIV disease child neuropsychological deterioration ( relate mental nervous system function ) . This complication affect vast majority HIV infect child . A previous study continuous intravenous administration AZT pediatric patient HIV infection show consistent dramatic improvement symptoms patient show neurodevelopmental deficit abnormality . These improvement see within 3 4 week AZT treatment start . Neurodevelopmental improvement sustain AZT , usually show steady improvement , patient , associate restoration pre-HIV intellectual neurological function . This study also show increase IQ score child receive continuous infusion AZT overt clinical evidence encephalopathy ( disease brain ) . Thus change cognitive function may among early sign AIDS encephalopathy underscore need start therapy treat central nervous system patient appear clinically intact . A study compare continuous infusion intermittent dose AZT show significant increase IQ score child receive continuous dose compare treated intermittent schedule . Although portable infusion pump allow patient receive continuous infusion AZT , sustain release oral formulation could provide continuous release AZT bloodstream would highly desirable .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>One serious effect HIV disease child neuropsychological deterioration ( relate mental nervous system function ) . This complication affect vast majority HIV infect child . A previous study continuous intravenous administration AZT pediatric patient HIV infection show consistent dramatic improvement symptoms patient show neurodevelopmental deficit abnormality . These improvement see within 3 4 week AZT treatment start . Neurodevelopmental improvement sustain AZT , usually show steady improvement , patient , associate restoration pre-HIV intellectual neurological function . This study also show increase IQ score child receive continuous infusion AZT overt clinical evidence encephalopathy ( disease brain ) . Thus change cognitive function may among early sign AIDS encephalopathy underscore need start therapy treat central nervous system patient appear clinically intact . A study compare continuous infusion intermittent dose AZT show significant increase IQ score child receive continuous dose compare treated intermittent schedule . Although portable infusion pump allow patient receive continuous infusion AZT , sustain release oral formulation could provide continuous release AZT bloodstream would highly desirable . AMENDED 07/07/93 : Children progressive encephalopathy receive minimum 3 month oral intermittent AZT fail improve follow 6 month optimal AZT receive continuous infusion AZT via portable infusion pump . AMENDED : The oral sustained release drop oral ddI . Added plan stratification randomization patient receive antiretroviral therapy 4 week prior study entry . The informed consent modify reflect ddI toxicity adult study . Computerized Tomography radiation dosimetry include . AMENDED : Dropping ddI component open child encephalopathy meaning lose milestone , equal P2 CDC rating . Testing difference intermediate v continuous AZT . 12/1990 . Original design : Children first evaluate randomization accord whether evidence neurodevelopmental deficit time initial pretreatment evaluation . Patients assign 1 3 group , receive AZT ( 1 ) continuous infusion ; ( 2 ) oral , intermittent ( every 6 hour ) dosing ; ( 3 ) oral sustained-release dosing . If oral sustained-release formulation available study begin , begin first 2 group . The sustained release preparation evaluate soon available . Patients tested measure physical biological improvement neurodevelopmental function .</detailed_description>
