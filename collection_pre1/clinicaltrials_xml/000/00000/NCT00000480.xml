	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Cardiac arrest ( sudden cardiac death ) occur relatively frequently asymptomatic patient myocardial infarction , ejection fraction less 40 percent , non-sustained ventricular tachycardia . However , possible predict die suddenly cardiac arrest occur . Current effort reduce sudden death long-term survivor myocardial infarction patient coronary disease produce result encourage . Such patient may feel quite well . They survive myocardial infarction may slight even moderate reduction exercise ability , 'pacing ' , patient lead relatively normal life . They may aware arrhythmia short period palpitation may trouble transiently . Consequently , group patient , many still prime life , relatively high risk die suddenly . The multicenter trial may reveal effective treatment patient , value electrophysiologic study predict risk sudden cardiac death , whether electrophysiologic study help select best mode treatment . The protocol performing programmed stimulation serial drug test design mirror currently use many practicing electrophysiologists . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , non-blind . Patients assigned standard therapy aggressive arm consist electrophysiologic-guided antiarrhythmic therapy . Patients aggressive arm whose ventricular tachycardia suppressible still inducible , hemodynamically stable ventricular tachycardia , follow drug therapy . Otherwise , patient aggressive arm receive implantable defibrillator . The primary endpoint sudden cardiac death cardiac arrest . Patients without inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia follow registry . Recruitment cease October 31 , 1996 recommendation DSMB . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter NIH Query View Report ( QVR ) .</detailed_description>
