	<brief_summary>To determine whether profound reduction serum cholesterol level , induce maintain partial ileal bypass , would prevent second heart attack among men woman one myocardial infarction whose blood cholesterol could reduce sufficiently diet .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Program Surgical Control Hyperlipidemias ( POSCH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The correlative evidence link elevate cholesterol increase risk cardiovascular disease incontrovertible . Animal study show significant reduction disease human may forthcoming blood lipid reduce elevated level . Beginning 1960s , patient undergone surgical bypass procedure hyperlipidemia . Patients select surgery dietary management carry three year . The average serum cholesterol concentration decrease markedly decrease sustain . This grant-supported clinical trial attempt determine effect cardiovascular morbidity mortality partial ileal bypass patient suffer myocardial infarction within previous 5 year serum cholesterol 220 mg deciliter ( 200 mg LDL cholesterol l40 mg ) . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , non-blind , fixed sample study control group experimental group equal size . The experimental group receive partial ileal bypass diet therapy reduce serum cholesterol triglyceride . The control group give conventional medical therapy exclusive cholesterol-lowering drug . The primary endpoint death due cause . Secondary endpoint include death due atherosclerosis morbidity recurrent myocardial infarction , unstable angina , cerebrovascular accident . Other secondary endpoint include coronary artery bypass surgery , percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty , cardiac transplantation , peripheral vascular surgery . Beginning January 1993 , long-term morbidity mortality follow-up continue December 1997 grant support ( R01HL49522 ) . Follow-up include track morbidity mortality annual telephone survey review patient record , include death autopsy result . In addition , mortality morbidity correlate lipid change exist arteriographic result . The long-term course control patient treat AHA Phase II Diet counsel assessed long-term side effect partial ileal bypass evaluate .</detailed_description>
