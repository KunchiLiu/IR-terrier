	<brief_title>Cardiovascular System Obesity : Effect Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Obesity problem significant public health concern western country . One reason risk factor cardiovascular disease , notably hypertension . For example , Framingham study find relative body weight , weight change observation , skin fold thickness relate exist blood pressure level subsequent rate development hypertension . Additionally , previously normotensive individual , risk develop hypertension proportional degree overweight . Obesity also major risk factor type II diabetes mellitus . On hand , overweight individual physically healthy suffer psychosocial consequence condition lose weight would desirable well individual risk physical illness . Like essential hypertension , obesity chronic condition many individual also heterogeneous condition many underlying cause interact factor . It generally difficult treat chronic problem , success come slowly , physician practice generally understand condition rather poorly manage well . Results study caloric restriction , behavior modification medication often disappointing subject physician . In practice , dropout rate exercise program , well various dietary self-help program relatively high . Similarly , clinical trial dropout rate often quite high . Compounding problem weight management rather universal negative bias part physicians prescribe anorexiant medication . It previously generally hold agent either effective short term . Additionally , always concern potential adverse effect anorexiants well potential abuse . Physicians use appetite suppressant often prescribe four six week inappropriate management chronic condition . In several relatively short term clinical trial ( e.g. , 16 week ) , show appetite control medication fenfluramine phentermine effective placebo induce weight loss . It less clear trial perform heretofore effective anorectic medication use adjunct behavior modification diet . This aspect address first two year clinical trial consideration . A second controversial issue concern duration efficacy anorexiant agent . Originally felt tolerance develop , hence recommendation short course treatment . A long-term double-blind study use anorexiants since demonstrate exert beneficial effect 24 week , evidence weight loss maintenance weight loss . This important finding give , note earlier , chronicity problem obesity . The so-called stimulant anorexiants , like phentermine , believe act via central catecholamine mechanism . Side-effects include nervousness , insomnia , increased motor activity cardiovascular disturbance tachycardia elevation blood pressure . The latter effect lead physician feel use obese hypertensive patient limited . Fenfluramine , although chemically relate stimulant anorexiants , appear act via serotonergic mechanism . It reportedly cause sedation , occasionally diarrhea cardiovascular effect . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Double-blind , fix sample . After six-week single-blind placebo control diet behavior modification period , participant enter parallel-group comparison fenfluramine plus phentermine versus placebo . In third fourth year study , patient randomly assign either continuous therapy intermittent therapy . The intermittent therapy group receive medication three month April June period Thanksgiving New Year 's day . The study completion date list record obtain Query/View/Report ( QVR ) System .</detailed_description>
