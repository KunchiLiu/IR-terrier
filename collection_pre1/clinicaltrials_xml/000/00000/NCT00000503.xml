	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Angiographic study acute stage myocardial infarction show complete occlusion 75-85 percent subtotal lesion remain case . Evidence spasm acutely occluded artery report . However , majority pathological well intraoperative examination yield thrombotic material site complete obstruction . Indirect evidence thrombotic material provide successful intracoronary thrombolysis 80 percent infarct patient complete obstruction . There could causative relationship spasm , intimal damage coronary thrombosis . Selective application spasmolytic and/or thrombolytic substance occlude vessel enable high local concentration dos cause little systemic effect . Angiographic verification result pharmacotherapy would help clarify role spasm thrombus pathogenesis acute coronary occlusion . Reperfusion man achieve coronary by-pass surgery acute stage infarction . Follow-up angiography reveal significant improvement leave ventricular function . Intracoronary streptokinase infusion result recanalization acute coronary occlusion 80 percent case within 20-30 minute infusion time . Reperfusion achieve intervention angiography associate improved local wall motion well improve leave ventricular function . Improvement leave ventricular function depend duration symptom prior reperfusion presence absence collateral blood flow . Available data suggest improvement likely occur reperfusion achieve within 3-4 hour . However , since majority patient reach hospital great 4 hour chest pain , study functional change follow late reperfusion great practical significance . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study randomize trial myocardial reperfusion acute myocardial infarction selective intracoronary infusion nitroglycerin and/or intracoronary infusion streptokinase . The trial single-blinded interventional therapy ; double-blinded drug infuse . The primary endpoint ejection fraction 10th day intervention . Patients assign one four treatment arm : intracoronary infusion streptokinase ; intracoronary infusion nitroglycerin ; combine infusion nitroglycerin streptokinase ; control group receive conventional therapy without acute catheterization . All patient underwent anticoagulant therapy intravenous heparin follow warfarin three month . Patients follow minimum two year . The study completion date list record obtain Query/View/Report ( QVR ) System .</detailed_description>
