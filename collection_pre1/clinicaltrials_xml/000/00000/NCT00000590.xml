	<brief_title>Anti-HIV Immunoglobulin ( HIVIG ) Prevention Maternal-Fetal HIV Transmission ( Pediatric ACTG Protocol 185 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The HIV epidemic United States change course past year . The main risk group past , homosexual male , reduce number new infection education prevention . Other group , include intravenous drug abuser , disadvantage urban socioeconomic class adolescent , continue infect transmit HIV needle share and/or unprotected heterosexual activity . Many newly infect individual woman child-bearing age . These woman turn infect child . The Centers Disease Control estimate 2,000 infected infant bear 6,000 HIV-positive mother annually United States . Over past year , several study identify risk maternal-fetal transmission HIV seropositive mother . The risk close 30 percent . However , reason yet understand , risk appear high Africa , approach 40 percent , low Europe , approach 16 percent . Factors influence maternal-fetal transmission HIV well define may include clinical state mother , plasma p24 antigen positivity mother , viral load , prior pregnancy associate maternal-fetal HIV transmission , absence maternal epitope specific and/or high affinity gp120 antibody , prematurity . The result Phase III , multicenter , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluate efficacy , safety , tolerance zidovudine prevention HIV transmission infect pregnant woman infant ( ACTG protocol 076 ) provide first time proof concept preventive intervention reduce vertical HIV transmission ( 47 ) . Based analysis data 364 evaluable birth , zidovudine ( ZDV AZT ) treatment accord regimen employ ACTG 076 appear reduce risk HIV transmission two third , 25.5 percent 8.3 percent . Eligible subject HIV-infected pregnant woman receive antiretroviral therapy current pregnancy , maternal clinical indication antiretroviral therapy , CD4+ T-lymphocyte count 200 per microliter study entry . Efficacy ZDV reduction vertical HIV transmission woman advance HIV disease already receive antiretroviral treatment accord current clinical indication health , CD4+ T-lymphocyte count 200 per microliter , evaluate ACTG 076 . Administration antiretroviral agent pregnant woman theory could reduce risk neonatal infection reduce exposure fetus maternal virus , prophylaxis fetus prior exposure . Because postulated intense exposure potentially uninfected fetus HIV present maternal blood genital tract secretion occur parturition , design study include intrapartum administration ZDV follow six week oral ZDV infant . An identical regimen ZDV administration employ ACTG Protocol 076 . Pediatric ACTG Protocol 185 evaluate hypothesis HIV-infected pregnant woman receive oral ZDV medical indication , HIVIG administer monthly begin 20-30 week gestation combination intravenous ZDV intrapartum , together single newborn dose HIVIG within 12 hour birth combination six week newborn oral ZDV , would reduce vertical HIV transmission compare IVIG administer identically control agent . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , double-blind , control . Approximately half woman give intravenous HIVIG every four week delivery . The half receive standard intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) without anti-HIV antibody . Both group receive AZT . A similar dose HIVIG IVIG give newborn infant within 12 hour birth . Each infant multiple birth receive mother 's randomize study drug . Infant blood sample take birth several interval first 24 month life determine infant ' HIV status p24 antigen assay , plasma viremia , HIV co-culture assay . An exist NICHD contract Westat , Inc. use conduct trial . Westat , study coordinate center subcontract 25 NICHD clinical trial unit . An approximately similar number NIAID clinical trial unit also participate trial . As February 1 , 1996 , 51 clinical trial unit participate . Data analysis perform Westat . In 1993 , NHLBI contract North American Biologics supply HIVIG . The trial end December , 1996 .</detailed_description>
