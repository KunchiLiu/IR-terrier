	<brief_summary>To determine whether histocompatibility match corneal transplant donor recipient reduce incidence graft rejection high-risk patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collaborative Corneal Transplantation Studies ( CCTS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 20 percent corneal transplant patient , 6,000 per year , face donor tissue rejection rate 60 percent corneal vascularization prior graft rejection . Histocompatibility antigen match and/or crossmatching may offer patient improve chance successful outcome . The Collaborative Corneal Transplantation Studies Group conduct two control , double-masked study address distinct scientific question donor-recipient histocompatibility matching . The Crossmatch Study randomize study assess effectiveness crossmatching prevent graft rejection among high-risk patient lymphocytotoxic antibody . The Antigen Matching Study prospective , double-masked , observational study effectiveness HLA-A , -B , -DR donor-recipient match high-risk patient lymphocytotoxic antibody . Six clinical center recruit high-risk patient collaborate local eye banking organ procurement agency procure donor corneal tissue . For two study , total 400 patient seek . Blood sample enrol patient send local CCTS tissue type laboratory HLA typing , serum sample send Central Laboratory screen preform lymphocytotoxic antibody . Depending result test , patient enter Crossmatch Study Antigen Matching Study . As corneal donor become available , donor blood sample HLA type local laboratory crossmatched CCTS patient await transplantation . Results test entered national , 24-hour computerize allocation system operate United Network Organ Sharing ( UNOS ) . Patients Crossmatch Study receive cornea either positively crossmatched donor negatively crossmatched donor . Patients Antigen Matching Study receive cornea 0 6 match antigen . Transplant patient follow intensively first month surgery . The number clinic visit taper 2 third final year followup , result total 17 postoperative visit . Irreversible failure corneal allograft due cause primary outcome variable study . Allograft reaction episode , irreversible failure due rejection , visual acuity secondary outcome variable .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Males female age 10 year old two four quadrant corneal stroma vascularization history allograft rejection eye consider surgery eligible study CCTS . Patients must willing participate 3 year followup . No one eligible CCTS condition would greatly increase risk nonrejection graft failure , xerophthalmia severe exposure keratopathy . Also exclude patient systemic disease medication usage might alter immune response .</criteria>
