	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The life expectancy American woman 78 year . More one-third year postmenopausal , time risk coronary heart disease increase . The current United States estimate 40 million woman age 50 indicate large segment population increase risk coronary heart disease . Heart disease account third death 50-69 year old woman . In 1978 , example , approximately 66,000 210,000 death woman 50-69 attributed heart disease . Premenopausal woman low rate ischemic heart disease compare men similar age . Surgically induced natural early menopause increase risk ischemic heart disease . These fact focus interest estrogen possible mediator beneficial effect , point need study relationship atherosclerosis risk factor . Estimates Lipid Research Clinics Program indicate estrogen use approximately one third postmenopausal woman . Analysis Lipid Research Clinics data confirm administration estrogen result low plasma low density lipoprotein level elevate plasma high density lipoprotein level . Thus , ratio high density lipoprotein/low density lipoprotein level substantially increase . Given inverse relationship high density lipoprotein level coronary heart disease risk , effect estrogen plasma lipoprotein could expect reduce coronary heart disease risk woman . Although bulk currently available evidence suggest benefit , controversy concern effect postmenopausal estrogen morbidity mortality coronary heart disease persist . Analysis Lipid Research Clinics Follow-up Study population indicate potentially profound beneficial effect postmenopausal estrogen use . Mortality cause decrease considerably postmenopausal estrogen user , effect pronounce hysterectomized oophorectomized woman . Similar result observe cardiovascular death . These benefit appear mediate higher high density lipoprotein level associate postmenopausal estrogen use . Framingham data primary source report possible detrimental effect postmenopausal estrogen use cardiovascular morbidity ; mortality cause cardiovascular disease report vary use . NHLBI convene Trans-NIH Estrogen Working Group make recommendation NHLBI feasibility undertake clinical trial effect postmenopausal estrogen use cardiovascular disease mortality . The Working Group identify number important research question need answered elucidate effect postmenopausal estrogen use risk factor cardiovascular disease osteoporosis . This initiative result Working Group 's deliberation recommendation . DESIGN NARRATIVE : There seven clinical center coordinate center randomize , double-blind clinical trial . The woman allocate one five treatment arm : placebo ; conjugate equine estrogen ( CEE ) , 0.625 milligram per day ; conjugate equine estrogen , 0.625 milligram per day plus cyclic medroxyprogesterone acetate ( MPA ) , 10 milligram per day 12 day per month ; CEE , 0.625 milligram per day plus consecutive MPA , 2.5 milligram per day ; CEE , 0.625 milligram per day plus cyclic micronized progesterone ( MP ) , 200 milligram per day 12 day month . The four primary endpoint choose represent four biological system relate risk cardiovascular disease include high density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) , systolic blood pressure , serum insulin , fibrinogen . Recruitment begin October 1989 end February 1991 . Baseline data collect include blood pressure , rest heart rate , weight , waist/hip ratio endometrial biopsy . Laboratory evaluation include lipid panel , high density lipoprotein cholesterol , insulin glucose , bone density , fibrinogen , three clinic , additional hemostasis factor , renin substrate , plasma renin activity , aldosterone , oral post-heparin lipase activity . All woman underwent endometrial aspiration biopsy baseline annually thereafter . Additional biopsy specimen obtain noncyclic endometrial bleeding . All woman also baseline annual mammogram . Other data collect quality life , exercise , diet , alcohol use , smoking . Participants follow three , six twelve month post-randomization , six month interval thereafter three year . Post-trial analysis exist data set fund three year cooperative agreement mechanism begin August 1 , 1994 . A three-year safety follow-up fund contract mechanism begin 1994 . It include three annual visit endometrial biopsy , mammogram , limited health information obtain . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
