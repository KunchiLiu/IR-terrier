	<brief_title>Cardiac Arrest Seattle : Conventional Versus Amiodarone Drug Evaluation ( CASCADE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Sudden cardiac death usually attribute occurrence cardiac arrhythmia , ventricular fibrillation . Although significant proportion patient experience sudden cardiac death may successfully resuscitate without disable sequela , event tends recur . Recurrent sudden cardiac death common among patient demonstrate certain clinical characteristic : ventricular fibrillation occur set remote prior transmural infarction ; presence abnormal leave ventricular function ; male gender ; concurrent complex ventricular arrhythmia identify electrocardiographic monitoring ; extensive coronary artery disease ; ability induce ventricular arrhythmia follow electrical stimulation . Multiple therapeutic approach offer patient survive primary ventricular fibrillation . In evidence myocardial ischemia , coronary revascularization procedure may employ . Pharmacological therapy anti-arrhythmic agent either alone combination selection guide result continuous electrocardiographic monitoring electrophysiologic study often initial step . For patient refractory medical therapy , ventricular resection implantation pacemaker employ . Amiodarone , unique antiarrhythmic agent complex pharmacokinetics substantial potential toxicity , utilized antiarrhythmic agent fail . The agent release oral agent treatment ventricular fibrillation United States FDA . Several investigation suggest amiodarone efficacious treatment ventricular fibrillation available agent fail . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Patients stratify presence absence coronary artery disease , leave ventricular function , presence absence drug failure prior randomization . All patient underwent evaluation leave ventricular ejection fraction , usually radionuclide ventriculography , baseline drug-free Holter record electrophysiologic study , . A total 113 patient randomize amiodarone 115 patient conventional therapy antiarrhythmic agent include procainamide , quinidine , disopyramide , tocainide , mexiletine , encainide , flecainide , propafenone , moricizine , combination therapy order . Holter exams give one , three , six , twelve , twenty-four , thirty-six month . Patients follow one five year , average three year overall . Primary endpoint study include term 'cardiac survival ' cardiac mortality , resuscitate cardiac arrest due document ventricular fibrillation , complete syncope follow shock automate implanted defibrillator . These endpoint include sudden arrhythmic cardiac death , resuscitate out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation , nonarrhythmic cardiac death . A patient death due amiodarone pulmonary toxicity also consider primary endpoint .</detailed_description>
