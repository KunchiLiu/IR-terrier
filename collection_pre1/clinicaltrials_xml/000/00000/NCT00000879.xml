	<brief_summary>The purpose study see give ALVAC vCP1452 anti-HIV vaccine alone another vaccine call AIDSVAX B/B baby HIV-positive mother safe . The study also look vaccine affect baby 's immune system . Most HIV-positive child get HIV mother pregnancy birth . Treatment anti-HIV drug reduce baby 's risk get HIV . Vaccines also may help prevent HIV infection . This study look whether ALVAC vCP1452 vaccine AIDSVAX B/B vaccine help body fight HIV infection . There chance get HIV infection vaccine . ( This study change . In early version , ALVAC vCP205 AIDSVAX B/E go use . )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Transmission HIV untreated infected mother offspring think occur infant perinatally others parturition . It possible administration immunogenic vaccine reduce vertical transmission HIV-1 moderate course infect infant . Successful early sensitization HIV epitope might succeed prevent HIV infection . Alternately , enhancement HIV-specific immune function might also succeed modify HIV replication affect disease progression . Sixty infant treat randomized , double-blind study ; 45 infant receive recombinant Canarypox virus , ALVAC-HIV vCP205 , 15 receive placebo . Mothers serve proxy infant . All infant receive minimum four immunization , Weeks 0 ( within 72 hour birth ) , 4 , 8 , 12 . Initially , 24 patient randomize receive one two dos vCP205 saline placebo . When suitable subunit vaccine available , protocol amend 36 additional infant randomize receive vCP205 alone subunit vaccine Weeks 4 8 ( vaccine placebo without subunit placebo ) . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 11/5/97 : 18 infant receive ALVAC-HIV vCP205 one two dose 6 receive placebo . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 9/9/99 : Cohort 1 receive vCP205 . Cohort 2 receive high dose vCP205 . Cohort A received vCP205 placebo ( saline ) . Cohorts 1 , 2 , A double-blinded closed accrual March 1999 . As September 1999 , infant randomize one four new cohort . Cohort 3 receives vCP1452 Weeks 0 , 4 , 8 , 12 . Cohort 4 receives vCP1452 Weeks 0 4 , receive vCP1452 plus AIDSVAX B/E gp120 Weeks 8 12 . Cohort B receive vCP1452 placebo Weeks 0 , 4 , 8 , 12 . Cohort C receive vCP1452 placebo Weeks 0 4 , receive vCP1452 placebo plus AIDSVAX B/E placebo Weeks 8 12 . All infant follow every 2 week first 14 week life , every 6 month age 2 . Cord blood use establish autologous B cell line , CTL assay perform characterize immune response HIV . In addition , CD4 count , viral load , mucosal antibody response measure . Immunized infant infect HIV serve control immunogenicity vaccine infect infant . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 1/24/00 : AIDSVAX B/E replace AIDSVAX B/B . ]</detailed_description>
