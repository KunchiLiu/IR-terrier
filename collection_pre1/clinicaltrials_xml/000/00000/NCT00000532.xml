All woman give weight loss goal five 15 pound , depend baseline weight status ask reduce calorie intake 1300 kcal weight goal achieve . The intervention include intensive group program first six month follow-up individual/group session six 54 month . The primary endpoint trial difference change LDL cholesterol weight intervention assessment-only group end trial . The intervention also compare whether dietary intervention could prevent increase low density lipoprotein cholesterol weight gain observed period woman 's life ; whether dietary intervention affect age menopause percent woman use hormone therapy hysterectomy ; whether dietary intervention adverse effect menopausal symptomatology , endogenous hormone , bone mineral density . The Office Research Women 's Health provide supplemental fund measure hemostatic factor , include fibrinogen , factor VIIc antigen , antithrombin III PAI-1 plasma sample subject baseline . The supplement allow longitudinal description change hemostatic factor appear occur perimenopausal transition investigation whether diet diet intervention alter pattern hemostatic change observe menopause . Beginning February 1996 , trial extend four year January 2000 provide data analysis additional follow-up least 4.5 year participant . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
