	<brief_summary>To compare safety effectiveness foscarnet vidarabine treatment AIDS patient herpes simplex virus infection resistant standard treatment acyclovir . Foscarnet drug inhibits virus show effective infection Cytomegalovirus also infection Herpes simplex virus several patient AIDS . Vidarabine show activity Herpes simplex virus patient AIDS , study patient AIDS .

	<brief_title>Comparison Foscarnet Versus Vidarabine Treatment Herpes Infection Patients With AIDS Who Have Not Had Success With Acyclovir</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Foscarnet drug inhibits virus show effective infection Cytomegalovirus also infection Herpes simplex virus several patient AIDS . Vidarabine show activity Herpes simplex virus patient AIDS , study patient AIDS . This study compare foscarnet vidarabine treatment AIDS patient herpes simplex infection respond therapy acyclovir hope one two drug help stop progression herpes simplex infection may fewer side effect . Following evaluation study , patient receive least 10 day intravenous ( IV ) therapy acyclovir . During therapy , patient two serum concentration level acyclovir draw make sure adequate level medication blood . If skin lesion heal total 10 day therapy acyclovir , lesion swab viral culture test susceptibility virus therapy acyclovir , foscarnet , vidarabine . If test confirm herpes lesion resistant acyclovir , patient may choose participate next phase study . Following additional evaluation study , patient randomize one two group , receive 10-21 day IV treatment one two alternative medication , foscarnet vidarabine . Foscarnet give IV infusion every 8 hour , infusion last 1 hour . Vidarabine give IV infusion day , infusion last 12 hour . While receive therapy either foscarnet vidarabine , blood test do every 3 day routine lab test week determine foscarnet vidarabine blood level . Skin lesion culture herpes virus every 5 day . At end 10 day therapy , improvement evaluate , patient continue receive therapy indicate . There provision cross-over treatment patient show poor response .</detailed_description>
