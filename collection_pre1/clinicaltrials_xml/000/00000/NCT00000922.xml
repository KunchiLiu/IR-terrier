	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether good start anti-HIV regimen contain protease inhibitor ( PI ) , non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) , PI combination NNRTI . This study also examine treatment regimen best first treatment HIV infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Long-Term Effectiveness Three Anti-HIV Drug Regimens HIV Infected Patients Who Have Never Been Exposed Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ( HAART )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) regimens contain PIs , NNRTIs , nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) show slow disease progression . However , long-term consequence initial therapy PI , NNRTI , PI NNRTI yet know , impact future anti-HIV treatment regimen . Patients experience virologic failure particular HAART regimen typically study subsequent response HAART regimens . It possible regimen initially potent may optimal limit effectiveness subsequent anti-HIV treatment regimen . Patients randomize one three HAART treatment arm : - Arm 1 participant receive one two PIs plus two NRTIs . - Arm 2 participant receive one NNRTI plus two NRTIs . - Arm 3 participant receive one two PIs plus NNRTI plus one two NRTIs . Before randomization treatment arm , patient give option preselecting drug use allow randomization study-specified drug . The study-specified PIs indinavir ( IDV ) , nelfinavir ( NFV ) , two PIs patient doctor choice . The study-specified NNRTIs nevirapine ( NVP ) efavirenz ( EFV ) . The study-specified NRTIs abacavir ( ABC ) plus lamivudine ( 3TC ) didanosine ( ddI ) plus stavudine ( d4T ) . The study sit provide ABC , 3TC , ddI , d4T patient assign take medication . All anti-HIV drug initial subsequent treatment regimen obtain clinician prescription . At Months 1 4 every 4 month thereafter , patient receive medical history update , physical exam , questionnaire . Blood sample also draw measure CD4 cell count , viral load , genotypic antiretroviral resistance . Changes treatment regimen may occur time .</detailed_description>
