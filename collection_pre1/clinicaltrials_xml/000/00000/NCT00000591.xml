	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation accept therapeutic option many hematologic , immunologic , malignant disease , include chronic myelocytic leukemia acute leukemia first relapse ( second remission ) . In order maximize chance successful transplant , desirable donor recipient share Human Leukocyte Antigen ( HLA ) histocompatibility antigen . Because Mendelian inheritance HLA antigens , chance find match much great among relative general population . However , 30 percent patient need transplant match sibling . Thus transplant HLA-matched unrelated donor may important alternative patient . Graft versus host disease frequent severe complication marrow transplantation . Acute GvHD typically occur within three month transplantation characterize skin rash , liver dysfunction , diarrhea . Although pathophysiology disease fully define human , data animal study suggest mediate mature donor T cell react disparate recipient histocompatibility antigens . One treatment modality ameliorate prevents GvHD follow allogeneic marrow transplantation T cell-depletion donor marrow infusion recipient . T cell-depletion divide physical method separation elutriation sheep cell rosetting , immunologic method use T cell-specific antibody ( y ) plus complement toxin kill cell . These different technique may remove subpopulation T cell , T cell , T cell plus cell type B cell natural killer ( NK ) cell . The number stem cell transfer may also affect . Unfortunately , many publish study conduct patient receive transplant HLA-matched sibling , T cell-depletion use prevent treat GvHD increase chance complication , namely graft failure leukemia relapse . This surprising light study patient early advance leukemia demonstrate decreased risk relapse associate acute and/or chronic GvHD . Because net effect oppose consequence T cell-depletion leukemia-free survival relate donor transplant generally unfavorable , T cell-depletion related donor marrow transplantation controversial . The utility T-cell depletion unrelated-donor transplant need determine . The initiative grow increase concern part Institute staff , bone marrow transplantation community , member Congress graft versus host disease frequent severe complication unrelated donor transplant become limiting factor outcome . The initiative give concept clearance May 1992 National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council release January 1993 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The primary endpoint trial disease free survival three year post transplant . Secondary endpoint include overall survival , incidence GvHD , graft failure , infection complication , time disease relapse . The covariates consider included age recipient , disease risk status , interval diagnosis transplant , disease type , age gender donor , post-transplant chimerism , pre-transplant Karnofsky score , measure performance status . An economic analysis perform . Patients randomly assign receive either T-cell deplete non-depleted transplant . Two method T-cell depletion use : anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody , T10B9 , plus complement , counterflow elutriation plus Ceprate column . Each method T-depletion part package include specific pre-transplant conditioning regimen additional GvHD prophylaxis . Patients randomize non-T-cell depleted arm receive conditioning regimen contain cyclophosphamide total body irradiation , GvHD prophylaxis regimen cyclosporin methotrexate . A total 410 patient enrol . Enrollment end October 31 , 2000 . A total 14 transplant center participate study , Follow-up end April 2002 .</detailed_description>
