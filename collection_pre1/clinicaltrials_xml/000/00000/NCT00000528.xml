	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : High blood pressure affect 15 30 percent adult population United States , major contributor lead cause death include coronary artery cerebrovascular disease . A substantial body evidence population laboratory study indicate number dietary lifestyle factor associate chronic progressive increase blood pressure age , commonly observe population industrialized country . There also increase number report important reduction blood pressure person hypertension follow treatment number different non-pharmacological intervention . These observation lead interest possibility primary prevention hypertension non-pharmacological intervention factor relate development high blood pressure . In 1979 , main result NHLBI-supported Hypertension Detection Follow-up Program ( HDFP ) , large randomize clinical trial antihypertensive drug treatment , report . This trial compare effect intensive systematic Stepped-Care drug treatment Referred-Care community . These result confirm finding earlier subsequently report placebo-controlled trial effective blood-pressure lower hypertensive individual reduces occurrence stroke , congestive heart failure , complication hypertension , first time demonstrate significant reduction total mortality . The implication finding regard recommendation long-term drug treatment ten million Americans lead several group investigator consider alternative approach control hypertension . To concern clinician drug-related symptom economic cost add additional question regard safety common antihypertensive agent hypertensive subgroup , base result Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial evidence . A number small moderate-sized randomized clinical trial non-pharmacologic intervention hypertension initiate past 5 year NHLBI support . The Hypertension Prevention Trial ( HPT ) large program study effectiveness intervene non-hypertensive population . The HPT feasibility study establish ability enroll sufficient number men woman diastolic blood pressure 78-89 mm Hg ; determine dietary intervention alone could achieve sustain weight reduction , and/or decrease sodium intake , increase potassium intake along sodium reduction subject ; study effect intervention blood pressure . If feasibility demonstrate , plan conduct full-scale trial incidence frank hypertension outcome measure . The HPT achieve feasibility goal regard recruitment participant weight reduction , dietary sodium reduction potassium increase . Some dietary trial among non-hypertensive subject also achieve relatively small sodium change ( 20-25 percent ) ; produce much large change , short-term follow-up . Other experience also show difficult increase potassium intake dietary mean alone . The importance work area meanwhile reinforce conclusion several expert group convene NHLBI . These include participant 1984 NIH Workshop Nutrition Hypertension 1984 Joint National Committee Detection , Evaluation , Treatment High Blood Pressure , whose report address detail non-pharmacologic intervention primary prevention . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Phase I pilot study test feasibility provide obtain compliance select nutritional-behavioral , non-pharmacologic intervention measure short-term effectiveness intervention reduce prevent increase diastolic blood pressure . Ten clinical center , coordinate center , include two central laboratory nutrient data center , participate . Each clinic test subset intervention . The lifestyle arm trial , include weight loss , sodium restriction , stress management , open design untreated control . The two-stage supplement arm trial , test magnesium calcium Stage I , fish oil potassium Stage II , double-blinded placebo-controlled . Three clinic test lifestyle intervention , two test supplement , five participate arm trial . Recruitment begin August 1987 randomization complete October 1988 . Endpoint data collection complete January 1990 . The average follow-up approximately 18 month . Phase II 2x2 factorial design test effectiveness weight loss sodium restriction alone combination reduce blood pressure decrease incidence definite hypertension . Lifestyle intervention administer counseling session center . Blood pressure , weight , body mass index , skin fold thickness , urine electrolyte measure baseline six month interval minimum 36 month . Recruitment begin end 1990 complete March 1992 . Intervention follow-up complete March 1995 . Data analysis continue June 1998 U01-HL-37852 , coordinate center . The main result present 1995 American Heart Association Scientific Sessions . The Phase II main result paper publish March 1997 . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
