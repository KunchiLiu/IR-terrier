	<brief_title>Extracorporeal Support Respiratory Insufficiency ( ECMO )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The report Task Force Respiratory Diseases identify clinical syndrome acute respiratory insufficiency ( ARI ) estimate approximately 60,000 Americans die ARI yearly . ARI precisely define ; indeed , Task Force realize pathologist recognize ARI . The Task Force point diagnostic test early detection ARI exist , incidence prevalence disease know , exist therapy supportive nonspecific ( diuretic , corticosteroid , etc. ) . The pathogenesis syndrome , mechanism interstitial edema , defenses lung agent cause ARI , ultrastructural pathology natural history disease virtually unknown . The Task Force indicate need Respiratory Care Centers highly train personnel could reduce mortality ARI . This clinical trial grow Task Force report . Nine participate center define ARI clinical physiological term agree prospective randomize study 3 year compare treatment severe ARI conventional mean treatment extracorporeal membrane oxygenators . Animal study show ECMO 's provide one two week ' support lung without serious blood damage , contrast bubble oxygenators , allow complete pulmonary bypass approximately 6 hour , severe blood damage occur direct blood-gas interface . If patient hypoxia secondary acute reversible lung injury support ECMO 's lung lesion heals , improvement survival rate avoidance hazard conventional therapy may result . The trial , complete , conduct nine clinical center United States . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , non-blind , fixed sample ; 90 eligible patient randomly assign group receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation plus conventional therapy group receive conventional therapy . The study completion date list record obtain Query/View/Report ( QVR ) System .</detailed_description>
