	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare safety effectiveness two treatment prevent relapse seriously ill patient major depressive disorder ( MDD ) respond electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) . Patients either continue receive ECT ( continuation electroconvulsive therapy [ C-ECT ] ) , treat antidepressant medication . ECT highly effective treatment MDD ; however , relapse major concern . To prevent relapse patient respond ECT , common treatment antidepressant continuation therapy ( follow initial therapy order continue treat disorder ) . Relapses , however , still occur even antidepressant continuation therapy . This study evaluate potent antidepressant combination order prevent relapse . C-ECT another option need test . If patient responds first round ECT , he/she assign randomly ( like toss coin ) either continue receive ECT receive antidepressant combination nortriptyline plus lithium ( NOR-Li ) 6 month . The patient psychological test , shortly , 3 month first round ECT , end 6-month continuation trial . Patients monitor symptom side effect . All patient urine test test drug abuse . An individual may eligible study he/she : Has major depressive disorder respond positively ECT treatment 18 80 year old .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To define role continuation electroconvulsive therapy ( C-ECT ) relapse-prevention seriously ill patient major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . To determine relative efficacy safety C-ECT comparison traditional approach continuation pharmacotherapy ( C-PHARM ) prevent relapse MDD . Electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) highly effective treatment MDD helpful patient severe form affective illness ; however , relapse successful acute phase ECT pharmacotherapy remain major public health problem . To prevent relapse patient MDD respond ECT , common practice prescribe antidepressant ( e.g. , tricyclic [ TCA ] , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [ SSRI ] , lithium ) continuation therapy . Recent study show alarmingly high relapse rate ECT despite conventional continuation pharmacotherapy ( C-PHARM ) . Continuation ECT ( C-ECT ) also widespread clinical use ; however , efficacy safety never rigorously test . Investigators four site ( Mayo Clinic , UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School , Zucker Hillside Hospital , University Texas SW Medical Center , Dallas ) randomize patient receive either C-ECT aggressive pharmacological strategy ( nortriptyline lithium combination , [ NOR-Li ] ) 6 month follow response acute phase ECT . Raters site evaluate symptom side effect . On basis edit videotape obtain regular interval , site-independent , blind evaluator also assess symptom . A neuropsychological battery administer prior acute phase ECT , shortly ECT course , 3 month end acute phase treatment , end 6-month continuation trial . These continuation therapy compare effect relapse , cognitive performance , global functioning , side effect , perceive health status . NOR Li level optimize blood level monitoring . Bilateral ECT , progressively increase interval , use C-ECT . Methods include ensure integrity clinical diagnosis , symptom severity assessment , data collection entry , treatment delivery . In patient , surreptitious use prescription recreational drug monitor urine testing .</detailed_description>
