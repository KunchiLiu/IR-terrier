	<brief_title>Occlusion Versus Pharmacologic Therapy Moderate Amblyopia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Amblyopia , lazy eye , common cause visual impairment child often persist adulthood . It report lead cause vision loss one eye 20-70 year old age group , prevalence 1-4 percent various study , indicate improve mean detection treatment need . Most available data natural history amblyopia success rate treatment either patch drug therapy retrospective uncontrolled . Despite common occurrence amblyopia , little quality data treatment condition . Thus , much learn course treat amblyopia , provide precise estimate success rate identify factor may associate successful unsuccessful treatment . Amblyopia , diagnose child , usually treat occlusion ( patch ) sound eye . Occlusion therapy subject problem compliance , due child 's dislike wear patch visual , skin irritation , social/psychological reason . There evidence compliance may one , , important determinant success amblyopia therapy . An alternative treatment , drug therapy cycloplegic drug ( atropine ) dilate pupils blur image see sound eye , know almost century . This method widely use management occlusion treatment failure maintenance therapy . However , see little use primary treatment amblyopia . Clinical experience find high acceptability patient parent , hence high compliance . In addition acceptability , pharmacologic therapy know advantage occlusion provide wide visual field eye , may safety functional implication . There also clinical laboratory evidence suggest drug therapy may maintain improve ability see eye ( binocularity ) . Available data suggest success rate drug therapy good , good , success rate occlusion therapy mild moderate degree amblyopia . If true , many child amblyopia , drug therapy may prefer initial therapy since appear readily accept child parent . Despite data support use drug therapy primary therapy amblyopia , gain limited use among pediatric ophthalmologist . A definitive study compare outcome occlusion therapy drug therapy justify order determine new practice guideline treatment amblyopia need . Regardless whether trial determines one therapeutic approach well , data collect provide valuable information course amblyopia treatment presently available . The study also expect provide data help determine whether factor age , refractive status , cause amblyopia , fixation pattern consider determining procedure best give patient . Extended Follow-up Study Patients The extend follow study consist annual visit prior age 10 , follow visit age 10 year visit age 15 year . There amblyopia treatment require extend follow period .</detailed_description>
