	<brief_summary>To compare three accepted mode myocardial preservation , warm , tepid , cold blood cardioplegia , coincide normothermic ( 37 degree centigrade ) , tepid ( 32 degree centigrade ) hypothermic ( 8 10 degree centigrade ) cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) define difference neurologic function coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : A pilot study warm versus cold perfusion preservation complete 32 patient prior ongoing study . The finding pilot study show 53 percent patient evidence new neurologic disturbance postoperative day four . Only neurologic dysfunction could correlate warm versus cold perfusion ( 37.5 percent warm versus 75 percent cold , P le 0.05 ) . The change neurologic function abate clearly improve one month follow-up , distinction neurologic dysfunction grade longer apparent two group . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Patients randomly assign cold , tepid , warm blood cardioplegia , coincide normothermic , tepid , hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass . All patient receive standard anesthetic protocol combine narcotic inhalational anesthesia . Each patient enter study extensive clinical data collect prospectively incorporate aspect measurable determinant relate myocardial preservation . Additionally , neurologic test perform blinded neurologist rat objective scoring system , Mathew scale . The study perform preoperatively , third fourth postoperative day , one month follow surgery . Hematologic data measure fibrinolytic potential .</detailed_description>
