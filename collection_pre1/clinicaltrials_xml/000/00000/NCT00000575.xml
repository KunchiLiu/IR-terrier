	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Asthma serious chronic condition , affect approximately 14 million Americans . People asthma experience well 100 million day restrict activity annually , cost asthma care exceed $ 10 billion year . Asthma much prevalent among child adult . Hospitalizations asthma increase among child . For example , 1979 1987 , hospital discharge rate asthma first-listed diagnosis rise 43 percent among child le 15 year age , 19.8 28.4 discharge per 10,000 population . Death rate asthma great Blacks white , difference increase . In 1979 , Blacks sex twice likely die asthma white . Over past decade ratio increase , 1987 asthma death rate almost three time great among Blacks white . In child , mortality difference Blacks white even striking . Current knowledge epidemiology natural history childhood asthma incomplete , relationship asthma early life development chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) adulthood become apparent . Asthmatic child persistent severe asthma symptom low level lung function young adulthood milder disease . Recent longitudinal study confirm decrease rate growth lung function measure FEV1 among symptomatic ( primarily wheeze ) child compare asymptomatic child . Among person develop COPD , initial level lung function strong predictor subsequent rapid decline ventilatory function . Thus , less maximally attained level lung function among child asthma may predispose great normal decline lung function later life . Although long-term effect treatment course asthma know , treatment goal decrease bronchial hyperresponsiveness maximize lung function growth childhood may beneficial effect lung health throughout life prevent progression irreversible airflow obstruction . Two class medication currently available treatment inflammation -- corticosteroid cromolyn sodium . Inhaled corticosteroid significantly few side effect systemic administration . Corticosteroids inhibit early asthmatic response , effective suppress inflammation bronchial hyperresponsiveness late phase response . Long-term study inhale corticosteroid show beneficial effect lung function measure FEV1 . However , concern possible effect long-term use inhaled corticosteroid . Although epidemiological study use inhaled corticosteroid show significant adverse effect , large-scale randomize controlled study effect child 's growth development need . When CAMP initiate United States , bronchodilator treatment common approach therapy . Two class bronchodilator , inhale beta-2-adrenergic agonist oral theophylline , frequently prescribe asthma . To date , randomize , control study compare two class anti-inflammatory medication bronchodilator therapy course asthma . The initiative propose Pulmonary Disease Advisory Committee work group October 1987 approve full committee February 1988 meeting National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council May 1990 . The Request Proposals release October 1990 . Awards make September 1991 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Children randomize one three treatment group receive either : inhaled albuterol alone , albuterol inhale budesonide , albuterol nedocromil . Upon randomization , data collect demographic factor , physical psychosocial development , clinical factor include medical history extent allergy , quality life factor include limitation activity , absenteeism school , emergency room visit , hospitalization . All subject receive common educational program , differ information present regard medication use subject . Each subject give standard protocol deal asthma attack . All subject treat follow five year quarterly visit yearly . Recruitment begin July 1993 end June 1995 accrual 1,041 subject . The study extend June 2011 three funding phase observe subject provide asthma treatment . This allow CAMP ( 1 . ) determine full impact 4 6 year anti-inflammatory therapy attain maximal lung function final height ; ( 2 . ) examine natural history asthma age 26 ; ( 3 . ) define pattern reduce lung function growth early decline lung function young adult .</detailed_description>
