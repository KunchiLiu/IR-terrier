	<brief_summary>This project ass effectiveness novel approach involve patient education strength train improve functional recovery hip fracture . Participants randomly assign one two study group . One group ( control group ) receive standard medical care . The group participate program patient education strength training , include at-home walking program .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Functional Recovery After Hip Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific aim project ( ) implement intervention program patient education focus self-efficacy ( belief one 's action responsible successful outcome ) strength training design improve postoperative rehabilitation old person ( 65 year age old ) sustain fracture hip ; ( b ) evaluate randomize trial efficacy intervention program improve overall postoperative functional status patient decrease rate subsequent institutionalization . The study also ( ) describe document risk factor functional deterioration , recurrent fall , subsequent institutionalization cohort patient ; ( b ) ass self-efficacy belief ability influence predict postoperative functional capacity patient ; ( c ) document cost associate implement program generate data provide basis subsequent cost-benefit analysis . We hypothesize ( ) program patient education focus self-efficacy strength training improve functional capacity reduce rate institutionalization older person follow hip fracture ; ( b ) clinical , psychosocial factor , muscle strength , balance multifactorial determinant functional capacity , recurrent fall , subsequent institutionalization hip fracture patient . We randomize 200 patient sustain primary unilateral hip fracture multiple-component intervention program patient education high-intensity strength train standard medical care . The intervention program comprise four major component : ( 1 ) in-hospital postoperative patient instruction protocol conduct prior discharge patient family member caregiver ; ( 2 ) hospital-based , 8-week program high-intensity isokinetic strength training patient ; ( 3 ) at-home walk program design enable patient maintain strength physical activity follow hospital-based portion intervention ; ( 4 ) supportive telephone call patient family caregiver regular ongoing contact hospital-based interventionist , well hip fracture patient . The principal outcome within-patient change physical , social , role function subscales SF-36 . Secondary measure outcome , include muscle strength , balance , functional status Cummings Scale , activity daily live , recurrent fall , rate institutionalization , assess baseline 1 year post-discharge . The long-term objective project improve overall functional capacity reduce recurrent fall need institutionalization hip fracture patient development evaluation intervention program whose feasibility cost potential application wide range institutional setting involve treatment rehabilitation patient .</detailed_description>
