	<brief_title>Women 's Angiographic Vitamin Estrogen Trial ( WAVE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Coronary artery disease lead cause death United States , account 500,000 deaths year . Although onset coronary artery disease delay woman , single important cause death woman entire life span . Indeed , woman men survive old age , mortality due coronary artery disease age combine great woman men . Furthermore , present clinical evidence coronary artery disease , woman prognosis poor , even bad , men . In part , may due late recognition coronary artery disease woman , less intensive treatment woman , adverse risk profile woman develop coronary artery disease . The report recent Working Group Angiographic Trials Atherosclerosis Prevention note , compare male , female develop coronary artery disease , various different characteristic may affect vascular response lipid-altering intervention . These difference lead report question whether mechanisms clinical benefit lipid-altering agent may different men woman . It note angiographic trial conduct date base primarily upon cholesterol-lowering treatment diet drug suggest approach base upon lipid hypothesis could profitably test give high priority time ; specifically recommend trial hormone replacement antioxidant therapy woman . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Subjects randomize 2 x 2 factorial trial hormone replacement therapy antioxidant therapy . Women randomize four treatment group : active hormone replacement antioxidant ; active hormone replacement therapy antioxidant placebo ; active antioxidant therapy hormone replacement placebo ; double placebo plus usual care . Hormone replacement therapy consist estrogen plus progestin ( PremPro ) gynecologically intact woman , unopposed estrogen ( Premarin ) woman hysterectomy . Antioxidants consist combination vitamin E vitamin C. Angiographic change primary endpoint trial . The study double-blind extent permit intervention ; however , fully-blinded respect outcome variable . Recruitment end August 1999 . The mean duration follow-up approximately three year . The NHLBI award R01HL68397 April 2001 ancillary study WAVE . The study entitle `` Modifying Oxidative Damage WAVE '' site database . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
