	<brief_summary>PRIMARY : To determine effect 8 week zidovudine ( AZT ) treatment HIV-1 burden peripheral blood lymphoid tissue HIV-1-infected , AZT-naive patient CD4+ T lymphocyte count 100 500 cells/mm3 . SECONDARY : To determine extent apoptosis ( program cell death ) occur patient . In previous trial AZT treatment HIV-infected patient , antiviral effect clearly demonstrate quantitative measurement virus plasma peripheral blood mononuclear cell . However , lymphoid tissue appear major reservoir HIV-1 major site virus replication HIV-infected person . Further data need assess effect treatment viral burden HIV-1 replication lymphoid tissue .</brief_summary>
