	<brief_summary>To determine safety maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydrothymidine ( d4T ) administer patient AIDS AIDS relate complex ( ARC ) intolerant zidovudine ( AZT ) . The study also begin assessment effectiveness d4T therapy HIV replication , plasma level p24 antigen , clinical immunologic parameter associate AIDS . Of method evaluate treat HIV-infected individual , AZT produce best result date . Toxic effect approximately 50 percent patient receive AZT may limit usefulness prolonged treatment . Long-term treatment may necessary prevent progression early stage HIV infection AIDS prevent secondary transmission . Other drug may equally effective AZT useful long- term treatment HIV infection must develop evaluate . Test-tube animal study d4T show drug inhibit replication ( reproduction ) HIV concentration similar concentration AZT anti-HIV activity . These study also indicate drug may stay bloodstream longer AZT . Thus , may possible drug effective AZT take less frequently AZT . It also may less disturb effect body function ( thymidine metabolism ) .</brief_summary>
