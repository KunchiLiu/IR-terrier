	<detailed_description>Because considerable variation among HIV-1 virus strain differ geographical location worldwide , multivalent peptide vaccine construct include prevalent divergent isolates , potentially provide wide coverage geographically isolated epidemic . Fourteen volunteer enter one two dose level multivalent candidate vaccine . At dose level , 12 volunteer receive vaccine two receive placebo . At least eight volunteer low dose level must monitor 2 week subsequent volunteer enter high dose . Intramuscular injection give day 0 , 28 , 168 , patient follow minimum 48 week initial immunization . Approximately 13 clinical visit require .</detailed_description>
