	<brief_title>Women 's Health Study ( WHS ) : A Randomized Trial Low-dose Aspirin Vitamin E Primary Prevention Cardiovascular Disease Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Various dos aspirin show effective prevent thrombosis vascular occlusion several clinical condition . Short-term study document efficacy aspirin prevent occlusion saphenous vein bypass grant , prevent myocardial infarction patient unstable angina , prevent transient ischemic attack stroke men cerebral vascular disease , prevent occlusion injure coronary artery follow transluminal angioplasty aid reduce myocardial infarction total mortality patient receive fibrinolytic therapy . Additionally , aspirin effective secondary prevention myocardial infarction subject know coronary artery disease . The result Physicians ' Health Study , large-scale primary prevention trial aspirin male physician , show decrease myocardial infarction , non-significant increase cerebral vascular event , difference overall mortality . However , study address efficacy aspirin vascular disease woman , possible risk benefit ratio may different woman . Specifically , large primary prevention trial woman , risk coronary heart disease , especially menopause . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The Women 's Health Study ( WHS ) randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial use 2x2 factorial design . The WHS sponsor NHBLI ( HL080467 ) NCI ( CA047988 ) . Approximately 1.75 million female health professional contact mail determine suitable inclusion study . A three-month run-in phase perform screen poor compliance . Randomization , begin February 1993 end January 1996 , stratify five-year age group . A total 39,876 participant randomly assign either Vitamin E ( 600 IU every day ) placebo ; aspirin ( 100 mg every day ) placebo . IN 2x2 factorial design , woman randomly assign active aspirin placebo vitamin E ( n=9,968 ) , placebo aspirin active vitamin E ( n=9,971 ) , active aspirin active vitamin E ( n=9,966 ) , placebo aspirin placebo vitamin E ( n=9,971 ) . A description characteristic woman 4 group provide J Women 's Health Gend Based Med 2000 ; 9:19-27 . In main analysis , woman active aspirin ( n=19,934 ) compare woman placebo aspirin ( n=19,942 ) ; woman active vitamin E ( n=19,937 ) compare woman placebo aspirin ( n=19,939 ) . As part initial trial , pre-randomization blood sample 28,345 participant frozen store genetic analysis support non-federal source . The primary endpoint reduction risk important vascular event ( combine endpoint nonfatal myocardial infarction , nonfatal stroke , total cardiovascular death ) decrease incidence total malignant neoplasms epithelial cell origin . Secondary endpoint individual component combine endpoint . Compliance measure reply questionnaire sent every year . The trial complete 2004 result publish 2005 ( N Engl J Med 2005 ; 352:1293-304 ; JAMA 2005 ; 294:47-55 ; JAMA 2005 ; 294:56-65 ) . Currently , woman follow observational basis .</detailed_description>
