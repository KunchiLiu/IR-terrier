	<brief_summary>The purpose study see develop good graft oral mucosal tissue like top mouth `` test tube '' could use successfully human . We already do successfully mice . The next step take small piece tissue human volunteer see grow large piece tissue outside human body graft back person successfully . We expect technique work . It already try patient burn skin similar procedure skin graft back . The significance research oral tissue take top mouth palate limit supply leave patient painful uncomfortable post surgery experience . If successful technique patient experience less pain discomfort site use grow tissue outside body take top mouth palate . In addition , wait long period grow patient 's cell make large piece oral tissue could get directly patient 's mouth . Patients participate study need require soft tissue graft mouth area need additional attach keratinize mucosa . This likely either preparation patient dental implant place . Another subset patient need scar tissue release vestibule mouth ( area turn gum lip ) release .</brief_summary>
