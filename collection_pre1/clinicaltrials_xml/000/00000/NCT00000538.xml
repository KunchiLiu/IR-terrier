	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : A solid foundation epidemiologic , clinical laboratory evidence underlies current dietary recommendation population-based prevention coronary heart disease . Average blood cholesterol level decline consumption less saturated fat cholesterol traditional United States . It clear , however , whether reduction total fat intake necessary well . More research also need define best provide national food supply whose composition enhance effort reduce coronary heart disease risk . Fatty acid investigation especially critical , area food industry great latitude reformulate product accord current scientific evidence , dietary recommendation , customer demand . Stearic acid , example , may suitable replacement 'hard ' fatty acid relatively little effect total blood cholesterol level , may render less suitable purpose accelerates tendency blood clot . Similarly , hydrogenate vegetable oil use substitute saturate animal fat , contain trans-fatty acid may raise low-density lipoprotein level saturate fatty acid . In general , mechanisms diet influence eventual development atherosclerosis alteration lipid lipoprotein level metabolism , factor hemostasis , still fully understood . Human clinical nutrition study , feasible , among best research approach address link diet atherosclerosis . Moreover , great relevance everyday life , finding quickly publicize . Often , however , study yield consistent reproducible result . The result transmission mixed message scientific lay community seriously undermines credibility nutrition research public 's confidence possibility obtain reliable practical advice modify diet . Oat bran , rise fall scientific popular press well marketplace , good example phenomenon . The lack consistency among designs clinical nutrition study seek answer scientific question ( example , influence dietary fiber serum cholesterol level ) mean result readily compare . Some study design flaw , lack adequate hypothesis control group . In addition , compliance dietary study frequently less ideal . Studies allow participant select prepare food , even adhere 'experimental ' diet , frequently provide reliable result . Only tightly control clinical setting , participant receive food experimental kitchen know consume , influence poor compliance minimize . A complication actual composition study diet may intend due natural variation food source vagary food composition database . Such discrepancy sufficient alter result study lead false conclusion , yet research budget seldom allow high cost food composition analysis . The typical small size clinical nutrition study far-reaching effect . Because study expensive require great commitment labor space , generally difficult single investigator fund traditional research grant enroll , feed , study 20 25 participant one time . This impose constraint duration , design , statistical power ; consequently , many human nutrition study lack sufficient power detect biologically meaningful difference group treatment . To avoid outside source variability would reduce study power , investigator usually make effort assemble 'homogeneous ' study population minimize number factor might impinge experimental design ; thus , study often conduct young Caucasian male average even low plasma cholesterol level . Not much know , therefore , response diet affect sex , age , race , co-morbid condition ( obesity ) , lipoprotein phenotype factor would make result generalizable population large . Furthermore , mechanism underlie so-called 'hypo-responder ' phenomenon , wherein individual presume insensitive effect diet plasma lipid level , elucidate unless individual wide range response study adequate number . The Arteriosclerosis , Hypertension , Lipid Metabolism Advisory Committee recommend development initiative February 1991 meeting . The National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council approve concept September 1991 meeting . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The first protocol , conduct 1993-1994 , compare effect three diet vary total fat ( 37 percent , 30 percent , 26 percent ) saturate fat ( 16 percent , 9 percent , 5 percent ) plasma lipoprotein thrombogenic activity 103 normal adult . Subjects consume three diet eight week . Ten meal per week consume on-site food pack take-home use . The second protocol , conduct 1994-1995 , examine lipoprotein level hemostatic parameter 86 subject low high density lipoprotein level and/or high triglyceride level and/or high insulin level consume seven week one three diet : typical American diet , high monounsaturated fat diet , high carbohydrate diet . DELTA also expend considerable effort field food composition analysis . Menus analyze chemically verify composition ensure nutrient content differ significantly among field center diet period . Food composition analysis research conduct Virginia Polytechnic State University consortium University North Carolina . The study active August 31 , 1999 grant U01-HL-49644 .</detailed_description>
