	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Permanent pacing estimate cost one billion dollar annually health care cost United States . Initially , pace primarily confine ventricular pacing limit sensing , program pace capacity . Tremendous growth occur pace technology , make available dual chamber pacing sophisticated sensing , pace , rate control . These advanced pacemaker costly complicate place surgically . One common indication pace sick sinus syndrome . Initial therapy usually medical inhibit tachyarrhythmias ( commonly paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ) . However , symptomatic bradycardia result , permanent pace commonly employ . The appropriate type pace set clearly define controversial . The development atrioventricular pace principally aim improve cardiac hemodynamics create physiological heart rate control . Hemodynamic study clearly show benefit approach many patient , particularly decrease leave ventricular compliance atrial activity contribute significantly cardiac output . Lack synchronization upper low chamber heart cause pacing ventricle alone result constellation symptom commonly refer `` pacemaker syndrome '' . The underlying mechanism dual chamber pacing purport improve outcome straightforward ; patient normal sinus rhythm , cardiac output improve 15 30 percent . In addition , number retrospective study compare single chamber atrial-based dual chamber pacing suggest latter may prevent adverse clinical event atrial fibrillation , congestive heart failure , cerebral vascular accident , death . While none study randomize trial , literature consistent concept dual mode pace result improved hemodynamics favorable outcome patient sick sinus syndrome . However , data provide definitive answer small sample sizes methodological problem . A major problem previous study probable selection bias favor implantation dual chamber device young , healthy patient . Several small study compare functional status quality life measure single dual chamber pace mode suggest good quality life outcomes dual chamber mode . Again , conclusion severly hamper sample size , lack random assignment adequate statistical adjustment control confounding , use outdated and/or invalid measure , potential response bias due awareness mode assignment . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A multicenter , randomize clinical trial . All patient receive dual chamber pacemaker capable either single dual chamber rate modulate pacing . Patients randomize either single chamber mode dual chamber mode . Patients prior stroke pre-stratified . Clinical electrocardiographic data collect 1.5 4.5 year follow-up . The primary endpoint either : first occurrence stroke , ; total ( all-cause ) mortality . Secondary endpoint include health status , cost-effectiveness , cardiovascular mortality , composite three major adverse effect expect sick sinus syndrome patient ( total mortality alone first stroke congestive heart failure hospitalization ) , first occurrence atrial fibrillation , heart failure score , pacemaker syndrome , health status woman elderly , outcome patient risk factor pacemaker syndrome . Enrollment complete October , 1999 total 2,010 patient . Quality life economic issue assess patient entry annually three year . Questionnaire-based measure health status quality life compare two pace group entire population subgroup define age gender . The economic substudy measure comparative cost , direct indirect medical nonmedical , two pace mode attempt determine cost-effective approach pacemaker treatment sick sinus syndrome . Recruitment start October 1 , 1995 complete October 4 , 1999 2,010 patient enrol .</detailed_description>
