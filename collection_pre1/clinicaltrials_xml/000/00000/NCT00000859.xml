	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial Efficacy Safety Strategy Starting With Nelfinavir Versus Ritonavir Added Background Antiretroviral ( AR ) Nucleoside Therapy HIV-Infected Individuals With CD4+ Cell Counts Less Than Equal 200/mm3</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AR therapy rapidly become standard care treatment HIV infection . AR therapy provide best opportunity maximize viral suppression , reduce toxicity delay emergence resistant strain . The new class AR agent , HIV protease inhibitor , exhibit potent anti-HIV effect describe date . This study compare 2 protease inhibitor , NFV RTV efficacy safety population advance HIV disease , take various background nucleoside therapy . Eligible patient randomize either NFV plus background AR nucleoside therapy RTV plus background AR nucleoside therapy . Background AR therapy may also background therapy , although use protease inhibitor monotherapy recommend unless alternative . Patients allow cross alternate protease inhibitor reach primary study endpoint . Data collect every 4 month . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 10/2/97 : Patients assign NFV arm develop significant intolerance may switch RTV IDV ; assign RTV arm develop significant intolerance encourage switch IDV ( NFV allow IDV contraindicate ) . Switchover intolerance strongly discourage first 4 week follow-up . Patients initially assign NFV therapy experience disease progression may switch RTV ; RTV tolerate , patient may switch IDV . Because cross-resistance RTV IDV , patient progress RTV switch NFV . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 12/15/98 : Patients originally assign NFV experience poor virologic control disease progression change RTV IDV enroll PIP protocol ( CPCRA 057 ) . Conversely , patient originally assign RTV change NFV enroll PIP protocol ( patient continue follow study ) . Because cross-resistance RTV IDV , change RTV IDV discourage . Determination poor virologic control disease progression discretion patient 's clinician . Change background antiretroviral therapy occur time protease inhibitor change poor virologic control progression ; choice new background antiretroviral agent discretion clinician . ] Randomization stratify clinical site . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 3/11/98 : SUBSTUDY CPCRA 045 : At least 600 patient ( &gt; = 400 CPCRA site &gt; = 200 CTN site ) enrol substudy . These patient plasma sample collect HIV RNA genotypic resistance within 30 day prior randomization , 1-month visit , q-4-month study visit thereafter end study . CD4+ cell count do 1-month visit q-4-month study visit end study . A subset patient also immunophenotyping CD4+ CD8+ cell TCR V-beta clone carry treatment . Another subset patient select site viral culture perform phenotypic drug sensitivity test . Initially , specimens 50 randomly choose patient group originally assign RTV identify resistance test . Of group , specimens receive RTV/IDV 1 month analyze genotypic resistance obtain estimate rate resistance development estimate risk disease progression associate resistance RTV/ZDV . Based estimate , determination make total number patient specimens treatment group order address primary objective comparing genotypic resistance two group . ]</detailed_description>

However , use protease inhibitor recommend monotherapy unless alternative . Therefore , patient AR treatment may enrol discretion clinician . Allowed : Saquinavir . Patients must : Documented HIV infection . A CD4+ cell count &lt; = 100/mm3 within 3 month prior study . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 3/11/98 : CD4+ cell count &lt; = 200/mm3 time prior entry ] . Parental consent patient &lt; 18 year old . Prior Medication : Allowed : Saquinavir ( SQV ) . Exclusion Criteria Coexisting Condition : Patients follow symptoms condition exclude : Stage 2 great AIDS dementia complex . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 10/2/97 : Any acute disease condition would , physician 's judgement , contraindicate start NFV RTV . ] Known hypersensitivity RTV ingredient ( patient assign RTV therapy ) . Concurrent Medication : Excluded : Concomitant use protease inhibitor . Concomitant treatment discontinue , physician 's judgement , take NFV RTV . AS PER AMENDMENT 10/2/97 : For patient randomize NFV : Concomitant therapy terfenadine , astemizole , cisapride , triazolam , midazolam , ergot derivative , amiodarone , quinidine , rifampin . For patient randomize IDV : Concomitant therapy terfenadine , astemizole , cisapride , triazolam , midazolam , rifampin . Patients follow prior symptom exclude : AS PER AMENDMENT 10/2/97 : History clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction component NFV tablet ( patient assign NFV therapy ) . Prior Medication : Excluded : Prior use protease inhibitor except SQV . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 10/2/97 : Prior use IDV 4 week protease inhibitor ( except SQV ) prior duration . ]</criteria>
