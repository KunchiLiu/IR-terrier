	<brief_title>Hepatitis B Vaccine Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Although carrier HBsAg asymptomatic , substantial proportion eventually develop chronic active hepatitis cirrhosis . There also overwhelm evidence hepatitis B virus single important causative factor hepatocellular carcinoma . Thus , mass immunization program HBV infection may ultimately affect incidence acute hepatitis B pool chronic carrier may also reduce morbidity mortality chronic active hepatitis , cirrhosis , hepatocellular carcinoma . Krugman co-worker lay groundwork active immunization hepatitis B 1970 1973 . They discover 1:10 dilution hepatitis B infective serum lose infectivity boil one minute retain antigenicity prevent hepatitis B 70 percent vaccinate subject . Hilleman colleague Merck Institute Therapeutic Research develop sophisticated vaccine consist highly purify , formalin-inactivated HBsAg particle derive plasma chronic carrier antigen . By 1978 , data sufficient permit test clinical trial . The first subject inoculate November 1978 , October 1979 , recruitment end . In May 1980 , trial event review classified expert panel . In June 1980 code vaccine placebo allocation broken . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , double blind , fixed-sample . A total 549 subject allocated vaccine group treat highly purify formalin-inactivated virus subunit derive plasma chronic carrier hepatitis B . A total 534 allocate placebo group . Both group receive injection 0 , 1 month , 6 month unless evidence infection develop series complete .</detailed_description>
