	<brief_summary>PRIMARY : To assess safety nimodipine treatment HIV-Associated Motor / Cognitive Complex ( formerly AIDS dementia complex ) . To assess systemic central nervous system toxicity ( e.g. , rash , headache , gastrointestinal symptom , nausea , dyspnea , muscle pain cramp , acne ) nimodipine . SECONDARY : To assess efficacy nimodipine stabilize progression HIV-Associated Motor / Cognitive Complex improvement neuropsychological test performance , peripheral neuropathy , neurologic manifestation . HIV-infected patient may develop condition know HIV-Associated Motor / Cognitive Complex ( also know AIDS dementia complex ) cause damage nervous system , particularly brain spinal cord . Evidence exist nimodipine protects nerve cell culture injury HIV . Although nimodipine use patient neurological problem , safety effectiveness halt progression HIV-Associated Motor / Cognitive Complex yet know .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HIV-infected patient may develop condition know HIV-Associated Motor / Cognitive Complex ( also know AIDS dementia complex ) cause damage nervous system , particularly brain spinal cord . Evidence exist nimodipine protects nerve cell culture injury HIV . Although nimodipine use patient neurological problem , safety effectiveness halt progression HIV-Associated Motor / Cognitive Complex yet know . Forty patient currently take zidovudine ( AZT ) approve antiretroviral agent randomize one three treatment arm : high-dose nimodipine , low-dose nimodipine , placebo . Additionally , six patient intolerant standard antiretroviral therapy randomize receive high- low-dose nimodipine . Nimodipine administer mouth concurrently patient ' prestudy dose antiretroviral agent . Treatment give 16 week , patient follow every 4 week . As option , patient may receive additional 16 week low-dose nimodipine .</detailed_description>
