	<brief_summary>To determine safety usefulness zidovudine ( AZT ) treatment child 3 month 12 year age . This study design determine child infect HIV special type lung disease call lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis ( LIP ) early symptoms HIV infection may derive benefit treatment AZT . It hop drug prevent child develop additional symptom infection help resolve already exist symptom . AZT show laboratory inhibit infection cell HIV . AZT show decrease mortality frequency opportunistic infection certain adult patient symptomatic HIV infection . It , therefore , likely symptomatic HIV-infected child may also benefit specific antiviral therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Safety Effectiveness Zidovudine Treatment HIV-Infected Children With Mild Moderate Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AZT show laboratory inhibit infection cell HIV . AZT show decrease mortality frequency opportunistic infection certain adult patient symptomatic HIV infection . It , therefore , likely symptomatic HIV-infected child may also benefit specific antiviral therapy . Children participate study evaluate hospital outpatient clinic care specialist pediatrics . Of child participate study , half receive AZT syrup half receive placebo ( sugar solution ) . The investigator know medication child receives decide random process . The child take medication strawberry-flavored clear syrup every 6 hour ( 4 time day ) , period 2 year 104 week . The child monitor outpatient basis receive therapy test perform admission study repeat several time treatment . Blood sample obtain week first 4 week , every week next 4 week , monthly end study . At certain site , Cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) collect lumbar puncture every 52 week evaluate infection involve brain nervous system . An independent committee review data collect child every 6 month . The drug stop dose reduce unacceptable side effect develop . AMENDED : As August 7 , 1989 study blind broken , placebo arm discontinue study close accrual September 25 , 1989 . The 6 child enrol study offer AZT .</detailed_description>
