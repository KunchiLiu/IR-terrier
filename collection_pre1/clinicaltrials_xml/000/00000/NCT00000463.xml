	<brief_title>Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft ( CABG ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : A large number study report follow CABG , vessel proximal graft demonstrate accelerate atherosclerosis graft may show progressive obstruction due thrombosis , fibrosis , graft atheroma . Pathological clinical study document graft obstruction perioperative period first year usually due technical problem surgery thrombosis occur 15 20 percent saphenous vein graft . Antiplatelet drug aspirin show reduce early graft occlusion 50 percent . In addition thrombosis , first year , saphenous vein graft undergo diffuse fibrosis distortion . However , significance change know . After first year , lipid deposition change histologically similar atherosclerosis document experimental study human saphenous vein graft patent one year completely occlude additional 30 percent narrow period ten year . These angiographic change saphenous vein graft correlate high LDL-cholesterol , low HDL-cholesterol high apolipoprotein B level . In experimental animal , cholesterol deposition graft substantially increase decreased increase decreasing saturate fat cholesterol animal 's diet . In contrast change saphenous vein graft , internal mammary artery graft show substantially low rate obstruction . The native vessel ( ungrafted vessel graft vessel distal proximal site ) , however , show evidence progressive atherosclerosis . The long-term follow-up graft also demonstrate thrombotic material even occlusive thrombus part acute event . Progression atherosclerotic lesion graft native vessel lead recurrent angina , unaltered long-term survival reduce efficacy repeat CABG surgery . Johnson 11 year follow-up 3,105 post-CABG patient , report 15 percent patient preoperative angina recurrent angina 1 year ; 6 percent develop angina every subsequent year . In study , patient recurrent angina twice mortality compare angina-free . Long-term follow-up VA Cooperative Trial CABG show survival surgical group appear initially superior compare medical group benefit diminish ten year . This may relate graft obstruction progression native coronary atherosclerosis . Re-operation patient carry high operative mortality risk result less impressive . It estimate approximately 5 percent CABG surgery 1984 re-operations percentage would double next decade . Therefore , measure prevent graft occlusion progression atherosclerosis native vessel , successful , could substantial clinical economic importance reduce mortality , morbidity number patient undergo re-operations . Apart trial aspirin dipyridamole post-CABG patient demonstrate significant reduction graft closure within first year surgery , large systematic study intervention patient . Graft occlusion show correlate high LDL-cholesterol low HDL-cholesterol , severity atherosclerosis additionally show related cigarette smoking increase level coagulation factor . Therefore , lower LDL cholesterol ( diet drug ) , anti-thrombotic therapy warfarin logical choice intervention . Several study suggest CABG surgery relieve angina improve overall quality life . However , available study , CABG consistently appear associate improvement employment status , physical recreational activity , life style . The reason result entirely clear need identify biobehavioral psychosocial factor predict successful adjustment CABG . The initiative propose Institute staff approve September 1985 National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council . The Request Proposals release September 1985 award make April 1987 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Multicenter , double-blind , randomize , control trial . All prospective participant receive active warfarin treatment month prior randomization . Only participants demonstrate minimal reaction warfarin consume 90 percent prescribe medication randomize . Dietary modification lower serum cholesterol , exercise program , smoke cessation program implement . Patients randomly assign 2 X 2 factorial design four treatment group : aggressive LDL-C lower lovastatin 40 80 mg/d , necessary cholestyramine 8 mg/d achieve LDL-C 60 85 mg/dl ; moderate LDL-C lowering lovastatin 2.5 5 mg/d , cholestyramin need , achieve LDL-C 130 140 mg/dl ; warfarin 1 4 mg/d achieve INR 1.8 2.0 ; warfarin-placebo . All participant follow five year , end selective coronary graft angiography perform . The primary angiography endpoint proportion major SVG per patient show substantial reduction ( 0.06 mm great ) lumen diameter . Biobehavioral study conduct 750 participant . Planning study begin April 1987 final protocol develop August 1988 . Patient recruitment complete . Follow-up end September 1 , 1995 data analysis continue December 1998 contract N01-HC-75076 . . The Post CABG Biobehavioral Study examine cohort 759 coronary artery bypass patient ( 269 woman 490 men ) enrol five clinical center . Sociodemographic medical data obtain interview medical chart . Health-related quality life psychosocial data ascertain preoperatively interview questionnaire patient whose condition allow preoperative assessment compare among patient hospital enrol male female patient .</detailed_description>
