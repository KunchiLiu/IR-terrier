	<brief_title>Cardiac Arrhythmia Pilot Study ( CAPS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Epidemiologic study indicate complex ventricular premature beat make independent contribution risk sudden death survivor myocardial infarction ( MI ) , appear merely reflection association relatively severe myocardial damage . The potential reduction mortality identification administration drug capable safely suppress ventricular arrhythmias tremendous . In 1982 , incomplete knowledge regard type ventricular arrhythmia respond various kind drug . A pilot study antiarrhythmic agent help clarify issue . Numerous antiarrhythmic agent differ pharmacologic property side effect show suppress ventricular arrhythmia . It also postulate antiarrhythmic might raise individual 's threshold experience ventricular fibrillation . There several publish report large ( least l00 patient ) , long-term clinical trial antiarrhythmic agent post-MI patient . None yield statistically significant result use mortality response variable . This might due incorrect drug selection , inadequate sample size , inappropriate choice patient , lack impact arrhythmia treatment mortality . Due incomplete knowledge drug ( ) combination drug effective , consider premature undertake full scale trial 1981-1982 . However , public health problem sufficient magnitude warrant pilot study learn efficacy safety various antiarrhythmic drug singly combination . The protocol plan phase begin October l982 . Patient recruitment start July l983 end summer 1985 . Each patient follow one year . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , double-blind , fixed sample . A total 502 patient randomly assign 5 treatment group consist encainide , ethmozine , flecainide , imipramine , placebo .</detailed_description>
