	<brief_summary>We start Bone , Estrogen , Strength Training ( BEST ) study fall 1995 University Arizona , Tucson , Arizona . The BEST study large kind . It look effect hormone replacement therapy strength training exercise bone mineral density . ( Bone mineral density affect bone strength risk osteoporosis . ) Six group 300 woman participate osteoporosis prevention study . In 1998 , BEST study receive additional funding examine another 2 year long-term effect strength train bone mineral density . By 2001 finish analyze result study group 1-year effect exercise bone , well additional analysis effect 2 , 3 , 4 year strength train weight-bearing exercise bone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Osteoporotic fracture associate low bone mineral density ( BMD ) significant public health problem woman , result 1 million fracture per year . The increase incidence fracture make already major health problem even great one future . Estimates medical cost treatment osteoporotic fracture expect increase $ 14.8 billion 1995 $ 60 billion 2020 . Although Women 's Health Initiative investigate dietary hormonal factor relation bone density , investigate effect exercise reduce bone mineral loss postmenopausal woman . This study include completion large , partially randomize clinical trial evaluate effect 1-year exercise intervention total body regional BMD two population ( hormone replacement therapy [ HRT ] versus HRT ) postmenopausal woman previous history physical inactivity . A major hypothesis , compare no-exercise group , exercise intervention effective alternative reduce risk osteoporosis exercise effect large cohort woman HRT HRT . The exercise program include progressive resistance exercise use free weight weight resistance machine weight-bearing aerobic exercise . We carefully supervise monitor exercise compliance keep record amount exercise complete three weekly exercise session measure strength gain select muscle group . We measure biochemical marker bone formation resorption hormonal correlate bone mineral density change include sex steroid baseline , 6 month , 1 year . We obtain duplicate blood collection , make one week apart , cohort three measurement period . We also collect duplicate dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) scan time period follow change axial appendicular BMD total regional soft tissue body composition result intervention . We collect extensive dietary intake record first year intervention ; monitor dietary intake 2-year followup use food frequency questionnaire . We also measure followup BMD , soft tissue , lean fat body composition 2 year woman complete first-year intervention program . Two-hundred sixty-six woman complete first year intervention . The study retention rate 92 percent first year first four cohort . Because paucity information regard long-term effect exercise , increase emphasis scientific community evaluate long-term efficacy exercise intervention osteoporosis prevention , comprehensive 1-year clinical trial 2-year followup make important contribution determine future role combine progressive resistance weight bear aerobic exercise prevention osteoporosis two population ( HRT vs. HRT ) postmenopausal woman .</detailed_description>
