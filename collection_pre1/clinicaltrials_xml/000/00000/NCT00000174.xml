	<brief_summary>This phase IIIb trial prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , 36-month study compare length time progression mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) clinical diagnosis Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) subject take Exelon vs. placebo . Exelon currently review U.S. Food Drug Administration treatment Alzheimer 's disease . The drug clear marketing 40 country Alzheimer 's disease date , include 15 member state European Union , New Zealand , Argentina , Brazil Mexico . Each subject MCI randomly assign treatment either Exelon placebo . Subjects assign Exelon receive 1.5 6.0 mg bid ( twice daily ) ( 3.0 12 mg/day ) majority study . At every regular visit schedule every three month , patient give basic efficacy safety assessment . These assessment include evaluation adverse event , vital sign , activity daily live , clinical staging scale determine subject may convert dementia .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Are aged 5585 year , inclusive . Subjects older 85 year may eligible participate , approval designate study medical monitor . Are male female without childbearing potential ( i.e. , surgically sterilize [ via bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy , hysterectomy ] , least one year postmenopausal , use adequate birth control ) . Are cooperative , able ingest oral medication , willing complete aspect study . Will provide write informed consent prior participation study . Show evidence mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) meeting follow criterion : Global CDR score = 0.5 , NYU Delayed Paragraph Recall less 9 , 17item HAMD score less 13 , HAMD Item 1 ( depressed mood ) score =1 . Have friend family member willing participate study informant . The informant must see subject least week several hour available accompany subject screen baseline visit , minimum , accessible telephone schedule visit . Advanced , severe , unstable disease type may interfere primary secondary variable evaluation include medical condition could expect progress , recur , change extent may bias assessment clinical mental status subject significant degree put subject special risk . Cognitive impairment sufficient warrant diagnosis dementia . Met DSMIV NINCDSADRDA criterion AD . A clinical diagnosis AD . A DSMIV Axis 1 diagnosis . However , subject current depression eligible appropriate treatment depressive episode . A minimum four week washout antidepressant medication occur prior screening . Subjects prior history depression ( currently depress ) allow study . Fewer four year formal education . A documented history transient ischemic attack . Baseline MRI finding CTscan finding within year screen consistent process AD , e.g. , stroke , tumor , brain trauma hydrocephalus , may contribute subject 's MCI . Lacunae infarcts present area affect cognition ( entorhinal cortex , hippocampus , medial temporal lobe ) also exclude subject study . A score great 4 Modified Hachinski Ischemic Scale . A current diagnosis primary neurodegenerative disorder , e.g. , Parkinson 's disease . A current diagnosis uncontrolled seizure disorder . A current diagnosis active peptic ulceration . A current diagnosis severe unstable cardiovascular disease . A current diagnosis sicksinus syndrome conduction deficit ( sinoatrial block , second third degree atrioventricular block ) . A current diagnosis acute , severe , unstable asthmatic condition . A know exaggerated pharmacological sensitivity hypersensitivity drug similar Exelon cholinergic compound ( e.g. , pilocarpine , bethanechol , tacrine , velnacrine , donepezil , metrifonate , physostigmine ) . Subjects experience elevation liver function test parameter cholinesterase inhibitor still eligible . Taken follow substance : An investigational drug past four week ; Metrifonate past three month ; drug treatment know cause major organ system toxicity past four week ; cholinergic drug ( e.g. , donepezil , tacrine , succinylcholinetype muscle relaxant ) past two week ( topical pilocarpine permit ) ; antidepressant medication past four week . Participated previous clinical trial Exelon . Clinically important laboratory abnormality serum B12 , folate , T3/T4 screening . The subject exclude peripheral neuropathy , macrocytic anemia , myxedema present . If screen value meet absolutely exclusionary value give still outside normal reference range , treatment folic acid/B12 deficiency thyroid disorder , appropriate , may initiate adjusted reevaluation subject within three month . Within three month treatment , subject 's cognitive condition must clinically unchanged bad subject acceptable . Once accept , subject must remain appropriate treatment throughout study . Exclude T3 uptake less 19 % ; T4 le 2.9 ( ( g/dL ) ; free T4 index less 0.8 Exclude folate le 1.7 ng/ml ( normal range great 1.9 ) Exclude B12 le 100 pg/ml ( normal range great 200 ) A positive rapid plasmin reagin test follow positive serological test syphilis . A disability may prevent subject complete study requirement ( e.g. , blindness , deafness , severe language difficulty ) .</criteria>
