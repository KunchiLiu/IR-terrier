	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine tolerance effectiveness rhIL-12 HIV-positive patient CD4 cell count less 50 cells/mm3 versus 300-500 cells/mm3 . This study look ability rhIL-12 boost immune system HIV HIV-associated bacterial infection patient . IL-12 find naturally body rhIL-12 commercially produce version . IL-12 may enhance anti-HIV immune system activity increase number cell fight infection . IL-12 may also increase body 's ability fight bacterial infection Mycobacterium avium complex ( MAC ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Effects Interleukin-12 ( rhIL-12 ) HIV-Positive Patients With CD4 Cell Counts Less Than 50 Cells/mm3 300-500 Cells/mm3</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IL-12 number effect vitro could relevant HIV disease include promotion TH1 cell development , enhancement HIV-specific T cell response cell subject AIDS , , particular relevance MAC disease , increase secretion cytotoxic cytokine IFN-gamma T lymphocytes NK cell . Part A ( 36 patient less 50 CD4+ cells/mm3 ) : Patients randomize within one three sequential dose cohort receive either rhIL-12 match placebo subcutaneous injection twice weekly four week . Eligible patient participate 1 3 dosing cohort . Dose escalation new cohort patient Part A occur 3 follow occur : ( 1 ) At least 9 patient rhIL-12 arm enrol current dose group either study drug least 4 week ( temporary discontinuation allow ) permanently discontinue study drug due primary toxicity endpoint . [ ( 2 ) AS PER AMENDMENT 6/16/97 : Fewer 2 12 patient receive rhIL-12 30 100 ng/kg primary toxicity endpoint . ] ( 3 ) Adequate data Genetics Institute/Wyeth Ayerst-sponsored dose escalation trial obtain analyzed demonstrate safety dose administer next cohort . Note : If 3 patient rhIL-12 arm give dose Part A experience primary toxicity endpoint , accrual drug administration discontinue . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 6/16/97 : If cohort exactly two patient rhIL-12 arm experience primary toxicity endpoint , next cohort receives study drug dose current cohort , administer week . If cohort receive study drug administer week least two subject experience primary toxicity endpoint , drug administration Part A stop . Any cohort receives study drug week last cohort Part A ; dose escalation perform ] . Part B ( 18 subject 300-500 CD4+ cells/mm3 ) : Patients randomize receive either maximum tolerate dose ( determined Part A ) rhIL-12 match placebo subcutaneously twice week 4 week . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 01/29/99 : Because slow accrual cohort 3 Part A , concurrent enrollment begin Part B cohort 3 Part A complete . There dose escalation Part A . Part A remain open accrual final enrollee Part B complete 4 week study treatment . For Part B , 27 patient randomize equal probability one two rhIL-12 dos placebo . Semiweekly injection give 4 week . ]</detailed_description>
