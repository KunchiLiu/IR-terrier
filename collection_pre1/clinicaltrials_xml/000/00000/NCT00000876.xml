	<brief_summary>CD4-IgG2 special man-made protein build block entrance HIV CD4 cell ( cell immune system fight infection ) . The purpose study see give CD4-IgG2 HIV-infected child safe effective . HIV attach CD4 cell enters . Inside , HIV make copy help virus invade body . CD4 cell kill disabled process HIV replication . Decreases CD4 cell lead weaken immune system . When CD4 cell count become low , body unable defend , HIV infection develop AIDS . The protein use study , CD4-IgG2 , may able attach HIV inactivate enter CD4 cell . This early study examine CD4-IgG2 possible treatment HIV child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Since CD4 high-affinity receptor HIV-1 , molecules CD4-IgG2 , incorporate gp120 bind region CD4 , potential bind neutralize strain virus . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 4/25/00 : Study result demonstrate product safe child , well tolerate , may antiviral property . With encouraging result hand , extra cohort add use twice dose rCD4-IgG2 Cohort I . ] The study conduct two part . In Part 1 patient receive single dose CD4-IgG2 intravenously 1 4 dose level . A minimum 3 patient treat give dose level . If none 3 patient experience Grade 3 4 toxicity , patient escalate next dose level . If 3 patient life-threatening toxicity 1 3 patient experience non-life-threatening Grade 3 4 toxicity , escalation stop prior dose ( ) consider maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . If 1 3 patient experience non-life-threatening Grade 3 4 toxicity , 3 additional patient treat dose level . If 1 3 additional patient Grade 3 4 toxicity , escalation stop . If none 3 additional patient Grade 3 4 toxicity , patient escalate next dose level . Part 2 provide additional data safety , toxicity pharmacokinetics CD4-IgG2 give multiple dos . Patients receive high safe dose ( MTD ) establish Part 1 . Treatment give intravenously weekly Weeks 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 . If insufficient activity see dose level , 6 additional patient enrol high dose level . Patients participate Part 1 may enroll Part 2 provide follow least 3 month meet inclusion criterion Part 2 . If patient experience life-threatening condition due CD4-IgG2 , study stop . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 4/25/00 : Cohort II receive twice dose Cohort I intravenously weekly Weeks 0 , 1 , 2 3 . Pharmacokinetic sample obtain pre-dose 1 hour dos administer Weeks 0 , 1 , 2 ; pre-dose , 1 hour , 24 hour , Days 3 , 7 , 14 dose administer Week 3 . An overnight stay hospital recommend first 24 hour . At Weeks 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , virology test include HIV-1 RNA perform infusion CD4-IgG . Follow-up monitoring patient do month 4 month patient Cohort II . ]</detailed_description>
