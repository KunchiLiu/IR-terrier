	<brief_summary>To evaluate whether progressive addition lens ( PALs ) slow rate progression juvenile-onset myopia ( nearsightedness ) compare single vision lens , measure cycloplegic autorefraction . An additional outcome measure axial length , measure A-scan ultrasonography . To describe natural history juvenile-onset myopia group child receive conventional treatment ( single vision lens ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Correction Myopia Evaluation Trial ( COMET )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myopia ( nearsightedness ) important public health problem , entail substantial societal personal cost . It highly prevalent society even frequent Asian country ; furthermore , prevalence may increase time . High myopia contributes significant loss vision blindness . At present , mechanism involve etiology myopia unclear , way prevent condition . Current method correction require lifelong use lenses surgical treatment , expensive may lead complication . The rationale trial , Correction Myopia Evaluation Trial ( COMET ) , arise convergence research involve ( 1 ) link accommodation myopia child ( 2 ) animal model myopia show important role visual environment eye growth . A contribution research blur critical component development myopia . The primary aim COMET , evaluate efficacy progressive addition lens , noninvasive intervention , slow progression myopia , follow line reason . These lens provide clear visual input range view distance without focus effort child . The comparison myopia progression child treat PALs versus single vision lens allow quantification effect PALs myopia progression followup period . The COMET multicenter , randomize , double-masked clinical trial evaluate whether PALs slow progression juvenile-onset myopia compare single vision lens . The study collaborative effort involve Study Chair New England College Optometry ; four clinical center college optometry Boston , Birmingham , Philadelphia , Houston ; Coordinating Center State University New York Stony Brook . The sample size goal , 450 child myopia eye meet specific inclusion exclusion criterion , attain enrollment 469 child one year . Children identify school screening , clinic record , referral local practitioner . Eligible child randomly assign receive progressive addition single vision lens . Participating child examine 6-month interval follow baseline , least 3 year , measure change refractive error update prescription , accord specify protocol . A dilated examination evaluate study outcome measure perform annual study visit . A standardized , common protocol use center . The primary outcome study progression myopia , define magnitude change relative baseline spherical equivalent refraction , determine cycloplegic autorefraction . The secondary outcome study axial length measure A-scan ultrasonography .</detailed_description>
