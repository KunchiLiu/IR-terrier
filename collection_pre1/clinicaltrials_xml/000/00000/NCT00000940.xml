	<detailed_description>Acute , primary HIV infection represent potentially unique opportunity eradicate infection . Although plasma viral load rise rapidly , dominant infect virus relatively uniform genetically , infection may fully establish tissue site time exposure . Current antiretroviral therapy able reduce plasma viral load unmeasurable level establish infection . However , many question remain treatment primary HIV infection . While assumed aggressive antiretroviral regimen require , know long must continue . It hop interval aggressive therapy , number agent could safely reduce . This study evaluate viral suppression sustain study therapy withdrawn . Participants study receive lamivudine ( 3TC ) , stavudine ( d4T ) , abacavir ( ABC ) , amprenavir ( APV ) , ritonavir ( RTV ) least 52 week . During induction phase , participant follow regular study visit every 4 8 week . If participant 's viral load CD4 count within study parameter end 52 week , participant discontinue antiretroviral medication simultaneously . Participants treatment interruption phase follow weekly initially , every 2 week 8 week , every 4 8 week . Treatment may restart necessary phase base viral load CD4 count . If treatment restart , participant receive 3TC , d4T , APV , RTV ABC . During reinduction phase , participant follow every 4 8 week . Depending viral load CD4 count , participant may eligible second treatment interruption phase follow reinduction phase . Participants stop antiretroviral medication simultaneously monitor first treatment interruption phase . Following second treatment interruption , participant restart 3TC , d4T , APV , RTV evaluate Weeks 4 , 8 , 16 , 24 , time participant go study . The length study participation individual participant vary . The length phase highly dependent participant 's laboratory parameter . In general , participant enrol study 3 4 year . Participants may also enroll immunology , compartment , pharmacology , medication compliance substudies .</detailed_description>
