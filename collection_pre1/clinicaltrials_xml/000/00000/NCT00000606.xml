	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : LVRS intend primarily patient whose chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) predominantly emphysema . Emphysema characterize anatomically `` abnormal , persistent enlargement airspace distal terminal bronchiole , accompany destruction airspace wall without obvious fibrosis '' . The loss lung architecture lead compressible peripheral airway close high normal lung volume ( early airway closure ) . The increased compliance air trap early closure lead hyperinflation lung , distention chest wall , flatten , disadvantage diaphragm , ventilation-perfusion mismatch . In 1950s 1960s , Dr. Otto Brantigan theorize surgical excision multiple wedge lung would reduce lung volume , thereby restore outward elastic pull small airway reduce airway obstruction . Dr. Brantigan report surgical excision lung tissue result significant clinical improvement case , mortality high . With little objective data high mortality , procedure gain widespread acceptance . The experience diaphragmatic chest wall function could restore emphysema lung transplantation renew interest Dr. Brantigan 's work . Improvements surgical technique open possibility perform surgical excision lung tissue . Recent report LVRS show improvement FEV1 , FVC , TLC , RV dyspnea quality life assessment . These report generate enormous excitement among patient doctor . Many center around country start perform LVRS result hundred patient procedure , despite preliminary nature result , lack rigorous patient selection criterion lack information long term outcome . Basic question remain patient surgery , protocol follow , physiological test obtain , long term efficacy technique morbidity , mortality , quality life . The mechanisms benefit full cardiopulmonary consequence unknown . The concept trial originate NHLBI Workshop Evaluation Research Lung Volume Reduction Surgery . The initiative reviewed approve May 1996 National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council meeting . The Requests Proposals release June , 1996 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In trial , 1218 eligible patient randomize receive either medical therapy ( 610 ) medical therapy LVRS ( 608 ) . LVRS perform median sternotomy video-assisted thorascopic surgery ( VATS ) . Centers randomize patient either ) medical therapy alone versus medical therapy LVRS median sternotomy , b ) medical therapy alone versus medical therapy LVRS VATS , c ) medical therapy alone versus medical therapy LVRS median sternotomy versus medical therapy LVRS bilateral VATS . Medical therapy include pulmonary rehabilitation education . Direct comparison two surgical technique possible center perform technique . All arm include intensive pulmonary rehabilitation . The primary endpoint survival functional improvement assess maximum workload . Secondary endpoint include morbidity , improvement pulmonary function , quality life performance activity daily live . Follow-up exam , include history , physical exam , pulmonary function test , exercise test quality life assessment , occur pre-operative rehabilitation six twelve month surgery every twelve month thereafter . Recruitment end July 31 , 2002 follow-up end December , 2002 .</detailed_description>
