	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn immune system work response vaccine . We give vaccine subject cancer treatment , patient chemotherapy stem cell transplant . Some patient get vaccines treatment boost immune system ( like immune stimulate drug interleukin-2 IL-2 ) . Although safely treat many patient immune boost drug , yet know improve body 's immune system respond well vaccine . Some healthy volunteer also give vaccine order serve control subject get good measure normal immune response . We compare patient healthy volunteer study immune system respond vaccine . There several different type white cell blood . We interested immune cell blood call T-cells . These T-cells detect foreign substance body ( like virus cancer cell ) . We try learn body fight foreign substance . Our goal develop cancer vaccine would teach T-cells detect kill cancer cell well . We know healthy people immune system effectively protect recurrent virus infection . For example , people get `` mono '' ( mononucleosis ) normal circumstance . When body infect `` mono '' virus , immune system remembers prevents infection . We try use immune system prevent cancer relapse . To test , give two vaccine use measure immune response . Blood sample study cancer patient compare similar sample normal subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccination With Tetanus KLH Assess Immune Responses .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive vaccine consisting : Arm A : Intracel KLH 1000 mcg ( 1 mg ) without adjuvant , subcutaneous Tetanus Toxoid 0.5 ml intramuscularly ( arm close 1/2/02 ) . Arm B : Biosyn KLH 1000 mcg ( 1 mg ) without adjuvant , subcutaneous tetanus toxoid 0.5 ml intramuscularly ( arm close 3/18/03 ) . Arm C : Biosyn KLH 1000 mcg ( 1 mg ) Montanide ISA51 ( replace vegetable ( VG ) source 8/31/06 increase product safety ) subcutaneous Tetanus toxoid 0.5 ml intramuscularly ( arm open 3/18/03 ) . Subjects ineligible tetanus may still receive KLH protocol . This especially true give national shortage tetanus vaccine . Subjects eligible tetanus become available significant change treatment intervention overall health status within 3 month KLH vaccine .</detailed_description>
