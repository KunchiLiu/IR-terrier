	<brief_summary>To compare , randomize , multicenter surgical trial , postoperative tamponade effectiveness intraocular silicone oil intraocular long-acting gas ( initially sulfur hexafluoride [ SF 6 ] , later perfluoropropane [ C 3 F 8 ] ) management retinal detachment complicate proliferative vitreoretinopathy ( PVR ) , use vitrectomy associate technique . To evaluate ocular complication result use silicone oil gas .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Silicone Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment retinal detachment complicate PVR remain controversial . Although case manage successfully pars plana vitrectomy temporary tamponade provide intraocular gas , others eventually redetach technique . Preliminary report indicate prolong tamponade liquid silicone result improve anatomical success , eventual visual outcome may prejudice silicone-related complication , particularly glaucoma keratopathy . The addition hydraulic reattachment simultaneous fluid/gas exchange vitrectomy surgery prove important development . Although complication procedure , subsequent redetachment frequent . The Silicone Study randomize trial investigate relative merit silicone oil gas tamponade modality . All study patient underwent vitrectomy randomize intraoperatively either silicone oil gas . Two group eye enter study : eye prior vitrectomy ( Group 1 ) undergone previous vitrectomy outside study ( Group 2 ) . A critical element study standardize surgical procedure PVR . This surgical procedure , intend relieve retinal traction vitrectomy technique , follow assessment relief provide intraocular air tamponade . The eye randomize silicone oil gas completion entire surgical procedure eliminate investigator bias might develop knowledge treatment modality . Patients examine 5 14 day follow randomization 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 36 month date . Repeated surgery permit either treatment modality . The Fundus Photograph Reading Center staff process analyzed photograph take clinic , grade preoperative severity PVR basis baseline visit photograph , confirm macular status followup visit . End point study visual acuity 5/200 great macular reattachment 6 month follow final surgical procedure . The successful outcomes complication rate two modality compare .</detailed_description>
