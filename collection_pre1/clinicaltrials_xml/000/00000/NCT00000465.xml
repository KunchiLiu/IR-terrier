	<brief_title>Emory Angioplasty Versus Surgery Trial ( EAST )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : PTCA widely practice procedure choice revascularization myocardium patient single-vessel disease deem need intervention probably widely apply surgery would group patient . No study show improved survival intervention patient . The early natural history study Oberman show survival experience patient single-vessel disease , include anterior descending , resemble closely patient coronary artery disease multivessel disease . Quality life study include CASS randomize study , include 27 percent single-vessel disease patient , show improved exercise tolerance less need medication patient receive PTCA For single-vessel disease . Balloon angioplasty single-vessel disease thus appear justified treatment angina pectoris . In multivessel disease CASS randomize trial show improved survival seven year subset patient three-vessel disease impair ventricular function . However , seven year may prove point wide separation medical surgical survival curve , base experience VA study present result 11 year show convergence survival experience . Data Montreal Heart Institute also indicate accelerate deterioration venous graft five seven year surgery . The late failure graft potent argument delay CABG long possible patient multivessel disease . Should PTCA prove delay action multivessel disease patient , delay several year first CABG operation would confer obvious advantage , even repeat PTCA 's require . Repeat CABG may carry increase risk presumably possibility inadequate revascularization autologous graft material use . As long treatment coronary artery disease palliative , management individual patient require long-term ( lifetime ) strategy , begin medical management . PTCA could occupy intermediate position time line management multivessel disease patient relative efficiency provide relief ischemia ability avoid delay CABG know . Most center perform PTCA expand indication procedure patient multivessel disease . However , efficacy patient proven . Although data NHLBI PTCA Registry include patient multivessel disease , patient underwent single PTCA procedure even though may stenoses vessel . Hence , number question must raise concern usefulness PTCA patient multivessel disease . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , single-center . A total 198 patient randomized PTCA group 194 CABG group . As initial treatment , one patient CABG group underwent angioplasty two patient PTCA group underwent surgery , group follow accord intention-to-treat analysis . Randomization perform basis four angiographic stratum . Data collect baseline , patient contact every six month follow-up information . Coronary arteriography thallium stress scan perform one three year . All patient follow duration trial . Repeat angiographic study perform 87 percent eligible patient one year 76 percent three year . Thallium scan obtain 88 percent patient one year 77 percent three year . The primary endpoint composite death , Q-wave myocardial infarction within previous three year , detection large ischemic defect thallium scan three year . Secondary endpoint involve degree revascularization one three year , ventricular function , exercise performance , need subsequent revascularization procedure , quality life , cost . All patient admit Emory University Hospital Crawford Long Memorial Hospital cardiac catheterization , whether enter study , enter study registry patient refer revascularization procedure initial catheterization perform elsewhere . Recruitment end April 1990 . The trial extend August 1997 allow minimum eight year maximum ten year followup registry patient well main cohort randomize patient . Telephone contact establish annually study participant order determine rate survival , rehospitalization , repeat revascularization procedure , functional status . The justification long-term followup evidence CABG begin increase failure rate five ten year . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
