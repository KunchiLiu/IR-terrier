	<brief_summary>To define toxicity maximum-tolerated dose weekly oral etoposide ( VP-16 ) patient AIDS-related Kaposi 's sarcoma ; determine clinical pharmacology orally administer VP-16 AIDS patient . A secondary objective obtain preliminary data determine effect oral VP-16 Kaposi 's sarcoma . VP-16 antitumor agent . Previous problem VP-16 include route administration toxicity . VP-16 give intravenously 3 consecutive day 21-day cycle lung cancer testicular cancer . VP-16 also use lymphoma therapy . Oral VP-16 would eliminate need intravenous catheter patient could avoid pain , inconvenience , potential complication associate medication administer intravenously . The relative ease outpatient administration potentially significant antitumor activity oral VP-16 motivates study . The possibility weekly drug administration focus study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>VP-16 antitumor agent . Previous problem VP-16 include route administration toxicity . VP-16 give intravenously 3 consecutive day 21-day cycle lung cancer testicular cancer . VP-16 also use lymphoma therapy . Oral VP-16 would eliminate need intravenous catheter patient could avoid pain , inconvenience , potential complication associate medication administer intravenously . The relative ease outpatient administration potentially significant antitumor activity oral VP-16 motivates study . The possibility weekly drug administration focus study . Four patient enter dose level start level 1 . Patients enter next high dose level least two patient previous dose level complete least 3 week therapy grade 2 less maximum tolerate dose-defining toxicity . Treatment repeat weekly 52 week either grade 3 4 toxicity occurs , patient show complete response progressive disease . Patients complete response continue drug 4 additional week time complete response first document . Patients progressive disease withdrawn study . Patients partial response stable disease continue either unacceptable toxicity occur complete response progression disease reach .</detailed_description>
