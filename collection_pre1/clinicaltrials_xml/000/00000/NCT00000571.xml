	<brief_title>Trial Inspiratory Muscle Rest Exercise Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The potential importance respiratory , chiefly inspiratory-muscle , fatigue recently appreciate . If inspiratory muscle fail , ventilation tissue respiration . There theoretical reason postulate inspiratory muscle failure chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , suggestion may occur acute form exacerbation chronic form 'stability ' . There two therapeutic strategy available prevention treatment inspiratory muscle fatigue : training inspiratory muscle increase efficiency rest fatigue muscle . The former work chronic fatigue present , latter allow recovery chronic fatigue , two approach necessarily mutually exclusive . This proposal originally design test efficacy therapy alone also combination ; however , give experience pretrial period , goal scale back . Since reason believe VMR may effective IMT , trial focus VMR sham VMR . Ventilatory muscle rest apply use negative pressure ventilation suit seal patient 's hip , arm , neck . A widebore tube connect fitting suit grid chest upper abdomen transmit negative pressure chest wall pump , thereby inflate lung . The evidence chronic inspiratory muscle fatigue patient COLD reside largely several relatively poorly control study indicate nocturnal artificial ventilation , presumably rest inspiratory muscle , produce improvement daytime function blood gas . The trial produce badly need data occurrence inspiratory muscle fatigue COLD patient treatment VMR . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , blind . A total 1,231 patient metropolitan Montreal area screen . Of , 348 recruit enter four week stabilization period , 184 subsequently randomize either active sham negative pressure ventilation ( NPV ) . A five day in-hospital period use train patient ventilator use obtain baseline measure exercise capacity , lung function , respiratory symptom , quality life . Randomization stratify basis whether patient receive oxygen home . Home ventilation treatment take place follow 12-week period . Respirator use record patient log conceal meter instal unit . Patients receive four home visit physiotherapists 12-week period return hospital follow-up four twelve week post-discharge reassessment . The principal outcome measure distance meter walk six minute . Secondary outcome measure cycle exercise endurance time , severity dyspnea , quality life , arterial blood gas tension , respiratory muscle strength .</detailed_description>
