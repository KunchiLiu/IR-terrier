	<brief_summary>Osteoporosis , condition bone fragile break easily , major health problem postmenopausal woman . Research study show estrogen/progestin replacement therapy ( hormone replacement therapy , HRT ) alendronate effective prevent treat osteoporosis . However , drug work somewhat different way , combination two drug might protect woman osteoporosis good either drug alone . In study test whether HRT alendronate give together 3.5 year postmenopausal woman low bone mass great effect bone either HRT alendronate give alone . We also give every participant study calcium vitamin D supplement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low-Dose Hormone Replacement Therapy Alendronate Osteoporosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical trial estrogen/progestin replacement therapy ( HRT ) bisphosphonate , alendronate ( ALN ) , demonstrate effective causing gain bone mass prevent bone loss fracture postmenopausal woman . The FDA approve drug prevention treatment fracture , widely use clinical practice . Because approved effective , work different mechanism , many patient physician ask whether take combination , particularly case severe disease . The question ask frequently high incidence osteoporosis among woman need long-term prevention treatment often last decade . Indeed , physician use ALN HRT together without adequate scientific support assumption combination effective either give alone . Clinical trial underway test conventional dos HRT give conjugate equine estrogen ( CEE ) , 0.625 mg/day equivalent , combine ALN , 10 mg/day . However , researcher study bone-sparing effectiveness combine administration ALN low-dose continuous HRT give CEE , 0.3 mg/d , along medroxyprogesterone , 2.5 mg/d ( MP ) . This low-dose continuous HRT regimen attractive good convenience , well patient tolerance , reduce risk breast cancer safety concern associate conventional high dos . Further , recently demonstrate bone-sparing effect regimen comparable high dos . The long-term objective study test hypothesis combine therapy show great bone effect either treatment give alone . Our specific aim conduct 3.5 year , randomize , double-blind , control trial low-dose , continuous HRT combine alendronate , 10 mg/d ( ALN ) , three group ( 72 people per group ) estrogen-deprived postmenopausal woman age 60 . We give Group 1 low-dose HRT , Group 2 ALN , Group 3 low-dose HRT ALN . We give calcium vitamin D supplement people three group . The primary outcome measure spine bone mineral density ( SpBMD ) total hip bone mineral density ( HipBMD ) measure dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) . Secondary outcome measure total body bone mineral content forearm bone mineral content . In addition , perform study characterize mechanism effect regimens . These study consist measurement urinary bone resorption marker , serum bone formation marker , calcium excretion , calcium absorption , application model develop laboratory estimate compare magnitudes anabolic effect ( ) three intervention SpBMD HipBMD . We report data show agent anabolic effect bone human , mean cause increase bone mass beyond explain remodel transient bring reduction bone remodel rate . Further , research show HRT ALN affect bone different mechanism . Thus , combination may additive effect bone result bone gain beyond previously see intervention . This project provide much-needed information physicians patient benefit safety combination regimen make `` evidence-based '' decision choice intervention prevent treat osteoporosis .</detailed_description>
