	<brief_summary>To understand effect leg strengthen exercise , study effect strength train legs four group people : ( 1 ) osteoarthritis ( OA ) knee pain ; ( 2 ) OA without knee pain ; ( 3 ) OA elderly knee pain ; ( 4 ) normal elderly OA knee pain . In first three group , look whether people strength training less pain and/or slow progression x-ray sign OA 30 month people perform nonstrengthening , range-of-motion exercise . We include fourth group find whether people OA ( group 1 &amp; 2 ) response strength training healthy elderly people , whether knee pain ( group 1 &amp; 3 ) response train without joint pain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Several study confirm weak leg muscle associate osteoarthritis ( OA ) knee . Studies body composition people also show , despite weak , people OA significantly great muscle mass without OA , suggest OA may potential greatly increase strength . However , research clearly show whether exercise design improve leg strength decrease severity pain slow progression OA base radiographic ( x-ray ) analysis . To understand effect leg strengthen exercise , perform randomize clinical trial low extremity strength train use four subgroups people : ( 1 ) OA knee pain ; ( 2 ) OA without knee pain ; ( 3 ) OA knee pain ; ( 4 ) normal elderly OA knee pain . In first three group , determine whether people assigned strength train low pain score and/or slow progression radiographic change OA 30 month control perform nonstrengthening exercise ( i.e. , range-of-motion exercise ) . We include fourth group determine whether OA ( group 1 &amp; 2 ) exhibit response strength training healthy elderly people , whether knee pain ( group 1 &amp; 3 ) response train without joint pain . We also prospectively monitor change body composition bone mass , quality life , symptoms depression .</detailed_description>
