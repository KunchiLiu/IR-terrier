	<brief_title>Inhaled Beclomethasone Prevent Chronic Lung Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) , fibrotic/emphysematous lung disorder common sequela among extremely premature infant . The severity BPD , incidence , reduce surfactant therapy . BPD remain one significant contributor excessively prolong hospital stay , therefore , potentially avoidable cost . Research lead reduction BPD morbidity prove cost effective estimate 10,400 affected infant annually ( 40 percent project 26,000 survivor birthweights le 1,250 gram ) . Inflammation significant component clinical experimental model BPD subject numerous basic science investigation begin since empiric observation BPD respond favorably systemic steroid . The known side effect systemic steroid lead cautious sequential control clinical investigation , initially late treatment ( 30 day age ) , early treatment ( two week ) , early treatment ( seven day ) , even prophylaxis ( day one ) . The prophylactic clinical trial inhale steroid , start day three 21 day , logical next step sequence determine least dangerous , yet effective mean prevent treat inflammatory component BPD . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled . The premature infant randomize beclomethasone placebo day three life . Beclomethasone deliver decrease dosage , 40 5 microgram per kilogram body weight per day , four day . The primary outcome measure bronchopulmonary dysplasia 28 day age . Secondary outcome include bronchopulmonary dysplasia 36 week postmenstrual age , need systemic glucocorticoid therapy , need bronchodilator therapy , duration respiratory support , death . Clinical site include Boston Perinatal Center New England Medical Center Hospitals , Baystate Medical Center Springfield , Massachusetts , Pennsylvania Hospital Philadelphia . The Data Coordinating Center Boston University School Medicine . Support trial end April , 1999 . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
