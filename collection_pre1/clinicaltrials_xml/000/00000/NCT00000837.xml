	<detailed_description>Primary varicella infection , chickenpox , devastate HIV-infected child complication occur high rate immunocompromised host . Current passive prophylaxis measure varicella-zoster immune globulin suboptimal administration must repeat exposure child 's lifetime timely notification exposure always possible . Since Varivax license routine vaccination healthy individual , must determine whether vaccine safely administer HIV-infected child . Thirty-six child varicella zoster virus ( VZV ) -naive ( treatment group ) receive Varivax Weeks 0 12 , possible boost Week 52 patient still seronegative VZV cytomegalovirus infection .

Patients make 12-14 visit clinic . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 9/9/99 : This study reorganize two cohort ( asymptomatic symptomatic ) . In asymptomatic cohort , accrual complete 40 patient Treatment Group I 19 control group . This phase study demonstrate Varivax well tolerate 48 HIV-infected child asymptomatic disease . The symptomatic cohort include Treatment Groups II III , 30 patient . The first 10 patient Group II monitor 42 day follow first dose vaccine remain 20 accrue . Once first 10 patient Group II evaluate acceptable toxicity immunologic profile , remain 20 Group II first 10 Group III patient enrol . The first 10 Group III patient also follow acceptable toxicity immunologic response accrual remain 20 Group III patient . ]</detailed_description>
