	<brief_title>Randomized Trial Acetazolamide Uveitis-Associated Cystoid Macular Edema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uveitis , intraocular inflammatory disease , cause 10 percent visual impairment United States . Uveitis may lead many sight-threatening condition , include cataract , vitreal opacity , glaucoma , , commonly , cystoid macular edema . Reduction swell edema within retina depends movement fluid retina choroid . A number study indicate process require active transport fluid ion retinal pigment epithelium may involve carbonic anhydrase system . Current treatment uveitis-associated cystoid macular edema require use immunosuppressive anti-inflammatory agent . However , many patient either resistant intolerant therapy . Recent report suggest acetazolamide , carbonic anhydrase inhibitor use low intraocular pressure glaucoma patient , might safe effective reduce uveitis-associated cystoid macular edema . Because course ocular inflammatory disease variable , double-masked , randomize , crossover trial design test efficacy acetazolamide compare placebo treatment uveitis-associated cystoid macular edema . Randomized adult patient receive either oral acetazolamide sodium 500 mg match placebo every 12 hour first 4 week study . Children 8 year age old receive less dose base body weight . Following 4-week period , medication give , patient receive 4-week course opposite medication . Primary end point include reduction cystoid macular edema ( grade fluorescein angiography ) improvement visual acuity ( measure standardize Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study [ ETDRS ] chart ) . Laser acuity also assess secondary outcome variable . Adverse effect acetazolamide therapy monitor clinical laboratory examination . A total 40 patient recruit study . Patients see begin study baseline measurement 4 , 8 , 12 week enrollment study .</detailed_description>
