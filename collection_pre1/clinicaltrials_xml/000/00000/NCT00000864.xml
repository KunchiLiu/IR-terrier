	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety , tolerance , metabolism single-dose multiple-dose abacavir ( ABC ) HIV-exposed infant receive standard postnatal treatment zidovudine ( ZDV ) . This study also evaluate correct dosage ABC use future study . Early aggressive therapy may best chance slow disease progression infant may infect HIV mother . Early HIV suppression may significantly reduce viral level allow restoration immune system , provide improve control HIV infection . Therefore , important safety tolerance ABC combination ZDV examine potential early therapy newborn young infant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Test Safety , Tolerance , Metabolism Abacavir ( 1592U89 , ABC ) With Standard Zidovudine ( ZDV ) Therapy Newborn Infants Born HIV-1 Infected Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rationale investigation agent define safety pharmacokinetics young infant allow investigation efficacy agent combination ZDV potential early therapy newborn young infant . The rationale early aggressive therapy may best chance significantly reduce long-term progression subsequent impact HIV-1 infection vertically infected infant . Early ablation enhance suppression HIV-1 replication may significantly reduce total viral load may allow maturation , preservation , reconstruction immune function stage early infection provide improve control HIV-1 infection reduce disease progression . This study divide 3 section , follow : Part 1A single-dose study neonates 0 72 hour age . If four four patient reach minimal therapeutic level less Grade 3 toxicity , ABC dose escalate . Part 1B also single-dose study infant 21 28 day age , start dose identify Part 1A . If four four patient reach minimal therapeutic level less Grade 3 toxicity , dose escalate . Finally , Part 2 multi-dose study examine dose regimen ABC ZDV neonates 0 72 hour age . The dose regimen ABC dose define Part 1A first 3 week ( 0 3 week age ) follow dose defined Part 1B second 3 week ( 3 6 week age ) . All patient receive 6 week standard ZDV therapy . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 9/24/97 : This study divide section , follow : Part 1A single-dose study neonates 0 48 hour age . ABC dose escalation make dose identified meet toxicity guideline demonstrate minimal target area concentration curve ( AUC ) 2,000 ng-hr/ml . Part 1B similar single-dose study infant 3 7 day age escalation per part 1A . Part 1C identical single-dose study infant 21 28 day age start dose identify Part 1B . Part 2 multi-dose study examine 6-week dose regimen ABC ZDV infants 0 48 hour age . The dose regimen ABC define Part 1A first 48 hour life , dose define Part 1B Days 3 20 life , dose define Part 1C Days 21 42 life . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 7/29/98 : Enrollment Parts 1A 1B remain open ; Part 1A enroll minimum 4 patient plan , Part 1B enroll 3 additional patient . ]</detailed_description>
