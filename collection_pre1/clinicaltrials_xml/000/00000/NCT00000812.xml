	<detailed_description>A protein blood call tumor necrosis factor ( TNF-alpha ) abnormally elevated patient HIV infection may cause body produce virus . In vitro study demonstrate thalidomide reduces TNF-alpha level inhibits production HIV . However , information pharmacological immunological aspect thalidomide need . Patients randomize receive oral thalidomide match placebo ( 3:1 ) one three dose level daily 8 week . All 12 patient dose level must receive treatment least 2 week dose escalation subsequent patient occur . The MTD define dose level immediately 3 9 patient receive thalidomide experience dose-limiting toxicity . Patients follow total 16 week . PER 6/20/95 AMENDMENT : Patients cohort 1 discontinue previous 50 mg formulation thalidomide new formulation available . Those patient may either wash 4 week recommence study discontinue study .</detailed_description>
