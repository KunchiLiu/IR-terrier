	<brief_title>Studies Ocular Complications AIDS ( SOCA ) -- HPMPC Peripheral CMV Retinitis Trial ( HPCRT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CMV ( cytomegalovirus ) retinitis common intraocular infection patient AIDS estimate affect 35 percent 40 percent patient AIDS . Untreated CMV ( cytomegalovirus ) retinitis progressive disorder , end result total retinal destruction blindness . As September 1997 , drug approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment CMV ( cytomegalovirus ) retinitis ganciclovir ( Cytovene ) , foscarnet ( Foscavir ) , cidofovir ( Vistide ) . Cidofovir prolong duration effect permit intermittent administration . All systemically administer anti-CMV drug give similar fashion consist initial 2-week high-dose treatment ( induction ) control infection follow long-term low dose treatment ( maintenance ) prevent relapse . Cidofovir administer intravenous infusion weekly induction therapy every 2 week maintenance therapy . The HPCRT evaluate efficacy safety cidofovir therapy . The HPCRT multicenter , randomize , control clinical trial cidofovir treatment CMV ( cytomegalovirus ) retinitis . Patients small peripheral CMV ( cytomegalovirus ) retinitis lesion ( i.e. , risk immediate loss visual acuity ) randomize immediate treatment cidofovir defer therapy retinitis progress . Patients randomized immediate therapy receive either 1 ) low-dose cidofovir 5 mg/kg weekly induction 2 week , follow 3 mg/kg every 2 week maintenance 2 ) high-dose cidofovir 5 mg/kg weekly induction 2 week follow 5 mg/kg every 2 week maintenance . Patients whose retinitis progress give treatment accord best medical judgement , assign deferral generally treat cidofovir . Outcomes trial include retinitis progression , loss retinal area , morbidity .</detailed_description>
