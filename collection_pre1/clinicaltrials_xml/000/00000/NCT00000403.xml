	<brief_summary>This study determine whether doxycycline decrease severity rate progression osteoarthritis ( OA ) knee . Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) popular agent use treat OA , elderly woman , OA especially common , great risk develop serious side effect NSAIDs . Our study target overweight middle-aged woman OA one knee . Half 432 study participant receive treatment ( doxycycline ) half receive placebo ( inactive pill ) . Treatment doxycycline ( placebo ) last 30 month , participant researcher know receive doxycycline receive placebo end study . We look narrow joint space knee affect OA start study . Joint space narrow sign OA . We also use questionnaire evaluate participant ' symptom function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study double-blind , multicenter randomize control trial doxycycline osteoarthritis ( OA ) progression . Our previous research suggest doxycycline might help prevent slow OA development reduce breakdown cartilage joint . The target population one high risk development bilateral knee OA : overweight middle-aged woman unilateral knee OA baseline . We hypothesize doxycycline decrease severity rate progression OA . We recruit 432 study participant across six clinical center randomize treatment placebo group ( N=216/group ) . Participants receive either doxycycline ( treatment ) placebo 30 month . We use several strategy maximize compliance study medication retention participant study , include `` faintness-of-heart '' test , use outset eliminate people unlikely comply , use computerized medicine cap provide information compliance prescribe dose regimen visit . These strategy permit study personnel aim effort enhance compliance participant best benefit effort . The primary outcome variable minimum joint space width ( joint space narrowing , JSN ) medial tibiofemoral compartment knee normal baseline . In addition , examine change algofunctional index ( WOMAC ) , global arthritis activity , general health status ( SF-36 ) , use health service two treatment group .</detailed_description>

Current use investigational drug . Significant hematologic , renal , hepatic cardiovascular disease ( include mild/moderate hypertension ) serious medical condition might preclude subject 's ability participate fully project , keep clinic appointment , etc .

Charcot arthropathy . A know `` secondary '' cause OA , include acute chronic infectious OA ; crystalinduced arthritis ; systemic inflammatory connective tissue disease ( e.g. , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus ) ; osteonecrosis ; Paget 's disease ; metabolic disease , hemochromatosis , Wilson 's disease , ochronosis . Chondrocalcinosis , however , exclusion criterion . Conditions knee OA limit low extremity function mobility and/or would confound evaluation knee pain function ( e.g. , clinically significant spinal hip arthritis , painful dysfunctional foot , peripheral vascular disease , lumbar radiculopathy , stroke , etc. ) . Steroid injection either knee within past 3 month . A history photosensitivity ( sensitivity light ) adverse reaction tetracycline . Failure pas `` faintnessofheart '' test ( prerandomization compliance test ) . Prior chronic use tetracycline ( e.g. , severe acne ) . Severe OA ( Kellgren Lawrence Grade IV ) index knee .
