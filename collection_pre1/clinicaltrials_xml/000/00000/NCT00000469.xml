	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : At present time , atherosclerosis major extracranial artery brain consider cause stroke . Early intervention stroke prevention utilized anti-coagulants coumadin heparin . Results largely equivocal due diverse nature underlie pathogenesis due problem offset potential benefit . Emphasis gradually switch aspirin platelet anti-aggregant drug mount evidence micro-emboli major element transient ischemic attack . Several study examine potential benefit aspirin stroke prevention . The exact dose aspirin maximally beneficial minimal side effect completely establish . There evidence low dose aspirin effective high dos . The American College Chest Physicians ( ACCP ) make recommendation aspirin issue primary anti-thrombotic agent , dose 325 mg daily , except patient cerebrovascular disease low beneficial dose appear one gram per day . The ACCP also point risk bleed substantially great patient ischemic cerebrovascular disease venous thromboembolism high risk group require anticoagulation . It advise anticoagulant therapy need , aspirin might give 325 mg per day . Lovastatin fungal metabolite inhibits 3-hydroxy , 3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase , rate-limiting enzyme cholesterol biosynthesis human cell include liver . Inhibition pathway cause cell increase low density lipoprotein receptor number compensate , cause reduction circulate low density lipoprotein level consequent drop circulate plasma cholesterol level . The drug also raise high density lipoprotein level significantly . A favorable outcome trial major public health implication prevention control atherosclerosis complication . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , double-blind , factorial design . In multicenter study , patient assign one four drug combination group : active lovastatin/active warfarin , active lovastatin/warfarin placebo , lovastatin placebo/active warfarin , lovastatin placebo/warfarin placebo . Daily aspirin recommend everyone . Ultrasound perform screening , baseline semiannually thereafter . Lipid profile obtain screening , baseline , monthly first three month , six month , annually thereafter , beta quantification baseline . Recruitment begin tenth month trial continue one year , end September 1990 . Treatment continue 51st month . Average treatment period 2.7 year . Subjects offer dietary regimen three month prior receive drug therapy . Only individual whose lipid level fall certain point continue dietary intervention . The primary outcome measure three year change mean maximum intimal-medial thickness ( IMT ) twelve wall carotid artery . Secondary outcome include change single maximum IMT incidence major cardiovascular event . In 1995 , R03 award Mark Espeland extend analyse carotid B-mode ultrasound data August , 1998 . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
