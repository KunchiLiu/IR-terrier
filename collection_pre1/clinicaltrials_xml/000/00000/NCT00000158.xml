	<brief_summary>To evaluate laser treatment choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) randomize , control clinical trial . The Macular Photocoagulation Study ( MPS ) consist three set randomize , control clinical trial . Change best-corrected visual acuity baseline primary outcome MPS trial . Other measure vision evaluate set trial . The purpose described . Argon Study : To determine whether argon blue-green laser photocoagulation leak abnormal blood vessel choroidal neovascular membrane outside fovea ( 200 2,500 micron center foveal avascular zone [ FAZ ] ) benefit prevent delay loss central vision patient age-related ( senile ) macular degeneration ( AMD ) , presume ocular histoplasmosis ( POH ) , idiopathic neovascular membrane ( INVM ) . A separate trial conduct three underlying condition . Krypton Study : To determine whether krypton red laser photocoagulation choroidal neovascular lesion posterior border 1 199 micron center FAZ benefit prevent delay large loss visual acuity patient AMD , POH , INVM . A separate trial conduct three underlying condition . Foveal Study : To determine whether laser photocoagulation benefit prevent delay visual acuity loss patient new ( never treat ) recurrent ( previously treat laser photocoagulation ) choroidal neovascularization center FAZ . Two separate trial , one type lesion , carry .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In randomize trial conduct MPS Group , focal laser photocoagulation compare observation without treatment . Patients assign laser treatment observation equal probability . The first set MPS randomize trial , Argon Study , focus effectiveness photocoagulation argon blue-green laser eye discrete extrafoveal choroidal neovascularization . The study investigator , begin recruit patient 1979 , estimate 550 patient AMD 750 POH would require . Follow-up continue 5 year determine whether argon laser photocoagulation treatment could prevent delay visual acuity loss patient . After initiation Argon Study , new krypton red laser become available . The new wavelength offer theoretical advantage argon laser treat CNV extend inside FAZ macula . The Krypton Study design analogous Argon Study , investigation three underlying condition , except CNV closer FAZ center . The third set MPS clinical trial , Foveal Study , design determine whether laser photocoagulation effective delay prevent visual acuity loss AMD patient subfoveal CNV . Among patient assign laser treatment Foveal Study , argon laser treatment compare krypton red laser treatment lesion . The investigator originally project 350 patient would require clinical trial Foveal Study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Common Eligibility Criteria Argon , Krypton , Foveal Studies : To eligible , men woman must experience visual symptom attributable macular lesion , decrease visual acuity Amsler grid distortion , time entry study . They also must visible , welldemarcated hyperfluorescence characteristic classic choroidal neovascularization fluorescein angiography . AMD patient 50 year age old drusen visible macula least one eye . POH patient least 18 year old least one characteristic histo spot one eye . INVM patient least 18 year old evidence AMD , POH , angioid streak , high myopia , diabetic retinopathy , condition could cause neovascularization . In particular , INVM patient neither drusen great MPS Standard Photograph No . 1.1 histo spot either eye . Additional Patient Eligibility Criteria Argon Study : Each patient visible serous detachment sensory retina diffuse area leakage , discrete choroidal neovascularization outside fovea ( 2002,500 micron center FAZ ) , visual acuity 20/100 good study eye . Additional Patient Eligibility Criteria Krypton Study : All patient neovascular lesion consist neovascularization possibly blood and/or pigment extend FAZ . The posterior border CNV could extend close 1 micron FAZ center . Visual acuity study eye 20/400 well . Additional Patient Eligibility Criteria Foveal Study : Only patient AMD eligible study . Fluorescein angiography eligible eye show evidence leak choroidal neovascular membrane , part extend center FAZ , neovascular lesion consist old laser treatment scar contiguous leak neovascularization within 150 micron center FAZ . New , nevertreated subfoveal lesion less four disc area size . Recurrent lesion less six disc area size , include old treatment scar new neovascularization . Bestcorrected visual acuity well 20/40 bad 20/320 .</criteria>
