	<detailed_description>One early observation HIV epidemic demonstration HIV infection mucosal surface cell genital tract . These data suggest prim immune defense viral infected cell may important component strategy develop effective HIV vaccine . Direct immunization relevant mucosal surface vectored vaccine may stimulate mucosal immunity . The ALVAC-HIV vCP205 immunogen construct live recombinant canarypox vector good safety profile volunteer allow mucosal induction immunity . This randomized , double-blind trial evaluate safety immune response vaccination ALVAC-HIV vCP205 give 0 , 1 , 3 , 6 month . Patients randomly assign 1 7 drug administration rout follow : Group A : Intramuscular Group B : Oral Group C : Intranasal Group D : Intrarectal Group E : Intravaginal Group F : Intranasal/intramuscular Group G : Intrarectal/intramuscular Twelve patient randomize group , 8 receive experimental therapy ALVAC-HIV vCP205 4 receive control therapy ALVAC-RG vCP2058 ( rabies vaccine ) . Women preferentially enrol , goal 60 % woman ( minimum 4 woman per treatment arm ) ; woman randomize Group E. Blinding maintain respect drug assignment rather route administration , randomization . NOTE : The protocol amend add 2 boost vaccination subunit product approximately Months 9 12 suitable boost product identify . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 8/3/98 : The protocol modify include 2 booster vaccination administer 9 12 month . Patients Group A receive booster vaccination ALVAC-HIV VCP205 ALVAC-RG intranasally . Patients Groups B G boost AIDSVAX B/B vaccine ( bivalent vaccine consist MN rgp120/HIV-1 antigen GNE8 rgp120/HIV-1 antigen alum adjuvant ) Imovax diploid cell rabies vaccine ; vaccination patient give intramuscularly . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 11/19/98 : The second booster vaccination group A administer study Month 15 . ]</detailed_description>
