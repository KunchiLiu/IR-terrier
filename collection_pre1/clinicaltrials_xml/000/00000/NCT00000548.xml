	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Respiratory morbidity , particularly chronic lung disease ( CLD ) , remain major cause long-term morbidity mortality preterm infant . Although surfactant replacement decrease acute respiratory morbidity mortality , reduce incidence CLD . A number approach , include antenatal thyrotropin release hormone conjunction corticosteroid , postnatal steroid administration , well administration Vitamin E , diuretic , bronchodilator , result clinically important decrease CLD . Infants severe CLD go develop finding suggestive pulmonary hypertension cor pulmonale . There preliminary evidence preterm infant severe chronic lung disease low-dose inhaled nitric oxide may significantly attenuate disease decrease mortality . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The multi-center , control blind trial investigates hypothesis low-dose inhaled nitric oxide administer preterm infant 500 1250 gram birth weight continue require mechanical ventilation 10 day age increase survival without chronic lung disease ( CLD ) 36 week post menstrual age . Secondary outcome duration ventilation , oxygen requirement duration hospitalization . In addition , expect improvement infant respiratory status ( ventilatory support , airway resistance compliance ) associate inhaled nitric oxide treatment . Indicators inflammation oxidant stress assess measurement specific cytokine protein modification tracheal aspirate plasma sample , respectively . The safety therapy evaluate assess toxicity measure clinical bleeding , include intraventricular hemorrhage well incidence morbidity preterm infant ( necrotizing enterocolitis , retinopathy prematurity infection ) assess neurodevelopmental outcome two year age . A total 480 infant randomize either inhaled NO placebo . In summary , clinical trial ass efficacy safety inhale nitric oxide amelioration major disease premature infant .</detailed_description>
