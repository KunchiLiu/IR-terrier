	<detailed_description>Sexually transmit disease major cause neonatal eye infection . All 50 States require eye treatment birth prevent gonorrheal eye infection . Approximately 3 4 million Americans acquire genital chlamydial infection year , 150,000 infant born mother chlamydial infection . These infant high risk develop conjunctivitis pneumonia .

( Erythromycin choose tetracycline antibiotic study commonly use United States ocular prophylaxis . ) Women recruit University Washington Medical Center-associated obstetric unit . Among 2,577 woman eligible possible participation , 758 enrol . Of participant , 89 randomize . Among 669 randomized woman , 39 available personal observation . These 39 equally distribute among three prophylaxis group . In final participant group , infants 630 woman evaluable . The infant randomly assign one three group delivery room . Infants without conjunctivitis monitor 2 month delivery . Infants develop conjunctivitis monitor 2 month successful treatment infection . The study include extensive effort determine etiology conjunctivitis find nasolacrimal duct obstruction .</detailed_description>
