	<detailed_description>Infection MAC poor prognostic indicator person AIDS . Evidence suggest poor outcome simply reflection great immune impairment AIDS patient MAC infection , rather may direct indirect consequence infection mycobacterium . Survival AIDS patient MAC shorter without MAC . Studies show treatment MAC improve survival MAC infect patient nearly survival AIDS patient without MAC . Treatment MAC clarithromycin contain regimen associate decreased symptom prolong survival . There evidence , however , mycobacterial infection may enhance propagation human immunodeficiency virus mechanism may involve enhanced expression pro inflammatory cytokine . It unclear extent cytokine abnormality contribute symptom complex extent treatment MAC infection reverse cytokine abnormality . All patient diagnose MAC initiate least 2 drug clarithromycin contain MAC treatment regimen eligible participation . Blood urine obtain patient follow timepoints : Pre-Entry ( within 7 day prior study entry ) , week 4 , week 8 . Sites process ship specific sample Case Western Reserve University ( CWRU ) . Various assay analysis perform CWRU . NOTE : Patients receive treatment study , however , patient must receive least 2 drug clarithromycin contain treatment regimen MAC either part participation study prescribe subject 's health care provider .</detailed_description>
