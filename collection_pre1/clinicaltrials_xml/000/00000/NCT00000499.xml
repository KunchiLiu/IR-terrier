	<brief_title>Systolic Hypertension Elderly Program ( SHEP ) ( Pilot Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Isolated systolic hypertension , define systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg great diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg , know associated increase risk coronary heart disease stroke . The HANES I group estimate isolated systolic hypertension , uncommon 54 year age , occur 5 percent 10 percent adult 55 year less common systolic-diastolic elevation . Evidence readily available effective safe therapy correct isolate systolic hypertension . At time , body clinical research data conclusively prove therapy , available , beneficial . Several group express interest clinical trial systolic hypertension elderly . Among House Select Committee Aging , Blue-Ribbon Panel Hypertension Elderly , Citizens Treatment High Blood Pressure , panel expert associate National High Blood Pressure Education Program , National Institute Aging , National Institute Mental Health , National Institute Neurological Communicative Disorders Stroke . A Policy Data Monitoring Board appoint review protocol pilot study develop make recommendation Director NHLBI . The Policy Data Monitoring Board review accumulate data April 8 , 1983 recommend Institute full scale trial implement . The recommendation accept Director , NHLBI present National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council meeting May 1983 . A full scale trial conduct . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A randomized , double-blind design , two group fix sample size . The 551 participant randomize stratified double-blind manner either chlorthalidone matching placebo ratio 4 : l. Subjects fail reach goal blood pressure randomize second time receive one follow drug addition chlorthalidone : reserpine , hydralazine , metoprolol . Subjects placebo Step I achieve goal correspond Step II placebo add regimen .</detailed_description>
