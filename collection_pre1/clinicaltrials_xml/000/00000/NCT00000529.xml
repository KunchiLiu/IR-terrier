	<brief_summary>To assess impact tamoxifen development breast cancer , coronary heart disease , bone fracture . The National Cancer Institute initiate prevention trial National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Bowel Project ( NSABP ) . The National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute provide support obtain blood pressure lipid measurement , lipoprotein select coagulation factor measurement subsample .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tamoxifen Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Tamoxifen nominally call 'anti-estrogen ' although estrogen-agonist activity tend increase plasma endogenous estrogen level . Several study confirm decrease plasma total cholesterol LDL-cholesterol review mortality patient take tamoxifen adjuvant therapy breast cancer indicate decrease number vascular death woman tamoxifen compare agent . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Subjects randomize receive 10 mg tamoxifen two time day placebo . The primary endpoint prevention invasive breast cancer . The secondary endpoint effect fatal nonfatal cardiovascular event ( coronary heart disease , stroke , thromboembolic disease ) fracture . A total 13,388 woman increase risk breast cancer randomly assign receive either tamoxifen ( 20 milligram per day ) placebo . Cardiovascular follow-up available 13,194 woman . The median follow-up 57 month ; mean follow-up 49 month . During long-term follow-up , 76 percent tamoxifen participant compliant study therapy ; 83 percent compliant 24 month follow-up . To evaluate effect tamoxifen woman without pre-existing heart disease , 13,388 woman enrol 131 clinical site divide subgroup without self-reported history clinical coronary heart disease , define myocardial infarction angina prior randomization . Medical record subject suspect cardiovascular event collect clinical site forward NSABP Operations Center adjudication investigator blind treatment assignment . Primary cardiovascular event include fatal myocardial infarction , Q-wave myocardial infarction , non-Q-wave myocardial infarction . Secondary cardiovascular event include unstable angina ( angina require hospitalization ) severe angina ( angina require revascularization ) . All subject include analysis use intent-to-treat principle .</detailed_description>
