	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Published data Veterans Administration Cooperative Study Hypertension demonstrate reduction morbidity mortality could attain treat men fix diastolic blood pressure 105 mm Hg . Similar trend occur fixed diastolic blood pressure 90 104 mm Hg . Results current trend study support finding . However , prior inception Hypertension Detection Follow-up Program ( HDFP ) , know whether benefit antihypertensive therapy apply hypertensives general population whether make use exist medical knowledge could significantly reduce morbidity mortality hypertension community . Recognizing need , NHLBI initiate pilot activity HDFP characterize significant operational , socioeconomic , motivational factor would influence acceptance antihypertensive therapy define population within controlled clinical trial would take place obtain baseline information necessary undertaking clinical trial , determine whether practical , intensive , antihypertensive program could significantly reduce morbidity mortality hypertensives general population . The planning trial , include development protocol manual operation , begin 1971 . Between February 1973 May 1974 , 158,906 person screen high blood pressure 14 community . A total 10,940 hypertensive participant randomize . The primary hypothesis test trial intensive blood pressure control step care five year could significantly reduce mortality compare referred-care . Stepped-care method treatment HDFP clinic diuretic give initially additional antihypertensive agent add time-structured , stepwise fashion goal blood pressure achieve . Referred-care represent referral private physician community source care . Participating study 14 clinical center , coordinate center , ECG center , central laboratory , monitor laboratory . The clinical phase trial end May 1982 . The project extend 1983 order continue surveillance mortality blood pressure control . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The trial randomize , non-blind , fixed sample trial single intervention control group . The intervention group receive step care clinical trial clinic ( see Background , ) , control group refer physician . Each community contribute stepped-care referred-care participant , analysis purpose , group pool two group . The primary endpoint mortality . The effect stepped- vs. referred-care also assess intermediate secondary factor , include nosologic code specific cause mortality , nonfatal myocardial infarction , stroke , hypertensive heart disease , EKG abnormality .</detailed_description>
