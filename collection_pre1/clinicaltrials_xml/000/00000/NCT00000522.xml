	<brief_title>Treatment Mild Hypertension Study ( TOMHS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Dietary sodium reduction mild effect reduction hypertension . Weight loss , achievable short-run diet alone , may also mild effect hypertension difficult maintain diet and/or behavior modification . Alteration patient ' lifestyle decrease excessive alcohol intake somewhat controversial . Medications , hand , clear benefit term blood pressure lowering , case diuretic beta-blockers , reduction cardiovascular morbidity mortality . However , concern justify use mild hypertension since one side effect , may long-term implication , alteration serum lipid . Newer class drug -- calcium antagonist , angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor , alpha blocker -- previously compare long-term diuretic beta-blockers . DESIGN NARRATIVE : TOMHS I enrol 902 men woman determine feasibility large trial . Participants randomize double-blind manner one six treatment group within two stratum . Stratum I participants antihypertensive drug Stratum II antihypertensive drug initial screening . There six treatment arm : placebo , diuretic ( chlorthalidone ) , beta-adrenergic blocking agent ( acebutolol ) , alpha blocker ( doxazosin mesylate ) , calcium antagonist ( amlodipine maleate ) , angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( enalapril maleate ) . All participant receive lifestyle intervention program include reduction sodium chloride alcohol intake well weight reduction increase physical activity . All participant follow least 48 month , average 54 month . The primary endpoint lower blood pressure . The treatment also compare effect blood chemistry include lipoprotein , echocardiographic leave ventricular mass , ventricular ectopic activity ST-T change ischemia measure ambulatory ECG monitoring , side effect , quality life . Randomization take place October 1986 March 1988 . Active follow-up end March-April 1992 . Data analysis end May 1994 .</detailed_description>
