	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effect HIV vaccine ( Remune ) immune system . This study involve patient receive least 60 week anti-HIV therapy , either alone combination IL-2 , enrol ACTG 328 . Remune experimental HIV vaccine . To see body 's immune system reacts , vaccine give 1 3 vaccine , skin test monitor body 's reaction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Test If Giving Remune ( HIV Vaccine ) Can Improve Immune Systems HIV-Positive Patients Who Are Also Participating ACTG 328</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Proliferative response HIV antigens either absent small magnitude HIV-infected patient , even early stage infection vigorous proliferative response recall antigen still see . Remune consist inactivate , gp120-depleted virus intend stimulate HIV-specific immune response . Remune report increase lymphocyte proliferative response HIV antigens patient high CD4 cell count . Many T-cell-dependent response also impair HIV-infected patient , vaccination hepatitis A B vaccine . In study , patient moderately advanced HIV disease already receive 52 week either HAART HAART plus IL-2 vaccinate Remune control recall immunogen , tetanus toxoid ( TT ) , evaluate whether patient develop new CD4 T-cell CD8 T-cell responses HIV-related antigen . The antibody response hepatitis A hepatitis B vaccination also explore . Fifty patient enrol substudy ; 17 HAART arm ( Arm I ACTG 328 ) 33 HAART plus either CIV subcutaneous IL-2 arm ( Arms II III ACTG 328 ) . All patient vaccinate 3 time Remune twice TT . If patient hepatitis A total antibody negative , receive hepatitis A vaccine twice . Additionally , patient hepatitis B surface antigen negative , hepatitis B core antibody surface antibody negative , receive hepatitis B vaccine 3 time . Patients negative hepatitis marker receive hepatitis A B vaccine . Week 0 A5046s begin Week 64 ACTG 328 ( patient HAART-only arm ) 4 week initiation seventh subsequent IL-2 cycle ACTG 328 ( patient IL-2-containing arm ) . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 9/16/99 : Patients screen Week 124 ACTG 328 . ] Patients receive Remune Weeks 0 , 8 , 16 TT Weeks 0 8 . Hepatitis A and/or B vaccine also give time , indicate . Blood skin test perform Weeks 0 , 8 , 16 , 24 measure immune response lymphocyte proliferative response .</detailed_description>
