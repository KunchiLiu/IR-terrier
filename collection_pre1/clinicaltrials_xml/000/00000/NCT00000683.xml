	<brief_summary>Evaluation safety immunogenicity ( immunological reactivity ) HIVAC-1e vaccine . An additional goal determine dose level vaccine might effective . Specific question address part study include : Are adverse reaction gp160 vaccine give vaccinee previously immunize vaccinia-recombinant ? Does gp160 vaccination prior HIVAC-1e vaccine result stimulation neutralize antibody humoral immune response ? Does vaccination gp160 enhance development cell-mediated immune response HIVAC-1e vaccinee ? Is magnitude immune response gp160 booster immunization great follow prim GP160 recombinant vaccinia ( HIVAC-1e ) vaccination prim three dos purify recombinant gp160 ? AMENDED : An 80 mcg dose gp160 choose booster dose show safe immunogenic previous trial allow comparison late boost protocol late boost protocol patient prim three dos gp160 . Original design : HIVAC-1e vaccine preparation envelope protein HIV ( virus cause AIDS ) . The protein produce genetic modification vaccinia virus . The purpose vaccine produce artificially increase immunity particular disease , case , AIDS . Since know cure AIDS , control disease necessitate development effective prevention vaccine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>AMENDED : An 80 mcg dose gp160 choose booster dose show safe immunogenic previous trial allow comparison late boost protocol late boost protocol patient prim three dos gp160 . Original design : HIVAC-1e vaccine preparation envelope protein HIV ( virus cause AIDS ) . The protein produce genetic modification vaccinia virus . The purpose vaccine produce artificially increase immunity particular disease , case , AIDS . Since know cure AIDS , control disease necessitate development effective prevention vaccine . AMENDED : Participants amend study give one injection deltoid muscle gp160 vaccine . The injection gp160 give 2 month first take HIVAC-1e vaccine . After inoculation , volunteer observe one hour . For four day inoculation , participant interview daily monitor side effect ask record temperature symptom twice daily . It anticipate cohort approximately 20 HIVAC-1e recipient participate AIDS Vaccine Evaluation Units agree receive booster immunization gp160 , number patient adequate determine booster effect gp160 . Original design : Study patient receive two immunization , one beginning study second one eight week later . These immunization administer scarification arm , way smallpox vaccine give several year . The patient divide two group . The control group receive derivative smallpox vaccine use produce HIVAC-1e vaccine . The treatment group actually receive HIVAC-1e . Whether patient receive parent virus vaccine determine randomly computer , neither patient physician know actually receive vaccine . The group receive parent virus group receive HIVAC-1e divide three subgroup receive different dos HIVAC-1e , order test effectiveness different dose HIVAC-1e . Following first inoculation booster inoculation eight week later , patient vaccination site cover special waterproof bandage vaccination site heal . Participants counsel avoid contact spread vaccine virus include hand washing , management bandage , separation person high risk complication virus infection . Patients closely follow first four week follow immunization follow minimum one year . Women include willing provide continue information sexual practice menstrual pattern , furnish urine sample , appropriate , pregnancy test day of/before vaccination every week throughout 56th day receipt vaccine . At Johns Hopkins site , patient compensate depend far travel long commit every-other-day visit first 30 day . This change bandage check heal . Interested patient call collect additional information travel pay .</detailed_description>
