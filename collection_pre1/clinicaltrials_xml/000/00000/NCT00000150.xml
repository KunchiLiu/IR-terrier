	<brief_summary>To determine whether surgical removal subfoveal choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) associate hemorrhage patient age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) , ocular histoplasmosis syndrome ( OHS ) , idiopathic CNV stabilize improve vision often observation . To determine surgical removal compare observation subfoveal CNV due AMD , OHS , idiopathic cause change patient 's perception health- vision-related `` quality life , '' measure telephone interview use Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form-36 ( MOS SF-36 ) instrument , Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale , National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire ( NEI VFQ-25 ) . To determine whether randomized trial surgery warrant patient subfoveal CNV associate age-related macular degeneration suitable laser treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) CNV common cause irreversible severe loss vision old adult . The Macular Photocoagulation Study ( MPS ) Group , sponsor National Eye Institute , demonstrate laser treatment effective recurrent subfoveal CNV ( extend center macula ) laser treatment select patient subfoveal CNV prior treatment . More recently , photodynamic therapy verteporfin show reduce risk moderate server loss vision select patient subfoveal neovascularization associate AMD . Choroidal neovascularization due OHS affect adult work age may pose lifelong risk blindness people characteristic scar ( `` histo spot '' ) macula . It estimate 2,000,000 people live lived region United States histoplasmosis endemic characteristic histo spot 100,000 lose vision one eye due CNV . Fortunately , effectiveness laser photocoagulation treat CNV due OHS subfoveal ( i.e. , extend center macula ) also demonstrate MPS Group two randomize clinical trial . However , treat patient risk subfoveal recurrence , laser treatment apply patient patient OHS present subfoveal CNV absence prior laser treatment . Recently , alternative therapy laser photocoagulation photodynamic therapy propose management CNV intend increase chance stabilize improve vision great rate observation . The promise alternative time surgical removal neovascular lesion , i.e. , submacular surgery . The rationale surgical approach removal CNV may halt enlargement visual defect , spare photoreceptors central macula , allow adjacent ocular structure function normally . Data regard effectiveness approach limit report case series suffer absence untreated control , limited number case evaluate , lack long term follow-up assess impact recurrent CNV , delay atrophy outer retina , adverse outcome cataract retinal detachment , require additional treatment . The Submacular Surgery Trials comprise set multicenter , randomize clinical trial goal determine whether surgical removal subfoveal CNV stabilize improve vision often observation . A total 19 clinical center collaborate conduct clinical trial patient neovascular OHS idiopathic CNV ( Group H protocol ) . The target sample size Group H protocol 250 participant enrol follow 4 year . A total 29 clinical center collaborate conduct two additional clinical trial patient neovascular AMD . The target sample size AMD trial 960 participant enrol follow 4 year . Vision data collect baseline include protocol refraction , best-corrected logMAR visual acuity ( ETDRS chart ) , contrast threshold ( Pelli-Robson chart ) , read speed ( enlarged text ) . Other baseline data record include stereoscopic color fundus photograph , fluorescein angiogram , lens photograph , well health- vision-related quality life interview data ( telephone ) . Eligible patient give sign , inform consent randomly assign surgery ( within 8 day randomization ) observation . Patients , assign surgery , see one month post-surgery examination photograph . All participant examine 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 month randomization collect vision data ( collect mask fashion 24 48 month randomization ) repeat photography . Quality life telephone interview repeat 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 month randomization . The primary outcome improvement visual acuity baseline two-year examination retention baseline visual acuity two-year examination . Secondary outcome include change quality life baseline 2- 4-year examination , change visual acuity 4 year , large loss visual acuity , adverse ocular outcome ( e.g. , require additional treatment cataract , retinal detachment , recurrent CNV ) .</detailed_description>
