	<brief_title>Prevention Coronary Aneurysms Kawasaki Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Kawasaki Syndrome acute febrile illness occur predominantly previously healthy young child . It unknown etiology first describe Japan 1967 . The illness carry acute mortality rate approximately 3 percent . The Centers Disease Control define Kawasaki Syndrome fever last five day explanation find . Patients also must least four follow symptom : bilateral conjunctival infection ; infect fissure lip , pharynx , 'strawberry tongue ' ; erythema palm sol , edema hand foot , generalize periungual desquamation ; rash ; cervical lymphadenopathy . Coronary artery aneurysm occur 15-20 percent child illness . In past , treatment show effective preventing complication . Investigators Japan begin use IVGG reduce aneurysm formation . Preliminary result show usefulness therapy lead multicenter trial Japan 400 mg/kg/day IVGG give five day child also receive aspirin condition . Results Japanese trial show within 29 day onset disease , coronary artery dilatation develop 42 percent aspirin-treated child 15 percent IVGG aspirin-treated child . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Phase I randomize , unblinded stratified age , sex , center . Subjects randomize receive either 80 120 mg/kg/day aspirin day 14 illness , subsequently reduce 3 5 mg/kg/day single daily dose 400 mg/kg/day intravenous gamma globulin four consecutive day plus aspirin . Primary endpoint formation aneurysms demonstrate echocardiogram . Follow-up 7 week . Phase II trial begin enrollment 549 patient May 1986 end enrollment November 1989 . Two hundred seventy six child randomize receive 400 mg/kg intravenous gamma globulin four consecutive day . Two hundred seventy-three received single infusion 2 g/kg body weight 10 hour . Both treatment group receive 100 mg/kg aspirin per day day 14 3 5 mg/kg per day . The primary outcome variable presence absence coronary artery abnormality evident two week seven week follow-up examination . Echocardiograms obtain 523 child two week visit 520 child seven week visit .</detailed_description>
