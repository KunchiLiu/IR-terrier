	<brief_summary>To evaluate therapeutic intervention patient choroidal melanoma , common primary eye cancer affect adult , assess potential life-preserving well sight-preserving role radiation therapy . To determine two standard treatment , removal eye brachytherapy , likely prolong survival eligible patient medium-sized choroidal melanoma . To determine whether preoperative radiation prolongs life patient whose eye large choroidal melanoma enucleate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For 100 year , removal eye ( enucleation ) standard treatment choroidal melanoma . Before COMS initiated 1986 , interest radiation therapy increase potential saving eye perhaps vision . However , merit radiation respect prolong patient survival unknown . The best data nonrandomized study suggest difference length remain life patient treated radiation whose eye enucleate . Thus , appropriate necessary conduct randomize , control clinical trial large number patient would follow many year order compare enucleation radiation respect relative success prolong survival choroidal melanoma patient . The Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study ( COMS ) set long-term , multicenter , randomize controlled trial . In trial patient tumor medium size , enucleation irradiation iodine-125 episcleral plaque compare basis length remain life . All randomize patient follow 5 15 year death . For patient randomly assign enucleation , eye remove follow standard procedure . For patient assign plaque irradiation , margin tumor locate dimension tumor measure ophthalmic surgeon . A gold plaque plastic seed carrier contain proper dosage configuration radioactive iodine seed suture outside ( sclera ) eye base tumor . This procedure make possible delivery high dose radiation localize area ( 85 Gy [ TG-43 ] tumor apex ) . The plaque typically remove eye three seven day . Enrollment complete trial July 1998 1,317 patient enrol . Clinical follow-up patient end July 2003 . In COMS trial preoperative radiation , patient large tumor randomize enucleation alone enucleation precede 20 Gy external beam radiation . The two randomly assign group patient follow least five year death compare basis length remain life outcome . Enrollment trial complete December 1994 , 1,003 patient enrol . Clinical follow-up patient trial end July 2000 . Accrual nonrandomized pilot study assess feasibility randomize trial small tumor halt 1989 . Additional followup 204 patient carry 1994 1996 . The COMS conduct 43 clinical center locate major population area United States Canada . Six resource center participate major role quality assurance study . Information gather analyzed include time death cause , time death cancer ( whether metastatic choroidal melanoma ) , diagnosis tumor , complication radiation , change visual acuity . A parallel study quality life patient enrol trial radioactive plaque initiate January 1995 . From November 1986 July 1998 , 8,712 patient choroidal melanoma size screen eligibility COMS clinical trial .</detailed_description>
