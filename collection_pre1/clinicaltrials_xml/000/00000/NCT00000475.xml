	<brief_title>Prevention Early Readmission Elderly Congestive Heart Failure Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The prevalence congestive heart failure increase progressively advancing age , congestive heart failure major cause mortality , morbidity , diminish quality life elderly . Not congestive heart failure common cardiovascular indication hospitalization patient 65 year old , frequent repetitive hospitalization , occur 30-50 percent patient within three six month initial discharge , create impose cost burden care patient . A pilot study conduct grantee institution show elderly congestive heart failure patient risk early readmission identify time initial hospitalization , 50 percent readmission potentially preventable , non-pharmacologic treatment strategy consist patient education , medication analysis , discharge planning , enhance follow-up feasible may reduce readmission 30 50 percent . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In feasibility study , patient randomly assign receive intervention standard care four year period . Patients stratify readmission risk category high moderate base presence four independent risk factor readmission define prior study Jewish Hospital St. Louis . The risk factor include : four prior hospitalization within precede five-year interval , previous history congestive heart failure , hypocholesterolemia , right bundle-branch block admit electrocardiogram . The study intervention consist individualized patient education use teach material specifically design study ; careful review medication specific recommendation design eliminate unnecessary drug , decrease number dose interval , improve compliance , minimize side effect ; early discharge planning ; enhance post-discharge follow-up . The primary endpoint rehospitalization within 90 day initial hospital discharge cumulative number day hospitalize follow-up . Principal secondary endpoint include analysis effect study intervention compliance prescribed medication , dietary sodium intake , incidence adverse drug reaction , patient knowledge understand congestive heart failure , patient-assessed quality life , overall cost medical care . In full-scale trial , 140 patient assign control group receive standard treatment service order physician . A total 142 patient assigned treatment group receive intensive education congestive heart failure treatment experience cardiovascular research nurse , use teach booklet develop study investigator geriatric patient heart failure . Treatment group patient also receive individualized dietary assessment instruction give registered dietitian ; consultation social-service personnel facilitate discharge planning care discharge ; analysis medication geriatric cardiologist make specific recommendation eliminate unnecessary medication simplify overall regimen ; intensive follow-up discharge . The goal follow-up reinforce patient 's education , ensure compliance medication diet , identify recurrent symptom amenable treatment outpatient basis . The primary outcome measure survival 90 day without hospital readmission . Secondary endpoint include number readmission cause , number readmission congestive heart failure , cumulative number day hospitalization follow-up , quality-of-life score , overall cost medical care . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
