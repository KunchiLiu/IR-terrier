	<brief_title>Cholesterol-Lowering Atherosclerosis Study ( CLAS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial Coronary Drug Project show morbidity mortality ischemic heart disease reduce blood cholesterol-lowering therapy . Although blood cholesterol reduction ameliorate experimental atherosclerosis animal model , two large human study angiographic observation arterial lesion change , NHLBI Type II Coronary Intervention Study study Cohn et al , demonstrate significant treatment effect . Favorable , inconclusive , treatment trend observe four unrandomized angiographic trial one trial small evaluation randomize group . The clinical trial support subproject within program project grant . DESIGN NARRATIVE : CLAS-I randomized selectively-blinded . Screening trial consist five clinic visit , baseline data , include angiographic data , obtain prerandomization trial study drug conduct . One hundred eighty-eighty subject randomize either 30 gram ( g ) colestipol hydrochloride plus 3 12 g niacin daily placebo . Both group receive diet intervention . The drug group receive less 125 milligram ( mg ) cholesterol daily , 22 percent energy fat , 10 percent polyunsaturated fat , 4 percent saturate fat . The placebo group receive less 250 mg cholesterol per day , 26 percent energy fat , 10 percent polyunsaturated fat , 5 percent saturate fat . The different diet composition drug placebo group enhance differential blood cholesterol responses two group . Study subject clinic staff blind prerandomization study drug trial lipid response . Subjects blind treatment assignment . Subjects staff blind on-trial lipid value . The primary endpoint , global change score , change atherosclerosis observe angiography native coronary artery aorta coronary bypass graft . Evaluation study end-points perform staff consultant blind treatment group assignment , well temporal order angiographic data . Subjects see monthly first six month two-month interval . A repeat angiogram perform two year . Of 188 randomized subject , 162 complete study . On completion CLAS-I , participant require bypass surgery invite continue CLAS-II additional two year previously assign treatment . Blinded study method maintain ; crossover treatment . One hundred thirty-eight subject continue CLAS-II ; 103 complete third angiogram CLAS-I outcome know CLAS-II terminate . The CLAS-II clinical procedure , lipid , lipoprotein-cholesterol , apolipoprotein analyse CLAS-I . The CLAS-II angiographic file evaluation procedure exactly replicate CLAS-I . The study completion date list record obtain Query/View/Report ( QVR ) System .</detailed_description>
