	<brief_summary>The purpose study see HIV-positive patient take anti-HIV drug viral load ( level HIV blood ) 1,500 copies/ml respond GM-CSF ( granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ) . GM-CSF medication test HIV-positive patient see improve immune system low level HIV blood . GM-CSF often give patient leukemia patient receive bone marrow transplant increase white blood cell improve immune system . Doctors believe GM-CSF increase CD4 count HIV-positive patient , study also look GM-CSF affect viral load .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effectiveness GM-CSF HIV-Positive Patients Who Are Also Receiving Anti-HIV Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GM-CSF promote differentiation activation granulocyte , monocyte , macrophage , dendritic cell enhance function cell . The various cellular response ( i.e. , division , maturation , activation ) induce GM-CSF bind specific receptor express surface target cell . At high dos , dose use protocol , GM-CSF may result rapid rise white blood cell count . However , research necessary determine potential antiviral effect GM-CSF potent ART-treated population . It hop GM-CSF decrease extent ongoing HIV replication via alteration macrophage activation chemokine receptor expression effect result reduction pool latently infect T cell . Patients stratify study entry accord screen CD4 count ( 200 cells/mm3 versus 200 cells/mm3 high ) screen HIV-1 RNA copy number ( 1,500 10,000 versus 10,000 copies/ml high ) . Then , patient randomize receive GM-CSF GM-CSF placebo subcutaneously 3 time per week 16 week . All patient remain current stable potent ART ( provide study ) . During Step 2 , patient receive open-label study treatment , consist current potent ART plus GM-CSF subcutaneously 3 time per week 32 additional week . HIV-1 RNA , CD4 count , clinical safety parameter monitor patient periodically Week 52 . Patients experience increase HIV-1 RNA great 1 log 10 baseline 2 consecutive determination great 50 % decrease CD4 count baseline ( drop least 50 cell ) 2 consecutive determination time Step 1 2 must discontinue study treatment . Patients discontinue study treatment reason prior Week 16 continue follow study visit schedule Week 16 . Additional laboratory sample perform patient participate immunology substudy ( ACTG A5042s ) order evaluate effect GM-CSF immune function .</detailed_description>
