	<brief_title>Ganciclovir Implant Study Cytomegalovirus Retinitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CMV retinitis occur 20 30 percent patient AIDS lead cause visual loss patient . At present , ganciclovir foscarnet drug approve U.S. Food Drug Administration treatment CMV retinitis . The therapeutic regimen drug consist 2-week induction period follow daily maintenance intravenous infusion . Unfortunately , CMV retinitis usually progress despite daily maintenance therapy , drug associate significant systemic toxicity often limit therapeutic usefulness . As alternative intravenous administration , direct intravitreal injection ganciclovir study show effective delay progression CMV retinitis . The short half-life drug , however , necessitate one two intraocular injection week maintain therapeutic level . Widespread adoption technique limit logistical difficulty inherent risk associate numerous intravitreal injection . A drug delivery system capable continuous delivery ganciclovir vitreous cavity develop . The device consist 6-mg pellet ganciclovir coat series polymer variable permeability ganciclovir . The device surgically implanted par plana . Thirty eye 26 patient unilateral non-sight-threatening CMV retinitis randomly assign one two group : ( 1 ) immediate therapy device design release ganciclovir vitreous cavity approximately 4-month period ( 2 ) defer treatment . In patient bilateral non-sight-threatening CMV retinitis , one eye randomly assign receive ganciclovir implant eye assign deferred treatment . ( Note : The original trial design include third randomized arm use 2 ug/hour device . This arm drop logistical reason enrol two patient . ) Patients assigned immediate treatment underwent surgery implant ganciclovir device within 48 hour enrollment baseline photograph . Postoperatively , patient evaluate next day , weekly 2 week , every 2 week progression CMV retinitis occur . At examination , eye , visual acuity current correction best correction determine use Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study eye chart ; intraocular pressure determine ; evidence inflammation cataract evaluate ; retinal finding document . Any adverse event consider even possibly related device implantation procedure document . Standardized nine-field fundus photograph take 2-week visit . The ganciclovir implant exchange 32 week early progression CMV retinitis occur . The primary end point time CMV retinitis progression , defined time ( day ) initiate therapy advancement 750-um 750 um front border lesion observe . Standardized nine-field photograph take 2-week interval analyze masked fashion Fundus Photograph Reading Center determine evidence CMV retinitis progression . Secondary end point include time development CMV retinitis contralateral eye , time development visceral CMV , time death .</detailed_description>
