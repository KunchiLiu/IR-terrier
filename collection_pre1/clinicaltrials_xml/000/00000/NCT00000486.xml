	<brief_title>Unstable Angina Pectoris Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Angina pectoris symptomatic condition attack chest pain , often debilitate . It cause decreased supply blood heart , might occur coronary artery disease . The usual treatment angina pectoris design relieve symptom . It include avoidance activity produce discomfort use nitroglycerin beta block drug . Soon introduction coronary bypass surgery , many doctor enthusiastically adopt approach treat patient unstable angina . In 1972 , emphasize definitive evidence show superiority intensive medical management coronary bypass surgery determine mortality morbidity patient hospitalize unstable angina , participate group NHLBI Myocardial Infarction Research Units develop cooperative clinical trial compare medical surgical approach therapy . From 1972 1976 , 288 patient enter randomized clinical trial . One hundred forty-seven patient receive intensive pharmacological medical therapy , 141 comparable patient underwent coronary artery bypass surgery . Careful follow-up study perform patient group , in-hospital post-hospital phase . These study include , apart routine physical examination , rest electrocardiogram , chest x-ray film , grade exercise tolerance test six month twelve month . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , non-blind , sequential design control group experimental group . The patient experimental group treat coronary bypass surgery . Patients control group receive intensive medical management . Endpoints mortality morbidity measure , incidence myocardial infarction persistence angina .</detailed_description>
