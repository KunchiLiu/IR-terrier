	<brief_title>Safety Effectiveness Azidothymidine ( AZT ) HIV-Positive Patients With Hemophilia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There clear risk development AIDS hemophilic patient . AZT administration show inhibit HIV replication vitro . Patients take AZT experience few opportunistic infection improvement measure immunity . The common laboratory abnormality observe AZT hematologic . However , clinical laboratory toxicity AZT remain poorly understood hemophiliac . Hepatitis liver dysfunction common population compare group risk HIV infection . Because AZT largely metabolize liver , drug pharmacokinetics need evaluate patient population . Both hemophiliacs non-hemophiliacs take AZT period 12 week . The first dose administer intravenously . AZT give orally every 4 hour awake ( 5 dos per day ) . Patients evaluate physical examination laboratory assessment . These include HIV culture blood leukocyte count , lymphocyte count , lymphocyte subset measure study entry every 4 week thereafter . Patients hospitalize pharmacokinetic study study entry Weeks 6 12 . Each study involve intravenous oral administration within 48 hour one another . Blood sample 0 , 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 hour administration urine collect every 2 hour 12 hour .</detailed_description>
