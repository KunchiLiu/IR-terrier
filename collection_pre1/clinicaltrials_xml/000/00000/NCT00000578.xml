	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Asthma one common illnesses complicates pregnancy . Asthma complicate least 4 percent pregnancy ; however , least 10 percent population appear nonspecific airway hyper-responsiveness , true prevalence may much high . Asthma produce serious maternal fetal complication . A number investigator report increased incidence pre-eclampsia , gestational hypertension , hyperemesis gravidarum , vaginal hemorrhage , toxemia , induce complicate labor . Fetal complication include increase risk perinatal mortality , prematurity , low birth weight , neonatal hypoxia . In contrast , several study fail confirm previous observation . Patients severe asthma may greatest risk complication pregnancy , addition risk maternal morbidity asthma . For example , show reduced pulmonary function asthmatic woman associate increase likelihood intrauterine growth retardation . On hand , study asthma successfully control result pregnancy outcome similar general population . The mechanisms asthma may adverse perinatal effect well know . Poor control asthma lead chronic episodic fetal hypoxia think important . Medications use asthma treatment may also play role , although limited data suggest minimal effect . In addition , possible extrapulmonary autonomic nervous system abnormality , uterine muscle hyperreactivity , could contribute pre-term delivery gestational hypertension independent asthma control therapy . Unfortunately , previous study limit relatively small number . Few study control factor know affect infant birth weight , maternal race , height , weight , parity , nutrition , cigarette smoking . Particularly , race may important contribute factor assess relationship asthma pregnancy outcome , since Blacks sex twice likely hospitalize asthma three time likely die asthma white . Under auspex National Asthma Education Program ( NAEP ) , Working Group Asthma Pregnancy develop statement regard treatment asthma pregnancy . In deliberation , Working Group note paucity data relative contribution biological , social , environmental factor asthma pregnant woman , well lack data efficacy safety commonly use asthma therapy pregnancy . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The Asthma Pregnancy Study evaluate relationship maternal asthma severity control . The primary objective determine frequency preterm delivery &lt; 32 week among moderate severe asthmatic compare non-asthmatic control . The incidence small-for-gestational-age infant woman mild moderate asthma secondary outcome . Other independent variable include type medication use , race , socioeconomic status , height , weight , parity , nutrition , smoking , substance abuse , prenatal care . Secondary outcome include birth weight prematurity , maternal pre-eclampsia , gestational hypertension , asthma morbidity . The study begin February 1,1995 patient recruitment continue 46 month less . The Asthma Therapy Pregnancy Trial randomize , double-blind , control clinical trial begin recruitment November , 1996 , enrollment last 44 month . Patients randomize receive either active oral theophylline placebo beclomethasone inhaler active beclomethasone inhaler placebo oral theophylline . Albuterol use relief symptom . The primary outcome measure incidence Emergency Department visit hospitalization pregnancy . Secondary outcome measure include birth weight , incidence small-for-gestational-age infant , gestational hypertension , pre-eclampsia , lung function , daily peak flow , quality life . Patients see monthly measurement fetal growth , morbidity , lung function . Extensive interview conduct patient first prenatal visit , third trimester , shortly birth . The study completion date list record obtain `` Completed Date '' enter Query View Report System ( QVR ) .</detailed_description>
