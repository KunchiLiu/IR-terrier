	<brief_title>Boston Area Anticoagulation Trial Atrial Fibrillation ( BAATAF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The efficacy oral anticoagulation therapy reduce risk embolic stroke patient atrial fibrillation rheumatic heart disease well know . The value anticoagulant therapy patient atrial fibrillation without rheumatic heart disease establish . Several study strongly suggest although risk stroke patient atrial fibrillation great presence valvular disease , risk stroke absence valvular disease also much great patient atrial fibrillation without arrhythmia . What lack detail control study assess degree reduction stroke risk anticoagulation fibrillate patient without valvular disease . The second question ask whether add potential morbidity mortality associate long-term anticoagulation therapy justify use prophylactic treatment neurologically asymptomatic patient atrial fibrillation , even reduce stroke risk . Gastrointestinal , urinary tract , cutaneous joint hemorrhage potential serious complication , cerebral hemorrhage , include bleed area recent cerebral infarction . Interest focus hemorrhagic complication stroke anticoagulated patient among risk factor hemorrhage large , recent infarct . No one suggest anticoagulation , even successful reduce stroke risk , would eliminate altogether , thus hemorrhagic infarction important potential problem , assessment risk primary intracerebral hemorrhage . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized non-blind . Recruitment begin September 1985 end June 1989 . The experimental group 212 patient receive long-term , low-dose warfarin . The control group 208 patient receive warfarin could choose take aspirin . Average follow-up 2.2 year . The primary endpoint non-hemorrhage stroke . At entry annually , history record patient underwent physical examination focus neurologic factor . Every year , begin six month , patient send questionnaire neurologic symptom , bleed episode , medical condition . Study nurse contact patient review response . Each patient 's refer physician contact three month nine month year follow-up . Participating institution multicenter trial organize three group . At Group I institution , on-site investigator perform clinical evaluation . In Group II , personnel central site hospital , Massachusetts General Hospital , travel local hospital evaluate , randomize , follow patient . Group III institution refer patient directly Massachusetts General Hospital procedure .</detailed_description>
