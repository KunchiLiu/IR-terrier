	<brief_title>Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial Prevention Coronary Heart Disease ( MRFIT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Research finding prospective epidemiological study number population United States past 40 year convincingly establish elevate blood cholesterol , elevate blood pressure , cigarette smoking risk factor associate accelerated development myocardial infarction , sudden death , death coronary heart disease . These risk factor associate premature development CHD , factor modifiable provide strong expectation reduction factor beneficial result reduce rate development premature heart attack . A multifactor approach risk factor reduction closely resemble type intervention would carry physician treatment patient . The general concept trial endorse Arteriosclerosis Task Force 1970 report Institute . Volunteers select trial series three screen visit , begin November 1973 complete February 28 , 1976 . From among 361,662 men see first screen , 12,866 find eligible randomized trial . Half participant assign special intervention group half usual care group . The special intervention group advise follow eating pattern design result nutrient intake 30 percent 35 percent calorie fat , 10 ( later 8 ) percent saturate 10 percent polyunsaturated fat ; approximately 300 ( later 250 ) mg cholesterol ; modification carbohydrates need individual requirement . This group also encourage cease cigarette smoke combination technique , include counsel audio-visual aid . Hypertension management base stepped-care program weight reduction drug similar use Hypertension Detection Follow-up Program . Those usual care group refer personal physician source care management risk factor consider appropriate provider . The primary endpoint death due coronary heart disease . Men special intervention usual care group return assessment change risk factor level annually . A medical history take physical examination perform . An electrocardiogram also obtain centralized reading identify non-fatal myocardial infarction additional endpoint . Participating study 22 clinical center across United States , coordinate center , central laboratory , two ECG reading center , lipid standardization laboratory , well drug distribution center . The trial conclude , main mortality result publish September l982 . Active follow-up terminate schedule February 28 , l982 , final determination vital status date accomplish 99.6 percent study population . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A randomized , non-blind design two group fix sample size . The experimental group underwent modified-fat diet , antihypertensive therapy , education relate lifestyle smoking . Those control group refer physician treatment . Post-trial mortality surveillance 12,300 participant still live end active intervention February 1982 continue June 1998 grant support ( R01HL43232 ) . Use National Death Index mortality surveillance 361,662 men screen MRFIT continue thorough July 1998 grant support ( R01HL28715 ) . Recent analysis focus relationship dietary factor , sodium , trial post-trial mortality . Papers progress predictor diabetes mellitus ; indicator cardiovascular disease morbidity risk death ; prognostic importance change index leave ventricular hypertrophy ischemia .</detailed_description>
