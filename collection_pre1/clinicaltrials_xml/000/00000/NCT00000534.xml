	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : A considerable body data associate low blood pressure high level dietary calcium . Epidemiologic study , laboratory evaluation , clinical trial also indicate incidence hypertensive disorder pregnancy affect similarly calcium intake . A meta-analysis five control clinical trial calcium supplementation pregnancy suggest significant reduction proteinuric pre-eclampsia 46 percent . Several trial , however , suffer 'pitfalls ' diagnosis pre-eclampsia , include lack blinding , uncertain definition endpoint , unknown technique measurement . Most trial assess role dietary nutrient possibility subgroup low baseline urinary calcium may benefit calcium supplementation . In trial potential increase risk kidney stone treatment group examine systematically . Moreover , daily schedule administration calcium , generally report . There great need , therefore , evaluate efficacy calcium supplementation prevention pre-eclampsia large multicenter control clinical trial . The trial consider role dietary nutrient , establish whether treatment beneficial low baseline urinary calcium , conduct systematic surveillance urolithiasis , employ standardized terminology , technique measurement , diagnostic criterion . The NHLBI provide funding NICHD three year mean Intraagency Agreement ( Y01HC20154 ) . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , double-blind , multicenter . Healthy nulliparous patient randomly assign receive either 2 gram supplemental calcium daily ( ( n = 2,295 ) placebo ( n = 2,294 ) double-blind study . Study tablet administer begin 13 21 complete week gestation continue termination pregnancy . Eligible patient enter run-in period 6 14 day exclude highly noncompliant subject . During run-in , obstetrical ultrasound perform obtain previously , blood drawn serum calcium creatinine . Follow-up visit schedule every four week 29th week gestation , every two week 35th week , weekly thereafter . Blood pressure urine-protein obtain clinic visit , labor delivery , first 24 hour postpartum . Primary endpoint include pregnancy-associated hypertension , pregnancy-associated proteinuria , pre-eclampsia , eclampsia , hypertension . Other endpoint include placental abruption , cerebral hemorrhage thrombosis , elevate liver enzyme , acute renal failure , disseminate intravascular coagulation . Surveillance conduct renal calculus . Recruitment begin May 1992 end March 1995 . Follow-up complete October 1995 . Data analysis continue March 2000 NICHD contract N01HD13121 .</detailed_description>
