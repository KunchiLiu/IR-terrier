	<brief_title>Krypton-Argon Regression Neovascularization Study ( KARNS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The KARNS randomize clinical trial design compare effectiveness argon krypton laser photocoagulation cause regression preexist neovascularization disc ( NVD ) diabetic retinopathy . The main theoretical advantage krypton laser treatment diabetic retinopathy red laser beam penetrates blood may effective make burn pigment epithelium eye vitreous hemorrhage . The burn produce krypton laser retina different produce argon laser . Specifically , burn krypton laser involve inner retina . Also , krypton laser spare nerve fiber layer near macula . In contrast , nerve fiber layer burn common argon laser . Pigment epithelium outer segment usually destroy krypton argon photocoagulation , uptake energy vascular tissue within retina krypton photocoagulation use . Further , krypton treatment effective penetrating nuclear sclerosis lens use treat diabetic eye condition treat argon laser . In KARNS , patient diabetic retinopathy NVD one-third disc area great extent assign random either argon krypton laser scatter photocoagulation ( panretinal photocoagulation ) . The null hypothesis treatment would result similar proportion eye regression NVD 3 month . The KARNS pilot study affirm benefit argon laser photocoagulation treatment proliferative diabetic retinopathy , demonstrate NEI-supported Diabetic Retinopathy Study conduct decade ago . ( See publication list . ) The KARNS study seek determine whether use krypton laser could effective argon laser cause regression diabetic neovascularization , few side effect ( small loss central visual acuity ) . Thirty-two nationwide clinical center participate initially multicenter clinical trial . Following initial study examination , baseline examination fundus photograph obtain within 1 week application photocoagulation . Study followup visit occur 3 month 1 year entry study . Additional visit schedule clinically necessary . The specific technique photocoagulation similar argon krypton scatter photocoagulation . Scatter ( panretinal ) photocoagulation consist 1,600 2,000 burn place 0.5 1 burn width apart . Burns moderate intensity ( whiteness ) 500 ? ? size retina require . The burn apply retinal periphery closer 2 disc diameter center fovea 500 ? ? margin optic disc . In December 1985 , Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study group report focal photocoagulation effective reduce rate moderate visual loss patient clinically significant diabetic macular edema . The KARNS protocol change allow focal treatment clinically significant macular edema study participant allow eye previous focal photocoagulation macular edema become eligible study . The study primary end point regression NVD , assess 3-month visit stereo fundus photograph disc , less one-third disc area extent . Secondary end point include change extent NVD , change visual acuity photocoagulation , development fibrous tissue proliferation , change development macular traction line .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men woman age 18 79 diagnose diabetes mellitus neovascularization optic nerve head ( NVD ) eligible . NVD one eye patient great equal DRS Standard Photograph 10A . NVD define new vessel surface retina , forward vitreous cavity disc , within one disc diameter disc direction . Patient 's ocular medium must clear enough fundus photography , allow extent neovascularization optic nerve head assess . ( If vitreous hemorrhage medium opacity prevent adequate visualization neovascularization , would greatly impair ability assess effect photocoagulation . ) Another requirement patient eligibility presence area least three quadrant retina full argon krypton laser panretinal photocoagulation could place . ( Vitreous hemorrhage and/or traction retinal detachment interfere treatment le one quadrant extent . )</criteria>
