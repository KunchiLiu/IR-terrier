	<brief_title>Shock Trial : Should We Emergently Revascularize Occluded Coronaries Cardiogenic Shock .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Approximately 7.5 percent acute myocardial infarction diagnose emergency room in-hospital lead cardiogenic shock in-hospital death rate 70 80 percent , usually within one two day diagnosis cardiogenic shock . The high death rate change last two decade . Non-random clinical series animal study suggest rapid revascularization follow cardiogenic shock complicate acute myocardial infarction may substantially improve survival . However , apparent benefit report non-random clinic study could result partly selection bias towards patient good prognosis . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , multicenter , Phase III , control clinical trial . Patients shock due leave ventricular failure complicate myocardial infarction randomly assign emergency revascularization initial medical stabilization . Revascularization accomplish either coronary-artery bypass graft angioplasty . A total 152 patient randomize early revascularization 150 patient conventional therapy consist thrombolytic possible late attempt revascularization . Intraaortic balloon counterpulsation perform 86 percent patient group . The primary endpoint mortality cause 30 day . Secondary endpoint include all-cause mortality six month assessment quality life survivor discharge . All patient clinically suspect diagnosis cardiogenic shock complicate myocardial infarction form registry , limited information collect in-hospital procedure , medication , length stay vital status discharge . The study extend June , 2005 patient follow-up data analysis . Long-term survival rate ( 6 11 year post-MI ) estimate quality life survivor acute MI complicate cardiogenic shock study . Extended trial data analysis conduct : ) To determine early echocardiographic parameter associate one year survival cardiogenic shock patient , assess interaction parameter early revascularization ; b ) To examine difference disease course patient outcome function age , gender , national practice , change serial hemodynamic measurement , well well characterize related condition complication cardiogenic shock .</detailed_description>
