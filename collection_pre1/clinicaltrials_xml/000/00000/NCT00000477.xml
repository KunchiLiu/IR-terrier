	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Circulating level cholesterol , specifically cholesterol associate low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) fraction , establish observational epidemiologic study metabolic , pathologic , genetic study human select animal model , randomize clinical trial major etiologic factor coronary heart disease . The ratio percent reduction coronary heart disease incidence percent reduction cholesterol level associate treatment randomize trial , approximately 2:1 , almost exactly predict numerous observational epidemiologic study relationship . However , clinical trial demonstrate lower LDL-cholesterol level reduces subsequent incidence coronary heart disease event confine large middle-aged men hypercholesterolemia Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial ( LRC-CPPT ) men establish coronary heart disease Coronary Drug Project ( CDP ) . Experimental confirmation cholesterol-lowering treatment worthwhile well age 60 lacking . Thus , although guideline issue October 1987 National Cholesterol Education Program 's ( NCEP ) Expert Panel Detection , Evaluation , Treatment High Blood Cholesterol Adults discriminate explicitly age , absence direct evidence efficacy lead allow room physician judgment apply recommendation old patient . This uncertainty application NCEP guideline old men woman matter considerable consequence public health . Epidemiologic study suggest prognostic power cholesterol level diminishes advance age . Subdivision participant several cohort study age 50 entry show increment coronary heart disease risk per increment total LDL cholesterol level nearly always substantially low old group . In Framingham Heart Study , study follow-up data beyond age 60 , 0.5 percent increment coronary heart disease incidence rate estimate per 1 mg/dl increment plasma cholesterol level -- 60 percent increment see middle-aged men woman . However , absolute number potentially preventable coronary heart disease death , 80 percent occur age 65 , myocardial infarction attributable high plasma cholesterol level Framingham observational study appear increase increase age . Previous clinical trial cholesterol-lowering drug weaken limited efficacy acceptability patient . In old patient , administration cholesterol-lowering drug may complicate interaction drug take press condition . However , since Food Drug Administration approve HMG CoA reductase inhibitor , lovastatin , September 1987 , agent efficacious well-tolerated patient age , use increasingly widely . In 1986 , ad hoc committee National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute 's Atherosclerosis , Hypertension , Lipid Metabolism Advisory Committee ( AHLMAC ) recommend randomized clinical trial cholesterol-lowering use HMG CoA reductase inhibitor elderly . The recommendation endorse full AHLMAC approve National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council ( NHLBAC ) May 1987 . However , due high cost trial concern feasibility , initiative two-year pilot study five clinical center develop approve NHLBAC September 1988 . The Request Applications release February 1989 award make July 1990 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : There five clinical center coordinate center pilot study . There four pre-randomization visit four six week interval . Subjects eligible inclusion LDL cholesterol level remain 120 mg/dl introduction American Heart Association Step 1 Diet Visit 2 . Subjects randomize diet plus low dosage lovastatin ( 20 mg ) , diet plus high dosage lovastatin ( 40 mg ) , diet plus placebo . End point change blood lipid level . Data blood chemistry value , well quality-of-life measure coronary heart disease morbidity mortality , also collect . LDL cholesterol level measure clinic visit six twelve week randomization twelve week interval thereafter . Serum alanine aminotransferase level measure six week interval determine liver function slit lamp exam perform study medication detect lenticular opacity . Subjects follow minimum six month maximum fifteen month . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record</detailed_description>
