	<brief_title>A Study Nevirapine Prevention HIV Transmission From Mothers Their Babies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nevirapine several property make attractive candidate antiretroviral therapy interrupt HIV-1 transmission intrapartum early postpartum period . The pharmacokinetic profile suggest nevirapine would rapidly absorb transferred infant utero give labor delivery . In addition , nevirapine show penetrate cell-free virion inactivate virion-associated reverse transcriptase ( RT ) situ . This property would potentially useful inactivate cell-free virion genital tract well breast milk . These characteristic nevirapine suggest treatment HIV-infected pregnant woman labor oral dose nevirapine may provide prophylactic level nevirapine infant time exposure virus birth canal and/or maternal blood . In addition , nevirapine may inactivate virion-associated RT present cell-free virion genital tract breast milk . Women randomize receive either NVP correspond placebo active labor . Women randomize time 32nd week gestation [ AS PER AMENDMENT 1/13/98 : 28th week gestation ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 2/23/00 : 20th week gestation ] . The randomization stratify use two factor : ( 1 ) use [ AS PER AMENDMENT 2/23/00 : current anticipated ] antiretroviral therapy current pregnancy ( therapy ; monotherapy duration ; multi-agent therapy duration ) , ( 2 ) CD4 cell count time randomization ( le 200 cell ; 200 - 399 cell ; 400 cell great ) . Mothers follow study 4 6 week postpartum . Mothers also encourage follow regimen zidovudine ( ZDV ) outline Office Public Health Science ( PHS ) treatment guideline infant . Infants administer either NVP placebo 48 72 hour life . The infant 's study drug mother 's randomize treatment assignment . Infants dose study drug accord randomization group regardless whether mother receive study drug . Infants follow 4 6 week , test HIV 4 6 week , 3 month , 6 month .</detailed_description>
