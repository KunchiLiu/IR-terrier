	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Since advent thrombolytic therapy , early treatment hold particular promise decrease mortality coronary heart disease . Thrombolytic therapy reduce mortality 25 percent patient treat within first hour AMI symptom , great benefit earlier treatment . Not everyone could benefit receive thrombolytic therapy receive therapy . One contribute factor many people symptom seek emergency care timely manner . Studies show substantial delay time AMI symptom hospital arrival , mean range 4.6 24 hour medians 2 6.4 hour . EMS transport time estimate average 7 22 minute , large portion pre-hospital delay attributable patient recognition action . Several factor associate delay time . Sudden onset pain associate short delay time , old age , female gender , African-American race , consultation others symptom , self-treatment program associate longer delay time . There need educational program effective decrease delay time , particularly focusing people increase risk AMI group likely delay seek treatment . Community intervention reduce delay time AMI symptom contact medical system conduct Britain , Canada , Sweden , Australia , Germany , King County Washington , Jacksonville , Illinois . The intervention promising , study suffer problem make report result difficult interpret . Almost publish study assess delay time pre-to-post intervention control comparison group , make magnitude significance impact intervention difficult determine . Most conducted country United States , applicability health-care system United States questionable . Although examined effect public education program ambulance ED utilization , effect public education campaign use EMS ED remain unanswered . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study multicenter , control community trial community unit assignment analysis . Twenty study community pair-matched demographic one pair randomly assign intervention one control . The intervention community receive 18-month community-based intervention reduce delay time symptom sign AMI , focus decrease delay time associate patient recognition action . Several method use include : educational intervention base behavior change theory ; patient provider education ; public education community organization . The primary outcome time symptom onset arrival emergency department . Data collection intervention continue competion 18 month intervention .</detailed_description>
