	<brief_title>The Safety Effectiveness Interleukin-2 Plus Zidovudine Patients With AIDS AIDS Related Complex</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AZT antiviral drug , show beneficial patient AIDS . IL-2 substance find naturally body boost body 's immune response invade organisms tumor cell . These two drug , administer together , may mutually helpful effect treat AIDS patient , effect study , important understand proper dose side effect may occur drug use together . The study show much AZT IL-2 patient safely take time two drug interact . AMENDED : Note dose AZT change 900214 reflect new dose recommendation . Original design : Six week begin treatment IL-2 , patient give AZT daily . There three patient group , one dose level IL-2 . On first day treatment two drug together , patient admit Presbyterian University Hospital , AZT administer orally every 4 hour IL-2 give day single injection skin . Clinical laboratory safety data first two patient enrol treatment group analyze prior enrol additional patient group . All patient expect stay hospital least 5 day , may stay longer serious side effect develop . AZT treatment continue patient leave hospital additional 10 week . Follow-up visit schedule day 6 , 8 , 15 safety , immunologic , virologic evaluation . Thereafter , patient follow telephone interview every week come clinic change health report . At week 10 20 , patient also evaluate follow-up clinic visit .</detailed_description>
