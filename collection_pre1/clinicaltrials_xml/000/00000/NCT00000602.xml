	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Sickle cell anemia complex syndrome multiple organ system disturbance bring interplay genetic , humoral , vascular environmental factor . The clinical course one abrupt insidious exacerbation remission , often migratory repetitive . These event may result impairment function , permanently damage organ , ultimately death . Although wide variability clinical expression sickle cell disease , complex set clinical manifestation experience patient . In addition , evidence primary disease process different child compare adult regard painful episode . However , child high incidence respiratory viral infection , susceptible pneumococcal septicemia . With successful completion Multicenter Study Hydroxyurea ( MSH ) Trial adult , attention focus use agent child . The Cooperative Study Sickle Cell Disease ( CSSCD ) demonstrate sickle cell anemia patient increase painful episode rate die young age . In addition , increased level fetal hemoglobin associate improved survival , probably reliable childhood forecaster adult life expectancy . The beneficial effect produce hydroxyurea thought occur increase fetal hemoglobin level . Therefore , chronic end organ damage prevent early childhood hydroxyurea administration , crisis rate decrease hydroxyurea use early life , sickle cell anemia patient may experience increased longevity improve quality life . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The Phase I-Phase II study , HUG-KIDS , examine safety hydroxyurea . Children sickle cell anemia , age 5 15 year , eligible multicenter Phase I/II trial . Hydroxyurea start 15 mg/kg/d escalate 30 mg/kg/d unless patient experience laboratory toxicity . Patients monitor 2-week visit ass compliance , toxicity , clinical adverse event , growth parameter , laboratory efficacy associate hydroxyurea treatment . Eighty-four child enrol December 1994 March 1996 . Sixty-eight child reach maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) 52 treat MTD 1 year . The study conduct four Comprehensive Sickle Cell Centers follow investigator : Thomas R. Kinney Duke University Medical Center , Durham , North Carolina ; Kwaku Ohene-Frempong Children 's Hospital Philadelphia ; Orah S. Platt Children 's Hospital Boston ; Elliot Vichinsky Children 's Hospital Oakland , California . The complete study last three year . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
