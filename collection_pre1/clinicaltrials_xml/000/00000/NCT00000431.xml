	<brief_summary>Most chronic ( long-lasting ) wound leg ( also know venous ulcer ) fail heal reasonable period time . Although researcher make great progress understand body repair wound , attempt develop new treatment disappoint . In general , treatment base recent finding detail wound repair greatly reduce number people chronic wound . The long-term goal study evaluate new approach heal chronic wound . Current method directly apply substance involve wound heal chronic wound cause enough healing . PDGF-B ( platelet-derived growth factor B ) , factor associate wound healing , might dramatically enhance heal genetically engineer virus inject wound cause cell wound produce PDGF-B large quantity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Most chronic wound leg fail heal reasonable period time . In fact , despite considerable advance elucidate molecular basis wound repair , attempt develop new therapy disappoint . In general , therapy base recently elucidate mechanism wound repair minimal effect overall number individual treat heal chronic wound . The long-term goal study evaluate new approach heal chronic wound . Current method apply cytokine topical protein treat chronic wound result inadequate response . PDGF-B , growth factor associate wound healing , might dramatically enhance wound heal produce large quantity wound bed via adenovirus-mediated gene overexpression cell wound bed . This study consist two trial . The goal Trial A , dose-escalation trial , determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) PDGF-B/Ad5 , adenovirus vector design overexpress PDGF-B , respect local systemic toxicity biologic feasibility . The primary objective evaluate acute safety , local systemic , intra-ulcer injection PDGF-B/Ad5 , thereby determine recommend dose . Upon evaluate patient , treat single intra-ulcer injection PDGF-B/Ad5 wound . Patients receive one dose , administer 72-hour inpatient stay research unit Hospital University Pennsylvania . This study use standard three-six dose-escalation scheme . The MTD define high dose few two six subject experience severe adverse reaction . Each patient closely monitor clinical adverse reaction result treatment PDGF-B/Ad5 . Toxicity grade accord National Cancer Institute 's Common Toxicity Criteria Scale . The primary objective Trial B evaluate safety biologic feasibility MTD PDGF-B/Ad5 report Trial A standard 24-week trial treatment venous leg ulcer . For study , 15 consecutive patient treat use MTD . All patient receive single intra-ulcer injection PDGF-B/Ad5 limb compression bandage change weekly.Study participant follow 24 week , length FDA-approved venous leg ulcer trial .</detailed_description>
