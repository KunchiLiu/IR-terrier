	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Stroke , occur 10 percent pediatric patient sickle cell disease , one devastating complication , high recurrence rate first episode . Several non-randomized study show reduction stroke recurrence periodic blood transfusion administer maintain hemoglobin S 30 percent . Periodic blood transfusion associate significant risk iron overload complication must accompany parenteral iron chelation therapy . However , become standard care prevention recurrent stroke SS child . Thus , randomize trial blood transfusion secondary prevention would feasible would consider unethical . Based various study , recurrence rate reduce 46 67 percent approximately 7 percent transfusion therapy . Because stroke patient leave neurological deficit , face lifetime disability , primary prevention would significant impact management patient . However , complication blood transfusion , hypothesis proven randomize clinical trial . A primary prevention trial possible acceptable mean detect child risk stroke available . The advent TCD identify arterial abnormality prediction stroke provide mean detection . TCD abnormalities high specificity ( 100 percent ) high sensitivity ( 90 percent ) detect angiographically proven narrow arterial diameter . Thus , TCD examination basal cerebral artery predictive develop stroke . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , Phase III , multicenter . Approximately 3,000 child 12 clinic screen transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) . A total 130 randomize receive either standard supportive care periodic blood transfusion find high risk stroke basis elevate cerebral blood flow measure TCD screen test . Primary endpoint include clinically evident symptom cerebral infarction consistent finding magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , and/or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage . Secondary endpoint include asymptomatic brain lesion detect MRI brain area involve primary endpoint . Hematologic characteristic high risk group analyze serum DNA sample frozen future analysis . Recruitment end October 1997 accrual 130 subject . The clinical phase end 1999 .</detailed_description>
