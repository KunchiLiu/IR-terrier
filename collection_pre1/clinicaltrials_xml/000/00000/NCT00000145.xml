	<detailed_description>AMD cataract lead cause visual impairment blindness United States . Based many clinical study , apparent frequency diseases increase dramatically age 60 . Although excellent treatment cataract available , equivalent treatment AMD . As average lifespan population increase , number people develop AMD increase dramatically year ahead . Unless successful mean prevention treatment develop , blindness AMD -- importance public health problem -- increase . Neither etiology natural history AMD cataract know . Epidemiologic study suggest number risk factor may associate AMD cataract , strength evidence support hypotheses varies . Possibly associate AMD personal characteristic , age , race , height , family history , strength hand grip ; ocular characteristic , hyperopia color iris ; cardiovascular disease , smoking , lung infection , chemical exposure . Clinical laboratory study suggest follow factor may associate progression AMD : drusen type , choroidal vascular disease , photic injury . Epidemiologic study cataract suggest associate risk factor may include personal characteristic , age , sex , race , occupation , educational status ; ocular characteristic , iris color ; diabetes mellitus , hypertension , drug exposure , smoking , sunlight exposure . Animal study observational epidemiologic study suggest deficiency vitamin C E , carotenoid , trace element zinc selenium also may associate development two disease , especially cataract . Although surgical treatment remove cataract effective , cataract surgery carry risk , surgery . Therefore , many research effort focus prevent slow cataract development , well determine cause cataract formation . The Age-Related Eye Disease Study ( AREDS ) major research program improve understand predispose factor , clinical course , prognostic factor AMD cataract . Eligible patient randomize treatment placebo , antioxidant , zinc , antioxidant plus zinc , follow minimum 5 year .</detailed_description>
