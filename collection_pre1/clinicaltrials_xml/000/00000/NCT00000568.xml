	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) major cause mortality morbidity United States , affect nearly 10 million person . COPD account 60,000 death yearly rank fourth lead cause death . If current trend continue , may become nation 's fourth even third lead cause death year 2000 . Epidemiological study consistently indicate smoke over-whelming risk factor accelerate decline pulmonary function subsequent development COPD . Furthermore , evidence several study indicate rate decline pulmonary function approach normal rate decline upon cessation cigarette smoking . Another presumed risk factor accelerate decline pulmonary function presence hyperreactive airway , although clear whether mere presence hyperreactive airway contribute accelerated decline , whether decline result reaction airways various irritant long period time . It possible hyperreactive airway keep non-reactive pharmacological mean period year , expect abnormal decline might lessen . This effect might enhance cessation cigarette smoking . Although evidence strong smoking hyperreactive airway risk factor COPD , demonstrate whether removal risk factor stage mild dysfunction already occur would effectively modify course COPD . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Lung Health Study I Randomized control . Cigarette smoker evidence airway obstruction underwent baseline test include spirometric response isoproterenol methacholine randomly assign one three group : intervention usual care group ; group receive smoke cessation program bronchodilator therapy ; group receive smoke cessation program placebo bronchodilator . The placebo/bronchodilator therapy double-blind . The smoking intervention consist intensive 12-session smoking cessation program combine behavior modification use nicotine gum , continue five-year maintenance program minimize relapse . The bronchodilator consist ipratropium bromide prescribe three time daily , two puff per time , metered-dose inhaler . All group follow yearly five year . The primary endpoint rate change FEV1 . Respiratory morbidity secondary endpoint . Recruitment begin November 1986 complete January 1989 . The clinical phase trial end April 1994 . The study continue contract N01-HR-46002 September , 2004 data analysis dissemination research result . Lung Health Study III Beginning fiscal year 1998 , survive participant LHS I invite participate long-term followup . The study determine , use intent-to-treat analysis , whether LHS I smoke intervention significantly reduce incidence clinically important respiratory cardiovascular disease 12- 15-year period follow study enrollment . The study also estimate magnitude effect FEV1 FVC risk cardiovascular respiratory morbidity mortality , control smoke history . Studies conduct role factor gender , airways reactivity , weight gain , co-morbidities determine rate decline pulmonary function risk cardiovascular respiratory morbidity mortality . A determination also make whether improvement lung function reduction respiratory symptom associate smoke cessation result improve health-related quality life ( HRQL ) less depression extend follow-up period . The LHS III , investigator initiate long-term follow-up study , NIH- define clinical trial .</detailed_description>
