	<brief_title>Prevention Events With Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor Therapy ( PEACE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Individuals coronary artery disease heighten risk major cardiovascular event . With current advance , large segment population manifest coronary artery disease advance age . The majority individual preserve leave ventricular function . Prior study convert enzyme inhibitor ( CEI ) therapy patient depressed ejection fraction demonstrate long-term administration lead improved survival reduce risk myocardial infarction conventional therapy . There sufficient rationale experience indicate benefit apply large group individual coronary artery disease preserve leave ventricular function therefore even broad public health implication . A definitive trial need assess capacity CEI therapy prevent mortality reduce risk myocardial infarction patient coronary disease preserve leave ventricular function . The initiative propose former Clinical Trials Branch staff give concept clearance May 1994 National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council . The Request Proposals release October 1994 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A multicenter , randomize clinical trial . There approximately 180 center United States , Canada , Puerto Rico , Italy . Patients randomly assign treatment group addition angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor trandolapril compare standard therapy . The primary endpoint include reduction incidence cardiovascular death , nonfatal myocardial infarction , need coronary revascularization ( PTCA CABG ) coronary artery disease patient leave ventricular ejection fraction 40 percent . Secondary endpoint include incidence hospitalization management either unstable angina , congestive heart failure , stroke , cardiac arrhythmia . Recruitment start November 1996 end June 2000 minimum follow-up five year .</detailed_description>
