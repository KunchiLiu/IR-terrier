	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety tolerability give IL-2 plus anti-HIV ( antiretroviral ) therapy HIV-positive patient CD4 cell count ( cell immune system fight infection ) least 350 cells/mm3 . This study also examine ability antiretroviral therapy combine IL-2 boost immune system . IL-2 , give injection skin , combination anti-HIV therapy increase CD4 cell count . This study examine 3 dos IL-2 order determine safest effective dose use .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Giving Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) Plus Anti-HIV Therapy HIV-Positive Patients With CD4 Cell Counts Least 350 Cells/mm3</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interleukin-2 administer subcutaneously , combination antiretrovirals , result increase CD4+ cell count might impact upon HIV disease progression . A Phase III trial involve large number HIV-positive patient next step development process . To develop appropriate clinical experience combination , Phase II trial allow administration IL-2 plus antiretroviral therapy small number patient sit consider Phase III trial . Patients receive antiretrovirals alone antiretrovirals plus IL-2 give subcutaneously . Three dose IL-2 study , 12 patient evaluate dose . When least 9 first 12 patient complete 5-day dosing period without dose-limiting toxicity , next 12 patient treat next high dose every 12 hour 5 day every 8 week ; dose tolerate , last 12 patient randomized receive high study dose every 12 hour 5 day every 8 week . Patients enrol first two dos IL-2 complete three course treatment dose escalate maximum high study dose .</detailed_description>
