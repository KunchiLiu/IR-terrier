	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effect stop preventive therapy DMAC HIV-positive patient ( 1 ) treat DMAC least 12 month free sign DMAC least 16 week , ( 2 ) improve immune system ( CD4 cell count great equal 100 cells/mm3 ) due anti-HIV drug therapy . DMAC serious sometimes life-threatening infection usually affect HIV-positive patient CD4 cell count ( cell immune system fight infection ) less 50 cells/mm3 . It recommend people likely get DMAC place preventive medication help reduce risk infection . New anti-HIV combination drug therapy increase CD4 cell count reduce level HIV blood . When CD4 count increase , risk DMAC infection le . This study examine whether possible stop preventive therapy DMAC CD4 count high without place individual risk get DMAC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Examine Effects Stopping Preventive Therapy Disseminated Mycobacterium Avium Complex ( DMAC ) HIV-Positive Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A grow body evidence suggest AIDS-related morbidity mortality significantly decrease potent antiretroviral therapy use . HAART ( highly active antiretroviral therapy ) seem significantly reduce incidence MAC . This study test validity observation . Peripheral blood culture bone marrow ( aspirate ) sample 50 eligible patient previously diagnose disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex ( DMAC ) assess microbiologic sterilization MAC time study entry . If either bone marrow blood culture test positive MAC , patient discontinue study . If culture prove sterile , patient receive 6 week treatment discontinue MAC therapy Week 6 ( entry Step 2 study ) . They monitor clinical sign symptom MAC recurrence presence mycobacteria blood culture . In case increase viral load study , modification antiretroviral therapy allow discretion patient 's provider .</detailed_description>
