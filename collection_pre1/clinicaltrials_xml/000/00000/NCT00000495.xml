	<brief_title>Prevention Hypertension : A Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Diet modification one strategies primary prevention hypertension . Studies association various factor blood pressure different population show occurrence specific dietary factor associate elevate blood pressure . The factor include overweight , alcohol consumption high sodium intake . Heart rate also independent predictor risk hypertension . Diet exercise amenable intervention influence blood pressure aim reduce risk develop hypertension . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In first phase trial participant randomize Monitored ( Control ) Group Intervention Group receive individualize intervention achieve change diet physical activity . The goal Intervention Group : reduction least 10 pound 5 percent body weight desirable weight ; reduction daily sodium intake 1800 mg ; modification alcohol intake two drink per day ; increase regular , moderate physical activity . The primary endpoint first phase trial comparison mean blood pressure Intervention Group versus Monitored Group . In second phase trial , randomize participant follow minimum five year . The primary endpoint second phase incidence high blood pressure and/or hypertension .</detailed_description>
