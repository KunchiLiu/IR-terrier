	<brief_summary>To compare two standard treatment strategy atrial fibrillation : ventricular rate control anticoagulation vs. rhythm control anticoagulation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation Rhythm Management ( AFFIRM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Atrial fibrillation extremely common increasingly prevalent cardiac arrhythmia , particularly elderly , important risk factor stroke . Management atrial fibrillation remain controversial , although antiarrhythmic drug widely use condition , clinical study support use meager . Management atrial fibrillation least three component : restoration maintenance sinus rhythm ; heart rate control maintenance sinus rhythm cardioversion attempt impossible ; anticoagulation . The first component management use antiarrhythmic drug second us different group antiarrhythmic drug catheter ablation . The third anticoagulant therapy patient normal sinus rhythm maintain cardioversion attempt . The initiative develop staff Clinical Trials Branch NHLBI Working Group Atrial Fibrillation meet Bethesda April , 1993 . The initiative give concept clearance February 1994 National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council . The Request Proposals release May 1994 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A randomized multicenter trial . The trial enrol patient atrial fibrillation high risk stroke , , 65 year age less 65 one risk factor stroke systemic hypertension , diabetes mellitus , congestive heart failure , transient ischemic attack , prior cerebral vascular accident . High risk patient treat anticoagulant warfarin . Cardioversion ( electrical pharmacologic ) might attempt randomization , unsuccessful , patient exclude consideration randomization . Normal sinus rhythm must persist one hour great cardioversion qualify successful cardioversion . Patients randomly assign treatment group include maintenance sinus rhythm heart rate control . Both treatment group two step . In maintenance sinus rhythm group , choice drug leave primary treating physician , choose amiodarone , sotalol , propafenone , flecainide , quinidine , moricizine , disopyramide , procainamide , combination drug . Atrioventricular nodal block drug also administer unless contraindicate . The major substudy AFFIRM randomize initial drug choice among amiodarone , sotalol , class I drug . Prior drug ineffective poorly tolerate repeat . There various drug exclusion depend patient 's condition . Patients maintenance sinus rhythm group multiple cardioversions need . If treatment failure intolerance two pharmacologic trial , patient consider innovative therapy Step II . In Step II , two maintenance dos amiodarone include , low dose 100 200 mg/day normal dose 300 400 mg/day . Each dose amiodarone consider single drug trial , patient receive treatment amiodarone dosage level consider two drug trial . It mandatory Step II therapy apply individual patient . The following innovative Step II therapy approve use study : ( 1 ) ablation atrial focus patient type I atrial flutter , clinically document atrial flutter lead atrial fibrillation ; ( 2 ) atrial pace alone , without documented bradycardia ; ( 3 ) atrial pace antiarrhythmic drug , either single site multiple site atrial pacing ; ( 4 ) surgical maze atrial isolation procedure select center . Catheter-based ablative procedure , attempt mimic maze procedure approve study . Implanted atrial cardioverter defibrillator also approve . All therapy periodically review subject modification Steering Committee concurrence DSMB NHLBI . In event sinus rhythm maintainable treatment , patient cross rate control anticoagulation . The heart rate control arm use heart rate therapeutic target , rather dose medication . Drug dosage adjust achieve target heart rate . During atrial fibrillation , heart rate assess rest activity clinic visit . The pharmacologic therapy approve use arm include : beta blocker , verapamil , diltiazem , digoxin , combination drug . When Step I pharmacologic therapy fail two drug trial , treat physician could select approved Step II innovative therapy . The two innovative therapy approve use heart rate control arm : ( 1 ) atrioventricular node modification catheter ablation , without placement pacemaker , without continue drug slow atrioventricular node conduction , ( 2 ) total atrioventricular junctional ablation placement pacemaker . The primary endpoint two strategy compare total mortality , analyze intention-to-treat . Secondary endpoint composite end point ( total mortality , disable intracranial bleed , stroke , disable anoxic encephalopathy , cardiac arrest , major noncentral nervous system bleed , cost therapy , quality life . Follow-up minimum two year average 3.5 year . Recruitment intervention extend November 1995 October 1999 4,060 patient enrol 213 site .</detailed_description>
