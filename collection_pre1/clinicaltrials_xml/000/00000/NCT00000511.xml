	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The hypothesis omega-3 fatty acid well magnesium potassium diet lower blood pressure mild hypertensive need documentation , although preliminary less well control study suggest effect possible . In previous study investigator find hypotensive effect another polyunsaturated fatty acid , linoleic acid . In addition , finding low blood pressure vegetarians result obtain study vegetarian diet feed normotensives lead conclusion dietary factor linoleic acid responsible possible hypotensive effect vegetarian diet . The nutrient select study , omega-3 fatty acid , magnesium potassium , occur high amount vegetarian diet . Dietary supplementation fish oil do study inconclusive result . However , relationship omega-3 fatty acid synthesis prostacyclins , locally active vasodilator decrease excretion vasoconstrictor thromboxane , provide possible mechanism effect compound blood pressure . The role potassium control blood pressure first suggest cross-cultural study population consume high level potassium display low rate hypertension decrease blood pressure age . Cohort study within country also show relationship potassium intake ratio potassium sodium , measure urinary excretion blood pressure . Most constantly find blood pressure difference black white related difference potassium excretion . The result human experimental study involve potassium supplementation normotensives hypertensive indicate mixed effect blood pressure lower consistently observe subgroup family history hypertension high blood pressure . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Trial 1 : Subjects randomize fish oil treatment group 6 12 grams/day omega-3 fatty acid placebo group . At end 12 24 week , participant three group crossed-over one two treatment additional 12 week . The primary outcome clinic blood pressure 3 day end treatment period . Trial 2 : Subjects randomly assign one four treatment placebo : magnesium supplementation ; potassium supplementation ; calcium supplementation ; 3 supplement ; match placebo . The trial double-blinded . Each treatment administer six month measurement take baseline end . The primary outcome 24-hour ambulatory systolic BP . The study completion date list record obtain Query/View/Report ( QVR ) System .</detailed_description>
