	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The strong relationship diet blood pressure risk hypertension well recognize . Currently , three specific diet-related factor recommend Joint National Committee High Blood Pressure first-line approach prevent treat hypertension : caloric restriction weight reduction , reduce consumption alcohol , low sodium intake . Many study , primarily observational , show significant association blood pressure diet-related factor , include micronutrient potassium , calcium , magnesium ; macronutrients type amount dietary fat , particularly polyunsaturated , protein ; dietary fiber . However , result individual , randomize , control clinical trial test effect nutrient blood pressure inconsistent equivocal . On hand , observational randomize intervention study consistently link vegetarian dietary pattern low blood pressure . To determine specific dietary component may account blood pressure-lowering effect produce vegetarian diet , numerous study examine individual micronutrient , macronutrients , fiber . A large majority cross-cultural observational study show significant inverse association blood pressure micronutrient , potassium , calcium , magnesium , evidence link dietary fiber low blood pressure come primarily study vegetarian high fiber diet . However , numerous clinical trial find potassium calcium supplement low blood pressure . Randomized trial magnesium supplementation generally show significant reduction blood pressure . The intervention study fiber supplement likewise generally demonstrate significant lower blood pressure . Pooled estimate meta-analyses potassium calcium trial report small significant reduction systolic ( potassium calcium ) diastolic ( potassium ) blood pressure . All result compatible small effect individual dietary component . Only observational intervention study demonstrate relationship macronutrients , dietary fat protein , blood pressure . However , recent data analysis show significant direct association saturate fat dietary cholesterol , inverse association protein intake . Thus , overall summary literature suggest strong potential number macronutrients micronutrient play important role reduce blood pressure . Testing dietary pattern rather specific nutrient promise approach yet know nutrient might effective lower blood pressure effect individual nutrient may small . Testing dietary pattern would naturally include several nutrient cumulatively likely low blood pressure . Furthermore , intervention study demonstrate decrease blood pressure individual nutrient use supplement rather food . Therefore , may important test nutrient component food dietary pattern isolate processed nutrient . DESIGN NARRATIVE : DASH , randomize , multicenter , control trial , compare effect three dietary pattern blood pressure . The study design consist three-week run-in period eligible participant provide diet approximated typical American diet nutrient content . After run-in , eligible participant randomize one three dietary pattern last eight week : 'typical ' American diet macronutrient fiber content reflect current United States consumption relatively low calcium , potassium , magnesium ; diet high fruit vegetable , therefore high potassium , magnesium , fiber . The macronutrient calcium content diet otherwise resembled typical American diet . The third diet , termed DASH diet , high fruit , vegetable , low-fat dairy product , favorable macronutrient profile . This diet low saturate fat , total fat , cholesterol , moderately high protein , high content calcium , potassium , magnesium , fiber . All three diet 3 gram sodium daily -- slightly average U.S. consumption -- include fresh , frozen , can , dry food . None diet vegetarian use specialty food contain fat substitute . Alcohol caffeine-containing beverage limit monitor . Because important good compliance diet assure , food provide free-living study participant . The primary endpoint change diastolic blood pressure baseline end study . The study compare change diastolic blood pressure among three dietary pattern . Screening begin June 1994 . Randomization begin September 1994 expect take two year . Support trial end July 1997 . NHLBI fund ancillary study DASH entitle , Folic Acid Dose Response . The purpose study determine dose-response relationship dietary folic acid intake plasma folate homocysteine . A total 133 healthy people age 60 year old enrol . Participants assign either 0 , 100 , 400 , 1000 , 2000 microgram folic acid 6 week . Study participant newly recruit DASH participant .
