	<brief_summary>To evaluate safety effectiveness 6-month course isoniazid ( INH ) prevention clinical tuberculosis anergic ( diminished absent reaction specific antigen ) HIV-infected person high risk tuberculous infection . A substantial number HIV-infected person anergic , thus respond currently available diagnostic tool tuberculosis infection ( , PPD ( purify protein derivative ) skin test ) . Many anergic person , however , infected Mycobacterium tuberculosis eventually develop reactivation tuberculosis , cause individual illness spread infection others community . This study examine possibility use INH prophylaxis ( , prevention ) anergic HIV-infected patient high risk tuberculosis mean decrease sharp rise incidence tuberculosis due HIV infection . INH inexpensive relatively safe , thus may demonstrate acceptable risk/benefit ratio medication give limited period time population suspect , prove , M. tuberculosis infection . If study show INH safe effective setting , could major effect public health country .</brief_summary>

If study show INH safe effective setting , could major effect public health country . Patients place random selection process either INH placebo group . One group receive INH plus pyridoxine hydrochloride ( vitamin B6 ) daily six month . Patients group receive placebo plus vitamin B6 daily six month .</detailed_description>
