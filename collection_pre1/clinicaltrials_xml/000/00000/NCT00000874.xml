	<detailed_description>A grow body evidence suggest antiretroviral resistance associate increase risk disease progression death . All commercially available antiretrovirals many development associate resistance . Fortunately , technique available define HIV genotypic resistance `` real time '' compare technique measure phenotypic resistance practical clinical setting . Using genotypic antiretroviral resistance testing ( GART ) result , along currently available marker , may lead improved treatment decision compare use currently available marker alone . 128 patient randomized GART GART within four stratum define current antiretroviral regimen : 1 . ZDV plus 3TC plus IDV 2 . ZDV plus 3TC plus SQV 3 . ZDV plus 3TC plus RTV 4. d4T plus 3TC plus IDV . Each four stratum contains 22 patient CD4+ count 50 - 199/mm3 11 patient CD4+ count 200 - 500/mm3 . Upon randomization , clinicians determine treatment strategy supply baseline GART result ( GART arm ) without ( no-GART arm ) . All patient remain triple antiretroviral regimen initiate randomization visit least 8-week visit . At time , change treatment allow base inadequate response therapy . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 9/17/97 : 128 patient randomize therapy base GART result therapy base result . Patients stratify 8 group define current antiretroviral regimen ( ZDV/3TC/IDV vs. ZDV/3TC/SQV vs. ZDV/3TC/RTV vs. d4T/3TC/IDV ) screen CD4+ count ( 50-199 vs. 200-500 ) . Management patient assign GART group base recommendation study virologist independent review patient plasma GART result addition current clinical practice . Up four different treatment regimen use licensed drug may recommend , rank consider approximately therapeutically equivalent .
