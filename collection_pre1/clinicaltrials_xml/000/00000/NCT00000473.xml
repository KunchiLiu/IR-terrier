	<brief_title>Do Fish Oils Prevent Restenosis Post-Coronary Angioplasty ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Coronary angioplasty non-surgical mean mechanical coronary artery revascularization potential reduce eliminate severe coronary arterial narrowing result myocardial ischemia . Since innovation , technique coronary angioplasty undergone continuous refinement , great proportion patient eligible increasingly successful procedure . All clinical syndrome associate coronary artery disease , include chronic stable angina , silent myocardial ischemia , unstable angina , acute myocardial infarction , successfully treat therapy , often dramatic , favorable result achieve . A persistent limitation procedure development restenosis recurrence coronary arterial narrow usually occur within six month successful balloon dilatation , spite current treatment anti-platelet agent . Several clinical trial attempt identify pharmacologic regimen aim reduce incidence restenosis . With rare exception , trial fail detect positive effect drug intervention . Considering restenosis reflect multiple factor , thrombosis , spasm , exaggerated response injury , smooth muscle cell , platelet , component arachidonic acid metabolism , multiple pharmacologic therapy employ , include aspirin , warfarin , heparin , calcium antagonist , steroid . Investigators direct attention potential role marine polyunsaturated fatty acid potential inhibitor restenosis . Dietary fish oil show inhibit platelet aggregation stimulate thromboxane synthesis , reduce platelet vascular interaction atherosclerotic injure blood vessel , inhibit diet-induced atherogenesis swine two specie monkey . One study show dietary fish oil administer pig reduce platelet deposition vasoconstriction balloon catheter induce carotid artery lesion . In addition , fish oil reduces blood red cell viscosity also inhibit function monocyte may important pathogenesis atherosclerosis vascular response injury . Early report human study mix , investigation fail demonstrate positive effect . However , trial limit small number patient typically lack rigor randomize , control clinical trial hard endpoint aggressive administration fatty acid . N-3 PUFAs report human increase prostacyclin formation plasma fibrinolytic activity reduce serum lipid , vascular reactivity , inflammatory potential white blood cell site vascular injury , factor potentially involved restenosis post-PTCA . Therefore , reason believe addition n-3 PUFAs aspirin might great effect upon restenosis treat vessel aspirin alone . The basis study rest epidemiologic data Eskimos Japanese ingestion n-3 PUFAs derive cold water marine source favorable effect prevent development coronary artery disease . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , double-blind . Patients eight center assign receive six month daily dietary supplement fish oil ( ten 1.0-g capsule contain 80.6 percent ethyl ester omega-3 fatty acid provide 4.1 g eicosapentaenoic acid [ EPA ] 2.8 g docosahexaenoic acid [ DHA ] ) control group receive corn oil . The high dose fish oil approach intake Greenland Inuits choose hope overcome antagonistic effect fatty acid compete EPA DHA , arachidonic acid saturate fat . Two week prior PTCA , patient begin take capsule . Aspirin initiate 12 hour prior PTCA continue six month . Dietary counseling provide prior two week intervention . Upon admission PTCA one week follow PTCA , expand dietary counseling instruction give . Patients telephone monthly reinforce dietary information include American Heart Association Phase I diet reduce total fat 30 percent total energy . Diet rigidly control . Recruitment begin August 1989 end September 1992 . Patients exit trial upon completion protocol , include final set evaluation six month . The primary endpoint presence absence restenosis define angiography six month PTCA . The trial extend without additional fund June 1994 allow data analysis .</detailed_description>
