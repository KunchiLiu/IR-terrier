	<detailed_description>This study use combine N-of-1 method compare effectiveness combination therapy amitriptyline fluoxetine ( AM+FL ) versus amitriptyline ( AM ) alone patient fibromyalgia ( FM ) . It also compare community-based center-based trial result . We ask community-based , board-certified rheumatologist participate investigator also carry center-based study ( Newton-Wellesley Hospital ) . Physicians ask patient meet eligibility criterion participate study undergo N-of-1 trial . Each N-of-1 trial consist three pair crossover period ( 6-weeks long ) patient receive either AM + placebo ( placebo every morning AM 25 mg night ) combination treatment AM+FL ( FL 20 mg morning AM 25 mg night ) . The dispense pharmacy carry pair randomization . We assess patient evaluation outcome measure baseline prior trial , end treatment period , 3 month completion N-of-1 trial . In addition , baseline , obtain demographic information , electrocardiogram , baseline blood test . We may ask patient additional blood test period evaluation . We also pregnancy test woman child-bearing age enrol study . The main study outcome measure Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire ( FIQ ) . Additional measure include Visual Analog Scales ( VAS ) pain , sleep , global well-being ; Physician VAS global well-being ; tender-point score . We analyze result N-of-1 trial two way : ( 1 ) use individual patient 's result ( classic one-sided t-test ) ( 2 ) use patient 's result combination result patient underwent similar trial ( combine N-of-1 approach ) . To obtain latter information , include patient 's result collective analysis . We provide result back physicians record final treatment decision physician reach patient . In addition , ask physician patient comment participation N-of-1 trial research process . Followup patient 3 month completion N-of-1 trial include determine current medication current outcome assessment . Investigators record adverse drug reaction patient withdrawn study . They also record reason withdrawal patient choose withdraw . We include result patient drop due reason drug reaction combine N-of-1 analysis complete period pair result available . An independent safety officer review withdrawal . Results individual patient trial confidential ; however , combine result ( removal patient identifier ) result patient , publish overall result study . We maintain connection result patient identifier enable u provide result individual investigator patient .</detailed_description>
