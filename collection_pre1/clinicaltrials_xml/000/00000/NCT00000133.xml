	<brief_title>Cryotherapy Retinopathy Prematurity ( CRYO-ROP ) - Outcome Study Cryotherapy Retinopathy Prematurity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ROP disease eye prematurely born infant retinal blood vessel increase number branch excessively , sometimes leading hemorrhage scar . Before establishment study 1985 , 500 infant annually blind ROP United States alone . More 30 year ago , National Institutes Health sponsor clinical trial show premature baby give oxygen need , number infant develop ROP drop dramatically . Subsequently , hospital cut back give excessive oxygen routinely premature baby . But , improvement neonatal care last two decade , number baby risk increase survival rate small premature infant improve . The low birth weight , high incidence severity ROP . In recent NEI-supported study University Miami , blood oxygen level low birth-weight infant monitor continuously use transcutaneous measurement long oxygen therapy need . The study show statistically significant difference rate ROP infant monitor continuous oxygen therapy monitor receive oxygen excess 40 percent . The Supplemental Therapeutic Oxygen Prethreshold ROP ( STOP-ROP ) trial , also fund NEI , study whether slight increase oxygen therapy would prevent progression moderate ROP ROP severe enough require surgical treatment . This intervention make little difference outcome . Likewise , another NEI-sponsored clinical trial ( LIGHT-ROP ) demonstrate absence protective effect ROP limit light exposure newborn premature infant . These study lead conclusion factor oxygen light exposure must involve cause ROP . In infant develop ROP , disease spontaneously subside , permit development normal vision . But infant progress severe form ROP danger become permanently blind . Although cause ROP fully explain , scientist seek way treat ROP successfully find right time progression disease use treatment . Cryotherapy , destroy fringe retina freezing , treatment far demonstrate provide substantial benefit eye . The multicenter trial cryotherapy ROP enrol 4,000 premature infant weigh 1,250 gram birth . This category infants great risk develop ROP . The eyes infant enrol study examine predetermined interval subject still intensive care nursery . After pupil dilate eye drop , eye examine ophthalmologist use binocular indirect ophthalmoscope visualize develop retina . The natural history condition infant 's retina record . When examination disclose severe form ROP ( threshold ROP ) eye , parent give inform consent , one infant 's eye randomly select receive cryotherapy . In technique , cryoprobe use freeze thus destroy peripheral extent retina , thereby arrest development blood vessel grow wildly toward . Outcome therapy assess 3 month 12 month follow randomization extensive examination include photography interior treat control eye . The 12-month exam also measure visual function preferential-looking technique . Such measurement allow correlation fundus photographs visual function comparison visual function treat versus control eye . Neither trained photograph reader evaluate picture eye specially trained vision tester know eye receive cryotherapy . Additional assessment visual acuity retinal status make approximately year present . Currently ( 2001 ) , preparation make 15-year outcome study conclude 2003 .</detailed_description>
