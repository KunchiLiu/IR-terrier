	<brief_title>Aspirin-Myocardial Infarction Study ( AMIS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : It postulate thrombosis play major role late stage coronary artery occlusion . Platelet aggregation large component formation arterial thrombus . Theoretically , agent prevents aggregation platelet would value people coronary artery disease . Aspirin , small dos , inhibits platelet aggregation prolong period time , therefore might expect prevent retard occlusion coronary artery . This would reflect decrease incidence myocardial infarction decrease mortality due coronary artery disease . Several study give preliminary evidence regular administration aspirin may benefit patient know coronary artery disease . A National Heart Lung Institute-sponsored study , Coronary Drug Project , run pilot trial aspirin placebo men previous myocardial infarction . Preliminary result trial demonstrate feasibility lead NHLBI sponsor definitive control study benefit aspirin secondary prevention coronary heart disease . An Institute Planning Committee meet four time October 1974 April 1975 develop protocol , manual operation , data collection form . Recruitment patient begin June 1975 , first patient randomize July 2 , 1975 . Patients randomize see AMIS Clinical Center two initial visit one baseline visit free reason exclusion , current use anticoagulant history adverse reaction aspirin . Patients take acetaminophen time would normally take aspirin . Follow-up minimum 3 year , patient see 4-month interval monitor side effect various nonfatal event , include cardiovascular problem . The primary endpoint mortality . Annually , detailed history obtain complete physical examination perform . The study involve 30 clinical center , coordinate center , central laboratory . The study complete patient recruitment schedule one year period . A total 4,524 post-MI patient enrol 30 clinical center . Three-year minimum patient follow-up end August 1979 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , double-blind , fixed sample . Eligible patient assign treatment group receive 1 gm aspirin daily ( equivalent three standard aspirin tablet ) control group receive placebo .</detailed_description>
