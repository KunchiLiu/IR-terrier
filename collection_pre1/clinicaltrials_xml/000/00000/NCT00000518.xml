	<brief_title>Electrophysiologic Study Versus Electrocardiographic Monitoring ( ESVEM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : There prospective , randomized study compare accuracy EPS versus HM guide long-term drug therapy ventricular tachycardia ventricular fibrillation . Success report use technique . Using rigorous ECG monitoring protocol patient , less five percent per year incidence sudden death report . Several investigator report result electropharmacologic test predictive clinical response . One large study , Mason Winkle , report , 51 patient recurrent ventricular tachycardia treat drug predict effective base result electropharmacologic test , ventricular tachycardia recur 68 percent 18 month follow-up . In contrast , ventricular tachycardia recur 11 percent patient treat drug predict ineffective . Two prior study compare , non-randomized fashion , predictive accuracy EPS HM treat patient ventricular tachycardia/ ventricular fibrillation . A retrospective analysis 44 patient ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation underwent HM EPS perform elimination ventricular tachycardia HM suppression ventricular tachycardia induce programmed stimulation therapeutic goal . The positive negative predictive value EPS find 88 percent 94 percent , respectively . The corresponding value ECG monitoring find 70 percent 50 percent , respectively . It conclude EPS provide high degree accuracy HM predict long-term clinical response drug therapy , mean follow-up 18 month . However , study criterion judge efficacy HM liberal one involve elimination ventricular tachycardia . A second study examine result HM 19 patient ventricular tachycardia treat base EPS . Among eight patient , inducible ventricular tachycardia suppress electrophysiologic testing , six change worsen premature ventricular contraction HM . These patient benign follow-up despite continued presence frequent complex ventricular ectopy . It conclude EPS superior HM predict successful drug therapy . Existing data suggest electrophysiologic test Holter monitoring might effective technique determine effective drug therapy ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation . However , enough data available ass technique effective . A prospective , randomized comparison two technique would significant contribution could potentially major impact medical community . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , fixed sample , multicenter trial conduct 14 institution . Patients meet clinical criterion underwent Holter monitoring . Those average 30 premature ventricular contraction per hour underwent EPS . Those inducible ventricular tachycardia randomize EPS arm Holter exercise treadmill arm drug testing . Each patient receive , random sequence , six antiarrhythmic drug . When effective drug find , patient underwent predischarge HM exercise test . Follow-up continue one year last subject randomize . The primary endpoint trial time arrhythmia recurrence therapy drug predict effective either EPS HM .</detailed_description>
