	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare 4 different combination anti-HIV drug determine number people whose HIV blood level decrease 200 copies/ml less treatment . This study evaluate safety drug combination , include experimental protease inhibitor ( PI ) , amprenavir . Despite success many patient PI treatment regimen , still possibility patient receive PIs may continue high HIV blood level . Because possibility , alternative drug combination contain PIs study . It appear amprenavir , take 3 4 anti-HIV drug , may effective patient prior PI treatment experience .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Amprenavir Combination With Other Anti-HIV Drugs HIV-Positive Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A number study within outside ACTG initiate development try address issue alternative treatment patient either achieve lose virologic control receive protease inhibitor ( PIs ) . Amprenavir ( APV ) attractive candidate investigate part salvage regimens : 1 ) substantial antiretroviral activity ; 2 ) preliminary vitro vivo data suggest resistance agent may mediate part unique mutation ( I50V ) ; 3 ) cross-resistance profile approve PIs uncertain . Patients selectively randomize 1 4 study arm base prior PI experience . Those randomized Arms A , B , C receive 2 PIs , 1 amprenavir ( APV ) , randomize Arm D receive single PI ( APV ) part treatment regimen , follow : Arm A : APV plus saquinavir soft gel capsule ( SQVsgc ) plus abacavir ( ABC ) plus efavirenz ( EFV ) plus adefovir ( ADV ) . Arm B : APV plus indinavir ( IDV ) plus ABC plus EFV plus ADV . Arm C : APV plus nelfinavir ( NFV ) plus ABC plus EFV plus ADV . Arm D : APV plus placebo ( NFV , IDV , SQVsgc ) plus ABC plus EFV plus ADV . All patient receive L-carnitine supplementation . All patient receive clinical physical assessment laboratory test study follow : Weeks 2 , 4 , every 4 week thereafter . A primary analysis perform last patient reach 24 week . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 3/2/00 : At time , patient unblinded original treatment assignment . ] Patients experience virologic failure unblinded may choose 1 follow 3 option : Continue study medication open-label , permanently discontinue study medication , selectively continue study medication [ AS PER AMENDMENT 3/2/00 : arm patient originally randomize ] combine approve antiretroviral agent . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 3/2/00 : For patient add didanosine ( ddI ) regimens , monitor development pancreatitis crucial . ] Final evaluation require patient drug immediate 8-week period follow last dose study treatment . Beyond 8 week , follow incidence death , cancer , congenital anomaly , permanent disability . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 3/2/00 : Gilead Sciences terminate U.S. development ADV HIV infection . Gilead continue supply ADV patient ACTG 398 study close . Patients receive ADV completion study may continue access ADV Expanded Access Program , provide physician patient determine continue use ADV beneficial . ]</detailed_description>
