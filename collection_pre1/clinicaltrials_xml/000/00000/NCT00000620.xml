	<brief_title>Action Control Cardiovascular Risk Diabetes ( ACCORD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Currently , 17 million Americans diagnose diabetes 90 percent type 2 diabetes . The number people form diabetes , formerly know adult onset non-insulin dependent diabetes , grow rapidly . By 2050 , number Americans diagnosed diabetes project increase 165 percent 29 million , 27 million type 2 form . Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause death people type 2 diabetes ; individual die CVD rate two four time higher diabetes . They also experience nonfatal heart attack stroke . Type 2 diabetes associate old age common overweight obese family history diabetes . Women history diabetes pregnancy , adult impair glucose tolerance , people sedentary lifestyle , member minority race/ethnicity also great risk develop type 2 diabetes . African Americans , Hispanic/Latino Americans , American Indians , Asian Americans Pacific Islanders particularly high risk type 2 diabetes . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The three strategy test ACCORD include follow : ( 1 ) Blood sugar - ACCORD design determine whether lower blood glucose level closer normal call current guideline reduces CVD risk . The study estimate effect CVD level compare level usually target . ( 2 ) Blood pressure - many people type 2 diabetes high blood pressure . The blood pressure part trial design determine effect lower blood pressure context good blood sugar control , determine whether lower blood pressure normal ( systolic pressure le 120 mm Hg ) good reduce CVD risk , compare usually-targeted level current clinical practice ( i.e. , definition hypertension ; systolic pressure le 140 mm Hg ) . ( 3 ) Blood Fats - Many people diabetes high level LDL ( `` bad '' ) cholesterol triglyceride , well low level HDL ( `` good '' ) cholesterol . ACCORD participant select part trial assign intervention improve blood fat level . This part study look effect lower LDL cholesterol blood triglyceride increase HDL cholesterol compare intervention lower LDL cholesterol , context good blood sugar control . A drug class drug call `` fibrates '' use low triglycerides increase HDL cholesterol , whereas drug class drug call `` statin '' use low LDL cholesterol . All ACCORD participant receive blood sugar treatment study . Based second trial ( Blood Pressure Lipid ) assign , participant also receive high blood pressure cholesterol care study . Study participant receive medication treatment relate study free charge . Individuals select consented participate ACCORD study continue see personal physician health care . In summary , ACCORD Study double 2x2 factorial design factor consist : intensive versus standard glycemic control , intensive versus standard blood pressure control , blind fenofibrate placebo combination simvastatin maintain desirable LDL-C level . All 10,251 participant randomize glycemic intervention ; subgroup 4,733 participant meet blood pressure entry criterion randomize blood pressure interventions one 2x2 trial ; distinct subgroup 5,518 participant meet lipid entry criterion randomize lipid intervention second 2x2 trial . All participant establish type 2 diabetes recruit 77 clinical center United States ( 64 site ) Canada ( 13 site ) . On February 6 , 2008 , National Heart , Lung Blood Institute ( NHLBI ) announce participant intensive glycemia treatment would transition ACCORD standard glycemic treatment approach due high mortality intensive treatment group terminate experimental arm Glycemia Trial early . The Blood Pressure Lipid trial continue design plan termination 2009 .</detailed_description>
