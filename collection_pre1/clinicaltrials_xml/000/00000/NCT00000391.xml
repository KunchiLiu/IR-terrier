	<brief_summary>To study safety toxicity intranasal peptide T ( D-Ala-1-peptide-T-amide ) human , find quickly much give dose enters bloodstream quickly leave bloodstream . To obtain information ability intranasal peptide T prevent , halt , and/or reverse effect AIDS central nervous system . Studies show AIDS cause retrovirus . This virus work inactivate destroy human CD4 cell ( part human immune system ) . This turn lead observe immunologic defect related illness , include HIV encephalopathy ( disease brain ) . One method prevent AIDS prevent HIV enter cell . HIV bind receptor CD4 site . Peptide T also bind site , thus compete site , block bind virus receptor . Preliminary animal human study indicate peptide T safe dos select trial . Thirty patient AIDS AIDS relate complex ( ARC ) enter study receive increase schedule three dosage level intranasal peptide T 12 - 16 week follow 1-month off-drug follow-up period subsequent 1-month return drug . All patient receive initial intravenous test dose peptide T. The test dose administer 1 hour , follow observation period 8 hour outpatient clinic .</brief_summary>
