	<brief_summary>This study design test clinical laboratory observation suggest IVIG give kidney transplant patient sensitize ( highly sensitive ) certain transplant antigen could result reduce sensitization reduce rate kidney rejection . Some ESRD patient highly sensitive certain transplant antigen ( foreign substance activate immune system ) must wait long time well-matched kidney become available . Transplant rejection likely among highly sensitize patient patient highly sensitize . There proven method improve highly-sensitized patient 's chance receive keep transplanted kidney .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Evaluation IV Gamma Globulin As Method Improve Kidney Transplant Survival Patients With End-Stage Renal Disease Who Are Highly Sensitized Transplant Antigens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Kidney transplantation treatment choice patient end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . However , many patient receive treatment due immune sensitization HLA antigens . IVIG show somewhat reduce anti-HLA antibody activity . By block activity , IVIG may make transplant feasible increase graft survival transplant recipient . Patients randomize receive IV infusion either 2 g/kg ( maximum dose 180 g ) IVIG 10 % S/D ( Gamimune-N , 10 % , manufacture Bayer ) placebo ( 0.1 % human albumin , manufacture Bayer ) time dialysis study entry monthly 3 month . If patient receive transplant 1 year , receive `` booster '' dose IVIG placebo ; patient receive another booster 24 month transplant still occur . If transplant occurs , patient receive 2 g/kg ( 180 g ) IVIG placebo monthly 4 month , begin time transplant . Before initiation IVIG/albumin placebo treatment , specific immune parameter , include panel reactive antibody ( PRA ) level , MLR , serum inhibition MLR , cytokine gene transcription MLR , AECA level measure . Outcomes study include time dialysis graft survival rate .</detailed_description>
