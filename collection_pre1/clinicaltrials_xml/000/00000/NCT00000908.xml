	<brief_summary>The purpose study see often Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia ( PCP ) occur HIV-positive patient stop take medication help prevent PCP . The risk develop PCP may decrease HIV-positive patient 's CD4 cell count ( cell immune system fight infection ) 200 cells/mm3 . This study look whether acceptable stop PCP prevention treatment patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Impact Stopping Treatment Prevention Pneumonia HIV-Positive Patients Receiving Anti-HIV Drugs Who Have Increased CD4 Cell Counts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The risk develop PCP may decrease treatment-induced recovery CD4 count &gt; 200 cells/mm3 . Few data exist confirm negate continue necessity PCP prophylaxis patient . This study assess effect discontinue therapy . Subjects ask discontinue PCP prophylaxis antiretroviral therapy result sustained CD4 increase great 200 cells/mm3 two measurement least 12 week apart . They evaluate symptom CD4 count every 8 week well plasma HIV-RNA every 16 week 18 month . Subjects whose CD4 count fall less 150 cells/mm3 150 200 cells/mm3 CD4 count re-evaluated immediately within 4 week . If second CD4 count le 200 cells/mm3 either case , conventional PCP prophylaxis resume subject follow study . Subjects follow study physical exam laboratory test Weeks 4 , 8 , every 8 week thereafter .</detailed_description>
