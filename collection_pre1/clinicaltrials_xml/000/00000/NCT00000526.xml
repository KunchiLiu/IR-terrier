	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Each year 400,000 people United States die suddenly coronary heart disease . The majority know coronary heart disease . Of , post-myocardial infarction population constitute large proportion . About 8 15 percent patient recover acute myocardial infarction die subsequent year . Half death usually sudden , presumably due arrhythmia . Advanced age , poor ventricular function , presence ventricular arrhythmias identify post-MI patient high risk sudden cardiac death all-cause mortality . A number clinical trial evaluate whether acute chronic anti-arrhythmic drug therapy reduce mortality post-MI patient . Of , use acute intravenous long-term beta-blockers , independently combination , show reduce mortality . However , beta-blockers many action addition anti-arrhythmic agent possible effect may particularly important prolong life . None clinical trial antiarrhythmic drug show significant benefit treatment , number even fail show positive trend . It certainly possible treatment ventricular premature depolarization , , lead reduction mortality , even sudden death . The study do , however , adequately addressed issue . Most study small select patient basis frequent ectopic beat . Moreover , appropriate drug optimal dos may use , adverse effect may well outweigh potential benefit . Poor compliance , perhaps due adverse effect , may also limited opportunity beneficial outcome . In effort address point , National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute initiate Cardiac Arrhythmia Pilot Study 1982 . The objective ass : whether post-MI patient document ventricular arrhythmia could identify enrolled double-blind clinical trial ; whether one drug could find effectively safely reduce ventricular premature depolarization one-year period ; whether dose-adjustment could carry , use ambulatory ECG 's ; whether good patient compliance could maintain . The Cardiac Arrhythmia Pilot Study , enrol 500 patient , evaluate four active drug ( encainide , ethmozine , flecainide , imipramine ) placebo . The study small determine whether drug effect mortality major morbidity . The study complete July 1986 . The pilot study demonstrate patient recruitment feasible , dose-adjustment could accomplish , good compliance protocol could achieve . Because encourage result pilot study , NHLBI conduct full-scale trial . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , double-blind . Enrollment begin June 1987 twenty-seven clinical center begin randomize 4,400 post-myocardial infarction patient placebo treatment encainide , flecainide , moricizine . Prior actual randomization , open-label titration period identify patient respond treatment . A total 1,727 patient respond randomize : 1,455 encainide , flecainide , placebo , 272 moricizine placebo . In April 1989 , encainide flecainide discontinue increased total mortality sudden arrhythmic death . CAST continue compare moricizine placebo 1,300 patient 18 month August 1991 moricizine portion trial stop early excess death . The primary outcome variable full-scale trial sudden cardiac death , total mortality secondary endpoint . Data analysis continue March 1998 .</detailed_description>
