	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety effectiveness soft-gel capsule formulation saquinavir ( SQV-SGC ) , protease inhibitor , give combination anti-HIV drug . SQV-SGC test adult treatment HIV infection , information still need SQV-SGC child . Recent study suggest soft-gel capsule form may safer effective protease inhibitor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Compare Two Anti-HIV Combination Therapies Each Containing Saquinavir HIV-Positive Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical trial adult child suggest SQV-SGC advantage protease inhibitor term tolerability , safety , effectiveness patient fail therapy protease inhibitor . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 11/24/99 : Pharmacokinetic data study demonstrate low expect plasma SQV exposure , particularly Arm 1 . Based data , patient study offer opportunity adjust dos . Ritonavir add Arm 1 regimen expect significantly increase SQV-SGC plasma level allow twice-daily dose SQV-SGC . ] Patients randomize one two study arm . Patients Arm 1 receive SQV-SGC plus two [ AS PER AMENDMENT 11/24/99 : one two ] NRTIs choice . Patients Arm 2 receive SQV-SGC plus NFV plus one two NRTIs choice . All participant evaluate physical examination laboratory test study follow incidence death , cancer , fetal abnormality . NRTIs provide part study . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 11/24/99 : This study close accrual . All subject follow-up ( Cohort 1 ) give option either discontinue participation ACTG 397 participate next phase study ( version 2.0 ) . Those elect continue participation constitute Cohort 1A . The adjusted Arm 1 regimen consist SQV-SGC plus ritonavir plus one two NRTIs . Ritonavir provide part study . The Arm 2 regimen study drug change maximum allowable dose SQV-SGC increase 1,200 mg twice-daily 1,600 mg twice-daily . Participants continue follow physical examination laboratory evaluation include intensive pharmacokinetics study Day 14 new regimen . ]</detailed_description>
