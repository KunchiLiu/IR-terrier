	<brief_summary>This study compare 2 different anti-HIV drug regimen determine effective lowering amount HIV blood . The anti-HIV drug use study 2 protease inhibitor ( nelfinavir ritonavir ) , 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( stavudine didanosine ) , 1 nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( nevirapine ) . These drug combination previously study adult , limited information well work HIV-infected child . It important develop drug combination effective suppress HIV virus child .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Compare Two Different Anti-HIV Drug Regimens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use combination therapy 2 antiretroviral agent strongly support recent study child adult . However , yet , combination antiretrovirals study large cohort stable HIV-1 infect , antiretroviral-experienced child . Evidence suggest viral suppression may difficult achieve child . Therefore , important develop new drug combination maximally suppress plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration child . Patients stratify prior antiretroviral treatment ( zidovudine [ ZDV ] /lamivudine [ 3TC ] versus d4T/other treatment ) age ( 24 month versus 24 month old ) . Patients randomize 1 4 treatment group . Arm A1 : ddI/NFV/RTV ( prior ZDV/3TC-treated patient ) . Arm A2 : ddI/NFV/RTV ( prior d4T/other-treated patient ) . Arm B1 : d4T/NFV/NVP ( prior ZDV/3TC-treated patient ) . Arm B2 : d4T/NFV/NVP ( prior d4T/other-treated patient ) . Treatment administer 48 week . At Weeks 2 , 4 , every 4 week thereafter , patient undergo physical examination , blood sample draw measure viral load . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 4/27/00 : Patients Arms A1 A2 may continue receive medication additional 24 week . While treatment extension , patient must continue current schedule study drug administration completion study visit . Patients Arms A1 A2 reach Week 44 participate enteric-coated ddI pharmacokinetic study part 24-week extension . Patients enrol Arms A1 A2 take study reach Week 48 may re-enter onto study Week 52 regardless number week study . ]</detailed_description>
