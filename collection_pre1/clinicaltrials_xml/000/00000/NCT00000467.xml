	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Coronary atherosclerosis begin childhood express adulthood angina pectoris , myocardial infarction , sudden death . The early lesion vascular system fatty streak , characterize accumulation lipid intima . These lesion present vessel infant young child . Whether fatty streaks precursor complex lesion controversial . However , fibrous plaque , intimal lesion consist central core extracellular lipid cover cap fibromuscular tissue , frequently see child 15 year age . In addition , necropsy study United States battle casualty confirm presence advance coronary lesion young adult . Thus , appear atherosclerotic process well establish American population young adulthood . Epidemiologic study adults find associate development coronary artery disease number risk factor include age , sex , hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , cigarette smoking , diabetes , family history coronary artery disease , obesity , lack physical activity , perhaps coronary prone behavior . Of modifiable factor , hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , cigarette smoking great predictive value . A small reduction serum cholesterol level child modest diet change , hypothesize , would reduce coronary heart disease . More severe dietary restriction , case conjunction medication , recommend high-risk pediatric population . In addition , surveillance blood pressure , avoidance cigarette smoking overweight , regular physical exercise prudent recommendation child . The National Children Youth Fitness Study ( NCYFS ) offer new standard measure fitness , profile youth exercise habit , help explain contribution exercise fitness . Nationwide , 8,000 fifth- twelfth-graders 140 school 19 state participate study February May 1984 . Findings reveal youth substantially body fat counterpart 1960 's approximately half student perform sufficient physical activity maintain effective cardiorespiratory functioning . Results 1985 national survey drug use among high school student indicate initial experience smoke occur high school , 13 percent student begin prior tenth grade . Substantial increase smoke occur seventh eighth grade inner city Hispanic student show high smoking rate white Black inner city youth . Although debate cut-off point child might consider risk coronary heart disease , estimate 36-60 percent child United States exhibit least one modifiable risk factor coronary disease age 12 . The nation 's school may provide appropriate efficient vehicle reduce cardiovascular risk large population . About 47 million child young people attend 115,000 public private school . These student school 5 8 hour day , 5 day per week , nearly 36 week per year . Furthermore , school food service provide 20 percent total daily caloric intake school day child select school lunch program . Currently , school-based health promotion program conceptualize include curriculum related organizational factor support healthy behavior . The existence comprehensive program limit throughout nation . The result numerous school-based nutrition study report change student ' knowledge nutrition . Several study base social learn theory report change behavior knowledge nutrition . Although health education intervention may succeed increase child 's knowledge produce change behavioral intention behavior , behavioral change may maintain unless school environment child 's parent reinforce intention . Substantial progress field cigarette smoke prevention youth make past year . Researchers focus prevention cigarette smoke several reason . First , cigarette smoking major risk factor chronic disease coronary heart disease , cancer , emphysema . Second , cigarette smoke widespread form drug dependence society . Third , cigarette smoking occur toward begin developmental progression substance abuse consequently generally regarded one so-called 'gateway ' substance . A recent review indicate promising cigarette smoke prevention approach focus psychosocial factor promote initiation cigarette smoke . Such approach fall two general category : ( ) focus social influence believe promote substance use , ( b ) provide cop skill train design enhance personal social competence . Results recent 24-month study involve 689 sixth-grade elementary student show youth receive health information skill intervention le intention smoke less cigarette use youth receive intervention health information alone . Prior study use peer-led model seventh grader report similar result . The research literature effect physical activity promotion sparse . One intervention study physical activity school child report increase endurance fitness reduce body fat associate intensive daily physical program Australian Health Fitness Study . This randomize , control trial design compare effect integrated physical activity health education program body fat , blood pressure , endurance fitness 10-year-old school child primary school locate Adelaide . The Oslo Youth Study successful design implement within school system comprehensive health educational program involve grade 5-7 . Positive result obtain intervention group relative reference group reduction smoke onset , improve eating habit , increase physical activity two-year period . Over past ten year , school-based research study become theoretically-grounded employed sophisticate research design strategies measurement technique . The prevention cigarette smoke major focus research . There still considerable need build base scientific knowledge development dietary , smoking , exercise habit childhood intervention effective school setting . DESIGN NARRATIVE : CATCH consist three-and-a-half year feasibility study conduct September 1987 March 1991 , main trial begin April 1991 , Tracking Study , 1996 follow-up study allow measurement cohort age 13 14 year . The purpose feasibility study test acceptability intervention measurement 1,471 third , fourth , fifth grade boy girl , age 7 11 . The main component Phase I intervention program eight school include classroom curriculum third , fourth , fifth grade ; home curriculum design involve parent child CATCH activity home family fun night enhance family involvement ; physical activity program center around new physical activity curriculum ; school nutrition program school food service director staff . Blood sample obtain 1,045 child risk factor screen . Other measurement include blood pressure , height , weight , triceps , subscapular skinfolds . Nutrient intake pilot-tested interactive 24-hour recall approach , supplement food record , home food inventory , follow-up call parent . Physical activity measure physical activity interview Caltrac motion sensor . The main trial Phase II , begin 1991 end 1994 , include two study group , Intervention Group Control Group , total approximately 8,000 student . The measurement cohort include 5,107 student . The Intervention Group receive school-based program consist CATCH curriculum , physical education program , school food service program , program establish smoke-free school . One-half Intervention Group receive school-based program plus family-based program . The Control Group receive usual health curriculum control school none CATCH intervention . The primary endpoint school level reduction fat saturate fat school lunch increase moderate vigorous activity PE class . The primary endpoint student level serum cholesterol change third fifth grade . Secondary endpoint include health knowledge , self-efficacy behavioral skill relate adoption maintenance cardiovascular health behavior ; dietary fat intake ; dietary sodium intake ; physical activity ; systolic blood pressure . The unit randomization elementary school . Schools recruit participation randomly assign study group . Twenty-four school recruit four participate field center total 96 school . In center , ten 24 school assign Control Group 14 Intervention Group . Among 14 intervention school , seven randomly assign school-based intervention alone seven school-based family component . Measures behavioral outcome process variable make grade three five . Physiological measurement make baseline grade three end grade five . Final measurement complete May 1994 . Close-out final data analysis conduct latter part 1995 1996 . The major result paper publish JAMA March 1996 . Ten major mainstream paper publish Preventive Medicine 1996 . The Tracking Study CATCH III , begin December 1994 , follow cohort early adolescence sixth eighth grade . The objective measure effect CATCH II intervention program subsequent smoke prevalence rate end eighth grade observe onset , development , inter-correlation cardiovascular risk factor early middle adolescence cohort . There CATCH intervention . Psychosocial measure , dietary fitness , smoke data collect annually . The full panel physiological measure biochemical validation smoking conduct last semester eighth grade . CATCH III end November 1999 . The study active November 2000 U01-HL-47098 , coordinate center . In August 1996 , homocysteine substudy add CATCH . The substudy use serum sample collect eighth grader spring 1997 analyse homocysteine , folic acid , vitamin B-12 , vitamin B-6 , lipid , lipoprotein , blood pressure , weight height . A mail survey conduct collect data child 's family history cardiovascular disease vitamin supplementation . The result paper publish JAMA 1998 . The CATCH-ON Study begin 1998 . It 's purpose assess degree CATCH intervention goal ( reduction fat saturate fat school meal , increase physical activity , tobacco use , implementation CATCH curriculum ) maintain institutionalized original 56 CATCH intervention school 20 control school . CATCH-ON Phase IV end March 31 , 2001 . To determine influence secular trend , outcome measure also assess 12 newly recruit ( unexposed ) school . Measures school climate , teacher staff characteristic , school turbulence school facility resource assess help explain variation degree institutionalization CATCH intervention control school .</detailed_description>
