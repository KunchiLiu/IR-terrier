	<brief_summary>To determine whether preoperative use prism eyeglass improve outcome surgery acquire esotropia , type strabismus . To determine whether patient respond prism adaptation develop new stable angle -deviation well surgical result patient respond prism adaptation . To determine whether patient respond prism adaptation accurately correct operate prism-adapted angle original angle deviation . To determine usefulness certain input variable ( e.g. , age time surgery , size deviation , visual acuity , binocular function , refractive error ) predicting patient likely benefit prism adaptation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Prism Adaptation Study ( PAS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acquired esotropia ( crossed eye develop child reach age 6 month ) account 25 percent patient misalign eye . Surgery correct esotropia do primarily attain functional use two eye together . The cosmetic aspect surgery secondary . In 40 50 percent case , one operation need accomplish primary goal , case even three four operation need . Preliminary study two eye care center report use prism eyeglass month surgery lead good result single operation 90 percent patient . These uncontrolled preliminary study point need multicenter , randomize , control clinical trial design prove disprove scientifically beneficial effect prism . The Prism Adaptation Study double randomization trial involve 286 patient . Three-fifths patient randomly select prism adaptation surgery . Of patient respond prism , one-half randomly select surgery base amount prism require stabilize deviation , half surgery base amount esotropia originally measure . Patients respond prism also surgery base amount esotropia measure , two-fifths patient undergo prism adaptation . Patients examine postoperatively 1 week , 1 month , 3 month , 6 month , 1 year . An independent examiner , mask treatment assignment , evaluated patient 6-month followup . The result analyze determine whether outcome good patient underwent prism adaptation underwent conventional treatment . Because examiner know type treatment patient receive , would bias evaluate result .</detailed_description>
