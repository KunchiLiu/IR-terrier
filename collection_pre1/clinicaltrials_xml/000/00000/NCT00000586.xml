	<brief_title>Multicenter Study Hydroxyurea Patients With Sickle Cell Anemia ( MSH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In spite fact advance make management prevention complication sickle cell disease , management common complication -- painful crisis -- still unsatisfactory , appropriate method prevention unknown . The morbidity associate painful crisis much suffering pain alone . The interference normal lifestyle , result obstacle obtain education hold job , risk narcotic addiction , cost multiple hospitalization , financial impact family individual must consider . Evidence Cooperative Study Sickle Cell Disease ( CSSCD ) study show association multiple pain event early death young adult . If association true , MSH potential reduce morbidity mortality well . The CSSCD study show 50 percent patient sickle cell disease least one crisis per year , considerable number . These episode believe occur result hemoglobin S within red cell lead rigid , non-deformable cell longer traverse microvasculature result produce obstruction consequent pain , ischemia , tissue necrosis . Previous approach therapy group disorder include : attempt modify hemoglobin molecule prevent polymerization ; use vasoreactive drug ; increase red cell volume . All attempt abandon either inefficacy , toxicity , impracticality . Chronic exchange transfusion program limit usefulness high rate isoimmunization , iron overload , risk transmission hepatitis retroviral disease . The rationale present study draw substance observation patient high level fetal hemoglobin ( Hb F ) ( particularly Saudi Arabian group ) , infant also high Hb F level few crisis . Several myelosuppressive drug , 5-azacytidine hydroxyurea , show increase Hb F production . The work 5-azacytidine abandon know risk malignancy . Preliminary study investigator others show convincingly Hb F level increase administer hydroxyurea patient several month period without produce dangerous level myelosuppression . The patient also rise red cell life span hematocrit . Further , report patient dramatic decrease crisis frequency . This agent readily available physician , evidence use without adequate justification , possibly , without adequate monitoring . The timing study therefore critical ensure adequate answer question efficacy obtain risk inappropriate use minimize . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Phase I conclude . Phase II , also conclude , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial . Patients Phase II trial recruit 21 clinic randomize receive hydroxyurea placebo . The hydroxyurea gradually increased initial dose 15 mg/kg maximal level tolerate patient order maximize red blood cell hemoglobin F ( Hb F ) content without undue marrow suppression . Changes Hb F production monitor two group variety laboratory test . The primary endpoint comparison crisis rate treat control group . Painful crisis define pain lasting longer four hour , require parenteral narcotic relief , include chest syndrome exclude ankle ulcer pain . Secondary endpoint include change pain severity duration , psychosocial status , complication disease , reason non-compliance either regimen . Patients follow two three year depend enter study . Because mutagenic nature hydroxyurea , use contraception requirement admission study . The trial stop early , January 14 , 1995 , instead May 1995 . The Data Safety Monitoring Board determine daily dos hydroxyurea reduce frequency painful episode hospital admission crises 50 percent . Beginning 1996 , five year follow-up adult patient MSH initiate . The purpose ascertain long-term effect hydroxyurea patient population . Patients follow annually determine health status , quality life , incidence malignancy , birth defect offspring . In addition , mortality rate determine comparison could make cohort mortality data Cooperative Study Sickle Cell Disease ( CSSCD ) adult cohort normal African-American population mortality data . The follow-up conduct three phase . Phase I Planning Phase final protocol develop , last three month . Phase II , patient entry March 1996 June 1996 patient follow-up , extend fourth 48th month . Phase III , patient exit data analysis , carry final nine month study . The DSMB stop MSH Phase III early study show hydroxyurea substantially reduced frequency vaso-occlusive ( painful ) crisis .</detailed_description>
