	<brief_summary>This study test effectiveness different treatment three commonly diagnose condition low backbone ( lumbar spine ) . The purpose learn two commonly prescribed treatment ( surgery nonsurgical therapy ) work well specific type low back pain . In part study , treat patient spinal stenosis ( narrow space backbone result pressure spinal cord and/or nerve root ) cause degenerative spondylolisthesis ( condition one vertebra , spinal bone , slip forward another ) either surgery nonsurgical method . This study cover cost treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial ( SPORT ) : Degenerative Spondylolisthesis With Spinal Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low back pain consider one widely experienced health problem U.S. world . It second frequent condition , common cold , patient see physician lose day work . Estimated cost severely disable low back pain range $ 30-70 billion annually . Rates spinal surgery U.S. increase sharply time , researcher document 15-fold geographic variation rate surgery . In many case , one live one see condition appear determine rate surgery . Despite trend , little evidence prove effectiveness therapy nonsurgical management . This study use National Spine Network conduct multicenter , randomize , control trial three common diagnostic group spine surgery perform : lumbar intervertebral disc herniation ( IDH ) , spinal stenosis ( SpS ) , spinal stenosis secondary degenerative spondylolisthesis ( DS ) . This arm trial deal patient third diagnostic group . The study compare commonly use standard surgical treatment commonly use standard nonsurgical treatment . We conduct study 12 site throughout United States . The primary endpoint study change health-related quality life measure SF-36 health status questionnaire . Secondary endpoint include patient satisfaction treatment , utility current health order estimate quality-adjusted life year ( QALYS ) measure cost-effectiveness , resource use , cost . We follow patient 6 week 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 month determine health status , function , satisfaction , health care use . We anticipate enroll randomly allocate total 300 study participant arm trial . We track additional observational cohort ass health resource outcome . Enrollment Observational cohort complete February 2003 . We integrate data trial observational cohort formally estimate cost-effectiveness surgical versus nonsurgical intervention IDH , SpS , DS . The result trial provide , first time , scientific evidence relative effectiveness surgical versus nonsurgical treatment three commonly diagnose lumbar spine condition .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Duration Symptoms : 12 week . Treatments Tried : Nonsteroidal . antiinflammatory medical therapy physical therapy . Surgical Screening : Pain low back , buttock , low extremity become bad lumbar extension . Must confirm evidence central centrallateral compression cauda equina degenerative lesion facet joint , disc , ligamentum flavum MRI , compute tomography scan , myelogram . Tests : MRI confirm diagnosis level ( ) . Previous lumbar spine surgery . Not surgical candidate reason : Overall health make spinal surgery lifethreatening appropriate alternative , patient improve dramatically conservative care , patient unable ( reason ) undergo surgery within 6 month . Possible pregnancy . Active malignancy : Patients history invasive malignancy ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer ) ineligible unless treat curative intent AND clinical sign symptom malignancy least 5 year . Current fracture , infection , and/or deformity ( great 15 degree lumbar scoliosis , use Cobb measure technique ) spine . Age le 18 year . Cauda equina syndrome progressive neurologic deficit ( usually require urgent surgery ) . Unavailability followup ( plan move , telephone , etc . ) inability complete data survey . Symptoms le 12 week . Patient currently enrol experimental `` spine relate '' study .</criteria>
