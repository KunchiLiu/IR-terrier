	<brief_summary>To follow patient enrol original Ischemic Optic Neuropathy Decompression Trial ( IONDT ) determine ( 1 ) incidence non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy ( NAION ) second eye , ( 2 ) change visual acuity time study second eye , ( 3 ) aspects natural history NAION .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ischemic Optic Neuropathy Decompression Trial Followup ( IONDT Followup )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NAION common cause acute optic nerve disease elderly , cause permanent severe visual loss . No proven treatment currently exist reverse arrest loss . There accepted method prevention reduction likelihood second eye involvement . NAION strike eye many 40 percent affect patient ( Beri et al . 1987 ) , 2-year risk 25 percent ( Steven Feldon , personal communication SEK ) . IONDT compare optic nerve decompression surgery ( ONDS ) , become widely use treatment NAION , careful followup alone , patient newly diagnose NAION . The rationale surgery NAION cause impaired blood flow optic nerve decompression surgery would restore vision alleviate pressure surround nerve . Because ONDS fast become standard care , evaluation safety efficacy procedure test context randomized clinical trial . Within 2 year start IONDT , Data Safety Monitoring Committee recommend cessation clinical trial recruitment . The National Institutes Health issue clinical alert 25,000 ophthalmologist neurologist describe study finding surgery well careful followup may harmful ( IONDT 1995 ) . It recommend ONDS used case NAION . Thus , IONDT finding lead costly ineffective surgery abandon treatment NAION , also leave practitioner dearth treatment choice . The IONDT first multicenter , prospective study newly diagnose patient NAION . The baseline history examination , take place within 14 day onset symptom , use standardize method diagnostic criterion collect data factor possibly relate etiology NAION . In report previous study present data initial final visual acuity , data available regard change visual acuity time individual patient . Where data available final visual acuity , report rate improvement low , range 0 percent 33 percent untreated eye . The IONDT find , however , improvement three line 42.7 percent patient receive careful followup . NAION eyes report 10.5 percent many 73 percent patient . In study bilateral NAION patient prospectively log , Beri et al . report 17.5 percent patient develop bilateral disease 1 year followup 34.5 percent develop 5 year . However , Beck et al. , use life table analysis cohort report Beri et al. , estimate risk bilateral NAION 12 percent within 2 year 19 percent within 5 year . The IONDT far similarly report 12 percent ( 25/216 ) incidence bilateral NAION randomize patient . The incidence nonrandomized group , 91 percent visual acuity well 20/64 , much low 4 percent ( 5/136 ) . Thus , continue followup IONDT cohort critically important ascertain clear picture natural history NAION term involvement second eye long-term vision . Data obtain critical understanding etiology disease generate hypothesis test treatment disease . The IONDT Followup Study continue monitor vision health outcome patient originally enrol IONDT , whether randomize one two treatment group whether follow part natural history cohort . All IONDT patient diagnose NAION within 14 day onset symptom , minimum 2 year continuous followup , follow additional 4 year Followup Study . Patients annual visit original IONDT Clinical Center , necessary , surrogate provider . If NAION occur second eye , patient ask visit clinic special visit . The Coordinating Center telephone patient quarterly basis , annual visit . Outcomes examine include : - incidence NAION second eye , - medical ocular event surround occurrence NAION , - visual acuity ( measure use New York Lighthouse chart ) . In event NAION event second eye , patient 's visual field test use Humphrey Perimeter .</detailed_description>
