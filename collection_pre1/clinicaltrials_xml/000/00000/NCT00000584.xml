	<brief_title>Transfusion-Transmitted Cytomegalovirus Prevention Neonates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Premature infant require multiple blood transfusion 15-30 percent incidence cytomegalovirus infection . Many infection result severe disease , mortality 20 percent . In theory , infection could avoid use blood blood product exclusively CMV antibody negative donor . The use blood impractical would require rejection approximately 40 percent blood donor . Studies suggest passively acquire antibody could reduce incidence disease expose neonate . This provide rationale use passive immunization hyperimmune globin premature infant likely require multiple transfusion . Lots high titer CMV immune globulin suitable intravenous administration prepare use technique screen outdated blood bank plasma unit high level antibody CMV . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , double-blind . Subjects receive either prophylactic CMVIG-intravenously placebo . Infants follow 12 week discharge . Total sample size expect 650 .
