	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease major health problem lead cause hospital admission United States . A severe form chronic obstructive pulmonary disease accompany weight loss commonly refer pulmonary cachexia . Studies 1960s demonstrated association chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patient weight loss , low FEV1 , early mortality . This observation strengthen retrospective analysis Intermittent Positive Pressure Breathing Trial data suggest malnutrition independent predictor outcome men chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . The underlying basis relate malnutrition adverse outcome chronic obstructive pulmonary disease unknown , although large body information indicate pulmonary cachexia associate respiratory muscle atrophy , myofibrillar substrate depletion , impaired skeletal respiratory muscle function . The primary question whether nutrition-related functional deficit observe underweight patient could reverse . The first three year study support pilot project oral nutrition therapy malnourish chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patient . DESIGN NARRATIVE : All subject underwent intubation initial test interval subsequently underwent dietary counseling oral nutritional supplement two-month stabilization phase . Subjects demonstrate adequate weight gain define achievement 90 percent ideal body weight unable tolerate intubation eliminate investigation . Eligible subject randomize either ENS dietary counseling . Subjects randomize ENS receive enteral supplementation Osmolite deliver continuous infusion pump . Feedings continuous nocturnal sixteen week order deliver caloric intake 1.7 time rest energy value . Following intervention phase , subject maintain dietary counseling monthly basis oral nutritional supplement . Outcome variable measure stabilization phase , eight sixteen week intervention phase , eight sixteen week post-intervention phase . The primary outcome variable muscle strength effect exercise performance , dyspnea , quality life . Secondary outcome variable include morbidity mortality . The grant extend November 1995 data analysis . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
