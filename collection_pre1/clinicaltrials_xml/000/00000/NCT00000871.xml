	<brief_summary>To expand available data regard safety immunogenicity 2 HIV-1 vaccine strategy : canarypox vector vCP205 , vCP205 SF-2 rgp120 . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 7/2/98 : To obtain immunogenicity safety data gp120 subunit may induce enhance neutralize antibody response primary isolate HIV-1 context previous immunization canarypox vector express HIV antigen ( vCP205 ) . To evaluate cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses 1 2 year initial vaccination vCP205 plus rgp120 SF-2 vCP205 alone . ] In previous ALVAC vCP205/SF-2 rgp 120 study , patient develop antibody neutralize homologous laboratory strain ; 50 % patient develop CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response HIV env gag epitope point study . This Phase II study seek confirm result among person low high risk HIV infection new lot ALVAC vCP205 , dose suitable potential large-scale trial . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 7/2/98 : Addition AIDSVAX B/B AIDSVAX B/E boost start least 12 month receive rgp120 ALVAC vaccine may induce enhance neutralize antibody response deem prior study thus plan `` follow-up '' therapy . ]</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In previous ALVAC vCP205/SF-2 rgp 120 study , patient develop antibody neutralize homologous laboratory strain ; 50 % patient develop CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response HIV env gag epitope point study . This Phase II study seek confirm result among person low high risk HIV infection new lot ALVAC vCP205 , dose suitable potential large-scale trial . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 7/2/98 : Addition AIDSVAX B/B AIDSVAX B/E boost start least 12 month receive rgp120 ALVAC vaccine may induce enhance neutralize antibody response deem prior study thus plan `` follow-up '' therapy . ] Volunteers recruit screen ; enrol stratify risk status 2 group : individual lower-risk behavior HIV individual higher-risk behavior HIV . Volunteers randomly assign arm A , B , C receive immunization month 0 , 1 , 3 , 6 follow : Group A- ALVAC vCP205 plus SF-2 rgp120 MF59 . Group B- ALVAC vCP205 plus saline placebo . Group C- Placebo-ALVAC plus saline placebo . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 7/2/98 : Beginning 12-18 month initial vaccination , 2 , 6 , 12 month later , 10 volunteer group A receive saline placebo , 50 volunteer group B C rerandomized within respective group , treat follow . Group B ( subgroup 1 ) - AIDSVAX B/B . Group B ( subgroup 2 ) - AIDSVAX B/E . Group B ( subgroup 3 ) - alum placebo . Group C ( subgroup 1 ) - AIDSVAX B/B . Group C ( subgroup 2 ) - AIDSVAX B/E . Group C ( subgroup 3 ) - alum placebo . ] Volunteers follow 2 year test humoral immune response HIV-1 . Neutralizing activity HIV-1 perform subset volunteer monitor CTL response . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 7/2/98 : Volunteers receive AIDSVAX B/B AIDSVAX B/E additionally study formation various neutralize antibody parameter cellular immunity . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 4/30/99 : Because subunit boost add version 3.0 available , subunit boost portion version 3.0 cancel . ]</detailed_description>
