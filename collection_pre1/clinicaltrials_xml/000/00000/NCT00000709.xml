	<brief_summary>To provide accurate complete neurologic assessment course AIDS dementia complex patient treat zidovudine ( AZT ) . The study determine frequently patient improve , long improvement sustain , magnitude functional significance improvement . Individuals AIDS frequently suffer central nervous system ( CNS ) problem characterize cognitive , motor , behavioral deficit , disorder know AIDS dementia complex . Clinical experience suggest course often progressive , go initial symptom moderate severe dementia within several month . Accumulating evidence suggests direct brain infection HIV virus likely cause AIDS dementia complex . Case report suggest therapy AZT , show strong inhibitor HIV replication vitro , may alleviate AIDS dementia complex . This study help define natural history AIDS dementia complex treat patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Individuals AIDS frequently suffer central nervous system ( CNS ) problem characterize cognitive , motor , behavioral deficit , disorder know AIDS dementia complex . Clinical experience suggest course often progressive , go initial symptom moderate severe dementia within several month . Accumulating evidence suggests direct brain infection HIV virus likely cause AIDS dementia complex . Case report suggest therapy AZT , show strong inhibitor HIV replication vitro , may alleviate AIDS dementia complex . This study help define natural history AIDS dementia complex treat patient . All patient receive AZT 24 week . Patients see weekly first 4 week , every week next 8 week , every 4 week completion study neuropsychological evaluation . This evaluation include lumbar puncture , either computerized tomography magnetic resonance imaging .</detailed_description>
