	<brief_title>Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( DRS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>By 1950s , diabetic retinopathy become leading cause blindness visual disability United States . The use photocoagulation treat proliferative retinopathy gain widespread use ophthalmic practice follow introduction 1959 . However , study photocoagulation incorporate basic principle control clinical trial , involve inadequate number patient . Consequently , inadequate evidence actual value procedure . Because clinical importance diabetic retinopathy increase use photocoagulation management , Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( DRS ) begin 1971 . This randomize , control clinical trial involve 1,700 patient enrol 15 medical center . One eye patient randomly assign immediate photocoagulation followup without treatment , regardless course follow either eye . The eye choose photocoagulation randomly assign either two treatment technique , one use argon laser xenon arc photocoagulator . Patients follow 4-month interval accord protocol provide measurement best correct visual acuity . Treatment usually complete one two sitting include scatter ( panretinal ) photocoagulation extend beyond vortex vein ampulae . The argon treatment technique specify 800 1,600 , 500-micron scatter burn 0.1 second duration direct treatment new vessel whether within one disc diameter optic disc ( NVD ) outside area ( NVE ) . Focal treatment also apply microaneurysms lesion think cause macular edema . Followup treatment apply need 4-month interval . The xenon technique similar , scatter burn few number , generally long duration , strong , direct treatment apply NVE surface retina .</detailed_description>
