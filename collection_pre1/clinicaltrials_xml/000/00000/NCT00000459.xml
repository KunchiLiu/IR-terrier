	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Several line evidence provide rationale intervening child . A large body autopsy pathologic evidence accumulate show atherosclerosis , include fatty streak , increase surface involvement , advance microscopic lesion , begin childhood . Blood cholesterol level track childhood adulthood , track correlation range .6 .8 . Therefore , high proportion child high level cholesterol high level adult . Family cluster risk factor also report . Studies show 2-3 time increase prevalence coronary heart disease adult relatives child high cholesterol compare child normal cholesterol , 2.2 time increased prevalence high cholesterol child parent grandparent premature coronary heart disease compare child family history premature heart disease . Finally , high likelihood environmental influence coronary heart disease risk factor behavioral antecents childhood . Thus , dietary habit contribute toward elevate blood cholesterol level likely develop early life , hop behavioral change achieve childhood likely persist adulthood . Although numerous study show dietary modification could lower blood cholesterol level adult , study show effect child , none long-term . Furthermore , impact long-term growth development child study . Concerns raise safety cholesterol-lowering diet child , particularly peak grow year . These concern include possible deficit growth nutrient adequacy , potential adverse psychological effect . This paucity data potential barrier active prevention measure . To fill gap knowledge , DISC trial , randomize , control clinical trial , test efficacy safety long-term dietary intervention reduction serum LDL-C level child puberty . DESIGN NARRATIVE : In feasibility study , child sex , age 8 10 baseline starting 1987 , randomize either control group usual care group intensive dietary intervention child family direct . The feasibility study last 16 month . The full-scale trial begin December 1988 randomization total 663 child . At baseline , mean LDL-C level , nutrient intake , anthropometric measurement , nutritional biochemical level , psychosocial measure similar two group . The intervention group assign series group individual session teach child family follow diet contain 28 percent calorie total fat , dietary cholesterol intake less 75 mg/1000 kcal , 9 % calorie polyunsaturated fat . The diet design meet nutritional requirement grow child . The usual care group provide packet general dietary information . The primary efficacy outcome difference change LDL-C level two group 36 month . Primary safety endpoint change height serum ferritin level . Secondary safety outcome include serum zinc , retinol , albumin level , red blood cell folate , ratio LDL-C high-density lipoprotein cholesterol , sexual maturation , cognitive development , psychosocial assessment . Recruitment complete July 1990 . Intervention follow-up extend 1997 participant average 17 year old . Data analysis continue January 1999 . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
