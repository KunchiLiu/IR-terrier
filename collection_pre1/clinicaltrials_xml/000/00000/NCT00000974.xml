	<brief_summary>To evaluate delivery single dose aerosolize pentamidine child ; evaluate tolerance pentamidine administration mask ; compare intravenous pentamidine first dose pharmacokinetics ( blood level ) child information previously collect adult ; compare plasma pentamidine level child aerosolize treatment level previously collect adult . Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia ( PCP ) common serious infection child AIDS associate high death rate . Current approve treatment include intravenous trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole ( TMP / SMX ) intravenous pentamidine , effective treatment first episode PCP pneumonia . However , therapy 50 percent great incidence adverse reaction . Because serious toxicity , drug treatment discontinue . Animal study show aerosolized pentamidine ( pentamidine give inhalation ) effective intravenous pentamidine . It hop aerosolize route less toxic intravenous pentamidine . The study first step evaluate delivery aerosolize pentamidine child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia ( PCP ) common serious infection child AIDS associate high death rate . Current approve treatment include intravenous trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole ( TMP / SMX ) intravenous pentamidine , effective treatment first episode PCP pneumonia . However , therapy 50 percent great incidence adverse reaction . Because serious toxicity , drug treatment discontinue . Animal study show aerosolized pentamidine ( pentamidine give inhalation ) effective intravenous pentamidine . It hop aerosolize route less toxic intravenous pentamidine . The study first step evaluate delivery aerosolize pentamidine child . Sixteen patient assign one follow group . Group 1 ( four patient ) receive intravenous pentamidine one-time dose , infuse 2 hour . Group 2a ( six patient ) receive aerosolized pentamidine via face mask . Group 2b ( six patient ) receive aerosolized pentamidine 2 time . Group 2b study initial dose well tolerate . Small amount ( 1 - 2 cubic centimeter ) blood take group 40 minute , 2 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 24 hour begin pentamidine treatment time lung biopsy bronchial alveolar lavage . Patients give routine TMP / SMX ( whatever medication consider appropriate patient 's primary physician medical management ) dose 1 - 2 hour pentamidine give . Bronchial alveolar lavage fluid lung tissue biopsy obtain 2 - 48 hour initiation pentamidine treatment ( optionally 10 - 24 hour post dose ) .</detailed_description>
