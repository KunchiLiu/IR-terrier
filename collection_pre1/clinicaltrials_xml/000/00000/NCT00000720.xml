	<brief_summary>To evaluate clinical , immunologic , virologic effect oral zidovudine ( AZT ) plus intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) versus AZT plus placebo ( albumin ) . It estimate 1991 , may 10,000 20,000 HIV-infected child United States . HIV infection child often associate symptomatic disease poor prognosis . Treatment antiviral therapy may effective change course disease decrease mortality vulnerable population . AZT treatment show decrease mortality frequency opportunistic infection certain adult AIDS patient ; therefore , likely child may also benefit antiviral therapy . In addition , bacterial infection frequently find HIV-infected child . Because pooled human serum immunoglobulin , another name antibody , effective reduce bacterial infection patient defect immunity , may reduce rate bacterial infection HIV-infected child well . In study , AZT administer together IVIG determine safety , tolerance , efficacy combine treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It estimate 1991 , may 10,000 20,000 HIV-infected child United States . HIV infection child often associate symptomatic disease poor prognosis . Treatment antiviral therapy may effective change course disease decrease mortality vulnerable population .

In addition , bacterial infection frequently find HIV-infected child . Because pooled human serum immunoglobulin , another name antibody , effective reduce bacterial infection patient defect immunity , may reduce rate bacterial infection HIV-infected child well . In study , AZT administer together IVIG determine safety , tolerance , efficacy combine treatment . The study include 250 child , 3 month 12 year age . All participant receive oral AZT . IVIG intravenous placebo administer every 28 day . Patients follow development serious bacterial infection , well number factor relate safety , tolerance , progression disease , survival . This outpatient study conduct minimum 100-week period . The child evaluate every 2 week first 8 week , monthly thereafter .</detailed_description>
