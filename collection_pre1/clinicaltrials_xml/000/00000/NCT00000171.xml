	<brief_summary>This protocol multicenter clinical trial melatonin sleep disturbance associate Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . Frequent nocturnal awakening common behavioral symptom AD . Nighttime wander agitate behavior may result injury sleep disruption caregiver . Alternatives sorely need currently available sleep medication marginal efficacy serious side effect . Melatonin naturally occur hormone secrete pineal gland . It soporific effect oral administration well tolerate . It enhance sleep normal old people .

	<detailed_description>In Alzheimer 's disease , sleep disruption one common behavioral problem , occur 45 percent patient . These nocturnal awakening agitation lead considerable burden caregiver frequently lead family decision nursing home placement . The propose study randomize , double blind , parallel group , placebo control , clinical trial . Placebo compare two dos melatonin : 2.5 mg , slow- release preparation 10 mg immediate release preparation . One hundred fifty community-residing AD patient disrupt sleep recruit . Included subject meet NINCDS-ADRDA criterion probable AD . Prior study entry , disrupt sleep document clinical history 1 2 week record use wrist activity monitor . The treatment period last 8 week . Rest/activity pattern record wrist activity monitor . The primary outcome measure change nocturnal sleep time baseline end treatment phase . Other outcome also examine , include time awake sleep onset , sleep latency , sleep efficiency , daytime agitation , change cognition . The relative effectiveness high low dose melatonin assess . Adverse event side effect compare treatment . This study provide data necessary determine whether melatonin safe effective treatment disrupt sleep associate AD .</detailed_description>
