	<brief_title>Fluorouracil Filtering Surgery Study ( FFSS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Filtering surgery adequately lower intraocular pressure glaucoma patient . However , prognosis less favorable aphakic patient glaucoma glaucoma phakic eye follow unsuccessful filtering operation . Failure filter surgery usually attribute proliferation fibroblast filter site . The use 5-FU , antimetabolite , show inhibit proliferation fibroblast tissue culture , preliminary study increase success filtering surgery nonhuman primate model . The Fluorouracil Filtering Surgery Study ( FFSS ) randomize , control clinical trial compare success rate standard glaucoma filter surgery success rate standard surgery adjunctive 5-FU treatment . Another element study evaluate frequency severity possible adverse effect relate 5-FU injection . Detailed preoperative postoperative examination cornea , lens , retina perform . Systemic toxicity assess preoperative postoperative hematologic study . After investigator perform filter surgery determine new outlet channel working , patient randomize receive either 5-FU injection standard postsurgical care without 5-FU . The patient treat 5-FU received subconjunctival injection 5 mg 5-FU twice daily postoperative day 1 7 daily postoperative day 8 14 . There 213 patient recruit study , 162 previous cataract extraction 51 previous filter surgery . All patient examine 1 month , 3 month , 6 month , 1 year , 18 month , 2 year postoperatively yearly interval thereafter 5 year postoperatively . Possible concomitant risk 5-FU treatment , toxic effect cornea , lens , retina , monitor .</detailed_description>
