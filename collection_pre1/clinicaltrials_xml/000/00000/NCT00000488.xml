	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Numerous prospective epidemiologic study demonstrate hypercholesterolemia major risk factor atherosclerotic coronary heart disease . Research animal indicate reduction serum cholesterol prevent reversed atherosclerosis show convincingly human . The Coronary Primary Prevention Trial test hypothesis lower serum cholesterol patient exist evidence coronary heart disease would reduce subsequent rate coronary heart disease person . Coronary heart disease lead cause death major cause morbidity United States . The slow development underlie arterial disease frequently sudden onset quickly fatal course necessitate preventive approach substantial inroad make . The positive result Coronary Primary Prevention Trial ( CPPT ) do much resolve controversy regard benefit lipid-lowering , lead firm advice high-risk hypercholesterolemic subject population whole . The CPPT part Institute 's Lipid Research Clinic Program Lipid Metabolism Branch , DHVD , NHLBI . Twelve lipid research clinic United States Canada participate trial , well coordinate center , central electrocardiographic laboratory , central lipid clinical chemistry laboratory , nutrition coding center , group consultant recruitment adherence . This program 's objective include development standardize method definition diagnosis hyperlipoproteinemia performance series collaborative study prevalence natural history disorder , well design implementation Coronary Primary Prevention Trial . The protocol trial approve November 1972 . Beginning July 1973 , men hypercholesterolemia recruit potential trial subject diverse source physician referral , blood bank donor list , mass screening program . Each subject screen series four visit , purpose select men ( 1 ) whose lipid abnormality primary Type II phenotype , ( 2 ) free clinically manifest coronary heart disease , ( 3 ) whose excellent overall health reliability make 7-10 year follow-up realistic objective . Additionally , standardize limited-cholesterol/saturated fat diet initiate second visit order exclude men whose cholesterol level highly responsive diet . Subjects met selection criterion randomly assign , double-blind fashion , receive either cholesterol-lowering drug cholestyramine placebo fifth visit . Recruitment 3,806 CPPT subject complete July 1976 . After randomization study , subject visit clinic bimonthly interval . At visit , adherence drug diet assess , study medication supply , general health potential toxic side effect monitor , intervene cardiovascular event record . Counseling drug dietary adherence give visit , medical advice give problem identify . Trial data collect analyzed Central Patient Registry review periodically Safety Data Monitoring Board . Intervention cease May August 1983 . A five-year follow-up initiate November 1984 detect possible toxicity CPPT participant follow ingestion cholestyramine ( placebo ) 7 10 year . Follow-up complete October 1989 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , double-blind , fixed sample size one experimental group one control group equal size . Experimental group diet lipid-lowering drug regimen ; control group diet placebo regimen .</detailed_description>
