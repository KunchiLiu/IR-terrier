	<detailed_description>Controlled study pharmacokinetics safety new drug critical development alternative therapy prevention perinatal transmission HIV-1 . The dose regimen RTV ZDV use treat pregnant woman study show safe effective HIV adult . Little known metabolism tolerance drug pregnancy , Phase I study need determine dosage , safety , tolerance . Protease inhibitor combination antiretroviral drug may help reduce rate perinatal transmission HIV-1 . Pregnant woman start RTV ( increase gradually day ) plus 3TC plus ZDV active labor . Intrapartum , woman receive RTV plus 3TC plus ZDV , postpartum ( cord clamp 12 week postpartum ) , RTV plus 3TC plus ZDV . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 2/9/99 : For maternal dosing , one Combivir tablet ( contain 3TC ZDV ) may administer place individual agent 3TC ZDV .

Infants participate one two cohort . The first four infant deliver ( Cohort 1 ) receive RTV single dose Days 8 12 . The next six infant deliver ( Cohort 2 ) start RTV 2-3 day life . The dose schedule base Cohort 1 drug pharmacokinetics data . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 2/9/99 : Cohort 1 expand seven mother/infant pair . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 9/28/99 : Cohort 1 expand eight mother/infant pair . ] Both maternal infant blood drawn assess drug pharmacokinetics .
