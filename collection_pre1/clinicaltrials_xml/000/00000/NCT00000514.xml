	<brief_summary>The primary objective ass whether long-term administration antihypertensive therapy elderly subject isolate systolic hypertension reduce combined incidence fatal non-fatal stroke . The secondary objective evaluate : effect long-term antihypertensive therapy mortality cause elderly people isolate systolic hypertension ; possible adverse effect chronic use antihypertensive drug treatment population ; effect therapy indices quality-of-life ; natural history isolate systolic hypertension placebo population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : More 3 million person United States age 60 isolated systolic hypertension . They face excess risk ( 2-3 fold ) stroke , cardiovascular disease death . Population-based data show prevalence rise approximately 8 percent age group 60-69 year approximately 20 percent age 80 . Based available data , annual stroke rate 2.0 percent estimate population . The full-scale clinical trial follow pilot study conduct 1980 1983 . Recruitment trial begin March 1985 finish January 1988 . Follow-up end February 1991 . Data analysis continue October 1996 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : A randomized , double-blind trial 2,365 subject assign active treatment 2,371 placebo . For active treatment group , stepped-care regimen use include chlorthalidone 12.5 25 mg/day , need , addition atenolol 25 50 mg/day reserpine , 0.05 0.10 mg/day . Treatment goal reduce systolic blood pressure least 20 mm Hg baseline 160 mm Hg minimal amount study medication . The primary endpoint incidence fatal non-fatal stroke . Secondary endpoint cardiovascular coronary morbidity mortality , all-cause mortality , quality-of-life measure .</detailed_description>
