	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The background proposal make develop combined information Veterans Administration Cooperative Study Hypertension Detection Follow-up Study . Data study clearly establish importance reduce sodium content mean diuretic administration mainstay treatment elevate blood pressure . The risk lifetime treatment undefined , cost indefinite treatment high blood pressure sufficiently high stimulate careful examination alternative mode management patient . The demonstration Parijs others moderate reduction sodium intake lead improved management hypertension data suggest increased potassium intake may enhance blood pressure lower effect associate sodium restriction cite investigator basis trial . Any additional data regard modest sodium restriction potassium ingestion would impact utilizing therapy prevent hypertension adjunctive therapy . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The study intend take advantage availability patient three center completion Hypertension Detection Follow-up Program Study . These patient enrol 'stepped-care ' participant treat antihypertensive drug least five year . The main objective study determine contribution dietary modification maintenance normal blood pressure withdrawal medication . Two type diet change follow : 1 ) reduction sodium intake couple increased potassium intake ; 2 ) reduction weight subgroup patient obese .</detailed_description>
