	<brief_summary>To evaluate effectiveness argon laser photocoagulation aspirin therapy delay prevent progression early diabetic retinopathy severe stage visual loss blindness . To help determine best time initiate photocoagulation treatment diabetic retinopathy . To monitor closely effect diabetes mellitus photocoagulation visual function .

	<brief_title>Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ETDRS multicenter , randomize clinical trial design evaluate argon laser photocoagulation aspirin treatment management patient nonproliferative early proliferative diabetic retinopathy . A total 3,711 patient recruit follow minimum 4 year provide long-term information risk benefit treatment study . The eligibility criterion ETDRS design include broad range macular edema severity , small hard exudate within disc diameter fovea normal visual acuity extensive cystoid space visual acuity 20/200 . All study patient one eye randomly assign immediate photocoagulation eye deferral photocoagulation high-risk proliferative retinopathy develop . During followup , additional photocoagulation allow degree macular edema within eligibility range , additional photocoagulation require edema involve threaten center macula . The term `` clinically significant macular edema '' coin designate level severity . The trial use aspirin therapy base clinical observation aspirin 's possible mechanisms action . Previous observation diabetic patient take large dos aspirin rheumatoid arthritis show prevalence retinopathy group low prevalence would expect diabetic population large . Evidence suggest diabetic patient alter platelet aggregation disaggregation , may contribute capillary closure see retinopathy . This abnormality reverse aspirin vitro . However , aspirin 's possible mechanisms action well-known side effect , allergic , idiosyncratic , intolerance reaction , use therapy ETDRS carefully control monitor .</detailed_description>
