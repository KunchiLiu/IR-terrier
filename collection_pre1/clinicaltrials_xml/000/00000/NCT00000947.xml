	<brief_summary>This study design find whether HIV-positive patient whose immune system improve receiving anti-HIV treatment take azithromycin prevent Mycobacterium avium complex ( MAC ) disease . This study also examine possibility put MAC prevention treatment patient respond well anti-HIV drug therapy . Azithromycin approve prevention MAC disease people HIV low CD4 cell count . However , people take azithromycin find carry antibiotic-resistant bacteria ( germ grow despite presence drug use kill ) . It know whether risk associate take azithromycin outweigh risk get MAC disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Effects Azithromycin MAC Disease Prevention HIV-Positive Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The need MAC prophylaxis advance HIV disease recognize . Prophylactic therapy complicate , however , due drug toxicity , potential drug interaction , patient noncompliance multiagent regimen , microbial drug resistance , high treatment cost . This study assess feasibility defer MAC prophylaxis patient whose CD4+ cell count rebound response antiretroviral therapy . In double-blind , placebo-controlled trial , patient randomize receive azithromycin weekly matching placebo . Patients switch open-label azithromycin average CD4+ cell count le 50 cells/mm3 2 consecutive count obtain least 48 hour apart ( preferably 60 day ) . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 10/23/97 : SUBSTUDY CPCRA 054 : A subset participant CPCRA 048 oropharyngeal swab take baseline 4 month randomization . Antibiotic susceptibility test perform isolates S . pneumoniae . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 9/3/99 : Participants protocol version 3.0 follow data collection purpose every 4 month 18 month January 31 , 2001 . Data collection include CD4 cell count , viral RNA measurement , macrolide susceptibility MAC isolate , antibiotic susceptibility isolate bacterial pneumonia episode . ]</detailed_description>
