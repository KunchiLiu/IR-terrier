	<brief_summary>To evaluate relative efficacy orthokeratology , primarily assessment change central corneal thickness , astigmatism , visual acuity , endothelial cell density , corneal curvature . To evaluate relative safety orthokeratology , primarily assessment change central corneal thickness , astigmatism , visual acuity , endothelial cell density , induced corneal edema , epithelial staining . To assess duration orthokeratology treatment effect . To study mechanism refractive error visual acuity change occur , particular contribution come change corneal curvature shape . To determine whether predispose ocular factor could use predict subject experience change complication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Berkeley Orthokeratology Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In early 1960s , group clinician assert myopia could reduce possibly correct fitting specially design contact lenses induce corneal flatten thereby reduce refractive power eye . This technique , know orthokeratology , require lens fit change progressively vision becomes normal nearly normal . Advocates orthokeratology claim corneal change could induce predictable fashion , often permanent , occur without cause adverse effect cornea . Data orthokeratology generally limit , poorly document , address issue control failure . The Berkeley Orthokeratology Study single center randomize , concurrently control , mask clinical trial . Corneal visual change orthokeratology treatment group monitor compare observed control group whose member wear contact lens fit standard clinical manner . Visual ocular characteristic monitor 1.5 year . Eighty subject studied-40 orthokeratology group 40 control group fit conventional hard contact lens . The hard lenses chosen study make either polymethyl methacrylate ( PMMA ) PMMA-silicone combination ( Polycon ) . All subject initially fit PMMA lens . The initial treatment control lenses select accord protocol guideline adjust achieve `` optimal fit '' base lens position , movement , alignment assess fluorescein study . At outset , treatment control lenses differ treatment lenses average thicker flatter large diameter . Following dispense visit , subject progress three study phase . In adaption phase ( Phase A ) , subject examine weekly adapt 12 14 hour daily contact lens wear . The postadaptive phase ( Phase B ) consist monthly followup examination 1 year . The final phase ( Phase C ) consist lens withdrawal segment postwearing segment .</detailed_description>
