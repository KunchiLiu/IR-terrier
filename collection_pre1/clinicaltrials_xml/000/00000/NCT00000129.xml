	<brief_title>Prospective Evaluation Radial Keratotomy ( PERK ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 11 million Americans myopia correct eyeglass contact lens . Some people may also candidate radial keratotomy ( RK ) , procedure aim correct reduce myopia surgery flatten corneal curvature . Keratotomy first perform surgeon Europe United States late 1800s , basic optical mechanical principle operation define 1940s 1950s Japanese doctor T. Sato K. Akiyama , use anterior posterior corneal incision . The posterior incision damage cornea , procedure modify Soviet Union doctor Fyodorov V. Durnev include incision anterior cornea . Since introduction United States 1978 , numerous ophthalmologist modify procedure introduce technical surgical improvement ultrasonic method measure thickness cornea use diamond-bladed micrometer knife make incision . However , scientific assessment RK lag behind grow public professional interest procedure . In 1980 , response widespread concern long-term safety efficacy RK , group ophthalmic surgeon approach National Eye Institute proposal multicenter clinical trial would evaluate potential benefit risk procedure . The Prospective Evaluation Radial Keratotomy study , involve 435 patient 99 pilot patient , clinical trial design evaluate short- long-term safety efficacy one technique radial keratotomy . The procedure evaluate compare patient 's refractive error uncorrected vision surgery . The myopic eye receive surgery first . Patients require wait 1 year operation second eye . The surgical technique standardize , consist eight centrifugal radial incision make manually diamond micrometer knife . The diameter central , uncut , clear zone determine preoperative spherical equivalent cycloplegic refraction ( -2.00 -3.12 D = 4.0 mm ; -3.25 -4.3 D = 3.5 mm ; -4.50 -8.00 D = 3.0 mm ) . The blade length , determine depth incision , set 100 percent thinnest four intraoperative ultrasonic corneal thickness reading take paracentrally 3- , 6- , 9- , 12-o'clock meridian outside mark delineate clear zone . The incision make edge trephine mark limbal vascular arcade space equidistantly around cornea . Patients examine preoperatively surgery 2 week , 3 month , 6 month , annually 5 year , 10 year . Examinations morning even day do 3 month , 1 year , 3 year , 11 year subset patient test diurnal fluctuation vision refraction . The primary outcome variable measure visit uncorrected spectacle-corrected visual acuity refractive error pupil dilate undilated . The corneal shape measure central keratometry photokeratoscopy . Endothelial function evaluate use specular microscopy . A slit-lamp microscope examination make check complication incision . Contrast sensitivity test subset patient . Patient motivation satisfaction study psychometric questionnaire baseline , 1 year , 5-6 year , 10 year .</detailed_description>
