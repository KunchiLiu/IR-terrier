	<brief_summary>To determine whether 50 mg beta-carotene take every day reduce risk develop age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) among male U.S. physician age 40 84 1982 . To investigate possible relationship AMD antioxidant , include selenium vitamins A , C , E. To identify potential risk factor development AMD . Possible risk factor include height , systemic hypertension , cardiovascular disease , blood cholesterol , cigarette smoking , iris skin color , sunlight exposure , body mass index , diabetes , alcohol intake .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Macular degeneration , major cause blindness United States , lead cause new case blindness people age 65 older . The National Eye Institute estimate year additional 165,000 people , mainly old age group , develop macular disease . Among people macular degeneration , approximately 116,000 affect neovascular form disease . Although laser treatment effective treatment patient certain form neovascular membrane ( exudative AMD ) , patient available treatment . The pathogenesis AMD partly understand , etiology remain obscure . The Retinal Choroidal Diseases Panel National Advisory Eye Council state `` none fundamental cause type macular disease know , none prevent . '' Thus , panel recommend one NEI 's program development priorities `` initiate epidemiologic study macular disease identify possible causative , protective , aggravating factor . '' This trial part Physicians Health Study , sponsor National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute ( NHLBI ) National Institutes Health , fund eye epidemiologic data evaluation provide NEI . It ongoing , randomize , placebo-controlled trial aspirin prevention cardiovascular mortality beta-carotene prevention cancer . Following randomization , 22,071 physician enrol assign one four group take either aspirin placebo beta-carotene placebo . Followup questionnaires send 6 12 month randomization every 12 month thereafter . The average length followup great 12 year . The hypothesis beta-carotene level inversely relate AMD support experimental study relationship antioxidant retinal morphology function . There increase evidence visible ultraviolet light damage retina production superoxide radical . Antioxidants ( include beta-carotene , vitamins A , E , C , selenium ) protect oxidative damage act scavenger superoxide radical . Epidemiologic data first National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES-1 ) also consistent link antioxidant AMD ; frequency consumption fruit vegetable rich vitamin A ( beta-carotene ) negatively correlate AMD adjustment demographic medical factor . Data study determine whether one 50-mg beta-carotene capsule take alternate day protect development AMD whether additional risk factor emerge simultaneous control potential confounding factor . Reported diagnose AMD confirm medical record review . The primary analysis comparison incidence report AMD beta-carotene placebo group . The Cox proportional hazard model also use determine whether difference time diagnosis AMD two group .</detailed_description>
