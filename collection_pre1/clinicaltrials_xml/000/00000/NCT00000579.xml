	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : ARDS affect approximately 150,000 people United States year . Despite 20 year research mechanism cause syndrome numerous development technology mechanical ventilation , mortality remain great 50 percent . Many patient young , tragic loss human life add cost society patient spend average 2 week intensive care unit require multiple high tech procedure . Because overwhelming nature lung injury establish , prevention would appear effective strategy improve outlook condition . Basic research identify numerous inflammatory pathway associate development ARDS . Agents block mediator prolong survival animal lung injury , test patient . Because large number putative mediator variety way action block , possibility new drug development almost infinite . This exciting prospect , since envisions first effective pharmacologic treatment ARDS . However , preliminary clinical study show conflict result , urgent need mechanism efficiently effectively test new drug ARDS . Treatment study patient ARDS difficult perform three reason . The complicated clinical picture make difficult accumulate large number comparable patient one center . There agreement optimal supportive care critically ill patient . Many patient meet study criterion enrol study protocol acute nature disease process . For reason , therapeutic trial ARDS require multicenter cooperation . The concept initiative first discuss meeting Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome Foundation staff Division Lung Diseases . The result work meeting uniform definition ARDS hold 1992 meeting American Thoracic Society reinforce recommendation community National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute participation drug evaluation ARDS . The concept initiative approve September 1992 National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council . The Requests Proposals release October 1993 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : It anticipate 12-year period , several multicenter clinical trial develop implement . A 12-month Phase I period devote plan develop infrastructure committee structure protocol development prioritization . In Phase IIa , staff train data acquisition procedure patient enrol . Additional protocol development may begin subsequent study . In Phase IIb , last patient first study complete follow-up measurement , data review initial study close . Protocol development continue subsequent trial . In Phase III , final data analysis publication preparation occur . Enrollment 1,000 patient first ARDSNet protocol , `` Ketoconazole Respiratory Management Acute Lung Injury/Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome '' ( KARMA ) begin spring 1996 . KARMA assess efficacy 6 ml/kg versus 12 ml/kg positive pressure ventilation reduce mortality morbidity patient acute lung injury ARDS . It also assess efficacy ketoconazole , thromboxane synthetase inhibitor , reduce mortality morbidity patient acute lung injury ARDS . The ketoconazole arm stop Data Monitoring Safety Board ( DSMB ) January 1997 enrollment 234 patient . Ketoconazole show benefit survival , duration ventilation , measure lung function . The ventilator arm protocol continue March 10 , 1999 , compare efficacy high ( 12 ml/kg ) low ( 6 ml/kg ) tidal volume ventilation reduce mortality morbidity patient acute lung injury ARDS . The ventilator portion trial stop March 10 , 1999 , recommendation DSMB data first 861 patient show approximately 25 percent few death among patient receive small , rather large , breaths air mechanical ventilator . A new drug , lisofylline , select replace ketoconazole factorial design ventilation protocol . The lisofylline study ( LARMA ) begin February 1998 . The study test efficacy lisofylline , analog pentoxifylline , show protect tissue injury mediate oxidant suppress production number cytokine mediator amplify inflammatory process . Patients randomize either high low tidal volume ventilation treatment group lisofylline placebo . The aim lisofylline protocol determine whether administration lisofylline early onset acute lung injury ARDS would reduce morbidity mortality . The study cosponsor Cell Therapeutics Incorporated . The trial stop DSMB May 27 , 1999 , result obtain 221 patient . There effect mortality , time ventilation , organ failure . The `` Late Steroid Rescue Study ( LaSRS ) : The Efficacy Corticosteroids Rescue Therapy Late Phase Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome '' ( LaSRS pronounce `` Lazarus '' ) compare effect corticosteroid placebo management late-phase ( great 7 day ) ARDS . The study determine administration corticosteroid , methylprednisolone sodium succinate , severe ARDS either stable worsen 7 day , would reduce mortality morbidity . The primary end point mortality 60 day . Secondary endpoint include ventilator-free day organ failure-free day . LaSRS design include 400 patient begin recruit spring 1997 . In October 1999 , DSMB reduce recruitment target number 200 patient eligible patient few anticipate . In November 1999 , Network begin new trial follow-on ventilator trial name `` Assessment Low Tidal Volume Elevated End-Expiratory Pressure Obviate Lung Injury '' ( ALVEOLI ) . This trial prospective , randomize , control multicenter trial include 549 patient compare two group patient . Patients randomize receive mechanical ventilation either low high PEEP , set accord different table predetermine combination PEEP fraction inspire oxygen . The primary end point mortality 60 day . Secondary endpoint include ventilator-free day organ failure-free day . The trial end result publish July 22 , 2004 , issue New England Journal Medicine . The result suggest patient acute lung injury ARDS receive mechanical ventilation tidal-volume goal 6 ml per kilogram predict body weight end-inspiratory plateau-pressure limit 30 centimeter water , clinical outcome similar whether low high PEEP level use . Network investigator develop plan new protocol ass pulmonary artery catheter ( PAC ) management tool ARDS . The new study prompt recommendation FDA/NIH Pulmonary Artery Catheter Clinical Outcomes workshop convene August 1997 response concern medical community regard clinical benefit safety PACs . The new protocol Fluids Catheters Treatment Trial ( FACTT ) two-by-two factorial design compare patient receive PAC central venous catheter ( CVC ) one two fluid management strategy ( conservative versus liberal ) . The randomized , multicenter trial design include 1,000 patient . The primary end point mortality 60 day . Secondary endpoint include ventilator-free day organ failure-free day . See NCT00281268 information study . Albuterol versus Placebo Acute Lung Injury ( ALTA ) Study : The Phase II/III study test safety efficacy aerosolize beta-2 adrenergic agonist therapy ( albuterol sulfate ) reduce mortality patient acute lung injury . In Phase II , safety albuterol 5-mg dose compare saline approximately 100 patient . The dose reduce 2.5 mg patient exceed defined heart rate limit . Consequently , Phase III placebo-controlled double-blinded , randomized trial approximately 1,000 patient compare 60-day mortality ventilator-free day Day 28 safe albuterol dose establish Phase II placebo saline . New effort initiate increase sample collection utilize collect patient material investigate mechanism ARDS pathogenesis . In addition investigation hypothesis related cytokine inflammatory mediator , Network prepare collect sample future study genetic determinant ARDS . The ARDSNet extend September 2012 , continue clinical trial .</detailed_description>
