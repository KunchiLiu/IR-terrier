	<brief_summary>To determine whether regular administration lipid modify drug ( clofibrate , nicotinic acid , estrogen , dextrothyroxine ) men document myocardial infarction would result significant reduction total mortality five year period . Secondarily , determine whether degree drug change serum lipid correlate effect mortality morbidity rate ; gain information long-term prognosis myocardial infarction ( study control group intensively treatment group ) ; acquire experience knowledge concern technique methodology long-term clinical trial ; determine , substudy , effectiveness aspirin , platelet inhibitor , reduce recurrence myocardial infarction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Correlation high level serum cholesterol increase incidence prevalence coronary heart disease ( CHD ) demonstrate -- prior inception Coronary Drug Project -- repeatedly prospective cross-sectional epidemiological survey ( e.g. , Tecumseh Study , Framingham Heart Disease Study ) . These finding lead question whether long-term lower serum lipid individual without CHD would beneficial effect morbidity mortality . The Coronary Drug Project design answer question secondary prevention . In 1961 , Dr. Robert Wilkins ( Boston University School Medicine ) chair ad hoc committee determine desirability feasibility conduct study . Following National Heart Advisory Council ( NHAC ) support , study Policy Board , Steering Committee , Coordinating Center establish detailed protocol write . In 1964 , NHAC approve project NHI recommendation implementation ; study begin 1965 . Supported grant mechanism , trial involve 53 participate clinic , coordinate center , central laboratory , ECG center , drug procurement distribution center , NHI medical liaison office , policy board , steer committee , 12 committee ( e.g. , data safety monitoring committee ) . The first patient randomly allocate treatment March 1966 last October 1969 . Each patient report clinic every 4 month follow-up visit . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , double-blind , fixed sample . A total 8,341 patient randomly assign six treatment group consist 2.5 mg/day conjugate estrogen , 5.0 mg/day conjugate estrogen , 1.8 gm/day clofibrate , 6.0 mg/day dextrothyroxine sodium , 3.0 gm/day niacin , 3.8 gm/day lactose placebo . The study completion date list record obtain Query/View/Report ( QVR ) System .</detailed_description>
