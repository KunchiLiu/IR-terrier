	<brief_title>Erythropoietin Anemia Due Zidovudine Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Reports show 24 78 percent patient Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome treat zidovudine four six month develop significant bone marrow toxicity , require zidovudine dosage alteration , blood transfusion , cessation therapy . While zidovudine efficacy demonstrate patient AIDS ARC , also evaluate patient AIDS-related illness , well asymptomatic HIV-infected individual . The clinically significant zidovudine-induced anemia develop substantial number patient group require blood transfusion could cause significant drain blood supply United States . The project part Institute-initiated study Pathobiology Bone Marrow Suppression AIDS AIDS-Related Complex . The concept approve May 1987 National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council . The Request Applications release December 1987 . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Double-blind , placebo-controlled . Patients receive intravenous REPO ( 1000 IU/kg ) placebo twice per week . The five patient Group A transfusion history . The five patient Group B history transfusion . Prior study , author determine treatment would continue twelve week hemoglobin reach 12.5 g/dl . After twelve week study period , patient eligible receive open label erythropoietin ( 500 IU/kg , twice week ) . For numerous reason , recruitment patient major problem trial . The study originally estimate total 64 patient .</detailed_description>
