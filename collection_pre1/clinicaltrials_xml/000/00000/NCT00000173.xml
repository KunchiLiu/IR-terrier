	<brief_summary>The National Institute Aging ( NIA ) launch nationwide treatment study target individual mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) , condition characterize memory deficit , dementia . An NIA-funded study recently confirm MCI different dementia normal age-related change memory . Accurate early evaluation treatment MCI individual might prevent cognitive decline , include development Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . The Memory Impairment Study first AD prevention clinical trial carry NIH , conduct 65-80 medical research institution locate United States Canada . This study test usefulness two drug slow stop conversion MCI AD . The trial evaluate placebo , vitamin E , donepezil , investigational agent approve Food Drug Administration another use . Vitamin E ( alpha-tocopherol ) think antioxidant property , show 1997 study delay important dementia milestone , patient ' institutionalization progression severe dementia , seven month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Memory Impairment Study ( Mild Cognitive Impairment Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo- control , parallel-group study vitamin E donepezil 720 subject mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) . Subjects randomized one three treatment group ( 240 subject per treatment group ) : 1 ) Placebo vitamin E placebo donepezil plus multivitamin daily . 2 ) Vitamin E ( 2,000 I ) placebo donepezil plus multivitamin daily.3 ) Donepezil ( 10 mg ) placebo vitamin E plus multivitamin daily . The study conduct three year , clinical evaluation every 3 month first 6 month every 6 month . Subjects randomize donepezil start dose 5 mg daily . Donepezil increase 10 mg six week . Subjects randomize vitamin E start 1,000 I daily . The dose Vitamin E increase 2,000 I six week . There 12-month recruitment period . The primary endpoint time development Probable Possible AD accord NINCDS-ADRDA criterion . Upon determination clinical diagnosis AD , documentation send ADCS Coordinating Center forward Central Review Committee verification . Upon verification , conversion diagnosis AD , subject stop take donepezil study medication correspond placebo , without break blind , offer open label donepezil schedule visit one month prior diagnostic visit . Donepezil offer subject convert AD subject complete three year baseline visit . Based estimate incidence AD 15 % per year , study 85 % power detect 33 % great reduction conversion AD 3 year . Secondary outcome measure include change Alzheimer 's Disease Assessment Scale ( ADAS-COG ) , Neuropsychological Battery , Mini-Mental State Exam ( MMSE ) , Clinical Dementia Rating Scale ( CDR ) , Global Deterioration Scale ( GDS ) , ADCS- Activities Daily Living Inventory ( ADCS-ADL ) , Pharmacoeconomics scale , Quality Life scale . Compliance monitor measurement alpha-tocopherol level pill count visit .</detailed_description>
