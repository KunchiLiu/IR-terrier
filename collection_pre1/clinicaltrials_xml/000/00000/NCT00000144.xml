	<brief_title>Glaucoma Laser Trial ( GLT ) Glaucoma Laser Trial Followup Study ( GLTFS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During last decade , argon laser trabeculoplasty ( ALT ) often use instead surgery treatment choice case open-angle glaucoma could control drug . ALT treatment consist tiny laser burn evenly space around trabecular meshwork . It sometimes find effective control glaucoma , although many eye still require medical treatment . The Glaucoma Laser Trial ( GLT ) , randomize , control clinical trial , conduct determine whether ALT effective patient newly diagnose , primary , open-angle glaucoma . Each 271 patient trial receive argon laser treatment one eye standard topical medication eye . The eye start medicine eye would get laser treatment randomly select . The Glaucoma Laser Trial Followup Study followup study 203 271 patient enrol Glaucoma Laser Trial . By close Glaucoma Laser Trial Followup Study , median duration followup since diagnosis primary , open-angle glaucoma 7 year ( maximum , 9 year ) . The argon laser treatment do two session 1 month apart , one-half trabecular meshwork treat 45 55 laser burn session . Patients see followup visit 3 month first laser treatment every 3 month thereafter period least 2 year . At visit , examination eye include check intraocular pressure visual acuity . Visual field examination perform 3 , 6 , 12 month randomization annually thereafter . Disc stereo photograph take 6 12 month randomization annually thereafter . The result examination determine whether treatment change . If pressure either eye reduce desired level , physician change medication eye treat drop start use drop laser-treated eye accord standardized procedure use trial . If intraocular pressure still successfully reduce , surgery laser treatment may require .</detailed_description>
