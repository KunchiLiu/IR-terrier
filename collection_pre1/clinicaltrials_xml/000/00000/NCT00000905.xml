	<brief_summary>The purpose study see safe stop maintenance therapy HIV-positive patient treat healed CMV retinitis ( eye disease ) respond well anti-HIV ( antiretroviral ) therapy . The current therapy available treat CMV retinitis long-term therapy . However , may safe stop long-term anti-CMV therapy patient heal CMV retinitis stable CD4 count result take combination least 2 antiretroviral drug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Effects Stopping Maintenance Therapy Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) Retinitis After Effective Anti-HIV Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study propose assess hypothesis , HIV-infected patient treat healed CMV retinitis , increase CD4+ T-cells initiation potent antiretroviral therapy either directly relate , marker , immunologic protection CMV retinitis associate recovery specific proliferation response CMV antigen . In study , 100 patient [ AS PER AMENDMENT 7/2/99 : 50 patient ] treat heal , non-immediate sight-threatening CMV retinitis discontinue maintenance therapy suppression CMV retinitis . Patients study 2 group . Patients enrol Group 1 CD4+ count great 100 cells/mm3 . Group 2 patient CD4+ count 50-100 cells/mm3 minimum 2 log10 decrease plasma HIV-1 RNA level plasma HIV-1 RNA level limit detection receive potent antiretroviral therapy least 8 week prior entry [ AS PER AMENDMENT 7/2/99 : Group 2 withdrawn ] . An additional 25 patient meet eligibility requirement choose continue receive maintenance therapy may also participate . All patient follow evaluate relationship reactivation progression CMV disease change CMV DNA , HIV-1 RNA , CD4+ cell count . Patients see Weeks 2 , 4 , 6 8 , every 4 week study closure 12 month last subject enrol . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 12/24/98 : Patients confirm moderate severe `` immune recovery vitritis '' receive 3-week course systemic steroid ( oral prednisone recommend ) . Moderate immune recovery vitritis define symptomatic decrease visual acuity 2 Snellen line along , absence active CMV disease , either 2+ great vitreous haze define Nussenblatt et al. , cystoid macular edema . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 7/2/99 : During course study patient confirm cystoid macular edema concomitant reduction visual activity 20/40 , attributable immune recovery vitritis/uveitis , 21-day course oral prednisone recommend . This initial course steroid help determine whether improvement vision decrease macular edema . Long-term management immune recovery vitritis/uveitis may include intraocular injection steroid . Ophthalmoscopic examination laboratory test perform per protocol . ]</detailed_description>
