	<brief_summary>To determine effect high low intensity long-term exercise conditioning patient coronary artery disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Training Levels Comparison Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : A vast amount literature exist improvement work capacity , reduction risk factor , increase feeling well-being among coronary heart disease patient physical training program . Previous observation short-term training program result increase physical work capacity usually show cardiac change . The National Exercise Heart Disease Project show change , exercise level may inadequate . Several study suggest prolonged intense training could result improved cardiac function . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Patients randomize high intensity low intensity long-term exercise group . Compliance strengthen randomize follow sequence eligibility visit test period subject reaction exercise program . The primary endpoint change exercise ejection fraction one year . Secondary endpoint include change lipid level , body composition , blood pressure heart rate measurement , glucose tolerance , quality life measure , compliance , progression disease . Patients classify one four stratum base documented history myocardial infarction rest leave ventricular ejection fraction . Within stratum , patient assign equal number two intensity level exercise intervention . All exercise prescription base exercise test patient maintain usual medical regimen include drug . Patients underwent standardized multistage treadmill exercise test monitor Doppler echocardiogram baseline , prior randomization three month , six month , one year two year visit . Patients participate structured group exercise session three day per week . Each exercise session precede end five fifteen minute warm-up cool-down session . Each patient give exercise prescription include 30 minute period walk walk jogging sequence 15 minute arm-leg bicycle ergometer exercise . Recruitment start May 1987 . The last patient enrol March 1990 .</detailed_description>
