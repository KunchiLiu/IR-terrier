	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Respiratory distress syndrome affect 40,000 infant annually United States . The overall mortality rate exceed 20 percent infant weigh less 1500 gram birth , RDS responsible contributes 30-70 percent mortality , depend birthweight . The present customary treatment RDS intermittent mandatory ventilation accompany sequelae extra-alveolar air leak , intraventricular hemorrhage , bronchopulmonary dysplasia approximately 50 percent survivor . The respiratory distress syndrome newborn disorder pulmonary surfactant deficient . It possible completely replace natural component surfactant synthetic component achieve mixture function physiologically like pulmonary surfactant . Therefore , study replacement therapy surfactant deficiency use complete natural surfactant derivatives natural surfactant contain define component surfactant . The surfactant use clinical trial derive human amniotic fluid . Two basic different strategy surfactant treatment respiratory distress syndrome emerge : prophylactic , preventilatory , treatment shortly birth versus rescue treatment initiation mechanical ventilation instance clinically confirm respiratory distress syndrome . Although treatment birth theoretic advantage deliver surfactant uniformly airway mechanical ventilation , disadvantage delay physiologic stabilization birth result unnecessary treatment , considerable cost , 20 percent 40 percent infant bear less 30 week gestation . Rescue therapy permit early physiologic stabilization confirmation respiratory distress syndrome , theoretic disadvantage early lung injury mechanical ventilation surfactant-deficient lung less uniform surfactant distribution . Previous comparative trial bias incomplete study enrollment inclusion infant preventilation treatment group without evidence surfactant deficiency immaturity . In addition , outcomes varied placebo-treated infant . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , placebo-controlled . Singleton infant assign receive placebo ( air ) , prophylactic surfactant treatment give intratracheally , rescue surfactant treatment . Multiple birth infant receive either prophylactic rescue treatment . Of 282 potentially eligible infant , 246 receive treatment birth 200 respiratory distress syndrome receive full course surfactant therapy . Preterm infant randomly assign receive prophylactic treatment receive surfactant soon birth ; assign receive rescue surfactant instillation mean age 220 minute lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio _ 2.0 phosphatidylglycerol detect either amniotic fluid initial airway aspirate , oxygen requirement fraction inspire oxygen &gt; 0.5 mean airway pressure _ 7 cm H20 2 12 hour birth . Up four treatment dos permit within 48 hour ; approximately 60 percent surfactant-treated infant require two dos . Endpoints include mortality rate 28 day age , incidence bronchopulmonary dysplasia 28 day birth 38 week adjust difference gestational age , incidence pulmonary air leak , severity respiratory distress syndrome assess requirement supplemental oxygen mechanical ventilation .
