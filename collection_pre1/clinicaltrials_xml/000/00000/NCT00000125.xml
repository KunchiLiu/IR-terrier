	<brief_summary>To determine whether medical reduction intraocular pressure prevents delay onset glaucomatous visual field loss and/or optic disc damage ocular hypertensive participant judge moderate risk develop open-angle glaucoma . To produce natural history data assist identifying patient risk develop open-angle glaucoma likely benefit early medical treatment . To quantify risk factor develop open-angle glaucoma among ocular hypertensive individual .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OHTS Phase 3 re-examine study participant 20 plus year enrollment document clinical status incidence severity self-reported functional limitation . The 279 participant develop POAG OHTS Phase 1 2 10 year post-POAG follow-up Phase 3 . The time re-examination 20 year meaningful 20 year approach median life expectancy OHT patient 60 's 70 's half median life expectancy patient 40 's 50 's . For first time , patient ocular hypertension clinician high quality data long-term risk develop POAG functional limitation associate disease . These data facilitate patient-centered care patient clinician decide appropriate frequency test examinations potential benefit preventative treatment . Glaucoma one lead cause blindness United States industrialized country . It estimate 2 million people United States glaucoma 80,000 individual legally blind disease . Among African Americans , glaucoma recognize leading cause blindness . Elevated intraocular pressure ( IOP ) , common condition affect 3 6 million people United States , think lead risk factor development open-angle glaucoma . There consensus medical reduction intraocular pressure prevents delay onset visual field and/or optic nerve damage ocular hypertensive subject . Despite lack convince evidence efficacy medical treatment ocular hypertension , approximately 1.5 million glaucoma suspect United States treat costly ocular hypotensive medication carry potential serious even life-threatening side effect . Clearly , need well-controlled clinical trial determine whether medical reduction IOP prevent delay onset glaucomatous damage ocular hypertensive subject . Only clinicians patient make rational choice health care planner ensure limited medical resource allocate safe cost-effective manner . The Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study ( OHTS ) long-term , randomize , control multicenter clinical trial . Ocular hypertensive subject judge moderate risk develop primary open-angle glaucoma randomly assign either close observation step medical regimen . Medical treatment consist commercially available topical ocular hypotensive eye drop . After completion baseline measure ( IOP , visual field , disc photo ) randomization , subject follow minimum 5 year automate threshold central static perimetry ( Humphrey program 30-2 ) twice yearly stereoscopic optic disc photograph yearly . Study end point reproducible visual field loss and/or progressive optic disc damage either eye patient attribute glaucoma Masked Endpoint Committee . All visual field optic disc photograph read mask fashion Reading Centers . In 1991 Baltimore Eye Survey , African Americans show prevalence open-angle glaucoma four five time higher white . Given high prevalence glaucoma African American population , important recruit follow adequate sample African American subject trial ( approximately 25 percent total patient sample ) . At conclusion study , practitioner able make reasonable estimate risk individual ocular hypertensive patient determine ocular hypertensive individual likely benefit early prophylactic medical treatment .</detailed_description>
