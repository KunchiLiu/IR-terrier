	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Asthma complex disease often start early life . Exacerbations trigger number agent allergens , respiratory infection , environmental tobacco smoke pollutant , drug , chemical , exercise , cold air , infection , strong emotion , make asthma therapy difficult sometimes complicate . Multiple medication often require treat symptom ( bronchodilator agent beta-2 adrenergic agonist , theophylline , anticholinergic ) well underlie disease process ( anti-inflammatory agent inhaled systemic corticosteroid , cromolyn sodium nedocromil , leukotriene modifier ) . The prevalence asthma increase age group , particularly child age 18 year . In 1992 , prevalence self-reported asthma among person 18 year age 7.2 percent , compare 5.1 percent among person . The rapid increase asthma occur child 5 year old , rate increase 160 percent past 15 year . Among age , 450,000 hospitalization , 5,000 death , 100 million day restrict activity due asthma every year . Yet burden asthma disproportionately affect child . For example , asthma hospitalization rate high among person age 0 4 year increase 28 percent last 15 year ; mortality rate increase faster among aged 5 12 year among age 15 34 year , neither change disease cod improve recognition asthma fully explain increase . Nearly one-third child restrict activity due asthma , include participation physical education sport . Despite major advance understand etiology pathophysiology asthma development new therapeutic modality control symptoms prevent exacerbation , effective therapy widely use pediatric health care community . Furthermore , long-term effect side effect asthma medication child , especially child age 12 year , well understood . Much remains learned impact asthma therapy different age different point natural history asthma alter progression , chronicity , severity disease . There urgent need rapidly evaluate new exist therapeutic approach child asthma disseminate finding health care professional , patient , public . There several reason pediatric asthma clinical research network accelerate clinical research meet need . The highly variable sometimes complicate clinical manifestation asthma often make difficult accumulate large number comparable patient one center . Furthermore , uniformity treatment protocol may reduce number patient need clinical center . Also , network mechanism help pool necessary clinical expertise administrative resource facilitate conduct multiple novel therapeutic trial timely , efficient manner . This , turn , would promote rapid dissemination research find health care professional . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This multicenter study perform multiple therapeutic trial child asthma . One outcome Network promote rapid dissemination finding clinical study health care community . Therapeutic trial may involve investigational drug , drug already approve currently use childhood asthma , drug currently use treatment asthma . The Network end May 2009 . The following protocols way complete : Prevention Early Asthma Kids ( PEAK ) begin recruitment January 2001 evaluate whether administer inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) 24- 48-month-old child risk develop asthma prevent development persistent asthma . All subject expect randomized prior December 2001 study completion September 2004 . The study double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , parallel comparison inhale fluticasone placebo . There 4-week run-in period qualify characterize child . A total 285 child randomize one two treatment group ; one receive active treatment , placebo . The study base continuous treatment schedule period 24 month , follow observation period 1 year main outcome assess . The primary outcome measure number asthma-free day . Secondary outcome include number exacerbation , use asthma medication , lung function . The study three specific objective : ( 1 ) ass chronic therapy ICS initiate child 4 year less high risk develop asthma prevent development significant asthma 4 6 year age ; ( 2 ) determine asthma therapy describe prevent loss lung function development bronchial hyperresponsiveness ( BHR ) associate early onset asthma ; ( 3 ) ass potential side effect may associate long-term use inhale steroid early life . PEAK study outcomes presented 2005 annual meeting American Academy Allergy , Asthma , Immunology American Thoracic Society . A manuscript submit publication New England Journal Medicine . Characterizing Response Leukotriene Antagonist Inhaled Corticosteroids ( CLIC ) begin August 2001 child age 6 17 mild moderate asthma . The study randomize , double-blind crossover compare montelukast inhale fluticasone propionate mild-to-moderate persistent asthma 144 child . There 5- 10-day run-in period qualify characterize patient . Children randomize one two crossover treatment sequence 8-week period either active ICS , fluticasone propionate , active leukotriene receptor antagonist ( LTRA ) , montelukast . During active treatment period one drug , participant receive placebo alternative drug . The first 4 week second treatment period consider sufficient period washout study medication use first period treatment sequence . The two crossover sequence stratify accord clinical center , age category , FEV1 percent predict category use minimization method randomization . Outcome parameter determine every 4 week 16-week treatment phase . The primary outcome measure percentage change prebronchodilator FEVI baseline end treatment period . Results publish February 2005 issue Journal Allergy Clinical Immunology . Acute Intervention Management Strategies ( AIMS ) randomize , double-blind , double-dummy , placebo-controlled parallel comparison study determine initiation ICS LTRA inhale beta2-agonist ( albuterol ) onset respiratory tract illness ( RTI ) -associated symptoms increase proportion symptom-free day entire treatment period 5- 9-month study period . There 2-week period qualify characterize child time low respiratory tract symptom mild cough . A total 244 child randomize one three treatment group follow remainder fall-winter-early spring season , participant receive one follow regimens 7 day first sign RTI-associated symptom : ( 1 ) active ICS placebo LTRA albuterol inhalation treatment four time daily ; ( 2 ) active LTRA placebo ICS albuterol inhalation treatment four time daily ; ( 3 ) placebo ICS placebo LTRA albuterol inhalation treatment four time daily . Pediatric Asthma Controller Trial ( PACT ) study determine comparative effectiveness ICS , LTRA , combination medication ICS long-acting beta2-agonist child mild asthma . The study address critical question face primary care physician optimal choice initiate daily long-term treatment child . The primary study outcome percentage day without asthma 12-month treatment period . Recruitment begin August 2002 . A total 300 child assign one three active treatment arm 12 month : active ICS , combination active ICS salmeterol , active montelukast ( LTRA ) . Major outcome follow-up 277 child present May 2005 American Thoracic Society meeting .</detailed_description>
