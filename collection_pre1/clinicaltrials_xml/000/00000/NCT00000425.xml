	<brief_summary>This study determine difference commonly use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) acetaminophen ( pain-reliever prevent inflammation ) treat knee pain osteoarthritis ( OA ) . The two main result look disease progression accord x-rays disability 3.5 year . Study participant moderate knee OA knee pain continue take NSAID stop taking NSAID start take acetaminophen . Every 6 month send participant questionnaires ask pain , medication use , disability . We take x-rays knee start study end study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) popular agent use treat joint pain inflammation associate OA . Although NSAIDs useful pain management , recent study find NSAIDs good acetaminophen treatment painful knee OA . The relative lack efficacy possibility accelerate disease progression , couple know gastrointestinal risk medication , especially elderly , lead u reevaluate NSAIDs first-line medical therapy osteoarthritis . Our dominant NSAID-based approach disease may result unnecessary cost , unnecessary toxicity , accelerate disability . These data allow u hypothesize NSAIDs , inhibit pain inflammation osteoarthritic joint , may cause encourage people OA overuse damage joint , result accelerate joint degeneration joint replacement earlier time , alternatively , treatment NSAIDs may accelerate joint damage alter cartilage metabolism inhibit joint healing . We hypothesize anti-inflammatory therapy NSAIDs result toxicity lead increase comorbidity higher medical care use compare analgesic therapy OA . The specific aim study determine ( 1 ) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy accelerate joint degeneration compare analgesic medication ; ( 2 ) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy result great comorbidity high medical care cost use compare simple analgesic medication . To accomplish aim , randomize 200 people knee OA 200 people hip OA , define Kellgren Lawrence x-ray grade 2 3 , currently NSAIDs , either NSAIDs current dose acetaminophen 4000 mg/day 4 year . Primary outcome measure rate radiographic progression , pain disability two group . Secondary outcome variable include medical care use , time joint replacement , medication side-effect profile . We separately identify describe clinical , demographic , radiographic variable predict accelerated progression group multivariate analysis . By method , determine long-term outcome NSAID therapy versus analgesic therapy treatment clinical OA knee hip . This information critical improving outcome disease principal cause disability elderly .</detailed_description>
