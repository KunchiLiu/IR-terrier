Conventional management include vitrectomy hemorrhage fail clear wait period 6 12 month retinal detachment involve center macula develop time . To compare early vitrectomy conventional management eye good vision poor prognosis threaten hemorrhage retinal detachment severe proliferative retinopathy .

	<brief_title>Diabetic Retinopathy Vitrectomy Study ( DRVS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitrectomy may remove vitreous hemorrhage also prevent relieve traction retina contraction fibrovascular membrane characterize severe proliferative diabetic retinopathy . It important determine whether early intervention vitrectomy well visual outcome instead produce rate serious complication higher rate associate conventional management . Two randomized trial carry DRVS among patient age 18 70 year either insulin-dependent non-insulin-dependent diabetes . In first trial , 616 patient recruit severe visual loss recent severe vitreous hemorrhage least one eye . Eligible eye randomly assign either early vitrectomy conventional management . In conventional management group , vitrectomy carry 1 year later hemorrhage persist ; vitrectomy carry sooner retinal detachment -involving center macula occur . In second trial , 381 patient recruit , severe fibrovascular proliferation useful vision least one eye . Eligible eye assign either early vitrectomy conventional management . Conventional management include photocoagulation indicate , vitrectomy severe vitreous hemorrhage occur fail clear spontaneously 6-month wait period retinal detachment involve center macula -occurred . After randomization treatment , patient examine 6-month interval 2 year annually thereafter . Comparisons visual acuity distribution experimental control group make .</detailed_description>
