	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Blacks United States disproportionately high rate cardiovascular disease mortality . Left ventricular hypertrophy , primary manifestation hypertensive heart disease major independent predictor cardiovascular mortality , twice prevalent Blacks hypertension white . Research implicate chronic socio-environmental psychological stress etiology hypertension leave ventricular hypertrophy Blacks . The trial seek investigate directly impact stress reduction program treat hypertensive heart disease Blacks , since conventional antihypertensive drug therapy less successful expect . Moreover , therapy frequently adverse side effect quality life , low compliance rate , particularly minority . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The first study conduct 1994 1999 use transcendental meditation stress reduction hypertensive heart disease . The study randomize blind . Subjects randomized practice TM twelve month receive health education . The following measurement obtain : left ventricular mass function use echocardiography ; clinic blood pressure ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ; urinary sodium excretion ; alcohol consumption , weight , physical activity , cigarette smoking , previous use antihypertensive medication ; various quality life measure include physical functioning , psychosocial functioning , subjective symptom , trait anger anger-expression , stress impact scale , personal efficacy health locus control , social support , ego development , social desirability . The trial part Collaborative Projects Minority Health , Institute- initiate program foster collaborative clinical research focus new improve approach diagnosis , management , prevention cardiovascular , lung , blood disease minority . The trial part two-grant collaboration Nonpharmacologic Treatments Managing Hypertension African American Adults . Ernest Johnson ( R01HL50516 ) , Program Coordinator collaborate Robert Schneider ( R01HL51519 ) . The objective study complementary collaborative arrangement allow determine effectiveness different approach stress management comparison control group comparable site . In addition , treatment schedule study result identical contact time , length intervention , expectation regard treatment effectiveness , follow-up assessment period . As result , considerable degree pool data analysis possible . Dr. Schneider 's study renew FY 1999 conduct randomize , single-blind , control , community-based trial involve 184 African American subject know coronary heart disease . Male female subject enrol on-going field site , Martin Luther King-Drew Medical Center inner city Los Angeles . After baseline testing , subject randomize either active stress reduction TM health education control-both addition usual medical care-and posttested 12 month . The primary outcome carotid artery atherosclerosis ( IMT ) measure non-invasively quantitative B-mode ultrasonography . Secondary measure include traditional CVD risk factor ( blood pressure , lipid , smoking , exercise ) , psychosocial stress , quality life cost effectiveness . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
