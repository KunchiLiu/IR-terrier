	<brief_summary>To evaluate short-term effect administer zidovudine ( AZT ) time increase dos aldesleukin ( interleukin-2 ; IL-2 ) patient persistent generalize lymphadenopathy syndrome ( PGL ) . The effect study include safety toxicity , quickly drug use body , effect immune system , effect HIV , concentration body fluid , quickly drug clear kidney . The trial establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) pilot study determine dose great effect immune system . AZT show effective HIV-related disease . IL-2 show increase immune response correct immune problem cause HIV test tube . IL-2 also effective treat Kaposi 's sarcoma number patient . Because clinical activity two drug toxicity mechanisms action overlap , may beneficial combine two drug antiviral immune stimulatory effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Trial Combination Zidovudine Recombinant Interleukin-2 Patients With Persistent Generalized Lymphadenopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AZT show effective HIV-related disease . IL-2 show increase immune response correct immune problem cause HIV test tube . IL-2 also effective treat Kaposi 's sarcoma number patient . Because clinical activity two drug toxicity mechanisms action overlap , may beneficial combine two drug antiviral immune stimulatory effect . Patients enter study stagger group five . All patient receive AZT orally every 4 hour 12 week . At end 8 week , first group five patient receive low dosage IL-2 daily basis still receive AZT . Toxicity immunologic effect measure begin AZT therapy every 2 week . Each succeed group five patient receive high dose IL-2 , receive AZT , MTD reach . Those patient show toxicity well improve immune function take drug receive 4-week follow-up course IL-2 5 week stop AZT . In addition , five patient complete AZT / IL-2 combine treatment without significant toxicity re-treated 12 week AZT alone start 8 week complete initial combine AZT / IL-2 portion treatment . Another five patient re-treated 12 week full dose AZT alone , follow 8 week half-dose AZT alone start 8 week complete initial combine AZT / IL-2 treatment . Patients receive ibuprofen fever chill , reach MTD continue receive dose combination AZT 4 week . If excess toxicity observe dos IL-2 , study discontinue .</detailed_description>
