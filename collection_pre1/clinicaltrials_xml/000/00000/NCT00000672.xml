	<brief_summary>AMENDED : 8/29/90 Inclusion asymptomatic patient CD4 count less 200 cells/mm3 . Standardization baseline evaluation schedule allow 14 day prior study dose . Reduction frequency intensity follow-up evaluation . Standardization study endpoint . Inclusion toxicity score management amylase triglyceride elevation . Clarification concomitant medication use . Original design : To determine effectiveness didanosine ( ddI ) patient AIDS advance AIDS relate complex ( ARC ) document hematologic intolerance zidovudine ( AZT ) therapy . To determine efficacy ddI increase increase dos . AZT effective reduce mortality patient AIDS receive drug first episode Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia ( PCP ) patient advanced ARC . However , AZT therapy associate significant toxicity . In addition , effectiveness AZT appear decrease second third year therapy . For reason , development alternative therapy would least effective less toxic great importance . The drug ddI antiviral agent inhibits replication ( reproduction ) HIV le apparent toxicity AZT . The major dose-limiting toxicity find Phase I study pain foot legs 2 patient initially receive 12 mg/kg/day 12 patient receive daily dos 25.8 51.2 mg/kg ; symptom begin 8 27 week initiate ddI treatment . These neuropathy-like symptom generally associate significant abnormality nerve conduction study patient report marked improvement symptom within 1 2 week discontinue ddI . Some patient resume ddI treatment reduce dose resolution symptom . Studies indicate ddI remain active body least 12 hour . This indicate benefit ddI might achieve low frequency drug administration .</brief_summary>
