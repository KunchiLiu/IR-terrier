	<brief_summary>The primary purpose compare effect immediate therapy lower intraocular pressure ( IOP ) versus late treatment progression newly detect open-angle glaucoma , measure increase visual field loss and/or optic disc change . The secondary purpose determine extent IOP reduction attain treatment , explore factor may influence glaucoma progression , describe natural history newly detect glaucoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Glaucoma common disease old adult . All present treatment aim reduction intraocular pressure , indication therapy well define . Furthermore , unclear whether intraocular pressure influence natural history glaucoma . Against background , primary aim study central importance patient manifest suspect glaucoma . Glaucoma subjective symptom long period early disease , damage irreversible occurs . Early diagnosis rapid detection progression paramount importance limit damage , whether pressure reduction way . The effectiveness , , lower intraocular pressure glaucoma require evaluation control treatment trial . The Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial ( EMGT ) first large , control , randomize clinical trial evaluate effect lower intraocular pressure progression newly detect , open-angle glaucoma . This study compare glaucoma progression initially treat versus untreated patient newly detect open-angle glaucoma allow quantification effect immediate IOP-lowering treatment progression followup period . The EMGT collaborative effort involve Clinical Center Department Ophthalmology Malmo University Hospital University Lund , Sweden , Satellite Center Helsingborg , Sweden ; independent Data Center Department Preventive Medicine , University Medical Center Stony Brook , New York ; Disc Photography Reading Center Department Ophthalmology Lund University Lund . The study initiate support Swedish Medical Research Council . Recruitment study complete . The 255 patient identify extensive , population-based screen successive age cohort well clinical referral . The diagnosis confirm Humphrey perimetry two postscreening visit Clinical Center Satellite Center . Eligible patient agree participate two additional visit collection baseline data . They randomize treatment beta blocker Betaxolol argon laser trabeculoplasty ( treat group ) initial treatment ( control group ) close followup group . Patients follow minimum 4 year assess development glaucoma progression . They see every 3 month collect visual field , IOP , data . Disc photograph take every 6 month . Technicians disc photograph grader mask regard treatment assignment . Additional followup visit hold confirm visual field progression IOP elevation ( &gt; 25 mm Hg treat group , &gt; 35 mm Hg control group ) . Patients treat group receive Xalantan whenever IOP exceed 25 mm Hg one visit ; patient control group receive Xalantan whenever IOP reach 35 mm Hg high trial . If IOP remain high , individualized treatment give . All patient continue follow monitor development end point analyze originally assign group . The study outcome glaucoma progression , base specific criterion derive analysis Humphrey visual field mask evaluation disc photograph . The perimetric outcome define statistically significant deterioration ( p &lt; 0.05 ) three test point Pattern Deviation Change Probability Maps three consecutive C30-2 Humphrey field . Optic disc progression determine follow : - The presence definite change ( detected comparison followup photograph baseline ) flicker chronoscopy two followup photograph visit , independent confirmation side-by-side grading . - Final confirmation change toward progression , flicker chronoscopy side-by-side grading , different followup visit .</detailed_description>
