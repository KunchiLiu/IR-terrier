	<brief_summary>In study investigate effect high-impact exercise program involve jump bone mass ( amount bone ) hip backbone grow skeleton . We also look effect gradually stop jump program bone mass grow skeleton . A high-impact exercise program may build bone childhood , skeleton still grow . This may help prevent broken bone due loss bone mass later life . We recruit 200 child age 5-10 participate study . For 6 month train child either jump stretch program . We gradually reduce amount exercise 6 month . We measure bone mass hip backbone start study , jumping , 6 month jump program stop . We compare result jump stretch group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Osteoporotic fracture increase alarm rate country result 13 billion dollar health cost annually . Peak bone mass , , individual 's maximum bone mass completion skeletal acquisition , important determinant fracture risk . Thus , maximize peak bone mass may provide effective strategy prevent osteopenia osteoporosis . Various investigator postulate increase bone mass 3-5 percent would reduce fracture risk 20-30 percent . Our data collegiate female gymnast demonstrate hip spine bone mineral density value 40 percent value normal age-matched control elite runner , despite menstrual irregularity . Further , observe dynamic response bone high-impact force gymnast train season bone increase 2-5 percent . This randomize , control exercise intervention design evaluate effect high-impact loading mean increase bone mass development . It determine bone mass accrual bone geometry lumbar spine proximal femur prepubescent girl boy . Further , study evaluate bone response withdrawal stimulus 6 month . We recruit 200 pre-pubescent child two separate year randomly assign jump stretch group . The jump group perform double leg jump stretch group act control . Outcome variable include bone mineral density ( BMD ) spine hip , estimate bone volumetric density spine , cross-sectional geometry femoral neck diaphysis . Implementing specific bone-loading program childhood potentially allow bone increase mass mineralization earlier age therefore provide large foundation mineralization growth throughout adolescence skeletal maturity reach . We expect finding provide basis design strategy build bone growth thereby reduce osteoporotic fracture .</detailed_description>
