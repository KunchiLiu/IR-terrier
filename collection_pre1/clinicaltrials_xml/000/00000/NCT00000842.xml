	<brief_summary>To assess efficacy , safety , tolerability recombinant human nerve growth factor ( rhNGF ) treatment HIV-associated sensory neuropathy . AS PER AMENDMENT 5/6/97 : To compare change viral load double-blind phase baseline week 4 placebo active rhNGF recipient . To ensure rhNGF induce increase viral load compare viral load change see placebo . Up , treatment HIV-associated sensory neuropathy symptomatic , rely pain-modifying agent membrane-stabilizing drug . Because nerve growth factor important development maintenance sympathetic sensory neuron outgrowth , propose recombinant human nerve growth factor may provide specific restorative treatment HIV-associated painful sensory neuropathy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II , Double-Blind Trial Recombinant Human Nerve Growth Factor Treatment HIV-Associated Sensory Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up , treatment HIV-associated sensory neuropathy symptomatic , rely pain-modifying agent membrane-stabilizing drug . Because nerve growth factor important development maintenance sympathetic sensory neuron outgrowth , propose recombinant human nerve growth factor may provide specific restorative treatment HIV-associated painful sensory neuropathy . Patients randomize receive either rhNGF one two dos placebo , administer subcutaneously twice weekly 18 week . Patients stratify three group within regimen use didanosine , zalcitabine , stavudine follow : current use vs. discontinue 8 26 week randomization vs. never use discontinue use least 26 week randomization . Patients assess pain daily use Gracely Pain Scale . AS PER AMENDMENT 5/6/97 : After completion double-blind phase ( 18 week treatment follow 4 week treatment ) , patient may receive open-label , active drug treatment accord previously assign regimen additional 48 week .</detailed_description>
