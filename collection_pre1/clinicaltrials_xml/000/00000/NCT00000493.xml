	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The study method minimize mass ischemic infarcted myocardium associate myocardial infarction identify topic research priority 1973 Report Panel Chairman Preparation National Heart , Blood Vessel , Lung , Blood Program . In September 1976 , Institute convene workshop involve 32 investigator active field , respondent past solicitation , expert topic collaborative clinical trial , member previous review committee , several member Cardiology Advisory Committee . The attendee enthusiastic practicality timeliness collaborative clinical trial field . The concept collaborative clinical trial protect ischemic myocardium discuss Cardiology Advisory Committee meet September 22 , 1976 , recommend affirmatively enthusiastically . This trial part Institute 's initiative review favorably recommended National Heart , Lung , Blood Advisory Council December 1976 meeting . The trial consist five clinical center , six central laboratory , clinical coordinating center , data coordinate center . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized . Group A patient randomized propranolol therapy , hyaluronidase therapy , control therapy ; patient assign Group B ( propranolol contraindicate ) assign hyaluronidase control therapy . Single-blind propranolol therapy , double-blind hyaluronidase control therapy ; fix sample . Detailed follow-up clinical status endpoint six-month period ; annual health status follow-up thereafter . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Query View Report ( QVR ) .</detailed_description>
