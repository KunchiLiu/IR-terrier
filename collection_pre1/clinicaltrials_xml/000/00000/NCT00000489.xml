	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Although generally agree many patient severe angina pectoris improve symptomatically coronary artery surgery , less consensus concerning , example , effect procedure , long-term benefit criterion patient selection . In addition , few data less agreement effect proper role procedure clinical circumstance . Both surgical procedure prior diagnostic procedure represent substantial cost monetary manpower term ; moreover , entail morbidity mortality risk . There existed urgent need reliable quantitative information regard effect coronary artery surgery patient ischemic heart disease . To meaningful , data set perspective clinical course patient medical treatment . This assessment presuppose meaningful classification patient therapeutic intervention well evaluation effect surgical medical regimen term mortality , quality life , objective hemodynamic physiological measurement . Only information could provide sufficient background determine suitability coronary artery surgery particular patient . In 1972 , National Heart Lung Advisory Council identify question topic high priority , National Heart Lung Institute establish Ad Hoc Policy Advisory Board Coronary Artery Surgery assist develop program research activity . In report , Board note 'critical need objective data long- short-term effect coronary artery surgery . ' Requests proposal issue carry recommendation Board . Planning trial conduct June 1973 April 1975 include protocol design , development manual operation , pilot study registry . In August 1975 , registry patient ' entry randomization begin 11 clinical center coordinate center . Initial projection patient population number underestimate ; therefore , five clinical center add trial 1976 . The five clinical subgroup patient randomized study include : stable angina normal resting leave ventricular function ; stable angina impair leave ventricular function ; post-myocardial infarction without angina ; congestive heart failure due primarily ischemic heart disease ; patient previously asymptomatic discover serious coronary artery disease . All subgroup must meet specifically outlined clinical angiographic criterion place randomized subset . The two subset ( distinguish subgroup ) study include patient unsuitable randomization surgery treatment choice judgment many physician patient medical management treatment choice . The patient enrol registry randomize trial follow 10-year period . This allowed evaluation primary endpoint , death myocardial infarction , secondary endpoint , angina , status , quality life . A total 24,959 patient entered registry ; 780 patient enter trial . Recruitment end 1979 . Intervention end June 1983 . Follow-up extend additional five year June 1989 . Data analysis continue May 1995 grant support . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , non-blind , sequential . Some 780 patient meet criterion specific subset base history , physical exam , laboratory test , catheterization , angiography randomize either surgical medical therapy . Primary endpoint include death myocardial infarction .</detailed_description>
