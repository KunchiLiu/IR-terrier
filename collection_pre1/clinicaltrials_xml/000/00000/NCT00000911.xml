	<brief_title>A Study Monitor Patients With Primary Early HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary HIV-1 infection frequently identify nonspecific viral syndrome occur within 20 day 8 week follow documented HIV exposure . However , symptom vary person person , people undergo asymptomatic seroconversion . Because difficulty identify patient either acute HIV infection ( within 30 day initial infection ) early infection ( within 12 month initial infection ) , systematic review viral dynamic immunodynamics patient population undertaken . A good understanding virologic immunologic parameter acute early HIV infection provide information relevant optimal design future clinical therapeutic trial . The patient intervention obtain blood , lymph node tissue , CSF , semen vaginal secretion specimen designate interval accord schedule evaluation . Patients follow 5 year . Patients may elect start discontinue antiretroviral therapy time ; however , antiretroviral therapy administer part study . Descriptive analysis include tolerance toxicity , magnitude durability RNA suppression , magnitude durability immunologic response ( CD4 CD8 cell ) , decay emergence resistant virus tissue reservoir ( CSF , genital secretion , lymph node ) .</detailed_description>
