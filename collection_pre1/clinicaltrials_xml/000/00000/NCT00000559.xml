	<brief_title>Women 's Estrogen/Progestin Lipid Lowering Hormone Atherosclerosis Regression Trial ( WELL-HART )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The trial logical extension precede observational cross-sectional study estrogen replacement therapy . Overall , study suggest 50 percent reduction risk coronary heart disease current estrogen user compare non-users . In spite striking finding , study prone number bias . One major criticism observational study woman receive estrogen generally healthier compliant non-estrogen user . There large body observational data suggest use estrogen postmenopausal woman reduce coronary heart disease mortality approximately 45 percent . At time , concern replacement therapy increase likelihood uterine cancer perhaps breast cancer well , although generally accept risk probably significantly less benefit obtain reduction coronary heart disease mortality . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled . After baseline angiogram , patient randomize one three arm : micronized 17-beta estradiol , 1 milligram per day ; 17-beta estradiol plus medroxyprogesterone , 5 milligram per day twelve day per month ; placebo . Subjects three arm receive lipid-lowering therapy , low fat/low cholesterol diet , HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor , pravastatin , sufficient dosage reduce low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol level 130 mg/dl . The primary endpoint progression/regression coronary obstructive disease measure angiography , include expert human panel quantitative computer analysis . The secondary endpoint carotid media-intima thickness determine ultrasound . Clinical measure include lipid , lipoprotein , apolipoproteins , estradiol medroxyprogesterone level , urinary prostanoid metabolite , insulin/glucose metabolism . Subjects recruit three center active coronary angiography unit . Several core facility support study : Core Lipid Lab , Reproductive Endocrine Lab , Biostatistics Lab ( Data Coordinating Center ) Angiographic Imaging Laboratory . The study completion date list record obtain `` Completed Date '' enter Query View Report System ( QVR ) .</detailed_description>
