	<detailed_description>Although change reverse transcriptase ( RT ) inhibitor recommend add change protease inhibitor treatment regimen , choice available RT inhibitor often limit prior exposure , toxicity , pharmacologic interaction protease inhibitor . This study address question whether continue 3TC substitute nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) DLV add IDV therapy patient previously treat ddI d4T plus 3TC great 500 copies/ml plasma HIV-1 RNA . Although activity DLV monotherapy combination nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor limited duration due rapid emergence resistance , possible DLV contribute significantly activity 3-drug regimen include new RT inhibitor plus protease inhibitor . Patients great 500 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml randomize 3 treatment arm follow : Arm I : d4T + ZDV placebo + DLV + IDV Arm II : ZDV + d4T placebo + 3TC + IDV Arm III : ZDV + d4T placebo + DLV + IDV Treatment arm give 24 week .
