	<brief_summary>To determine safety intradermal gp160 HIV seropositive individual asymptomatic relatively intact immune system . To determine whether evidence delayed-type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) response ( `` positive '' skin test ) patient , also dose gp160 elicits delayed-type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) response . Early immunity HIV may play important role long interval virus infection onset clinical disease . Immune response demonstrate HIV-infected individual within week month infection . Although none response show protective , possible boost anti-HIV immune response immunization may slow progression HIV infection . DTH responses HIV-derived recombinant envelope glycoprotein could provide mean measure important immune function infect patient , serve easily measure surrogate marker cellular immunity . In addition elicit local , cutaneous DTH response , intradermal inoculation skin test antigen may immunogenic , result new antibody production cellular immune response . This study allow direct comparison gp160 administer intradermally alum-adjuvanted intramuscular preparation respect immunogenicity HIV seropositive patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Early immunity HIV may play important role long interval virus infection onset clinical disease . Immune response demonstrate HIV-infected individual within week month infection . Although none response show protective , possible boost anti-HIV immune response immunization may slow progression HIV infection . DTH responses HIV-derived recombinant envelope glycoprotein could provide mean measure important immune function infect patient , serve easily measure surrogate marker cellular immunity . In addition elicit local , cutaneous DTH response , intradermal inoculation skin test antigen may immunogenic , result new antibody production cellular immune response . This study allow direct comparison gp160 administer intradermally alum-adjuvanted intramuscular preparation respect immunogenicity HIV seropositive patient . Each 10 volunteer initially inject low dose intradermal antigen injection site observe 24 , 48 , 72 hour . Clinical laboratory evaluation perform 4 8 week inoculation . If delayed-type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) response low dose , patient retested next dose 8 week later dose escalation continue 8-week interval ( 1 ) DTH response gp160 ; ( 2 ) maximum anticipate dose reach . In individual , high dosage administer evidence DTH response . Patients DTH may continue receive booster injection gp160 3 month interval week 70 . Patients immune response DTH may continue receive injection additional year . A second group 10 asymptomatic individual recruit inoculate dose found bring either DTH lymphocyte proliferative response 7 10 patient first group . If second group confirm result initial group , study amend include patient AIDS-related complex ( ARC ) AIDS .</detailed_description>
