	<brief_title>Penicillin Prophylaxis Sickle Cell Disease ( PROPS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : For 20 year child sickle cell anemia know increased susceptibility severe bacterial infection , particularly due Streptococcus pneumoniae . Meningitis , pneumonia septicemia due organism recognize major cause death child , child three year age high risk . The annual incidence pneumococcal septicemia among young child sickle cell anemia appear remain remarkably constant last two decade approximately 10 percent . This illness often fulminant , progress onset fever death le 12 hour , case fatality rate range high 35 percent . Penicillin prophylaxis advocate preventive measure severe pneumococcal infection child sickle cell anemia . One study show risk pneumococcal infection child could reduce use parenteral penicillin . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Phase I multi-center , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial . One hundred five patient assigned penicillin group 110 placebo . The primary endpoint document severe infection due S. pneumoniae . The secondary endpoint severe infection due organism S. pneumoniae . Because data available define age prophylactic penicillin could safely discontinue , NHLBI launch Phase II Prophylactic Penicillin Study begin 1987 . Recruitment end August , 1993 . The clinical phase Phase II end August , 1994 . Phase II multi-center randomize trial evaluate hazard discontinue daily oral penicillin age five year . Within three month fifth birthday , child randomize continue oral penicillin prophylaxis stop prophylaxis . Each child follow minimum two year . The primary endpoint comparison document pneumococcal infection child continue penicillin five year age versus child whose prophylaxis stop five year age . Ancillary study conduct subset patient include : prevalence colonization nasopharynx antibiotic resistant microorangisms ; relationship antibody response pneumococcal vaccination incidence pneumococcal sepsis patient population .</detailed_description>
