	<brief_title>Chelation Therapy Iron Overload With Pyridoxal Isonicotinoyl Hydrazone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Iron overload patient refractory anemia may consequence repeat blood transfusion , excessive absorption dietary iron , combination . The body lack effective mean excretion excess iron patient refractory anemia , inexorable accumulation iron contain transfused red cell absorb diet eventually exceed body 's capacity safe storage . Without treatment , widespread iron-induced damage liver , heart , pancreas , organ follow early death , often result cardiac failure . Treatment chelate agent capable sequester iron permit excretion body widely-used therapeutic approach . Desferrioxamine first introduce 30 year ago iron-chelating agent clinical use . A number recent study show regular chelation therapy desferrioxamine prevent organ damage improve survival transfusion-dependent patient thalassemia major disorder . However , desferrioxamine give orally poorly absorbed effective must give subcutaneous intravenous infusion use small portable syringe pump , ideally 12 hour day . Compliance regimen frequently poor , particularly adolescent thalassemia major may great risk lethal complication iron overload . With modern transfusion program , one main threat life patient transfusion-dependent anemias non-compliance iron-chelation therapy . Moreover , cost desferrioxamine therapy transfusion-dependent therapy exceed $ 10,000 per year , part drug must isolate bacterial culture . Despite limitation , trial desferrioxamine validate iron chelation therapeutic approach iron overload . PIH first recognize effective iron chelator vitro 1979 . It easily produce Schiff base condensation two widely use , inexpensive drug , vitamin B-6 ( pyridoxal ) antituberculous agent isoniazid . The recent Phase I study low-dose PIH healthy control volunteer iron overload find evidence toxicity produce amount iron excretion would clinically useful treatment non-transfusion-dependent patient iron-loading anemia . The trial provide evidence orally-administered PIH substitute chronic subcutaneous infusion desferrioxamine management iron overload refractory anemia . The trial part Institute-initiated study Iron Overload : Cooley 's Anemia Other Disorders . DESIGN NARRATIVE : There three study Phase II trial . Study 1 demonstrate safety effectiveness oral PIH reduce body iron burden near-normal level non-transfusion-dependent patient iron-loading anemia . Study 2 demonstrate safety effectiveness oral PIH maintain near-normal body iron store transfusion-dependent patient previously well-chelated chronic subcutaneous intravenous desferrioxamine . Study 3 demonstrate safety effectiveness oral PIH reduce body iron burden near normal level iron-loaded transfusion-dependent patient . Studies 1 2 carry concurrently . Study 3 begin method use first two study document sufficient level iron excretion permit iron-loaded transfusion patient keep pace ongoing transfusional loading excrete previous accumulation iron . After initial 21 day balance study demonstrate select dose PIH produce sufficient iron excretion , patient begin chronic therapy . PIH placebo give day 4 9 day 13 18 randomize , double-blind , cross-over design . Study 4 demonstrate effectiveness 21 patient oral deferiprone inducing sustain decrease body iron concentration compatible avoidance complication iron overload . Repeat balance study carry three month , six month , thereafter least annually hematological biochemical parameter monitor weekly interval first month , biweekly interval next two month , least monthly thereafter . Studies conduct Cleveland Metropolitan General Hospital Siriraj Hospital Bangkok , Thailand .</detailed_description>
