	<brief_summary>To evaluate safety tolerance oral zidovudine ( AZT ) give period 24 week child 3 month 12 year age . The effectiveness AZT treat HIV infection infant child also evaluate . HIV infection child often associate symptomatic disease poor prognosis . Treatment antiviral therapy may effective alter course disease decrease mortality child . AZT show effective certain adult patient symptomatic HIV infection . It therefore likely infected child may also benefit treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HIV infection child often associate symptomatic disease poor prognosis . Treatment antiviral therapy may effective alter course disease decrease mortality child . AZT show effective certain adult patient symptomatic HIV infection . It therefore likely infected child may also benefit treatment . The participant receive AZT mixed juice dose dependent body size every 6 hour 24 week . The child evaluate weekly first 4 week , every two week subsequent 8 week , monthly thereafter . Blood sample collect periodically cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) lumbar puncture 2 occasion .</detailed_description>
