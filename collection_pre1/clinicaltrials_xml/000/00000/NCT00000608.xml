	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : High blood pressure , define systolic blood pressure great equal 140 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure great equal 90 mm Hg , take antihypertensive medication , affect 24 percent United States adult population 50 million people . Because risk cardiovascular disease stroke increase increase blood pressure throughout entire range blood pressure level , people blood pressure optimal level 120/80 increase risk disease . Approximately 48 percent adult population blood pressure either normal optimal level Stage 1 hypertension , prevalence increase age . To combat highly prevalent condition , primary prevention lifestyle modification represent highly promising strategy public health . DASH - Sodium extend research DASH trial address several issue relevance clinical practice public health capitalize success DASH follow multicenter outpatient feed study model . The model permit true test efficacy high adherence follow-up rate . In addition , population study across four geographic area , encompass individual diastolic blood pressure 80-95 mm Hg systolic blood pressure &lt; 160 mm Hg , broadly representative , thus make result generalizable large portion United States population . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The effect blood pressure three level sodium intake two dietary pattern compare . The combined impact sodium reduction dietary intervention evaluate potential non-pharmacologic treatment alternative drug therapy stage one hypertension maintain normal blood pressure level . The two dietary pattern control diet represent typical American diet intervention diet ( DASH diet ) high fruit , vegetable , include whole grain , poultry , fish , nut , reduce fat , red meat , sweet , sugar-containing beverage dairy product . The three level sodium high ( current United States intake ) , intermediate ( current recommend level ) , low ( potentially optimal level ) . Participants assign one two dietary pattern use parallel group design feed sodium level use randomize cross-over design . Three eligibility pre-screening visit follow two-week run-in feeding period four-week intervention period three sodium level . During run-in intervention feeding period , food provide participant . They require attend clinic least one meal per day , five day per week , take home food eat meal . Each four clinic recruit 100 participant . Blood pressure measure week first three week five time last week . During final feeding period , fast blood collect 24-hour urine collection analyze magnesium , potassium . calcium , sodium , creatinine . DASH - Sodium determine , separately race , gender , hypertension status : 1 ) effect blood pressure three level dietary sodium within context control diet DASH diet ; 2 ) effect blood pressure DASH diet , relative control diet , three level sodium intake . The study also assess whether effect blood pressure go high low sodium diet differ participant control DASH diet . Lastly , study determine whether blood pressure effect associate reduce sodium high intermediate level differs blood pressure effect associate reduce sodium intermediate low level , , test whether blood pressure effect sodium linear across sodium level diet . Recruitment screen begin August 1997 . The first cohort begin experimental diet January 1998 last cohort complete diet November 1999 . A total 412 participant enrol study . Results present annual meeting American Society Hypertension May 2000 . The study renew R01HL57114 analyze data trial The hypothesis test genetic makeup modulates BP effect DASH diet reduce sodium intake one follow mechanism : 1 ) effect vascular tone ; 2 ) effect mineralocorticoid regulation sodium homeostasis ; 3 ) effect non-classical regulation sodium homeostasis .</detailed_description>
