	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Congestive heart failure major cause mortality morbidity , sudden arrhythmic death cause death 30 50 percent die . The study address problem test two intervention promise benefit . To date , many therapy test congestive heart failure either ineffective actually decrease survival . Conventional therapy still relatively ineffective recent study Congestive Heart Failure - Survival Trial Antiarrhythmic Therapy ( CHF-STAT ) demonstrate mortality 40 percent two-and-half year follow-up . The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator appear effective patient resuscitate cardiac arrest , recently , device require thoracotomy reserved patient high risk sudden death . The new transvenous device pectoral patch consider broad application . Although mixed result amiodarone patient congestive heart failure , general consensus could effective proper subset patient congestive heart failure . A comparison optimal device drug appropriate high risk population . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Three-armed , randomize , multicenter trial conduct 125 North American , Australian New Zealand site . Patients enrol 2.5 year randomly assign amiodarone , match placebo implantable cardiac defibrillator ( ICD ) . Median follow-up 45.5 month . All three arm use conventional therapy heart failure coronary artery disease ( ACE inhibitor , lipid lower beta-blockers ) . The central hypothesis amiodarone ICD would improve survival compare placebo . The primary outcome prevention all-cause mortality . Secondary outcome measure include cardiac mortality arrhythmic mortality , morbidity , quality life , incremental cost-effectiveness intervention . The study completion date list record obtain `` End Date '' enter Protocol Registration Results System ( PRS ) record .</detailed_description>
