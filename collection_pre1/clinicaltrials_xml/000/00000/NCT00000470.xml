	<brief_title>Infant Heart Surgery : Central Nervous System Sequelae Circulatory Arrest</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The pediatric medical community long concern increase incidence cerebral dysfunction among newborn severe cyanotic congenital heart disease . There concern great number potential predisposing factor include effect hypoxemia acidosis , trauma cardiac catheterization , duration prolong decrease arterial oxygen saturation . Many infant undoubtedly undergo significant brain damage prior surgery , may subject insult peri-operative period . The propose trial study circulatory arrest versus low-flow bypass method surgical support homogeneous group patient manage identical fashion aspect treatment . Major factor , influence cardiac catheterization presurgical status specifically incorporate primary statistical analysis . This important order identify significant predisposing cause brain injury beyond surgical technique compare , increase power comparison . DESIGN NARRATIVE : Randomized , partially blind . Infants assign deep hypothermia either circulatory arrest low-flow bypass support arterial switch surgical repair transposition great artery . Randomization stratify diagnosis ( without septal defect ) specific surgeon three , thus yield six stratum within treatment group . Randomization also block minimize imbalance treatment assignment stratum . The study partially blind , outcome data obtain investigator unaware management , surgical care , intensive care standardize . Hemodynamic assessment make early post-operative period . The outcomes primary interest ( magnetic resonance imaging , neurologic examination , psychometric test ) review one-year evaluation , maximize relevance long-term prognosis . Pre-operative seven-to-ten day post-operative neurologic examination also carry . Developmental status one year measure Bayley developmental scale Fagan test infant intelligence . Brain function assess neurologic examination one year . The recruitment period extend April 1988 February 1992 . The trial extend December 1997 allow four year follow-up . The follow-up allowed assessment primary outcome variable neurologic domain primary outcome variable developmental domain . The primary outcome variable neurologic examination result ordered classification three category normal , minor , major dysfunction , apraxia cerebral palsy . Development assess use standardized measure cognition , behavior , language , attention , motor skill . The primary outome variable developmental evaluation intelligence quotient Wechsler Preschool Primary Scale Intelligence ( WPPSI-R ) . Secondary outcome variable include measurement behavior performance specific domains speech language , visual motor integration , attention , motor function , temperament . Beginning January 1998 , study extend additional four year December 2001 compare effect two intraoperative method respect developmental neurologic status eight year age . Developmental status assess Wechsler Individual Achievement Test ( primary outcome ) presence learn disability performance specific neuropsychologic domain ( secondary outcome ) . Neurologic status determine neurologic exam ( primary outcome ) specific type dysfunction motor problem . The study also compare academic intellectual performance cohort age eight year population norm use data identify correlate child 's eight year outcomes , well development age one eight .</detailed_description>
