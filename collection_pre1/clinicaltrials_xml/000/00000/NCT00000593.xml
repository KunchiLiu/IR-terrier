Patients schedule transfusion enter study time first transfusion randomize receive leukopoor red cell filter within 24 hour collection unmanipulated blood component . Patients receive blood per treatment arm need one two year . Patients stratify CD4 count 50 /MM3 ( patient ) CD4 count level . Primary endpoint overall survival change HIV viremia 1st transfusion . The secondary endpoint occurrence new AIDS-defining complication . A substudy look donor lymphocyte immunosuppressed recipient help determine AIDS patient n't seem get post-transfusion graft-vs-host disease . The patient recruitment time extend one year low accrual . With new drug , especially protease inhibitor , proportion patient need transfusion decrease . The patient less severely ill disease produce less anemia . Furthermore , new drug n't anemia side effect . The trial end January , 2000 .
