	<detailed_description>In advanced glaucoma , medication alone longer reduce intraocular pressure adequately , eye field defect . Before 1980 , type filtering surgery , trabeculectomy , usual method intervention . Since , laser trabeculoplasty become popular alternative . Sometimes first intervention choose succeed control pressure many year ; time , success last week month . Because success limit , patient , time , need undergo sequence surgical intervention . Little known sequence give best long-range outcome . The Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study ( AGIS ) design provide comprehensive assessment long-range outcomes medical surgical management advance glaucoma . The study use visual function status compare two intervention sequence manage disease . Eligible eye randomly assign one two intervention sequence : ( 1 ) trabeculectomy , follow argon laser trabeculoplasty ( ALT ) trabeculectomy fail , follow second trabeculectomy ALT fail ; ( 2 ) ALT , follow trabeculectomy ALT fail , follow another trabeculectomy first trabeculectomy fail . Antifibrotic agent may use adjunct trabeculectomy , eyes previous history invasive surgery . Eyes fail entire assign sequence intervention manage discretion AGIS physician collaboration patient . Interventions supplement medical treatment need . A total 789 eye advance glaucoma enrol . All patient follow standardized protocol minimum 5 year determine degree visual function loss , failure rate intervention , rate complication , need supplemental therapy . After initial intervention , followup examination schedule 1 week , 4 week , 3 month , 6 month , every 6 month thereafter . After second third intervention , followup examination schedule 1 4 week . Additional visit schedule necessary management disease . The primary outcome variable AGIS average percent eye decrease vision , decrease vision substantial decline either visual field visual acuity attributable effect glaucoma . Secondary outcome variable include sustained decrease vision , failure intervention , number prescribe glaucoma medication , level intraocular pressure . An ancillary study assess filter bleb encapsulation .</detailed_description>
