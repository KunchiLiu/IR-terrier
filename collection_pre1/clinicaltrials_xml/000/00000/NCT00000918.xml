	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety effectiveness combine several anti-HIV drug order decrease plasma viral load ( level HIV blood ) HIV-positive patient fail nelfinavir ( NFV ) treatment . In order determine ability drug regimen decrease viral load drug treatment fail , best test variety different drug `` cocktail '' ( drug regimen ) . The drug cocktail study include 2 new nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) , efavirenz ( NNRTI , non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ) , either 1 2 protease inhibitor . It important include multiple drug different group drug cocktail since combination contain few drug likely fail .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Compare The Ability Different Anti-HIV Drugs Decrease Viral Load After Nelfinavir ( Anti-HIV Drug ) Treatment Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To maximize likelihood favorable response salvage therapy , 4 5 drug regimen study . Regimens contain few drug , particularly lack non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) efavirenz , likely result unacceptable rate virological failure . Therefore , study examines drug combination include two new nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) , NNRTI efavirenz , either one two protease inhibitor know produce cross-resistance nelfinavir . Patients randomly select receive 1 follow 4 treatment regimen : Arm A : Ritonavir , saquinavir , efavirenz , 2 new NRTIs . Arm B : Indinavir , efavirenz 2 new NRTIs . Arm C : Amprenavir , efavirenz , 2 new NRTIs . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 3/22/00 : Patients option increase APV dose add low-dose ritonavir . APV continue provide study ; ritonavir provide study . ] Arm D : Indinavir , amprenavir , efavirenz , 2 new NRTIs . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 6/28/99 : All treatment regimens must include least 1 new NRTI . ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 3/22/00 : ACTG 400 continue provide originally randomize study medication patient approximately May 10 , 2000 , regardless virologic response . Patients may also add antiretrovirals choice regimen ( provide study ) . ] Clinical assessment take Weeks 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , every 8 week thereafter duration study . In addition , 2 substudies conduct : drug-interaction substudy drug-exposure substudy . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 3/22/00 : Both substudies close accrual pharmacokinetics assessment discontinue . ]</detailed_description>
