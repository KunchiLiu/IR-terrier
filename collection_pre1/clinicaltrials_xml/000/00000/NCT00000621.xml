	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , include chronic bronchitis emphysema , affect 16 million Americans , fourth lead cause death USA , cost nation billion direct indirect health care cost . Though two million 16 million people COPD emphysema , emphysema disabling , account approximately half 114 million day restrict activity half 53 million day disability attribute COPD per year . Emphysema characterize destruction air space wall , lead anatomically abnormal , persistent enlargement airspace distal terminal bronchiole , without obvious fibrosis . The clinical result continuous dyspnea due hyperinflation lung , distention chest wall , disadvantage respiratory muscle , hypoxia , even rest . Treatment option emphysema limit primarily aim symptomatic relief dyspnea maximize depleted reserve patient . In late stage , care supportive , form oxygen therapy , bronchodilator , nutritional supplementation exercise rehabilitation . Exercise rehabilitation show improve quality life , oxygen therapy show affect survival . For patient le 60 year old , lung transplantation may possible , scarcity donor lung expense greatly limit option efficacy study . Lung volume reduction surgery currently investigation effect symptom survival . For patient hereditary alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency , recent report NHLBI support Alpha-1-Antitrypsin Deficiency Registry Study Group caution although moderate airflow obstruction may benefit augmentation therapy , study need draw firm conclusion answer question dose dose schedule . Recent laboratory data show all-trans-retinoic acid , derivative vitamin A , regenerate alveolus adult rat elastase induce emphysema ( Massaro , GD Massaro D. Retinoic Acid Treatment Abrogates Elastase-induced Pulmonary Emphysema Rats . Nature Med 3:675-677 , 1997 ) . Based upon finding prior septation , rat fibroblast rich vitamin A storage granule , high concentration cellular retinol bind protein , lung nuclear retinoic acid bind receptor , diminish septation fact retinoic acid increase number alveoli rat , investigator reason retinoic acid play key role septation . Tracheal instillation elastase adult rat result increase lung volume , decrease surface area , large alveoli human emphysema . Intra peritoneal injection all-trans retinoic acid elastase-treated rat 12 day prior sacrifice reduce lung volume increase surface area normal . In addition elastase-treated rat , trans-retinoic acid find induce formation alveolus normal rat , neonatal rat treat dexamethasone , prevents septation , adult tight skin mouse , fetal mouse lung culture . These finding lead interest medical community whether adult emphysema patient might get symptomatic relief treatment all-trans-retinoic acid . In September 1998 , NHLBI convene workshop , entitle `` Clinical Trial Feasibility : All-trans-Retinoic Acid Treatment Emphysema '' , discus feasibility clinical trial test efficacy retinoic acid treatment emphysema . The workshop participant agree laboratory finding excite , proof principle study need demonstrate whether laboratory finding could apply human emphysema . Since adequate information dose range toxicity retinoids human , adequate method assess extent emphysema , adequate method assess biological activity distribution retinoids human lung , workshop participant think study emphysema patient possible appropriate . Several possible population retinoids , especially retinoic acid , discuss appropriate clinical trial . However , participant think sufficient information available recommend single trial design recommend conduct multiple small trial , allow flexibility choice population , retinoid , dos , outcome . DESIGN NARRATIVE : The core study multi-center , randomize , double-masked , placebo-controlled clinical trial enrol total 300 non-smoking person emphysema 5 participate clinical center . Study participant randomly assign 1:1:1 ratio one three retinoid treatment arm . Within study arm , participant randomize active treatment match placebo 3:1 ratio . After six month follow-up , three month crossover period begin . Participants initially assign active treatment begin take matched placebo , participant originally assign placebo begin take active treatment . Retinoid treatment arm all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA trademark , Roche Laboratories , Inc. ) two different dos 13-cis retinoic acid ( cRA , Roche Laboratories , Inc. ) , match placebo . Several single-center substudies also perform .</detailed_description>
