	<brief_summary>This multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study evaluate rosiglitazone : 4 mg tablet placebo tablet administer orally twice daily 12 week . The purpose study evaluate efficacy safety rosiglitazone treatment mild moderately active ulcerative colitis . Disease activity measure use standard disease activity index . Calculation index require patient undergo flexible sigmoidoscopy start study week 12 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Rosiglitazone Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ulcerative colitis disease characterize inflammation ( change happen tissue body injure ) portion large intestine . There presently medical cure ulcerative colitis , although surgical removal colon would cure disease . Ulcerative colitis generally treat medication diarrhea infection , medication suppress immune system ( body system protect person foreign substance ) surgery . It think chronic inflammation associate ulcerative colitis may relate release certain chemical produce body . Rosiglitazone show inhibit production chemical . The active component rosiglitazone also show improve colitis animal model colitis . The purpose study evaluate benefit drug ulcerative colitis compare placebo . This randomize controlled trial rosiglitazone versus placebo patient fail respond 5-ASA therapy . Participants randomize receive either rosiglitazone 4mg bid placebo bid twice daily total 12 week . Disease activity measure use Disease Activity Index ( DAI ) visit 3 8 . Additional outcome measure include histological disease activity ( visit 3 7 ) quality life use IBDQ ( visit 3 8 ) . The principle analyse intent-to-treat analysis examine efficacy rosiglitazone dose 4mg twice daily compare placebo achieve partial complete response . Additionally , change NF-ÎºB activation prior follow therapy either placebo rosiglitazone examine use immunohistochemistry technique .</detailed_description>
