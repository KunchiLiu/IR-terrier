	<brief_title>Atypical Neuroleptic Drugs People With Mental Retardation/Developmental Delay</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atypical neuroleptic few extrapyramidal behavioral side effect typical neuroleptic . Atypical neuroleptic may also improve social cognitive functioning . This improvement may due reduction negative symptom part psychosis psychiatric syndrome improved side effect profile . This study examine effect atypical neuroleptic drug risperidone , clozapine , olanzapine learning , memory , social behavior individual MR/DD . A substudy expand study evaluate ecobehavioral measure . The goal study assess behavioral selectivity atypical neuroleptic measure cognitive social functioning along target aberrant behavior individual placebo different dos drug . Fifty participant randomize receive risperidone , clozapine , olanzapine , placebo . Twenty-five participant draw group receive typical neuroleptic onset study . The efficacy atypical neuroleptic reduce destructive , aggressive , stereotypic behavior person mental retardation assess . Learning memory measure use laboratory operant task . Social environmental interaction , well primary target behavior , directly measure trained observer . The frequency specific aberrant behavior determine , along conditional probability certain environmental event proceed follow behavior . In substudy , category aberrant behavior use provide information relevant environmental variable maintain aberrant behavior ; categorization improve determination pharmacologic efficacy provide good understand relationship atypical neuroleptic environmentally maintain aberrant behavior .</detailed_description>
