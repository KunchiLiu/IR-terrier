	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn clofarabine , give combination ara-C ( cytarabine ) , help improve disease 's response therapy increase duration response patient 50 year old leukemia . The safety combination treatment also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clofarabine Plus Cytarabine Patients With Previously Untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia High-risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) old patient improve significantly recent year compare considerable progress make young patient . Hence , new drug approach need poor-prognosis group patient AML . Nucleoside analog among active antileukemic agent available . Clofarabine synthesize rational extension experience deoxyadenosine analog . Clofarabine convert monophosphate form enzyme deoxycytidine kinase represent major metabolite clofarabine . Phosphorylation clofarabine substantially efficient nucleoside fludarabine intracellular retention triphosphate form clofarabine . Mechanisms action include inhibition DNA synthesis , inhibition DNA polymerases , potent inhibition ribonucleotide reductase ( RNR ) result depletion normal nucleotide increase DNA uptake analog . Single agent clofarabine show activity phase I study AML ALL . As potent inhibitor RNR , however , clofarabine ideal incorporate biochemical modulation strategy test validated fludarabine ara-C AML . By combine clofarabine ara-C , inhibition RNR clofarabine result drop deoxynucleotides cause decrease feedback inhibition deoxycytidine kinase rate-limiting step synthesis ara-CTP lead increased retention ara-CTP . Therefore , activity clofarabine ara-C leukemic cell would complement biochemical synergism agent result well clinical efficacy . We establish safety combination salvage patient acute leukemia .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) highrisk myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) ( &gt; 10 % blast ) . Prior therapy hydroxyurea , single agent chemotherapy ( e.g . decitabine ) , hematopoietic growth factor , biological `` target '' therapy allow . Age &gt; 50 year &lt; 74 year ( diploid cytogenetics ) &lt; 69 year ( abnormal cytogenetics ) . ECOG performance status &lt; /= 2 . Sign write informed consent form . Adequate liver function ( total bilirubin &lt; 2mg/dL , SGPT SGOT &lt; x 4 ULN ) renal function ( serum creatinine &lt; 2mg/dL ) . Male female patient fertile agree use effective barrier method birth control ( ie , latex condom , diaphragm , cervical cap , etc ) avoid pregnancy . Female patient need negative serum urine pregnancy test within 7 day study enrollment ( applies patient childbearing potential . Nonchildbearing define &gt; = 1 year postmenopausal surgically sterilize ) . Patients consider require immediate induction ( rapidly rise WBC &gt; /= 50,000 and/or organ involvement per assessment treat physician ) treat without final cytogenetic result pretreatment assessment cardiac ejection fraction ( MUGA echocardiogram ) history physical examination patient &lt; /= NYHA class II disease . AML follow cytogenetic abnormality : ( 15 ; 17 ) , ( 8 ; 21 ) , inv ( 16 ) . Cytogenetic result need available immediate induction require ( see inclusion # 7 ) . Cardiac ejection fraction &lt; 30 % . Pretreatment assessment ejection fraction necessary immediate induction require long history physical examination patient &lt; /= NYHA class II disease ( see inclusion # 7 ) . Active uncontrolled infection severe concurrent disease consider lifethreatening , , judgement investigator discussion Principal Investigator , would make patient inappropriate entry study .</criteria>
