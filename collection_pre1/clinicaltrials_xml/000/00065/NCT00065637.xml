	<brief_title>Once Weekly Parathyroid Hormone Osteoporosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In osteoporosis , skeletal bone mass strength reduce fracture occur modest level mechanical stress would harm normal bone . Fractures hip , spine , wrists typical , though fracture rib , pelvis , humerus also occur . Research show hip fracture cause 10 % 20 % increase mortality , cost osteoporotic fracture estimate $ 6.14 billion health care cost lose earnings per year . The common form osteoporosis postmenopausal osteoporosis . A reduction bone mineral density approximately 1 % 2 % per year observe first 3 5 year onset menopause , 0.5 % 1 % per year thereafter . PTH recently approve FDA daily treatment osteoporosis . However , PTH must self-injected , expensive , associated worrisome side effect . The currently approve formulation daily PTH self-injections practical small proportion people osteoporosis . A weekly formulation could significantly decrease cost , difficulty administration , risk side effect associate daily use PTH . A weekly injection caregiver would also make PTH accessible population daily self-injection may practical , elderly assist living nursing home . This study evaluate safety effectiveness weekly PTH dose woman osteoporosis . Women randomize receive either PTH placebo . Women self-administer injection daily 4 week , weekly 48 week . All woman receive calcium vitamin D supplement daily . Women visit clinic six time course year provide urine blood sample visit . Bone mineral density measure 6 12 month .</detailed_description>
