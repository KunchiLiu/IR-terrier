	<detailed_description>From 28 33 week ' gestation , significant neurological reorganization take place , initiate fetal behavioral individuality capacity extrauterine survival . Infants born transitional stage exhibit unexpectedly significant brain dysfunction develop age . The majority infant develop psychomotor , cognitive , attentional function deficit well emotional vulnerability substandard school performance . Research suggest symptom due central deficit frontal lobe processing complex information . This central deficit may result increased vulnerability cerebral white matter last trimester gestation , phase rapid development . Persistent stress due inappropriate sensory stimulation may contribute alteration early brain structure function . This study identify specific adaptation preterm brain transient NICU experience order estimate potential experience remodel neuroanatomical structure neurodevelopmental function . Further , study evaluate program specialize developmental care within NICU environment . The study ’ specialize developmental care model view preterm infant fetus attempt reduce discrepancy technological hospital environment mother ’ womb . A developmental specialist team support NICU caregiver . The developmental specialist observe infant ’ behavior use observation formulate descriptive neurobehavioral report suggestion , structure caregiving procedure coordination infant ’ sleep/wake cycle , maintain infant ’ well-regulated behavioral balance . The goal intervention promote infant ’ strength reduce infant ’ self-regulatory vulnerability . Sixty medically healthy infant bear 28 33 week ’ gestation randomly assign standard NICU care specialize developmental care . Preterm infant compare 30 healthy full term infant . All infant assess 42 week ' postconceptional age three neurodevelopmental domain : neurobehavioral function , neuroelectrophysiological function , neuroanatomic structure . Assessments focus distinct region brain ( occipital frontal lobe ) corpus callosum ( connects right leave side brain ) .</detailed_description>
