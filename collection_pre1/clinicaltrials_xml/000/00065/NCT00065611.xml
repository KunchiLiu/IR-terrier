	<brief_summary>Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS ) minimal change disease kidney diseases associate increased excretion protein urine . Approximately half FSGS patient lose kidney function within 8 year diagnosis require dialysis . The purpose study determine whether intermittent oral steroid therapy cause sustain remission FSGS MCD . Approximately 70 participant , include adult child old age 2 , enrol study . They receive 48 dos oral dexamethasone period 48 week . One group take two daily dos every 2 week ; group take four daily dos every 4 week . Doctors monitor participant , , steroid treatment extensive exam test . At completion study , researcher evaluate safety efficacy drug treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The major cause primary nephritic syndrome adult child idiopathic podocyte disease , minimal change ( MCD ) focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS ) . Our objective determine whether intermittent oral dexamethasone administer 48 week induce complete remission patient . This open-label multi-center pilot study design obtain preliminary evidence efficacy establish safety . This part long-term effort define effective mode administer pulse dexamethasone expect lead trial compare daily prednisone pulse dexamethasone . We enroll 70 patient nephritic-level proteinuria due biopsy-proven MCD ( 30 patient ) FSGS ( 40 patient ) . We include adult child great 2.0 year age . Children MCD must receive minimum 4 week maximum 10 week high-dose daily steroid , since many child responsive short course daily steroid ; requirement define steroid-resistant population . For child FSGS adult MCD FSGS , minimum duration prior steroid maximum 8 week prior high-dose daily steroid ; requirement define population receive short steroid course without response . If steroid use , inclusion criterion require persistent nephrotic syndrome ( thus exclude steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome , whether steroid-dependent frequently relapse ) . Patients may enroll NIH collaborate center . Those patient enroll NIH visit NIH Clinical Center least 4 time . Patients enrol collaborate center option come NIH Clinical Center complete research test ; circumstance enrol NIH research subject . Patients receive 48 dos oral dexamethasone period 48 week . Patients randomize one two arm : 2 daily dos every 2 week 4 daily dos every 4 week . The rationale test whether increased frequency dose great efficacy acceptable safety . For adult patient , record safety pulse dexamethasone FSGS Dexamethasone study well publish study disease . Therefore , adult pulse 50 mg/m ( 2 ) first 12 week pulse 25 mg/m ( 2 ) next 36 week . The trial pediatric patient involve dose escalation , little experience pulse dexamethasone podocyte diseases age group . In pediatric stage 1 , dexamethasone pulse 25 mg/m ( 2 ) 48 week . When 4 patient arm complete 48 week therapy , safety efficacy evaluate . If evaluation positive , embark pediatric stage 2 , dexamethasone pulse 50 mg/m ( 2 ) first 12 week 25 mg/m ( 2 ) next 36 week ( adult regimen ) . The primary endpoint presence complete remission 48 week begin therapy . Secondary endpoint include complete partial remission 48 week , complete partial remission 104 week . Assessment remission 24 hour urine collection adult child great 13.0 year first void urine sample child le 13.0 year . Patients evaluate manifestation steroid toxicity , include growth rate ( child ) , ophthalmologic complication , adrenal suppression , osteoporosis , vascular necrosis , psychological disturbance .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Adults child great 2.0 year age eligible . We exclude child le 2.0 year age light high risk steroid therapy age group high likelihood genetic syndromic FSGS , less likely respond steroid . 2 . Diagnosis : A ) Biopsyproven MCD variant , include IgM nephropathy MCD mesangial hypertrophy . B ) Biopsyproven FSGS , include idiopathic FSGS collapse FSGS . We exclude patient HIVassociated FSGS , risks steroid increase patient . We exclude hyperfiltration FSGS associate morbid obesity ( BMI great 40 kg/m ( 2 ) ) , sickle cell anemia , reflux nephropathy , chronic tubular injury , congenital renal anomaly , reduce nephron mass ; rationale FSGS variant consider refractory steroid . 3 . Proteinuria : patient must nephrotic range proteinuria . Baseline test obtain patient immunosuppressive therapy great equal 1 month . 4 . Renal function : estimate GFR must great equal 40 ml/min/1.73m ( 2 ) time study entry ; In child weigh less 40kg , GFR estimate Schwartz formula express GFR/1.73m ( 2 ) : GFR equal [ 0.7 ( male ) 0.57 ( female ) X height ( cm ) ] / serum creatinine . 5 . Angiotensin antagonist : Patients must receive angiotensin antagonist therapy , dose approve FDA . Nephrotic range proteinuria define urine protein great equal 3.5 g/1.73m ( 2 ) /d ( adult ) great 50 mg/kg ( child less 40 kg ) receive maximally tolerate dose angiotensin antagonist therapy least 4 week prior study entry . 6 . Prior immunosuppressive therapy : For child MCD , require minimum 4 week maximum 10 week daily steroid therapy dose great equal 60 mg/m ( 2 ) proteinuria persist nephrotic range ( exclude steroidsensitive , steroiddependent frequently relapse MDC ) . For child FSGS adult MCD FSGS , require minimum maximum 8 week daily alternate day steroid dose great 0.5 mg/kg proteinuria persist nephrotic range . Patients prior immunosuppressive therapy steroid eligible . 7 . If hypertensive , adequate blood pressure control ( target BP le 125/75 mm Hg great 75 % measurement adult ) . 8 . Women reproductive potential sexually active must maintain effective birth control regimen ( oral contraceptive , intrauterine device , barrier method plus spermicide ) must negative urine HCG test prior begin therapy . 9 . Patients must either negative PPD test within 3 month study entry immunosuppressive therapy , history positive PPD , must appropriate evaluation exclude untreated tuberculosis ( advice Infectious Disease consultant ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patients diabetes mellitus type 1 exclude , patient typically brittle diabetic control increase risk steroid treatment . Patients diabetes mellitus type 2 include manifest good glycemic control ( glycosylated hemoglobin less 7.5 % ) , lack proliferative retinopathy ( presence proliferative retinopathy would place high risk vision loss steroid worsen glycemic control ) renal biopsy within 6 month study entry show evidence diabetic nephropathy . 2 . Poorly control hypertension ( great 25 % value great 125/75 ) . 3 . Evidence significant chronic occult infection . Specifically , subject must evidence active hepatitis B hepatitis C infection , HIV1 infection , untreated mycobacterial infection . Minor infection , skin nail fungal infection infection advice Infectious Disease consultant , basis exclusion . 4 . Immunosuppressive medication glucocorticoid , whether podocyte disease another indication , must discontinue great 8 week prior study entry . This apply topical immunosuppressant medication . 5 . Pregnancy . 6 . Existence condition would complicate implementation interpretation study .</criteria>
