	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : This study ancillary MultiEthnic Study Atherosclerosis ( MESA ) Trial , prospective investigation etiology natural history atherosclerosis ability non-invasive tool measure atherosclerotic burden identify high risk individual large , population-based cohort . The development compute tomography ( CT ) evaluate coronary calcification ( CC ) provide tool directly measure coronary atherosclerosis non-invasively . The information obtain CT however provide information CC alone . CT ability measure quantitate aortic valve calcification ( AVC ) , mitral annular calcification ( MAC ) , aortic wall calcification leave ventricular size ( LVS ) . The longitudinal nature study allow epidemiologic association establish multitude risk factor measure , establish time sequence measure consistency association variety population ( ethnicity , gender , geographical location age ) . Magnetic resonance image heart also obtain part MESA trial , comparison LV size CT magnetic resonance measure also perform . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This study ancillary MultiEthnic Study Atherosclerosis ( MESA ) Trial , prospective investigation etiology natural history atherosclerosis ability non-invasive tool measure atherosclerotic burden identify high risk individual large , population-based cohort . The development compute tomography ( CT ) evaluate coronary calcification ( CC ) provide tool directly measure coronary atherosclerosis non-invasively . The information obtain CT however provide information CC alone . CT ability measure quantitate aortic valve calcification ( AVC ) , mitral annular calcification ( MAC ) , aortic wall calcification leave ventricular size ( LVS ) . The longitudinal nature study allow epidemiologic association establish multitude risk factor measure , establish time sequence measure consistency association variety population ( ethnicity , gender , geographical location age ) . Magnetic resonance image heart also obtain part MESA trial , comparison LV size CT magnetic resonance measure also perform . The investigator utilize scan already obtain part calcium scanning ( baseline 3.5 year follow-up ) , make four measure baseline follow-up scan obtain . The additive value simple measure CC score could possibly provide clinician even power identify stratify high-risk cardiac patient finding . This study also establish prevalence , population base study , AVC MAC , use technique highly sensitive see abnormality . It postulate 'total atherosclerotic burden ' could obtain add CAC thoracic aortic calcification , total atherosclerosis score ( without MAC AVC ) might better predict cardiovascular event CAC alone . Similarly , cohort 6,700 patient repeat scan assess factor enhance inhibit progression LVS , mitral annular , aortic valve wall calcification , lend insight therapy efficacy progression aortic sclerosis leave ventricular enlargement .</detailed_description>
