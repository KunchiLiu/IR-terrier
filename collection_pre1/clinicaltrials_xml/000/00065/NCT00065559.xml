	<brief_summary>COX-2 enzyme find several different tissue body . COX-2 appear produce substance call prostaglandin , mainly sit inflammation . Several drug approve FDA inhibit COX-2 celecoxib , brand name CelebrexÂ® . These drug primarily use patient osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis decrease inflammation pain . COX-2 inhibitor develop selective treatment inflammation pain tend few gastrointestinal side effect NSAIDs ( nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ) aspirin , ibuprofen , naproxen , etc . The normal adult kidney express COX-2 various region . Prostaglandins , produce kidney COX-2 , may contribute glomerular tubulointerstitial inflammatory disease ( type kidney disease due inflammation ) . In animal study , COX-2 inhibitor show potentially beneficial reduce amount protein spill urine preserve kidney function inflammatory kidney disease . This study compare effect COX-2 inhibitor placebo ( inactive substance ) patient diabetic nephropathy ( kidney disease due diabetes ) proteinuria ( spill protein urine ) 24-hour urinary protein excretion . This study design see whether COX-2 inhibitor useful treat diabetic patient kidney disease . The purpose study short-term pilot study allow gather important data ability carry study carry safely . Subjects proteinuria diabetic kidney disease already ACE ( Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme ) inhibitor ARB ( Angiotensin Receptor Blocker ) therapy ( type blood pressure medicine ) randomize type study subject serve control . The study set subject receive either COX-2 inhibitor placebo period follow period drug follow period receive either COX-2 inhibitor placebo ( whichever receive first period ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study design screening period , baseline period treatment period . The purpose screening identify eligible subject exclude ineligible subject . A careful history physical examination conduct ensure subject meet inclusion criterion meet exclusion criterion . The screening period last 2 day 2 month duration . The baseline period 2 - 3 month duration . During first baseline visit , withdrawal previously use angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor angiotensin receptor antagonist ( ) initiation quinapril 20 mg daily therapy ( irbesartan -- 150 - 300 mg daily ) . The subject see frequently determine investigator subject 's safety . The purpose second baseline visit determine safety initiation therapy quinapril 20 mg po per day ( irbesartan 150 - 300 mg per day ) . The purpose third baseline visit insure subject meet inclusion none exclusion criterion prior randomization . In addition , assure subject 's blood pressure safe level proceed randomization laboratory urinary collection make . Only subject fulfill inclusion none exclusion criterion proceed randomization . Also , order proceed randomization phase study , subject must blood pressure less equal 135/85mmHg . The treatment phase consist 18 week . During treatment phase , subject follow safety efficacy . The subject randomly assign COX-2 inhibitor 6 week ( 1st 6 week cycle ) , washout 3 week , placebo 6 week ( 2nd 6 week cycle ) , washout 3 week placebo 6 week ( 1st 6 week cycle ) , washout 3 week , COX-2 inhibitor 6 week ( 2nd 6 week cycle ) , washout 3 week . During baseline treatment period , interim visit hold order address blood pressure control problem patient PI deem necessary protocol adherence .</detailed_description>
