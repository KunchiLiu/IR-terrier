	<detailed_description>PWS neurogenetic disorder result loss paternal-only express gene chromosome 15 ( 15 q11-13 ) . PWS characterize persistent pattern SIB , notably skin picking , result frequent medical care attention . SIB mental retardation relate developmental disability often monitor behavioral observation method . Direct evaluation skin lesion report help systematically follow wound wound heal . However , difference type body location SIB individual PWS compare mental retardation . The goal study characterize SIB PWS evaluate efficacy topiramate versus placebo attenuate SIB individual PWS . A preliminary 8-week open-label study conduct evaluate topiramate appetite weight PWS show good tolerability beneficial effect topiramate . During study , unexpected serendipitous find six participant , four engage SIB four noticeable symptom improvement 8 week treatment . Three four continue topiramate therapy long term positive result term decrease self-injury . Participants study randomize receive either topiramate placebo 6 week . All participant monitor SIB observation photographic recording resultant skin lesion , report group home staff , standardize rating measurement self-injury . At end 6 week , participant receive topiramate receive decreasing dos topiramate ; participant receive placebo continue receive placebo . At week 9 , participant previously receive topiramate give placebo participant previously receive placebo give topiramate . After 6 week , participant enter 4-month open-label extension phase . Safety efficacy measurement assess 15 study visit ; event worsen SIB , blind broken study 's medical oversight physician , appropriate , participant place directly 4-month open-label extension phase .</detailed_description>
