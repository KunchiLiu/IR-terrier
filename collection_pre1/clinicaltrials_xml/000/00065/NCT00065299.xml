	<brief_title>Low Phenylalanine Diet Mothers With Phenylketonuria ( PKU )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PKU autosomal recessive trait cause absence phenylalanine hydroxylase . Phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme involve metabolism phenylalanine ( Phe ) . When phenylalanine hydroxylase absent defective , Phe level rise toxic Phe metabolite accumulate , cause central nervous system injury . PKU treatable disease . Affected individual must adhere diet low Phe childhood . Women PKU also adhere low Phe diet pregnancy avoid fetal damage . The offspring woman untreated maternal hyperphenylalaninemia ( HPA ) usually exhibit mental retardation , microcephaly , growth retardation , congenital anomaly . This study examine effect restrict Phe diet reproductive outcome woman maternal HPA . Participants study woman HPA whose blood Phe value persistently great 4 mg/dl . Those woman blood Phe value consistently great 8 mg/dl place Phe restrict diet maintain plasma Phe concentration 2 8 mg/dl . This level control practical achievable . Due gradient increase Phe level mother fetus , level latter would vary 3.5 12 mg/dl ; level usually associate normal outcome . Women monitor throughout pregnancy obstetric , biochemical , nutritional parameter . Women Phe restrict diet give enough Phe-limited protein , calorie , vitamin , mineral maintain adequate nutritional status . Folate supplementation provide . If indicate clinically , tyrosine ( Tyr ) supplemental trace metal prescribe . A match control sample woman offspring developed collaboration associate coordinate collaborating center . The offspring group mother follow long project permit . Those offspring born mother admit project first 2 3 year study assess intellectual ability physical health , well academic achievement school . Those admit last 3 4 year study assess intellectual ability physical health , recognize limited data available offspring .</detailed_description>
