	<brief_summary>This study examine whether drug pyrimethamine shrink lymph node spleen patient autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome ( ALPS ) . In disease , lymphocytes ( white blood cell ) die normally would . As result , patient enlarge lymph gland , spleen , liver , problem may involve blood cell count autoimmune disease ( overactivity immune system ) . Pyrimethamine orally administer antibiotic use treat prevent malaria toxoplasma , may effective shrink lymph node spleen . Patients ALPS 2 70 year age lymph gland enlargement least 1 year may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood test , possibly bone marrow test . Females reproductive age screen urine pregnancy test . Women capable become pregnant must use effective method birth control entire study period , , take early month pregnancy , pyrimethamine cause birth defect fetus . Women pregnant nursing exclude study . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - CT scan : For test , patient lie still CT scanner image take neck , chest , stomach area . A contrast dye inject vein brighten CT image . Very young child evaluate case case basis determine whether CT scan perform . - Bone marrow biopsy : Participants undergo test rule underlie bone marrow disease bone marrow test do last six month prior enrol pyrimethamine study , pyrimethamine affect bone marrow function . Under local anesthesia , needle insert back part hipbone small amount marrow remove . ( Children sedate test . ) - Leukapheresis : This procedure collect small proportion circulate white blood cell conserve majority blood cell . Specifically , blood drawn needle place arm vein direct cell separator machine , separate blood cell spin . A small proportion circulate white cell remove , red cell , platelet , plasma majority white cell return patient 's blood circulation . Only patient 7 year age old weigh least 55 pound undergo procedure . Other participant choose apheresis 3 tablespoon blood draw instead . - Pyrimethamine administration : When test complete , participant begin take pyrimethamine . The dose determine accord individual 's weight gradually increase study period . Patients take drug twice week total 12 week . - Blood test : Blood sample collect week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 begin treatment , 2 week last dose pyrimethamine . The purpose blood test check possible drug-related side effect . Patients develop skin rash , mouth sore side effect may one dose treatment drug withheld . When indicated , patient direct stop taking study drug . If need , drug side effect treat vitamin supplement , folinic acid , take mouth , 3 time weekly . - Evaluations NIH Clinical Center comprise pretreatment visit , one end treatment visit end 12 week optional post-treatment visit 3months stop pyrimethamine therapy . Patients respond well treatment may ask return NIH additional visit 3 , 6 , 12 month treatment end repeat evaluation . If lymph gland spleen become much large stop pyrimethamine , offer treatment another 12 week . If respond second course treatment , return NIH 3 , 6 , 12 month . If symptoms return , patient ask resume treatment additional 6 month . They blood draw periodically private physician return NIH evaluation every 12 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pyrimethamine Treat Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome ( ALPS ) inherit disease associate defect lymphocyte apoptosis lead lymphoproliferation autoimmunity . Although , treatment many complication , currently safe effective therapy syndrome . Recently investigator Europe serendipitously observe child ALPS show reduction spleen lymph node size pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine ( Fansidar ) Pneumocystis carinii prophylaxis . Our subsequent pilot clinical trial Fansidar ( Protocol # 01-I-0132 ) terminate failure recruit well-defined ALPS patient lack history suspicious allergy sulfa drug . Our vitro study , however reveal pyrimethamine sulfadoxine induces lymphocyte apoptosis observation suggest u pyrimethamine may beneficial alone , thus avoid added risk allergy hypersensitivity associate sulfa drug . However , potential bone marrow toxicity may result escalate dose schedule pyrimethamine respond addition folinic acid ( Leucovorin ) regimen . We propose conduct pilot study safety efficacy drug , pyrimethamine treatment ALPS . Six 8 individual , ALPS treat 3 month , initially , twice-weekly pyrimethamine ( Daraprim ) escalate dos adjust weight , addition folinic acid need aid management marrow toxicity . The effect pyrimethamine treatment lymph node and/or spleen size assess CT scan . The effect treatment laboratory feature ALPS also assess . Evaluating effect pyrimethamine clinical laboratory parameter allow u determine drug demonstrate sufficient activity warrant study large randomize control trial .</detailed_description>
