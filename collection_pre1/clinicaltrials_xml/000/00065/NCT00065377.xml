	<brief_summary>This study examine whether glucosamine affect way body respond insulin . Insulin hormone cause body use glucose ( sugar ) . Insulin work well overweight people , cause condition call insulin resistance . Insulin also increase flow blood muscle open inactive blood vessel . This study test whether glucosamine , nutritional supplement many people take treat arthritis , cause worsen insulin resistance change blood vessel react insulin normal weight overweight people . Healthy normal weight overweight volunteer 21 65 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen brief physical examination , medical history , blood urine test . After screen , participant three additional outpatient clinic visit follow procedure : Visit 1 - Glucose clamp test measure body 's response insulin : For procedure , needle place vein arm , one draw blood sample , one infusing glucose potassium solution . The glucose infuse continuously 4-hour test blood drawn frequently monitor glucose insulin level . After test , blood glucose level monitor another 2 hour make sure remain adequate level prevent hypoglycemia ( low blood sugar ) . - Blood flow measurement : Blood flow brachial artery arm measure assess many capillary ( small blood vessel ) use supply nutrient oxygen muscle forearm . This test do time glucose clamp test . Blood flow measure use technique call contrast ultrasound . A small amount contrast agent consist gas-filled bubble size red blood cell infuse 10 minute one catheter place vein glucose clamp test . The contrast agent infuse twice , begin glucose clamp test end test . The contrast material create signal response ultrasound provide information distribution capillary forearm . - Assignment medication group : Participants randomly assign take either glucosamine placebo three time day mouth 6 week . At end 6 week , study drug take 1 week , participant `` cross-over '' medication , take glucosamine first 6 week take placebo next 6 week vice versa . Visits 2 3 For visit , glucose clamp test blood flow measurement repeat . Visit 2 scheduled end first 6-week treatment period , Visit 3 scheduled end second 6-week treatment period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Oral Glucosamine Insulin Blood Vessel Activity Normal Obese People</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glucosamine popular over-the-counter nutritional supplement many people use treatment osteoarthritis . Intravenous administration glucosamine animal human cause significant metabolic insulin resistance vascular endothelial dysfunction . Moreover , experiment various cell line implicate elevated glucosamine level development insulin resistance . However , publish study examine potential effect oral glucosamine administration modulate insulin sensitivity capillary recruitment human . This significant concern insulin resistance vascular dysfunction contribute importantly major public health problem include diabetes , obesity , hypertension , cardiovascular disease . Normal healthy volunteer obese insulin resistant subject enrol randomized double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover study evaluate effect oral glucosamine modulate insulin sensitivity insulin-stimulated capillary recruitment . The reference standard hyperinsulinemic isoglycemic glucose clamp technique use assess insulin sensitivity treatment , placebo oral glucosamine ( 500 mg p.o . TID 6 week ) , completion crossover . In addition , insulin-stimulated capillary recruitment measure time glucose clamp study use ultrasound microbubble contrast technique assess blood flow brachial artery capillary recruitment forearm skeletal muscle response hyperinsulinemia . Finally , plasma glucosamine level measure prior glucose clamp study use HPLC method . The result study determine oral glucosamine administration cause significant insulin resistance impairment insulin-stimulated capillary recruitment healthy volunteer worsen insulin resistance capillary recruitment obese subject . In addition , study provide important information plasma glucosamine level change commonly used oral dos glucosamine .</detailed_description>
