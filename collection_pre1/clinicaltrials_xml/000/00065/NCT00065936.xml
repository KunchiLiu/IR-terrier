	<detailed_description>It unknown people mental retardation and/or autism repeatedly persistently injure , point tissue damage permanent scarring . Unraveling mystery pose paradoxical biomedical behavioral science question create deeply troubling problem practitioner family member affected individual . Over past decade , many case self-injurious behavior ( SIB ) treat successfully use behavioral intervention teach communication functional skill . However , practical problem implementation , cost associate long-term treatment , case clear social profile suggest still much learn people self-injure . Some form self-injury may involve intense stimulation body sit sufficient elicit release receptor bind endogenous opioid peptide . This study evaluate variable common SIB neurophysiology pain regulation . The study also clarify role endogenous opioids pain mechanisms self-injury . Participants mild profound mental retardation and/or autism observed frequency self-injury , duration intensity self-injurious behavior , body behavior direct . Following characterization , participant â€™ saliva noninvasively examine substance P , met-enkephalin , cortisol marker alter pain transmission predictor response treatment . After screen SIB subtyping ( i.e. , social , nonsocial , mixed ) , 37 participant whose self-injury primarily nonsocial mixed evaluate 16 week . Participants randomize receive either transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation ( TENS , opioid agonist treatment ) naltrexone ( opioid antagonist treatment ) . Participants whose self-injury primarily socially motivate evaluate TENS receive behavioral intervention technical assistance service delivery model . Follow-up evaluation occur Months 3 6 .</detailed_description>
