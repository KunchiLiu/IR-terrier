	<brief_summary>The purpose study : 1 . To assess efficacy lipid-lowering agent ( atorvastatin ) development atherosclerosis predispose child SLE cardiovascular event adulthood . 2 . To assess safety intermediate-term ( 36 month ) treatment child young adult atorvastatin . 3 . To characterize course SLE child young adult , establish cohort pediatric SLE patient follow prospectively . 4 . To establish mechanism conduct clinical trial rare pediatric rheumatic disease use Children 's Arthritis Rheumatology Research Alliance ( CARRA ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Children adolescent SLE represent 15 % SLE patient . Children SLE suffer high morbidity affect many organ system , reduces quality life , shorten lifespan . As child SLE survive adulthood , atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease emerge major concern . SLE significant risk factor myocardial infarction death young premenopausal woman SLE , even control traditional cardiovascular risk factor . Acceleration atherogenesis SLE likely reflect SLE-associated vascular immune inflammatory change . Although limited , data cardiovascular lipid abnormality child SLE implicate atherosclerosis important cause long-term morbidity mortality . The 3-hydroxy-3-methlglutaryl-coenzyme A ( HMG CoA ) reductase inhibitor , statin , reduce mortality morbidity atherosclerosis adult intrinsic anti-inflammatory immune modulatory property . These anti-inflammatory immune modulatory activity may particular benefit prevention treatment atherosclerosis SLE . This trial evaluate atorvastatin child SLE large cohort pediatric SLE patient ever study prospectively . Children study randomize receive either atorvastatin placebo . All child follow 3 year , 15 study visit . Study visit generally last 2 hour include medical interview , medication review pill count , physical examination , blood urine test . Cardiovascular-specific outcome measure include assessment high sensitivity CRP ; fast lipid profile ; homocysteine level ; apolipoprotein A , B1 , Lp ( ) ; carotid intima medium thickness ( IMT ) ; tensor diffusion/MRI .</detailed_description>
