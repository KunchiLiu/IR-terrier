	<brief_summary>The purpose Phase 1/2 study examine safety , tolerability , antiviral activity ISIS 14803 , give combination peginterferon alfa ribavirin , patient either fail least 100-fold HCV reduction Week 12 standard therapy still detectable HCV Week 24 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Addition ISIS 14803 Therapy With Peginterferon Ribavirin Chronic Hepatitis C ( HCV ) Patients Not Responding Adequately Two Drugs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previously untreated chronic hepatitis C patient undergo therapy peginterferon alfa ribavirin poor probability achieve sustain virologic response either 100-fold great reduction plasma HCV RNA level 12th week treatment detectable plasma HCV RNA 24th week treatment . ISIS 14803 experimental antiviral medication treatment chronic hepatitis C give chronic hepatitis C patient two previous single-agent clinical trial ( approximately 70 patient ) . In clinical research study , 12 week ISIS 14803 treatment add peginterferon alfa ribavirin treatment regimen previously untreated chronic hepatitis C patient poor probability achieve sustain virologic response base upon either two criterion . Enrolled patient must continue treated peginterferon alfa ribavirin must begin ISIS 14803 treatment within four week HCV RNA result report date . ISIS 14803 give two-hour intravenous infusion , two time week , 12 week . Depending HCV response three-drug combination , patient may continue treatment peginterferon alfa ribavirin end ISIS 14803 treatment . Patients monitor least eight week ( safety ) end ISIS 14803 treatment possibly longer ( sustain virologic response ) . Two dose level ISIS 14803 study trial , 3 6 mg/kg ideal body weight .</detailed_description>
