	<detailed_description>The transmission HIV-1 sexual parenteral route make likely successful preventive vaccine virus need induce protective immunity mucosal systemic compartment . The long-term objective program develop HIV-1 vaccine elicits protective immunity mucosal systemic compartment . The study evaluate safety immunogenicity oral recombinant Salmonella typhi HIV-1 gp120 vaccine ( SCBaL/M9 ) healthy human volunteer . This first study volunteer use intracellular bacterium deliver recombinant vector vaccine mucosally . The study also develop Env immunogen elicits broader spectrum neutralizing antibody gp120 deliver Salmonella typhi soluble protein immunogen . This Phase I dose-escalation study two vaccine component combine large prime-boost protocol desire safety endpoint obtain . Both component use conformationally constrain gp120 express epitope recognize broadly neutralizing antibody . The prim immunogen conformationally constrain gp120 gene deliver orally live attenuate Salmonella typhi . The boost immunogen soluble subunit protein comprise solely conformationally constrain gp120 . All participant study receive vaccine . Participants randomize different vaccine dos . Participants eight study visit 20 week . Study visit include brief medical interview , physical exam , blood urine test , counsel avoid HIV infection pregnancy . Participants test HIV infection 3 time study .</detailed_description>
