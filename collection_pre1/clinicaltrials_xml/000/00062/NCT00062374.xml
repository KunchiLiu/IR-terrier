	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give irinotecan together cisplatin work treat patient undergo surgical resection locally advance cancer stomach gastroesophageal junction . Drugs use chemotherapy , irinotecan cisplatin , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining one chemotherapy drug give surgery may shrink tumor remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan Cisplatin Treating Patients Who Are Undergoing Surgery For Locally Advanced Cancer Stomach Gastroesophageal Junction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate correlation FDG-PET/CT image early preoperative treatment program locally advance gastric cancer histologic response assessment patient outcome , define overall progression-free survival . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate efficacy safety preoperative chemotherapy irinotecan cisplatin treatment locally advance gastric cancer . II . To examine biology locally advance gastric cancer response chemotherapy DNA microarray technology histopathology . III . To obtain preliminary data biodistribution , dosimetry explore potential clinical usefulness FLT PET patient locally advanced gastric cancer undergo novel combination neoadjuvant chemotherapy . OUTLINE : This open-label , nonrandomized , multicenter study . Neoadjuvant chemotherapy : Patients receive cisplatin IV 30 minute follow irinotecan IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 22 , 29 . Treatment repeat every 6 week 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Surgery : Within 4 week completion neoadjuvant chemotherapy , patient undergo radical subtotal total gastrectomy lymph node dissection . Patients undergo fluorodeoxyglucose FDG-PET/CT baseline . Some patient undergo additional FDG-PET/CT scan week 3 6 . Approximately 5 patient undergo fluorothymidine FLT-PET/CT baseline , week 3 , and/or surgical resection . Patients follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
