	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy cyclophosphamide fludarabine use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Inserting gene interleukin-2 person 's tumor infiltrating lymphocyte may make body build immune response kill tumor cell . Combining cyclophosphamide fludarabine gene-modified tumor cell may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose gene-modified tumor infiltrate lymphocyte give together cyclophosphamide fludarabine see well work patient metastatic melanoma ( phase I close accrual 3/29/06 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cyclophosphamide Fludarabine Followed By Interleukin-2 Gene-Modified Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine survival patient metastatic melanoma administer interleukin-2 gene-modified tumor infiltrate lymphocyte cyclophosphamide fludarabine . - Compare survival result prior Surgery Branch study use adoptive cell therapy without interleukin-2 retroviral vector ( SBIL-2 ) gene . Secondary - Determine clinical tumor regression patient administer interleukin-2 gene-modified TIL cyclophosphamide fludarabine follow interleukin-2 . - Determine toxicity profile regimen patient . OUTLINE : - Phase I ( close accrual 3/29/06 ) : - Harvest : TIL harvest , transduce IL-2 gene , expand vitro period approximately 4 week . - Nonmyeloablative preparative regimen ( chemotherapy ) : Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour day -7 -6 fludarabine IV 30 minute day -5 -1 . - Lymphocyte administration : Patients receive IL-2 gene-transduced TIL IV 20-30 minute day 0 . They also receive high-dose IL-2 IV 15 minute every 8 hour day 0 -5 ( maximum 15 dos ) . Beginning 1-2 day lymphocyte administration , patient receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously ( SC ) daily , , blood count recover . - Retreatment : Patients re-evaluated every 4-6 week . Retreatment depend disease status regimen . Patients dose-limiting toxicity receive treatment . - No response : Patients stable disease disease progression initial treatment follow remove study . - Partial response : Patients partial minor response initial treatment may receive retreatment , approximately 2-4 week later , chemotherapy , IL-2 gene-transduced TIL , immunization , high-dose IL-2 , every 4-6 week 2 course provide least partial response document regimen . - Complete response : Patients complete response receive treatment . - Phase II : Patients receive treatment retreatment phase I MTD IL-2 gene-transduced TIL . Patients follow every 3-6 week absence disease progression . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 33 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
