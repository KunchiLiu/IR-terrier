	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Biological therapy gefitinib may interfere growth cancer cell slow growth tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy carboplatin paclitaxel use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining gefitinib carboplatin paclitaxel may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give gefitinib alone together carboplatin paclitaxel work treat old patient unresectable metastatic non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gefitinib With Without Carboplatin Paclitaxel Treating Older Patients With Unresectable Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine 6-month progression status old patient unresectable metastatic non-small cell lung cancer treat gefitinib alone carboplatin paclitaxel . Secondary - Determine response rate patient treat regimen . - Determine quality life patient treat regimen . - Determine whether serum-secreted soluble epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) concentration predict response patient treat regimen . - Correlate presence social support patient toxicity efficacy regimen . - Determine whether social support patient differs accord gender . - Determine reason oncologist would choose chemotherapy v nonchemotherapy regimen patient . Tertiary - Correlate EGFR signal pathway marker , RNA expression profile , gene polymorphism prespecified germline tumor gene , plasma urine proteomic pattern response rate time progression patient receive treatment group I . OUTLINE : This nonrandomized , multicenter study . Patients assign 1 2 treatment group determine treat physician . - Group I : Patients receive oral gefitinib day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Group II : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 1 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion chemotherapy absence disease progression , patient receive oral gefitinib group I . Quality life assess baseline completion course 2 . Patients follow every 3 month 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 107 patient ( 51 group I 56 group II ) accrue study within 1.7 year .</detailed_description>
