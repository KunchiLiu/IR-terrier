	<brief_summary>Von Hippel-Lindau disease ( VHL ) inherit cancer syndrome . Patients risk develop pancreatic cyst tumor . These tumor aggressive people others . To learn disease , genetic cause best treat , study 1 ) identify patient VHL pancreatic lesion ; 2 ) examine characteristic lesion fast grow ; 3 ) study well image test reveal lesion characteristic help diagnosis ; 4 ) perform genetic study use blood , possible , tissue sample . Patients 12 year age old VHL involve pancreas may eligible study . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Interviews cancer doctor , cancer nurse , surgeon ( surgery recommend ) . - Computed tomography ( CT ) scan abdomen , chest , pelvis . This test use x-ray produce image body tissue organ small section . - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) abdomen . This test use radio wave strong magnetic field produce image body tissue organ . - Ultrasound abdomen . This test use sound wave create image body tissue organ . - Blood test routine laboratory chemistry , test specific pancreas , genetic study - 24-hour urine study After test complete , doctor discus result patient . Patients pancreatic tumor require surgery offered option operation remove much tumor possible . Patients lesion appropriate surgery ask return NIH scan x-ray every year monitor growth lesion . If surgery become advisable future , option discuss time . Patients pancreatic cyst ask return NIH every 2 year scan x-rays monitor condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Patients familial cancer syndrome von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) demonstrate manifestation variety organ among pancreas . Pancreatic manifestation range benign cyst micro cystic adenoma neuroendocrine tumor pancreas capable regional distant spread . These neuroendocrine tumor result life-threatening complication . This protocol design identify VHL patient pancreatic manifestation follow patient serial image study germ line tissue genetic analysis . Objectives : To identify patient VHL pancreatic lesion define simple cyst , microcystic adenoma , neuroendocrine tumor solid lesion pancreas . To follow patient VHL pancreatic manifestation serial examination non-invasive imaging study . For patient solid lesion pancreas , determine rate growth correlate growth rate clinical measure disease progression . To validate non-invasive image method differentiate benign solid lesion lesion malignant potential . To characterize time initial presentation pancreatic tumor time surgery recommend . Eligibility : Patients great equal 12 year age diagnose VHL . Patients/parent must able sign inform consent willing return NIH follow-up . Design : Demographic data collect medical record patient interview patient participant . Data securely store computerized database . Patients evaluate Urologic Oncology Branch personnel indicate rule manage manifestation VHL . Imaging study region chest abdomen dictate best clinical practice workup management VHL manifestation previously publish . All patient enrol study offer genetic counseling train genetic counselor . After initial on-study evaluation , patient find solid lesion pancreas rather cystic disease pancreas , re-screened every two year non-invasive imaging study . Surgical resection solid lesion pancreas recommend base previously publish criterion . Based analysis likelihood tumor growth risk metastasis , data analyze every two year appropriate revision make surgical management guideline , indicate data analysis . Projected accrual 25 patient per year total 15 year . Thus , anticipate accrue 600 patient protocol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients diagnose VHL use follow criterion : either germ line analysis ( 12 ) clinical criterion family history ( 8 , 12 ) least 1 pancreatic manifestation VHL document noninvasive imaging study . These manifestation include : 1 . Pancreatic cyst ( ) . 2 . Solid lesion suspicious microcystic adenoma ( ) . 3 . Solid enhance lesion suspicious PNET ( ) . 4 . Any solid lesion ( ) pancreas . Age great equal 12 year age . Patients must willing return NIH followup . Patients/parent must able sign inform consent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients unwilling undergo serial noninvasive imaging .</criteria>
