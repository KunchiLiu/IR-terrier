	<brief_summary>The medicine offer study call Irinotecan . Irinotecan effective many animal cancer . It give adult child . We attempt determine much drug give child Irinotecan give weekly four week row every 6 week toxicity ( bad side effect ) occur irinotecan administer schedule . The purpose study : 1 . To determine high dose Irinotecan safely give child whose cancer long respond standard treatment . 2 . To determine toxicity Irinotecan . 3 . To determine study ( laboratory x-ray ) need do evaluate toxicity drug . 4 . To determine irinotecan beneficial patient . 5 . To understand drug Irinotecan work body .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Irinotecan give intravenously ( vein ) 90 minute four week row . This cycle may repeat six week long cancer get worse serious side effect . After one cycle patient evaluate decide treatment continue . If disease bad well additional course may give . If treatment continue , evaluation do second cycle every 2 cycle . If patient choose participate study would request remain study one full cycle . During first cycle treatment would like draw special blood sample help u learn much drug blood . These special study call pharmacokinetics . On first day drug give , fourteen blood sample draw . Each blood sample 1/2 teaspoon , total 3 tablespoon . These sample draw first cycle therapy . The total amount blood drawn le 5 % total blood volume , amount safe even small child . Examinations blood test do twice week initially , weekly look side effect drug . Patients additional one teaspoon blood drawn visit .</detailed_description>
