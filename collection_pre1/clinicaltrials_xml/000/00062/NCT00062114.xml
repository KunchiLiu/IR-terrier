	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine efficacy yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan rituximab , term overall response rate ( complete , unconfirmed complete , partial ) duration response , patient transform CD20+ B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . - Determine safety regimen patient . - Determine event-free survival time treatment progression patient treat regimen . - Determine immunogenicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive rituximab IV follow within 4 hour indium In 111 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV ( image ) 10 minute day 1 . Patients undergo 1 ( 2 need ) image scan day 2-5 . In absence alter biodistribution , patient receive rituximab IV follow within 4 hour yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV 10 minute day 8 . Patients follow monthly 3 month , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
