	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy paclitaxel carboplatin use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Celecoxib may increase effectiveness chemotherapy drug make tumor cell sensitive drug , may stop growth tumor cell stop blood flow tumor , and/or may block enzyme necessary tumor cell growth . Giving combination chemotherapy celecoxib surgery may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study well give paclitaxel together carboplatin follow surgery work compare give paclitaxel together carboplatin celecoxib follow surgery treating patient stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Carboplatin With Without Celecoxib Before Surgery Treating Patients With Stage IIIA Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare complete pathological response rate and/or minimal residual microscopic disease patient stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer treat preoperative paclitaxel carboplatin v without celecoxib . - Compare clinical response rate patient treat regimen . - Compare chemotherapy-related toxicity patient treat regimen . - Compare time progression , disease-free survival , overall survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord use aspirin prior cardiovascular disease ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour carboplatin IV 1 hour day 1 , 22 , 43 . Patients also receive oral celecoxib twice daily begin day 1 continue morning surgical resection . - Arm II : Patients receive paclitaxel carboplatin arm I oral placebo twice daily begin day 1 continue morning surgical resection . In arm , patient undergo surgical resection complete mediastinal lymph node dissection within 3-6 week completion chemotherapy . Patients resume oral celecoxib placebo twice daily within 28-42 day surgery continue 3 year date randomization absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3-6 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 110 patient ( 55 per treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
