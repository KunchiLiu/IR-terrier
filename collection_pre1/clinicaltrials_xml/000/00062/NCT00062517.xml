	<brief_summary>The purpose study increase researcher understanding biological basis generalize anxiety disorder social anxiety disorder . They investigate brain activity associate specific thought feeling may play role anxiety disorder . This knowledge use design intervention help illness . To qualify study , participant must evaluate via initial telephone screen interview material send mail . Participants require make three visit NIH . During first visit , ask question general mood , degree nervousness , think skill , behavior . They undergo thorough physical exam , include EKG , blood work , urinalysis , pregnancy test woman childbearing potential . During second visit , participant spend 2.5 hour various task sit look computer screen . These task guide experience specific kind thoughts emotion . Researchers attach electrodes participant hand monitor amount electricity conduct skin . The third visit similar second visit , participant perform task lie MRI scanner . Participants compensate $ 400 involvement study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There suggestion threshold amygdala activity lower individual anxiety disorder healthy individual . However , despite 's immediate plausibility , relatively tests hypothesis . Specifically , exploration performance patient anxiety disorder measure know implicate amygdala . Although high co-morbidity Generalized Anxiety Disorder ( GAD ) Social Anxiety Disorder ( SAD ) complicate issue , fact disorder doubly dissociate suggests due dysfunctional activity separable neurocognitive system . We would suggest hyper-responsive amygdala hypothesis likely link explanation GAD . In contrast , SAD may due reduce activation threshold unit system respond social threat recruit lateral orbital frontal cortex . Thus , current project determine performance patient GAD SAD measure amygdala know play role also measure recruit lateral orbital frontal cortex system social response reversal . In addition , two propose neuro-imaging study directly assess neural response two system patient population . The project provide clear data constrain future theorize pathology implicate two disorder .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Age : Participants male female , 1850 year age . IQ : IQ , measure 4 subscales Wechsler Adult Intelligence ScaleRevised ( WAISR ) , must &gt; 80 . Medication status : No regular use psychotropic medication within 2 week study ( fluoxetine within 8 week study ) . No regular use benzodiazepine . We intend identify patient whose GAD/SAD currently untreated . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Because factor psychiatric disease , CNS disease , influence functional brain activity , pregnancy precludes participation fMRI study , factor exclusionary . 1 . Psychiatric history : Participants assess use DSMIV criterion via standardized psychiatric interview conduct trained examiner ( i.e. , SCID ) . Any current suicidal ideation exclusionary . 1 . Healthy comparison individual ( Group 1 ) : All participant free current psychiatric disorder well lifetime history psychosis , pervasive developmental disorder , major affective disorder , panic disorder , obsessive compulsive disorder , conduct disorder , ADHD , anorexia . 2 . Patients GAD ( Group 2 ) : Any history axis I diagnosis exclude SAD include adjustment disorder , simple phobia dysthymia exclusionary . There must current mood disoder ( MD ) though patient past MD , occur onset GAD , admit study . We recognize difficulty recruiting patient GAD without comorbid SAD therefore allow patient comorbid study group . We face difficulty study child psychopathic tendency , although possible identify population meet criterion ADHD child meet criterion psychopathic tendency comorbid ADHD . We adopt similar strategy work child ; i.e. , contrast patient GAD comparison individual , use SAD symptomatology covariate reduce , evaluate , impact pathology associate SAD data . 3 . Patients SAD ( Group 3 ) : Any current history axis I diagnosis include GAD , exclude adjustment disorder , simple phobia dysthymia exclusionary . There must current mood disorder ( MD ) though patient past MD , occur onset SAD , admit study . 2 . History Drug Abuse : Axis I diagnose substance use disorder exclusionary . 3 . Severe acute chronic medical illness . 4 . CNS disease : History brain abnormality ( e.g. , neoplasms , subarachnoid cyst ) , cerebrovascular disease , infectious disease ( e.g. , abscess ) , neurological disease , history head trauma ( defined loss consciousness &gt; 3 min ) . 5 . Metal electronic object : Metal plate , certain type dental brace , cardiac pacemaker , etc. , sensitive electromagnetic field contraindicate MRI scan . 6 . Claustrophobia : Participants question potential discomfort enclose space , MRI scanner . 7 . Pregnancy status : Because potential effect hormonal change brain function well unknown effect electromagnetic field fetus , know pregnancy exclusion criterion .</criteria>
