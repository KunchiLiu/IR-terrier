	<brief_summary>The purpose trial examine safety immunogenicity therapeutic vaccine regimen recombinant DNA adenovirus express L523S protein patient early stage non-small cell lung cancer . The vaccine regimen consist two fixed dos recombinant DNA ( pVAX/L523S ) follow two dos recombinant adenovirus ( Ad/L523S ) . The trial evaluate dose escalation Ad/L523S three cohort patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective study evaluate safety vaccine regimen administer two dos pVAX/L523S two dos Ad/L523S . The secondary objective study : - To provide initial evidence whether CD8+ CD4+ T cell response specific L523S protein elicit two dos pVAX/L523S follow two dos Ad/L523S - To provide initial evidence whether antibody response specific L523S protein elicit two dos pVAX/L523S follow two dos Ad/L523S - To investigate extent dose escalation Ad/L523S affect elicit immune response</detailed_description>
