	<detailed_description>This multi-center , randomize , active treatment control phase II study patient either new onset therapy resistant rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . This study conduct 7 site NIAMS coordinate center 6 external center . Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F ( TwHF ) traditional medicinal plant use China many year treat inflammatory condition include RA . This study test standardize plant extract root TwHF superior Sulfasalazine improving sign symptom subject RA , assess ACR 20 criterion . Those subject , qualify study , allow continue stable dos NSAID therapy and/or low dose corticosteroid discontinue DMARDs , biologicals prior start study . Study subject randomize receive either TwHF Sulfasalazine subject remain double blind medication 24 week . Patients assessed baseline , 2 week every 4 week thereafter use standardize joint exam , questionnaires laboratory measure inflammation . ACR 20 response calculate visit compare group end evaluation 24 week . Safety monitor throughout trial . This first study compare extract TwHF currently use DMARD treat patient RA help define role new anti-inflammatory possibly disease modify agent treat patient RA .</detailed_description>
