	<brief_summary>This research study design determine safety dosage special cell may make patient immune system fight cancer . To put two special gene cancer cell take patient body . The gene put make cancer cell produce lymphotactin , natural substance attracts immune system cell cancer , IL-2 natural substance may help immune system kill cancer cell . Some cell put back patient 's body . Studies cancer animal cancer cell grown laboratory suggest substance like lymphotactin IL-2 help body kill cancer cell . A treatment similar use ten child previously similar treatment use adult cancer . The purpose study learn side effect safe 'dosage ' special cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Gene Modified Neuroblastoma Cells Treatment Relapsed/Refractory Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuroblastoma cell take patient separate laboratory two specially produce human virus ( adenovirus ) carry lymphotactin IL-2 gene put cell . These lymphotactin IL-2 gene mean help immune system fight cancer . The modified cancer cell inject patient 's skin . There four shot . The second subsequent shot ten time many cell produce lymphotactin first . We know best amount special cell use , different patient get different number cell . Before second shot , 2 week later , remove modify cell patient 's body study . We remove section skin ( refer skin biopsy ) place cell inject . This test help u see whether modified cell kill cancer cell . To study immunity work patient 's system , take blood sample prior injection , two four day injection , may repeat 5-7 day injection doctor think necessary . After patient receive first set 4 injection complete evaluation perform see research treatment work . If evaluation look okay injection available , patient option receive second set 4 injection . If patient receive second set 4 injection , blood sample take injection . After injection stop , patient blood sample collect month year , year fifteen year . To see research treatment work , CAT scan , MRIs , bone scan ( different type x-ray ) . We also take bone marrow biopsy ( bone marrow remove use needle look microscope ) . These test do prior treatment eight week later . In addition , patient receive second set four injection , test repeat six month .</detailed_description>
