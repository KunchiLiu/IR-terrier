	<brief_summary>Patients renal failure need chronic dialysis kidney transplant survive . Most kidney transplant patient must take medicine indefinitely prevent immune system reject kidney . Long-term exposure anti-rejection medicine damage transplant kidney . The purpose study determine whether give patient cell donor 's bone marrow reduce eliminate need long-term use anti-rejection drug . In addition donor 's bone marrow cell , patient receive drug thymoglobulin sirolimus . A total 20 patient participate five-year study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Use Thymoglobulin , Sirolimus , Donor Bone Marrow With Kidney Transplantation Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol evaluate combination Thymoglobulin ( Sangstat ) , sirolimus donor bone marrow infusion ability induce state donor specific hematopoietic chimerism immune hyporesponsiveness within context renal transplantation . Thymoglobulin ( Sangstat ) , FDA-approved polyclonal rabbit-IgG antithymocyte preparation , give ten day time transplantation effect lymphocyte depletion . This combined sirolimus ( rapamycin , Wyeth-Ayerst ) , oral immunosuppressant agent recently approve FDA . Sirolimus allow antigen specific T cell activation prevent T cell clonal expansion interrupt IL-2 receptor beta-chain signal transduction . Donor bone marrow administer seven day follow transplant . Patients demonstrate six month rejection free graft survival sirolimus withdraw three month begin sixth month anniversary transplant . Twenty people evaluate pilot protocol . Approximately ten receive live donor kidney allograft remain patient receive cadaveric kidney allograft . Patients treat Thymoglobulin begin prior graft implantation continue approximately ten day . Glucocorticosteroids give first Thymoglobulin treatment limit monocyte activation prevent cytokine release syndrome associate initial administration antibody preparation . Patients give sirolimus orally begin day transplantation continuously thereafter . Donor bone marrow administer seven day follow transplantation . Patients monitor evidence allograft rejection use standard functional parameter protocol allograft biopsy . In addition , patient follow specific desired effect , include transient state donor hematopoietic mixed microchimerism allospecific AICD . Both expect promote development allospecific graft tolerance . This accomplish assay peripheral blood allograft biopsy apoptosis peripheral blood evidence alloreactive T cell clone depletion donor chimerism .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Candidates kidney transplant . Age 12 60 time transplant first 10 patient transplant . Age 12 75 subsequent patient . Patients young age 12 good serve transplanted center extensive pediatric medical nephrology support . Patients le 12 year age also high risk post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder follow transplant adult intensive induction immunosuppression increase risk . The use aggressive induction imunosuppression population would inappropriate . Patients age 75 generally require less immunosuppression young patient . The use aggressive induction immunosuppression population would inappropriate . Willingness give inform consent . Availability donor tissue test . This could include splenic peripheral blood lymphocyte cadaveric donor willing living donor enrol Clinical Center Living Donor Protocol consent periodic phlebotomy peripheral blood lymphocyte isolation . Availability adequate donor bone marrow infusion . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Immunosuppressive drug therapy time 2 month prior enrollment . Specifically , candidate may take prednisone , cyclosporine , tacrolimus , azathioprine , mycophenolate mofetil , antilymphocyte agent , cyclophosphamide , methotrexate , agent whose therapeutic effect immunosuppressive . Treatment nucleoside analogue chemotherapeutic agent ( i.e . fludarabine phosphate , cladribine , pentostatin ) within 12 month kidney transplant . Absolute lymphocyte count le 1000/mm ( 3 ) prior first dose Thymogobulin . Any active malignancy history hematologic malignancy lymphoma . Patients primary , cutaneous basal cell squamous cell cancer may enrol provide lesion appropriately treat prior transplant . Donor/recipient combination 0 HLA mismatch donor homozygous share HLA haplotype . Serologic HLA type conduct Walter Reed Army Medical Center Tissue Typing Laboratory . Sensitization define historical current PRA le 20 percent patient receive first kidney allograft . First kidney graft survival le 3 year consequence acute/chronic rejection positive T B cell crossmatch patient receive second kidney allograft . Historical current positive T cell cross match donor recipient . Significant coagulopathy requirement anticoagulation therapy would contraindicate protocol allograft biopsy . Platelet count le 75,000/mm ( 3 ) time transplant . Any known immunodeficiency syndrome HIV , Chronic Granulomatous Disease , Severe Combined Immunodeficiency , DiGeorge Syndrome , etc . Presence uncorrected cardiac insufficiency ( either valvular vascular ) major vascular disease . Subjects unwilling/unable practice birth control potentially fertile . Presence active chronic infection . Any condition would likely increase risk protocol participation confound data interpretation inability unwillingness comply protocol monitoring therapy , include , among others , history noncompliance , circumstance compliance protocol requirement feasible due living condition , travel restriction , access urgent medical service , access antirejection drug research protocol complete . Any history allergy anaphalaxis rabbit protein .</criteria>
