	<brief_summary>Thalidomide may stop growth cancer stop blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy irinotecan use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining thalidomide irinotecan may kill tumor cell . This randomized phase I trial study side effect best way give irinotecan thalidomide treat patient metastatic unresectable solid tumor</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan Thalidomide Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine whether thalidomide alters pharmacokinetics irinotecan patient advance solid tumor . II . Determine whether irinotecan alters pharmacokinetics thalidomide patient . III . Determine toxicity regimen patient . IV . Determine observe antitumor response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive irinotecan IV 90 minute day 1 22 oral thalidomide daily day 15-28 . Arm II : Patients receive irinotecan arm I oral thalidomide daily day -6 7 . All patient undergo disease re-evaluation 6 week . Patients stable responsive disease may receive additional course comprise irinotecan IV day 1 oral thalidomide daily day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 35 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
