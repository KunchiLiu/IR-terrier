	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy irinotecan cisplatin use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Irinotecan cisplatin may also make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy . Combining chemotherapy radiation therapy surgery may shrink tumor remove surgery . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect neoadjuvant radiation therapy give together irinotecan cisplatin follow surgery treating patient limited-stage small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy Followed By Surgery Treating Patients With Limited-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety feasibility neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy irinotecan cisplatin follow surgery patient limited stage small cell lung cancer . - Determine pathologic complete response rate patient treat regimen . - Correlate level vascular endothelial growth factor treatment response disease outcome patient treat regimen . - Correlate genetic polymorphism cytochrome P450 1A1 , glutathione S-transferase M1 P1 , myeloperoxidase , NAD ( p ) H : quinone oxidoreductase treatment response disease outcome patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This pilot study . - Induction chemotherapy : Patients receive cisplatin IV 1 hour day 1 irinotecan IV 90 minute day 1 8 . - Chemoradiotherapy : Beginning day 21 , patient receive chemoradiotherapy comprise radiotherapy daily , 5 day week 4 week twice daily 4 day . Patients also receive cisplatin IV irinotecan IV 30-60 minute weekly concurrently radiotherapy . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . At completion chemoradiotherapy , patient evaluate surgery . Patients candidate surgery receive one additional course cisplatin IV irinotecan IV . Patients candidate surgery receive radiotherapy twice daily 4 day cisplatin IV irinotecan IV chemoradiotherapy . - Surgery : Approximately 2-4 week last dose chemotherapy , patient undergo surgery . Patients follow every 4 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
