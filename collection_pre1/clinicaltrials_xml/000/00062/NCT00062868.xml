	<brief_summary>Patients type lymph gland disease ( HD NHL , Lymphoepithelioma , severe chronic active EBV ( SCAEBV ) , leiomyosarcoma ) come back may come back go away treatment , include best treatment know disease . This research study use special immune system cell call LMP- specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes , new experimental therapy . Some patient Lymphoma SCAEBV leiomyosarcoma show evidence infection virus cause infectious mononucleosis Epstein Barr virus ( EBV ) time diagnosis . EBV find cancer cell half patient Hodgkin 's NHL , suggest may play role cause Lymphoma . The cancer cell ( lymphoma ) B cell ( SCAEBV ) infect EBV able hide body 's immune system escape destruction . Investigators want see special white blood cell , call T cell , train kill EBV infected cell survive blood affect tumor . The Investigators use sort therapy treat different type cancer occur bone marrow solid organ transplant call post transplant lymphoma . In type cancer tumor cell 9 protein make EBV surface . The investigator grow T cell lab recognize 9 protein able successfully prevent treat post transplant lymphoma . However , HD NHL SCAEBV , tumor cell B cell express 2 EBV protein . In previous study , T cell make recognize 9 protein give patient HD . Some patient partial response therapy patient complete response . The investigator think one reason may many T cell react protein tumor cell . In study , try find improve treatment grow T cell recognize protein express EBV infect Lymphoma cell B cell call LMP-1 LMP2 . These special T cell call LMP-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes ( CTLs ) . These LMP-specific cytotoxic T cell investigational product approve FDA . The purpose study find large safe dose LMP-specific cytotoxic T cell , learn side effect see whether therapy might help patient HD , NHL , Lymphoepithelioma , SCAEBV leiomyosarcoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigators first test biopsy tumor lymph node already do see tumor tissue cell EBV positive . If patient eligible , investigator take 60 mL ( 12 teaspoon ) blood patient donor one two occasion . They use blood grow T cell . First grow special type cell call dendritic cell monocytes stimulate T cell . Next put specially produce human virus carry LMP gene dendritic cell monocyte . They use stimulate T cell . This stimulation train T cell kill cell LMP surface . Investigators grow LMP specific CTLs stimulation EBV infect cell . These EBV infect cell treat radiation grow . Once sufficient number T cell make , investigator test make sure kill cell LMP surface . If count low may need obtain additional blood sample make cell . Prior give patient CTLs , cell test make sure n't attack tissue . The cell thaw injected patient 10 minute . Initially , two dos T cell give two week apart . If second infusion reduction size lymphoma CT MRI scan assess radiologist , patient receive six additional dos T cell patient wish . This dose escalation study mean patient second dose may large first . All treatment give Center Cell Gene Therapy Texas Children 's Hospital Methodist Hospital . The patient follow injection . They either see clinic contact research nurse yearly 5 year . To learn way T cell work patient 's body , extra 20-40 mL ( 4-8 teaspoon ) blood take infusion , 4 hour infusion ( optional ) 3-4 day infusion ( optional ) weekly 2 week infusion ( total 9 time ) . Two week last infusion , blood take every 3 month 1 year , year 5 year . Investigators use blood see long T cell last look immune response patient 's cancer .</detailed_description>

Any patient , regardless age sex , EBVpositive Hodgkin 's nonHodgkin 's Lymphoma , lymphoepithelioma leiomyosarcoma regardless histological subtype EBV ( associate ) T/NKlymphoproliferative disease Severe Chronic EBV # ( # SCAEBV define patient high EBV viral load plasma PBMC ( &gt; 4000 genome per ug PBMC DNA ) and/or biopsy tissue positive EBV ) In second subsequent relapse ( first relapse active disease immunosuppressive chemotherapy contraindicate multiply relapsed patient currently remission high risk relapse ) OR primary disease first subsequent remission immunosuppressive chemotherapy contraindicate , e.g . patient develop Hodgkin disease solid organ transplantation Lymphoma second malignancy e.g . Richters transformation CLL . ( Group A ) OR b In remission minimal residual disease status autologous syngeneic SCT Hodgkin 's nonHodgkin 's Lymphoma/Lymphoepithelioma/SCAEBV . ( Group B ) OR c Patients remission detectable disease allogeneic SCT . ( Group C ) 2 . Patients life expectancy 6 week great . 3 . Tumor tissue EBV positive 4 . Patients Karnofsky/Lansky score 50 great 5 . Donor HIV negative ( autologous product patient must HIV negative ) 6 . If post allogeneic SCT must less 50 % donor chimerism either peripheral blood bone marrow 7 . Patients bilirubin 3x normal less , AST 5x normal less , Hgb great 8.0 8 . Patients creatinine 2x normal less age 9 . Patients investigational therapy one month prior entry study . 10 . Patient , parent/guardian able give inform consent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patients severe intercurrent infection . 2 . Donors HIV positive Patients HIV positive autologous product use 3 . Patients great Grade II GVHD 4 . Due unknown effect therapy fetus , pregnant woman exclude research . The male partner use condom .</criteria>
