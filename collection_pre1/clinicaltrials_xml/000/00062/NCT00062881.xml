	<brief_summary>This research study investigational treatment experimental drug Mafosfamide . This treatment child cancer spread meninges ( tissue cover spinal column brain ) continue grow despite treatment standard therapy . Mafosfamide drug report antitumor effect animal give safely cerebrospinal fluid ( fluid within surround brain ) small number child adult . Since limited experience adult child give mafosfamide way , main purpose study determine appropriate safe dose mafosfamide give intrathecally , directly cerebrospinal fluid . The purpose study ( ) determine dose mafosfamide safely give cerebrospinal fluid Ommaya reservoir ( surgically implant catheter use sample cerebrospinal fluid instill medication cerebrospinal fluid ) lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) lumbar reservoir ; ( b ) look side effect drug treatment ; ( c ) study pharmacology ( human body handle drug ) give directly spinal fluid ; ( ) see drug beneficial patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mafosfamide give directly cerebrospinal fluid twice week six successive week . If six week disease show evidence progression ( tumor growth ) patient continue receive intrathecal ( I.T . ) mafosfamide week one month , follow twice monthly ( every week ) four month , follow month . Patients may continue receive mafosfamide long unacceptable side effect occur growth tumor . Patients weekly physical exam blood test . The cerebrospinal fluid test time receive drug presence cancer cell . If patient Ommaya reservoir ( surgically implant catheter use sample cerebrospinal fluid fluid chamber head install medication cerebrospinal fluid ) doctor may recommend receive one dose mafosfamide Ommaya reservoir next dose via lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) lumbar reservoir . A lumbar reservoir catheter surgically implant low back . This catheter use sample cerebrospinal fluid install medication cerebrospinal fluid . All patient must observe minimum eight hour first dose intrathecal mafosfamide . If first dose well tolerate ( major side effect ) , dose mafosfamide administer close observation least two hour administration first six week drug administration . Administration mafosfamide sample cerebrospinal fluid Ommaya reservoir , lumbar reservoir , spinal tap take 30 minute . In addition , mafosfamide give lumbar puncture , patient must remain lying stomach one hour . In patient Ommaya reservoirs lumbar catheter , sample spinal fluid take reservoir follow first two dos mafosfamide . For series test , total eight spinal fluid sample take needle Ommaya reservoir period 24 hour dose . A spinal tap also perform two hour dose two day . If lumbar reservoir , eight spinal fluid sample take needle Ommaya reservoir , period 24 hour dose . These sample cerebrospinal fluid use measure amount mafosfamide find cerebrospinal fluid time drawn . This help u understand body handle mafosfamide . For patient leukemia , bone marrow aspiration ( take bone marrow pelvis bone ) necessary receive intrathecal mafosfamide . This make sure cancer bone marrow .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Over 3 year age meningeal malignancy progressive refractory conventional therapy . Patients meningeal malignancy secondary underlie solid tumor eligible initial diagnosis conventional therapy . Patients leukemia , lymphoma , solid tumor also overt meningeal involvement tumor . Must life expectancy least 8 week ECOG performance status 2 better . Must sign inform consent indicate aware investigational nature study . Patients must recover acute toxic effect prior intrathecal chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy , prior enter study must without significant systemic illness ( e.g . infection ) . Patients must receive CNS therapy within 1 week prior start treatment study craniospinal irradiation within 8 week prior start treatment study . Patients must receive intrathecal chemotherapy within 1 week ( 2 week prior DTC101 ) . Must clinically significant abnormality regard liver function , renal function metabolic parameter ( electrolyte , calcium phosphorus ) . Durable Power Attorney ( DPA ) : A DPA must offer patient â‰¥ 18 year age . Receiving therapy ( either intrathecal systemic ) design specifically treat meningeal malignancy eligible study . However , patient receive concomitant chemotherapy control systemic bulk CNS disease eligible , provide systemic chemotherapy phase I agent , agent significantly penetrate CNS ( e.g. , high dose methotrexate , ( &gt; 1 gm/m2 ) , thiotepa , high dose cytarabine , ( &gt; 2 gm/m2 per day ) , 5fluorouracil , intravenous 6mercaptopurine topotecan ) , agent know serious unpredictable CNS side effect . Clinical evidence obstructive hydrocephalus compartmentalization CSF flow document radioisotope Indium111 Technitium99DTPA flow study eligible protocol . If CSF flow block compartmentalization demonstrate , focal radiotherapy site block restore flow repeat CSF flow study show clear blockage require patient eligible study . Patients leukemia lymphoma concomitant bone marrow relapse . Women childbearing age must pregnant lactating . Patients must receive systemic investigational agent within 14 day prior , , study treatment . The 14 day period extend patient receive investigational agent know delayed toxicity 14 day . Patients must receive intrathecal investigational within 7 day prior , , study treatment . The 7 day period extend patient receive investigational agent know delayed toxicity 7 day prolong halflife .</criteria>
