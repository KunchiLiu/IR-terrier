	<brief_title>Romidepsin Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine complete partial response rate patient relapse refractory acute myeloid leukemia treat FR901228 ( depsipeptide ) . II . Determine toxicity drug patient . III . Correlate clinical response specific cytogenetic abnormality patient treated drug . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord presence specific chromosomal abnormality ( [ 8 ; 21 ] v inv 16 v [ 15 ; 17 ] v absence chromosomal abnormality ) . Patients receive romidepsin IV 4 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
