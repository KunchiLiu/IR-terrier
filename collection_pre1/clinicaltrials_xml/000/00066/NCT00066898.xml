	<brief_title>ARISE – Aggressive Reduction Inflammation Stops Events</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study Phase III multi-center , double-blind , parallel group , placebo-controlled trial involve approximately 260 study site United States , Canada , South Africa United Kingdom . It expect approximately 6,600 subject screen order randomize approximately 6,000 subject globally ( 3,000 arm study ) . Male female subject coronary artery disease eligible participate meet required inclusion exclusion criterion . Recruitment delay one month subject PCI . Subjects PCI plan time screen randomization , randomize one month plan PCI conduct . All subject successfully complete screen phase meet required inclusion exclusion criterion enter single-blind , placebo Run-In phase study establish compliance . The placebo Run-In medication identical blind study drug use randomize portion study . After completion two-week Run-In , compliance adequate , study subject randomize receive AGI-1067 300 mg ( two 150 mg tablet daily meal ) placebo ( approximately equal number subject per treatment group ) minimum 12 month . It anticipate subject accrual occur period approximately 24 month subject follow least 990 subject experience primary event . Subjects remain drug therapy randomization end study . It estimate first subject recruit expose blinded therapy 30 36 month , last subject expose minimum 6 12 month . For purpose study one month equal 28 day . The subject ask return clinic 1 month , 3 month , every 3 month thereafter treatment phase . All clinical laboratory procedure electrocardiographic interpretation perform central laboratory . Over study period , subject follow occurrence major adverse cardiovascular event . These potential endpoint adjudicate independent endpoint committee . This committee consist cardiologist physician reviewer blind treatment . For purpose safety , trial monitor independent Data Safety Monitoring Board . This Board consist Cardiologists , least one Statistician experience conduct clinical trial . The Board meet approximately every 6 month review subject safety data .</detailed_description>
