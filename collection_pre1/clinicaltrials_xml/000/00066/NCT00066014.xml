	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare effectiveness three variable dental implant attachment methodology conjunction low dental-implant retained/supported complete overdenture treatment . These three method presently use dental practitioner , vary significantly term add treatment cost complexity . The study test hypothesis least complex costly method provide equivalent treatment outcome complex costly method .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Investigation Mandibular Implant Overdenture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project utilize 30 subject prospective , randomly assign clinical study use four-period , six sequence , three treatment crossover design test hypothesis define outcome variable implant overdenture treatment equivalent . The project test three overdenture treatment modality , ( 1 ) four-implant , bar/clip-attached treatment , ( 2 ) two-implant , bar/clip-attached treatment , ( 3 ) two-implant independently attach ( O-ring ) treatment . Each subject four dental implant place anterior mandible new denture fabricate . After successful implant integration , subject randomly assign one six sequence treatment . Each treatment follow data collection least twelve month mandibular denture modify incorporate next treatment sequence . Equivalence measure term prosthesis retention , stability , support peri-implant tissue response , patient satisfaction/preference treatment complications/failures . Information study assist dental practitioner treatment plan select appropriate cost effective treatment choice . There inverse relationship edentulism U.S. population socioeconomic status . If less costly simplify treatment method show provide equivalent treatment outcome costly/complex method , simplify treatment use treat large percentage edentulous population .</detailed_description>
