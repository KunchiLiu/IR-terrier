	<brief_title>Bortezomib Treating Patients With Advanced Metastatic Transitional Cell Cancer Bladder , Renal Pelvis , Ureter</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine response rate duration response patient advance metastatic transitional cell cancer bladder , renal pelvis , ureter treat bortezomib . - Determine 1-year , median , overall survival rate patient treat drug . - Determine stable disease rate duration time progression patient treat drug . - Determine toxicity drug patient . - Correlate baseline post-treatment level NF-kappaB HIF-1 alpha tumor biopsy clinical outcome patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This nonrandomized , open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive bortezomib IV 3-5 second day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients complete remission ( CR ) may receive 2 course confirmation CR . Patients follow within 3 week every 3 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-35 patient accrue study within approximately 6.6-17.5 month .</detailed_description>
