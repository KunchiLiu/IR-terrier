	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Estrogen stimulate growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use anastrozole may fight breast cancer reduce production estrogen . Gefitinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary growth . Combining anastrozole gefitinib may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Randomized phase II trial compare effectiveness anastrozole without gefitinib treat postmenopausal woman metastatic locally recurrent breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anastrozole With Without Gefitinib Treating Postmenopausal Women With Metastatic Locally Recurrent Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare 1 year antitumor activity anastrozole v without gefitinib , term progression-free survival , postmenopausal woman metastatic locally recurrent advance breast cancer . - Compare objective tumor response duration tumor response patient treat regimen . - Compare progression-free survival patient treat regimen . - Compare safety regimens patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord participate center , dominant site metastatic disease ( bone alone v ) , prior chemotherapy ( vs yes ) , stage ( metastatic v locally recurrent ) , measurability ( measurable v evaluable ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral anastrozole oral gefitinib daily . - Arm II : Patients receive oral anastrozole oral placebo daily . In arm , treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 8 week disease progression . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 108 patient ( 54 per treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
