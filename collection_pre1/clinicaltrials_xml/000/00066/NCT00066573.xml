	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Estrogen stimulate growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy , use exemestane anastrozole , may fight breast cancer reduce production estrogen . It yet know whether exemestane effective anastrozole prevent recurrence breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study exemestane see well work compare anastrozole prevent cancer recurrence postmenopausal woman undergone surgery primary breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exemestane Anastrozole Treating Postmenopausal Women Who Have Undergone Surgery Primary Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare event-free survival postmenopausal woman receptor-positive primary breast cancer treat exemestane vs anastrozole . Secondary - Compare overall survival patient treat regimen . - Compare time distant recurrence patient treat regimen . - Compare incidence new primary contralateral breast cancer patient treat regimen . - Compare incidence clinical fracture , specifically hip vertebral fracture , patient treat regimen . - Compare cardiovascular morbidity mortality ( i.e. , significant coronary heart disease , include myocardial infarction angina require percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty coronary artery bypass graft , fatal nonfatal stroke , vascular death ) patient treat regimen . - Correlate therapy induce change breast density plasma hormone growth factor , drug level exemestane anastrozole , genetic variation breast cancer recurrence contralateral event patient treat regimen . - Compare toxic effect regimens patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord lymph node status diagnosis ( negative v positive v unknown ) , prior adjuvant chemotherapy ( yes v ) , herceptin use ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral exemestane ( 25 mg ) daily 5 year . - Arm II : Patients receive oral anastrozole ( 1 mg ) daily 5 year . In arm , treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 6 month first year study participation annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 6,840 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
