	<brief_summary>Phosphorus phosphate iron play critical role bone structure essential cellular function . The purpose study learn factor hormone regulate phosphorus body collect blood urine sample patient disorder phosphate control . Both child adult enrol study . Researchers collect blood urine sample participant multiple occasion ( 2 6 time ) . Some blood specimen take overnight fast participant may ask collect urine 24-hour period . Researchers analyze blood urine sample well understand body handle phosphorus .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Phosphorus phosphate ion play important role cellular metabolism well bone structure . Scientific evidence suggest , addition Vitamin D PTH system , novel factor , Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 ( FGF-23 ) Matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein ( MEPE ) , may play important role phosphorus regulation . These factor best study rare genetic acquire phosphate waste disorder tumor induce osteomalacia ( TIO ) , X link hypophosphatemia ( XLH ) autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets ( ADHR ) . Patients abnormal phosphate regulating state hyperparathyroidism hypoparathyroidism , pseudohypoparathyroidism etc . undergoing phosphorus-altering intervention may provide important insight role hormone . We propose observational study collection blood urine sample study establish ( e.g . mineral ion , bone marker , PTH-Vit D system , TMP-GFR ) novel ( e.g . FGF-23 MEPE ) constituent phosphorus metabolism pathway . Patients abnormal phosphorus regulate state enrol study natural history disease effect specific intervention likely change phosphorus balance . The outcome potentially aid understanding new field mineral regulate hormone generate interest research phosphorus metabolism . It hop also encourage clinical trial treatment phosphate wasting disorder .</detailed_description>
