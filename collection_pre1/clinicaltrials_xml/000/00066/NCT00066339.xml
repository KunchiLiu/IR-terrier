	<brief_title>Gefitinib Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer That Has Progressed After Antiestrogen Nonsteroidal Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine clinical benefit rate , define complete response , partial response , stable disease least 24 week , patient receive gefitinib metastatic breast cancer progress prior antiestrogen nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor therapy . - Determine best overall response rate patient treat drug . - Determine progression-free survival patient treated drug . - Determine duration response patient treated drug . - Determine safety drug patient . OUTLINE : This nonrandomized , open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive oral gefitinib daily . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients go study absence disease progression follow every 8 week disease progression . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 44 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
