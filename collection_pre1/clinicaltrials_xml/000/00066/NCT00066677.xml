	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill deliver cancer-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining bevacizumab docetaxel may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study bevacizumab docetaxel see well work compare bevacizumab alone treat patient metastatic pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab With Without Docetaxel Treating Patients With Previously Treated Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine progression-free survival patient previously treat metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma treat bevacizumab without docetaxel . - Determine objective response rate overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine incidence thromboembolic event patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . - Arm II : Patients receive bevacizumab arm I . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 46 patient ( 23 per treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
