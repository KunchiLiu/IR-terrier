	<detailed_description>Dental decay prevalent affliction child worldwide . In recent year occurrence dental decay decline dramatically many industrialized country subsequent widespread availability fluoride water supply dentifrice . However , newly industrialize country Brazil , occurrence decay still high , especially among low income group . The mutans streptococci ( MS ) convincingly associate human dental decay clinical protocol , seek reduce level MS invariably , thus result significant reduction decay . One important observation study possibility decay establishment MS reduce and/or prevent young child treat mother highly infected MS prior eruption primary teeth . Other study indicate MS colonize primary teeth first year eruption , likely remain caries free follow year . These finding indicate delay colonization MS primary dentition may prevent dental decay . The ideal population study find community without water fluoridation , high level unmet dental care , would frequent access sugar . Populations many newly industrialized country would meet qualification . However , difficult perform interceptive study , prevent transmission MS mother infant country , local dental community neither financial physical resource train dental personnel . We find exception city Bauru , Sao Paulo , Brazil . This community 250,000 resident situate sugar cane grow region Brazil boast lead dental school South Central America . In investigation describe , collaborate Bauru investigator longitudinal randomized clinical trial follow specific aim : 1 ) determine whether salivary level MS reduce mother young infant intervention program consist restoration , topical fluoride , use xylitol chew gum , chlorhexidine varnish oral hygiene instruction ; 2 ) determine whether intervention reduces delay acquisition MS infants whether turn reduces subsequent caries incidence child</detailed_description>
