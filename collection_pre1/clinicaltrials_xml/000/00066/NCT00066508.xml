	<brief_title>Bortezomib Treating Patients With Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma That Is Refractory To Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine overall response rate patient chemotherapy-refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treat bortezomib . - Determine safety tolerability drug patient . - Determine time disease progression patient treat drug . - Determine possible mechanism resistance drug patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive bortezomib IV 3-5 second day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow 20 day every 3 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 22-40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
