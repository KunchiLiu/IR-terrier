	<brief_summary>Some voice disorder cause uncontrolled muscle action affect larynx voice box . The purpose study understand 1 ) brain controls voice production ; 2 ) change sensation within voice box affect brain control voice box ; 3 ) central nervous system affect people motor sensory abnormality affect voice box ; 4 ) whether patient voice disorder differ people without voice disorder way brain control voice box . By good understanding concept , researcher hope develop improved treatment patient voice disorder . Forty-five healthy adult volunteer 90 patient voice disorder participate study . Participants must age 20 70 . The study involve two visit Clinical Center . During first visit , participant undergo medical history physical exam . During second visit , investigator perform follow procedure study participant : 1 ) look voice box nasolaryngoscope , fine tube nose ; 2 ) use MRI [ magnetic resonance image ] record brain activity participant use voice speak ; 3 ) change sensation voice box drip topical anesthetic onto vocal fold ; 4 ) use MRI record brain activity speech immediately apply topical anesthetic . Participants receive $ 700 compensation involvement study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The neural organization laryngeal motor somatosensory function investigate adult idiopathic voice disorder use functional magnetic resonance imaging . Brain activation compare normal volunteer patient spasmodic dysphonia ( SD ) , muscle tension dysphonia ( MTD ) vocal tremor . While voice disorder characterize strained vocalization , disorder distinguish difference voice symptom . Accordingly , brain correlate vocalization disorder may differ normal vocal function . Because sensory feedback identify factor SD , role afferent input vocalization investigate compare brain activation topical anesthesia laryngeal mucosa . The afferent blockade expect significantly suppress dysphonic symptom SD patient duration block . The change symptomatology may associate temporary significant change central sensorimotor pattern patient . The block expect alter MTD , vocal tremor normal vocal function . The brain activation change accompany symptom relief SD patient determine alteration central neural control role symptom generation SD . Identifying difference central sensorimotor control disorder provide insight difference pathophysiology . Objectives : 1 . To determine emotional vocalization linguistic vocalization involve different cortical sub-cortical functional network normal adult . 2 . To determine brain activation network active linguistic vocalization network differs normal control dysphonia patient equivalent voice production effort . 3 . To determine patient dysphonia differ control performance non-vocal laryngeal gesture patient asymptomatic . 4 . To determine reduction sensation topical anesthesia alters linguistic vocalization dysphonia control .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : The inclusion criterion normal volunteer normal vocal function average health determine staff otolaryngologist . Normal vocal function refers normal voice quality , negative history voice laryngeal disorder . Persons significant pulmonary , neurological psychiatric function recruit . The primary inclusion criterion voice disorder group current diagnosis spasmodic dysphonia ( abductor adductor type ) , muscular tension dysphonia voice tremor . These person pulmonary , neurological psychiatric disorder exclusion criterion . INCLUSION CRITERIA Patients Spasmodic Dysphonia : Intermittent strain hoarseness , uncontrolled voice break change pitch present vowel , liquid ( r &amp; l ) semivowel ( w &amp; ) , speech adductor SD prolong voiceless consonant produce breathy break abductor SD ; Less prominent symptom whisper , sing falsetto , Normal voice vocal fold movement protective emotional laryngeal function , cough , laugh cry ; A diagnosis adductor adductor spasmodic dysphonia base voice test fiberoptic nasolaryngoscopy board certify otolaryngologist SpeechLanguage Pathologist initial interview ; Exclusion laryngeal pathology base fiberoptic nasolaryngoscopic examination conduct initial interview staff otolaryngologist . INCLUSION CRITERIA Patients Muscular Tension Dysphonia : Increased phonatory muscle tension paralaryngeal suprahyoid muscle palpation ; A consistent hypertonic laryngeal posture phonation , either anteriorposterior squeeze ( pinhole posture ) ventricular hyper adduction absence SD vocal tremor determine SpeechLanguage Pathologist staff otolaryngologist ; Exclusion laryngeal pathology base fiberoptic nasolaryngoscopic examination conduct initial interview staff otolaryngologist . INCLUSION CRITERIA Patients Vocal Tremor : Vocal tremor vocalization primarily involve laryngeal structure ; Exclusion laryngeal pathology base fiberoptic nasolaryngoscopic examination conduct initial interview staff otolaryngologist . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Any individual history one follow contraindication exclude study : Airway obstruction , smoke tobacco use ; Pulmonary , neurological disease ; Pregnancy report volunteer positive pregnancy result urine sample obtain day test ; Psychiatric disorder , psychiatric care , medication psychiatric disorder . Examples psychiatric disorder exclude : somatoform disorder , conversion disorder , major depression , schizophrenia bipolar disorder . A history previous episode minor reactive depression would exclude person participation ; Speech hearing problem determine medical history examination otolaryngologist . A 30 dB HL hearing screen 500 3000 Hz conduct subject report difficulty follow spoken instruction significant noise exposure ; A reduction range vocal fold movement nonspeech task whistle suggest either paralysis paresis , joint abnormality neoplasm determine videolaryngoscopic examination staff otolaryngologist ; Complete aphonia , history airway obstruction structural abnormality affect larynx vocal fold nodule , polyp , carcinoma , cyst , contact ulcer , chronic laryngitis determine videolaryngoscopic examination staff otolaryngologist ; Individuals condition would present unnecessary risk , e.g. , claustrophobia . Specific contraindication magnetic resonance image include : ) Any implant surgical clip implant neural stimulator , implanted cardiac pacemaker autodefibrillator , cochlear implant , ocular implant , aneurysm clip , artificial heart valve , insulin pump , orthopedic pin prosthesis ; ii ) Any ferromagnetic foreign body metal shaving , shrapnel , orthodontic brace , certain tattoos permanent eye liner ; , iii ) Any implanted device foreign body list possibly ferromagnetic .</criteria>
