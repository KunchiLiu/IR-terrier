	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Bevacizumab may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes necessary cancer cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy fluorouracil leucovorin use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Combining bevacizumab fluorouracil leucovorin may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combine bevacizumab fluorouracil leucovorin treat patient locally advance metastatic stage IV colorectal cancer progress standard chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Plus Fluorouracil Leucovorin Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Stage IV Colorectal Cancer That Has Progressed After Standard Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine response rate patient treat bevacizumab , fluorouracil , leucovorin calcium stage IV colorectal cancer progress standard chemotherapy . - Determine time progression overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine safety administer `` bolus '' continuous infusion fluorouracil leucovorin calcium patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive 1 2 treatment regimen . - Regimen I : Patients receive bevacizumab IV day 1 , 15 , 29 , 42 ( every 2 week ) leucovorin calcium ( CF ) IV 2 hour fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) IV bolus day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 . - Regimen II : Patients receive bevacizumab regimen I CF IV 2 hour 5-FU IV bolus follow continuous infusion 22 hour day 1 , 2 , 15 , 16 , 29 , 30 , 43 , 44 . For regimen , course repeat every 8 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow tumor response survival . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Various NCI-designated Clinical Cancer Centers medical institution across United States participate study . A total 35-125 patient accrue study within 3 month .</detailed_description>
