	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy use different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Combining one chemotherapy drug radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give cisplatin etoposide together radiation therapy work treat patient limited-stage small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cisplatin , Etoposide , Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Limited-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine response rate patient limited stage small cell lung cancer treat cisplatin etoposide combine accelerate high-dose thoracic radiotherapy . - Determine progression-free overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine qualitative quantitative toxicity reversibility toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : Patients undergo radiotherapy daily 5 day week approximately 3 week twice daily 5 day week approximately 2 week ( total 9 treatment day final 2-week treatment period ) . Beginning first day radiotherapy , patient receive cisplatin IV 2 hour etoposide IV 1 hour day 1 oral etoposide daily day 2 3 . Chemotherapy repeat every 3 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 71 patient accrue study within 18 month .</detailed_description>
