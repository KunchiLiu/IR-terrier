	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : ZD6474 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . ZD6474 may also stop growth small cell lung cancer block blood flow tumor . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study well ZD6474 work compare placebo treat patient small cell lung cancer respond previous chemotherapy without radiation therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ZD6474 Treating Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare progression-free survival patient previously treat small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) treat ZD6474 v placebo . - Compare response rate patient treat regimen ( patient measurable disease outside prior radiation field study entry ) . - Compare toxicity tolerability regimens patient . - Compare pharmacokinetics regimens patient . - Correlate outcome response vascular endothelial growth factor expression microvessel density patient treat regimen . - Compare quality life patient treat regimen . - Provide comprehensive tumor , plasma , urine bank link clinical database study molecular marker SCLC . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord participate center , time prior radiotherapy ( early [ day 1 , course 4 chemotherapy ] v late vs prior radiotherapy ) , stage disease diagnosis ( limited v extensive ) , response study entry ( complete vs partial ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral ZD6474 daily . - Arm II : Patients receive oral placebo daily . In arm , course repeat every 28 day 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline , every 4 week therapy , every 8 week disease progression . Patients follow every 8 week disease progression every 6 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 100 patient ( 50 per treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
