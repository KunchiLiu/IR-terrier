	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give tirapazamine together cisplatin , etoposide , radiation therapy work treat patient limited-stage small cell lung cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin etoposide , work different way stop tumor cell divide stop grow die . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays damage tumor cell . Tirapazamine may make tumor cell sensitive chemotherapy radiation therapy . Combining chemotherapy radiation therapy tirapazamine may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tirapazamine Combined With Chemo RT Limited-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess overall survival patient limited stage small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) treat induction tirapazamine combine cisplatin , etoposide high dose thoracic radiotherapy follow consolidative cisplatin etoposide . II . To assess time treatment failure calculate initiation step 1 , response ( confirmed plus unconfirmed , complete plus partial induction subset patient measurable disease ) toxicity patient population treat regimen . III . To investigate exploratory manner association baseline PAI-1 , VEGF , OPN NDRG1 plasma marker patient response survival . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . CHEMORADIOTHERAPY : Patients receive tirapazamine IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 29 , 36 , 38 , 40 ; cisplatin IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 29 , 36 ; etoposide IV 1 hour day 1-5 29-33 . Beginning day 1 chemotherapy , patient undergo thoracic radiotherapy daily 5 day week 7 week . CONSOLIDATION CHEMOTHERAPY : Within 28 day completion radiotherapy , patient stable respond disease receive cisplatin IV 1 hour day 1 22 etoposide IV 1 hour day 1-3 22-24 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients follow every 2-3 month 2 year every 6 month 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30-85 patient accrue study within 17 month .</detailed_description>
