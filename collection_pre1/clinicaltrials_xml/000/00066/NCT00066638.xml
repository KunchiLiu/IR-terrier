	<brief_title>FR901228 Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety efficacy depsipeptide patient refractory relapse multiple myeloma ( MM ) . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive FR901228 ( depsipeptide ) IV 4 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve stable plateau ( stable paraprotein level urine protein excretion 3 consecutive determination least 4 week apart ) may receive maintenance therapy comprise FR901228 IV day 1 15 , course repeat every 28 day . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 21-50 patient accrue study within 5-12.5 month .</detailed_description>
