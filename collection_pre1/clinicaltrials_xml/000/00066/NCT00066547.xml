	<brief_title>Monoclonal Antibody Therapy Treating Women With Locally Advanced Metastatic Breast Cancer Previously Treated With Combination Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety tolerability monoclonal antibody HuHMFG1 woman locally advance metastatic breast cancer previously treat anthracycline taxane-based therapy . - Determine maximum tolerate dose appropriate schedule drug patient . - Determine pharmacokinetic profile drug patient . - Determine tumor response rate , progression-free survival , median survival patient treated drug . - Analyze immunological marker evaluation disease status ( e.g. , vitro analysis antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity , natural killer cell activity , complement depletion , tumor marker CA 15.3 CEA ) patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , open-label , nonrandomized , multicenter study . - Phase I : Patients receive monoclonal antibody HuHMFG1 IV 1-3 hour every 3 week dose 1 2 . All subsequent dose interval base individual half-life value drug . Patients receive least 6 dos absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos monoclonal antibody HuHMFG1 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede least 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . - Phase II : Patients receive monoclonal antibody HuHMFG1 MTD . Patients follow 28 day . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 3-40 patient ( 3-15 patient phase I 19-25 patient phase II ) accrue study within approximately 12 month .</detailed_description>
