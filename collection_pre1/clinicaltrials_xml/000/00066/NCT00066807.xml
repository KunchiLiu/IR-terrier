	<brief_title>Premenopausal Endocrine Responsive Chemotherapy Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Compare ovarian function suppression tamoxifen exemestane v without adjuvant chemotherapy premenopausal woman endocrine-responsive resected breast cancer . - Compare disease-free overall survival patient treat regimen . - Compare sit first treatment failure patient treat regimen . - Compare incidence second nonbreast malignancy patient treat regimen . - Compare quality life , include late side effect early menopause , patient treat regimen . PLANNED OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord participate center , number positive axillary and/or internal mammary lymph node ( 0 vs 1 ) , method ovarian function suppression ( triptorelin v oophorectomy v ovarian irradiation ) , chemotherapy randomize arm II ( contain v contain anthracycline taxane ) , endocrine agent ( tamoxifen v exemestane v select subsequent randomization TEXT trial ) . Treatment duration five year . Quality life assess baseline , every 6 month 2 year , annually 4 year . Patients follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 5 year , annually thereafter . NOTE : Trial terminate early due poor accrual .</detailed_description>
