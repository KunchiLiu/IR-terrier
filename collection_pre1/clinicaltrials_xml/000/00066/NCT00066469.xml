	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy cyclophosphamide , prednisone , methylprednisolone use different way stop cancer cell divide stop grow die . Monoclonal antibody rituximab locate cancer cell either kill deliver cancer-killing substance without harm normal cell . Combining cyclophosphamide either prednisone methylprednisolone rituximab may effective treat lymphoproliferative disease follow organ transplantation . PURPOSE : Phase II trial study effectiveness combine cyclophosphamide either prednisone methylprednisolone rituximab treat patient Epstein-Barr virus-positive lymphoproliferative disease follow organ transplantation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cyclophosphamide , Rituximab , Either Prednisone Methylprednisolone Treating Patients With Lymphoproliferative Disease After Solid Organ Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety toxicity cyclophosphamide , rituximab , prednisone methylprednisolone patient CD20-positive Epstein-Barr virus-positive post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease ( PTLD ) solid organ transplantation . - Determine 2-year event-free survival , define alive continuous complete remission function original allograft , patient treat regimen . - Determine response rate patient treat regimen . - Determine PTLD gene expression profile microarray analysis fluorescent situ hybridization patient treat regimen . - Determine accrual rate patient study . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV 30-60 minute day 1 oral prednisone methylprednisolone IV twice daily day 1-5 . During course 1 2 , patient also receive rituximab IV 2-5 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression , new primary secondary malignancy , unrelated disease . After finish study treatment , patient follow periodically least 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 60 patient ( 50 non-fulminant post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease [ PTLD ] 10 fulminant PTLD ) accrue study within 2.5-3 year .</detailed_description>
