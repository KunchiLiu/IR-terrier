	<brief_title>Study Human Anti-TNF Monoclonal Antibody Adalimumab Children With Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis ( JIA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design clinical trial chosen evaluate adalimumab subject either methotrexate ( MTX ) -naive withdraw MTX least 2 week prior study drug administration ( non-MTX stratum ) inadequate responder MTX continue MTX treatment ( MTX stratum ) . The study consist 4 phase : 16-week Open-label Lead-in ( OL LI ) , 32-week Double-blind ( DB ) phase , 136-week Open-label Extension Body Surface Area ( OLE BSA ) phase , 224-week OLE Fixed Dose ( FD ) phase . All subject meet entry criterion enrol one appropriate stratum receive adalimumab ( plus concomitant MTX MTX stratum ) 16 week OL LI phase study . All subject respond adalimumab OL LI phase enrol DB phase study randomize receive adalimumab ( plus concomitant MTX MTX stratum ) placebo ( plus concomitant MTX MTX stratum ) . Subjects DB phase receive either adalimumab ( 24 mg/m2 BSA maximum 40 mg total body dose ) placebo subcutaneously ( SC ) administer every week ( eow ) . Adalimumab placebo administer additional 32 week flare disease ( base PedACR30 response criterion = worsen 30 % 3 6 response variable ( Parent 's global assessment subject 's overall well-being visual analog scale [ VAS ] , Physician 's global assessment [ PhGA ] subject 's disease severity VAS , number active joint [ joint swell due deformity joint limitation passive motion ( LOM ) ] , pain , tenderness , , number joint LOM , Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire [ CHAQ ] , CRP level ) , minimum 2 active joint , 1 indicator improve 30 % ) , whichever occur earlier . For subject disease flare , DB phase complete Week 48 . Subjects experience disease flare DB phase subject complete 48 week study give option receive adalimumab minimum 44 week ( maximum 136 week ) OLE BSA phase eligible switch OLE FD phase . In phase , subject receive OL adalimumab ( 24 mg/m2 BSA maximum 40 mg total body dose SC eow ) . All subject complete least 44 week OLE BSA treatment give opportunity continue OLE FD phase 224 week additional adalimumab exposure . In phase , subject weigh less 30 kg treat fix dose 20 mg adalimumab SC eow . Subjects weigh 30 kg treat fix dose 40 mg adalimumab SC eow .</detailed_description>
