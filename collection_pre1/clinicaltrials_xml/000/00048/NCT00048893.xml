	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effectiveness chemotherapy combination vaccine treat metastatic breast cancer ( breast cancer spread beyond breast ) patient whose cancer cell protein call carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) surface . Patients require surgery radiation therapy , , receive treatment well . Patients 18 year age old previously untreated metastatic breast cancer may eligible study . Newly diagnose patient may receive prior chemotherapy . Patients previously diagnose local disease may receive chemotherapy radiation therapy least 18 month enter current study . Patients may receive hormonal therapy stage IV disease . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood urine test , x-ray , heart lung test , test determine presence CEA tumor cell . Participants undergo follow procedure : 1 . Central venous line : Under local general anesthesia , intravenous catheter ( plastic tube ) insert major vein chest . It use give chemotherapy medication withdraw blood sample . 2 . Apheresis : Before begin treatment various time chemotherapy , patient undergo apheresis collect white blood cell later re-infusion time immunization evaluate body 's response vaccine . For procedure , blood collect central venous catheter circulate machine separate white cell rest blood . The white cell remove frozen later use . The rest blood return patient catheter . 3 . First vaccine : Before start chemotherapy , patient receive one subcutaneous ( skin ) injection vaccine call rV-CEA-Tricom , along subcutaneous injection granulocyte macrophage colony stimulate factor ( GM-CSF ) ( Sargramostim ) , drug stimulates bone marrow release white blood cell white cell precursor bloodstream . 4 . Chemotherapy : - Taxol ( paclitaxel ) /Cytoxan ( cyclophosphamide ) : Patients receive three five cycle Taxol Cytoxan . Taxol give continuous 72-hour intravenous ( intravenous ( IV ) , vein ) infusion Cytoxan give daily 3 day , intravenously , 1 hour . Cycles 21 42 ( usually 28 ) day . After cycle , patient also receive growth colony stimulate factor ( G-CSF ) ( drug help boost white cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Metastatic breast cancer remain day mostly incurable disease , le 10 % patient reach long-term disease free survival . This study propose use immune-depleting chemotherapy platform immunotherapy . It base follow hypothesis understand : - The combination dose-intensive follow immune-depleting chemotherapy provide platform subsequent immunotherapy : 1 . Lengthening progression-free survival period , thus allow time slow act therapy vaccination effective . 2 . Maximally decrease patient 's tumor burden . This show clinical experimental setting desirable necessary immunotherapy effective . 3 . Decreasing tumor burden may also decrease tumor-induced immuno-suppressive effect link tumor bulk . 4 . Providing tumor antigen exposure follow immune depletion form repeat immunization . This may take advantage pattern immune reconstitution follow immune deplete therapy early time point ( antigen-driven peripheral expansion T-cells ) renewal T-cell repertoire bias towards tumor antigens anti-tumor response later time point . - Low antigenicity tumor antigens immune tolerance may overcome clinically relevant fashion provide exposure tumor antigen ( carcino-embryonic antigen CEA ) immunogenic presentation along added co-stimulatory signal ( form two poxvirus-based recombinant vaccine ) . - Due post immune depletion defect delay immune reconstitution , adequate immune response vaccine may occur unless patient provide , follow immune depletion , unaltered T-cells form re-infusion pre-chemotherapy lymphocyte . The late recovery thymic function ( 18 24 month ) reappearance naive T-cells may play determinant role prevention later disease progression . It rationale late series immunization . ELIGIBILITY : Patients metastatic breast cancer untreated chemotherapy radiation previous 18 month CEA positivity either tumor serum . OBJECTIVES : The primary objective evaluate biologically immunization strategy assess CEA specific T-cell response well clinically compare patient event free survival ( EFS ) historical control ( protocol 96-C-0104 ) patient receive conventional therapy immunization DESIGN : Before chemotherapy patient immunized one two tumor-specific , recombinant , poxvirus-based deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) Tricom vaccine sensitize lymphocyte cryopreserved . Patients receive conventional induction therapy Paclitaxel , Cyclophosphamide Doxorubicin , surgery / radiation indicate local control , immune deplete chemotherapy Fludarabine &amp; Cyclophosphamide . Following immune depletion , patient receive 9 immunization boost next 30 month . Patients whose disease progress vaccination schedule , may , certain circumstance , receive vaccination intensive schedule ( monthly ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All patient must diagnosis metastatic infiltrating carcinoma breast include hormone receptor test . At least one site metastatic disease must confirm pathologic cytologic material . In choice biopsy site , PI weigh morbidity diagnostic procedure probability positive yield diagnostic procedure . All pathologic material must review Pathology Laboratory National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) treatment . The tumor MUST stain positive CEA , standard immunohistochemistry perform Pathology Laboratory NCI . Method : 5 microM formalinfixed paraffinembedded section deparaffinized blocked methanol30 % hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) . After antigen retrieval boil citrate buffer , heat microwave oven 10 minute , slide incubate monoclonal antibody antiCEA ( diluted 1/1000 Dako ) . Then , slide immunostained avidinbiotinperoxidase complex develop diaminobenzidine . Harris ' hematoxylin use counter stain slide . Positivity define great 30 % cell stain . Patients may newly diagnose metastatic breast carcinoma know breast carcinoma . If newly diagnose , patient may receive chemotherapy disease entry study . If previously treat breast cancer , patient may receive chemotherapy radiation adjuvant treatment nonmetastatic disease metastatic disease previous 18 month . Patients may hormonal therapy stage IV disease . Patients disease progression hormonal therapy alone eligible . Karnofsky performance status great equal 70 % ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) 0 1 ) Ejection fraction multigated acquisition scan ( MUGA ) 2dimensional ( 2D ) echocardiogram within normal institutional limit . In case insufficient ejection fraction , stress echocardiogram perform . In case ejection fraction great 35 % le 45 % , patient remain eligible study increase ejection fraction stress estimate 10 % . Creatinine clearance great equal 60 cc/min Normal urinalysis ; proteinuria present must quantify less 1 g / 24 h measure 24 h urine collection Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) less 3 time upper limit normal except believe due tumor involvement liver prior induction therapy .
