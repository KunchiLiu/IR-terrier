	<brief_summary>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To determine percentage patient high risk neuroblastoma first subsequent partial response well , microscopic residual bone marrow disease , demonstrate immunological anti-tumor response time , 12 month initiation , treatment subcutaneous injection autologous neuroblastoma cell , genetically modify adenoviral vector secrete interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) ( autologous neuroblastoma vaccine ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES 1 . To determine toxicity autologous neuroblastoma vaccine give accord schedule 2 . To obtain preliminary data effect vaccine administration progression-free survival high-risk neuroblastoma</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neuroblastoma Vaccine Treatment High-Risk Neuroblastoma After Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tumor cell subject high-risk neuroblastoma obtain time presentation initial diagnosis , routine surveillance bone marrow disease status , time surgical resection disease primary chemotherapy . The tumor cell irradiate prevent possibility tumor growth . Autologous neuroblastoma tumor cell use treat neuroblastoma follow completion primary salvage chemotherapy peripheral blood lymphocyte count recover &gt; 500 CD3+ cells/mm3 . This precede chemotherapy may may include bone marrow peripheral stem cell rescue . Therefore , follow achievement best response chemotherapy , vaccine administer 6 month . Vaccine modify secretion IL-2 use . Vaccine therapy commence complete recovery side effect primary salvage chemotherapy , long subject absolute CD3+ lymphocyte count absolute neutrophil count great 500/mm3 . A vaccine consist 0.3 x 10 8 cells/patient give per injection , base data Phase I study . Injections give twice monthly two month , monthly four month , total eight vaccine injection six month . The immune effect vaccine , toxicity treatment , anti-tumor effect periodically assess . Further evaluation do annually . The first second vaccine injection sit `` punch biopsied '' one week injection . Several x-rays various type scan also take assist monitor status neuroblastoma . Complete detail evaluation require study include . Subjects may receive supportive care acute chronic toxicity injection , include blood product support , antibiotic , appropriate intervention . Pneumocystis carinii prophylaxis initiate chemotherapy may continue vaccine therapy long deemed appropriate investigator . As well , subject may receive concurrent therapy cis-retinoic acid discretion treat physician . An adenoviral vector use transduce cell ex-vivo . Subjects treat viral vector .</detailed_description>
