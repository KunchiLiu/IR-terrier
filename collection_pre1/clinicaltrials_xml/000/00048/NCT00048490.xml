	<brief_summary>This study use transcranial magnetic stimulation , TMS ( describe ) , treat epilepsy certain patient whose seizure persist despite optimum medical treatment . TMS use study intend lessen number seizure patient decrease excitability brain region seizure originate . Patients 5 65 year age epilepsy two year least one seizure week least 6 month may eligible 18-week study . Their seizure must come neocortical focus-that , near surface brain . Candidates select NIH Epilepsy clinic screen electroencephalogram ( EEG ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan , blood test . Participants keep diary seizure experience 8-week period . After 8 week , come NIH outpatient clinic 6 consecutive day follow procedure : - Day 1 : A regular clinic visit , plus 6 hour video-EEG recording ( describe ) - Days 2 5 : Video-EEG monitoring TMS follow : 8:00 - 11 : 00 a.m. 3 hour video-EEG monitoring 11:00 - 12:30 p.m. TMS ( include set-up time ; actual stimulation time last 30 minute ) 12:30 - 3:00 p.m . Lunch + rest 3:00 - 4:30 p.m. TMS 4:30 - 7:30 p.m. 3 hour video-EEG monitoring ( On fifth day , subject 6 hour video-EEG monitoring afternoon instead 3 hour . ) Participants randomly assign one two TMS group . One group TMS deliver way think chance reduce seizure ; sham , placebo , stimulation . When TMS session complete , participant keep diary seizure another 8 week . Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation For TMS , insulate wire coil place subject 's scalp . A brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse travel scalp skull cause small electrical current cortex , out part brain . The stimulation may cause muscle , hand arm twitching , may cause twitch temporary tingle forearm , head , face muscle . During stimulation , electrical activity muscle record computer record device , use electrode attach skin tape . Some TMS session may videotape . Video-EEG Recordings The EEG recording device house small pouchlike container worn shoulder , attach belt worn around waist .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In study , use repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) 1.0 Hz treat patient poorly control neocortical epilepsy refractory pharmacological treatment continuation previous study ( 1.0 Hz TMS 24 patient refractory partial epilepsy ) . Previously , observe 1.0 Hz rTMS reduce seizure frequency first 2 week TMS , although difference reach statistical significance . However , result suggest patient neocortical temporal focus would better response mesial temporal focus . We wish see whether rTMS lead significant reduction seizure frequency neocortical epilepsy consider depth magnetic field . The design include two parallel group , one receive active treatment , one sham stimulation direct away epileptic focus . The patient rating physician blind treatment . 1.0 Hz TMS rate proven induce long term depression animal model report decrease excitability human animal cerebral cortex . Our preliminary control study show trend reduce seizure frequency 1.0 Hz stimulation . The main outcome measure reduction seizure frequency two week stimulation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients select ERB , NINDS , NIH Epilepsy Clinic . Age 5 65 entry protocol . History localizationrelated epilepsy two year . Patients stable anticonvulsant regimen define unchanged medicine dose modification low 20 % last month . Blood level anticonvulsant measure begin study , prior stimulation study assure type dose medication remain constant . Seizures completely responsive medical treatment ( 1 seizure per week least 6 month ) patient continue seizure despite best medical treatment past . The patient localize neocortical seizure focus , base EEG neuroimaging finding . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients exclude study : 1. pregnant woman ( tested urine pregnancy test ) . The effect rTMS pregnancy unknown . 2. severe coronary disease . 3. increase intracranial pressure express presence papilledema . 4. cardiac pacemaker . 5. take neuroleptic antidepressant medication . 6. progressive neurologic disease .</criteria>
