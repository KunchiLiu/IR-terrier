	<brief_summary>Nitric oxide gas important regulating blood vessel dilation , consequently , blood flow . This gas continuously produce endothelial cell , line blood vessel . This study examine whether nitrite , molecule normally circulate blood stream , also dilate blood vessel . The result study may valuable develop treatment people condition associate impaired endothelial production nitric oxide , include high blood pressure , high blood cholesterol , diabetes , estrogen deficiency , others . Healthy , non-smoking normal volunteer 21 year age old may eligible study . People lack enzyme G6PD cytochrome B5 red blood cell may participate . Absence enzymes lead episode sudden shortness breath cyanosis ( blueness skin due lack sufficient oxygen ) . Participants undergo procedure describe study Parts A B , follow : - Part A - After numb skin , small tube place artery vein inside elbow dominant arm ( right- left-handed ) small tube place vein arm . The tube use infuse saline ( salt water ) draw blood sample . A pressure cuff place around upper part dominant arm , rubber band device call strain gauge also place around arm measure blood flow . When cuff inflate , blood flow arm , stretch strain gauge rate proportional flow . Grip-strength dominant arm measure dynamometer determine maximum grip-strength . Then , several measurement blood flow , nitrite , hemoglobin , handgrip make administration L-NMMA , drug block endothelial production nitric oxide . - Part B - Part A testing repeat , except sodium nitrite dissolve saline solution infuse artery forearm minute hand-grip exercise . In addition , blood sample draw handgrip exercise measure methemoglobin , substance , excessive level , cause adverse side effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Nitric oxide ( NO ) soluble gas continuously synthesized endothelium contribute importantly vasodilator tone coronary systemic circulation activate guanylyl cyclase vascular smooth muscle , cause relaxation . Although regional synthesis NO endothelium contribute local vasodilator tone , show previously NO may transport blood , biological effect distance site entry circulation . Thus , find NO may transport bound heme iron red blood cell release vascular site deficient NO synthesis , restore vasodilator tone . Another potential source bioactive NO via nitrite , form auto-oxidation NO . This study design determine contribution nitrite transport blood forearm microvascular dilator tone healthy subject rest regional hypoxia associate forearm exercise stress , measurement make regional blockade endothelial NO synthesis . Findings study may relevant understand physiological contribution therapeutic potential nitrite regulation vasodilator tone diseases condition associate regional endothelial dysfunction reduce endothelial NO bioactivity ( e.g. , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , cigarette smoking , estrogen deficiency ) .</detailed_description>
