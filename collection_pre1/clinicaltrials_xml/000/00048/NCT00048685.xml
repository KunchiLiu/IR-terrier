	<brief_summary>This study examine type bacteria present dental plaque patient persistent dry mouth . Saliva essential digestion swallow maintain normal mineralization teeth . People suffer dry mouth usually significant increase tooth decay ( caries ) . This study determine increase due solely reduced salivary flow also increase certain type bacteria mouth . Patients participate follow NIDCR protocol may eligible study : Evaluation Treatment Salivary Dysfunction ( 84-D-0056 ) , Natural History Salivary Gland Dysfunction Sjogren 's Syndrome Research Project ( 99-D-0070 ) , Salivary Evaluation Normal Volunteers ( 94-D-0018 ) . Participants three appointment NIH dental clinic follow : Visit 1 Dental examination instruction keep detailed diary food intake . Visit 2 ( 1 week visit 1 ) Attachment bacteria collection device ( describe ) side tooth . Visit 3 ( 48 hour visit 2 ) Removal collection device , tooth clean polishing , submission food diary . The bacteria collection device 4mm x 2mm x 2mm square sterilize tooth obtain slice extract healthy tooth donate another patient . The donated teeth either extract impacted third molar ( wisdom teeth ) teeth extract teeth straighten ( orthodontics ) . The device heat-sterilized bond participant 's tooth . The dental cement use bond remove 48 hour damage surface participant 's tooth .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although significant improvement make dental health status US population , dental caries remain significant problem . The recent Surgeon General 's Report ( 2000 ) note 20 % US population bear 60 % caries burden . Caries incidence even high child minority , chronically ill , physically handicap , elderly institutionalize . Dental Caries multi-factorial disease fermentation dietary carbohydrate oral bacteria result acid dissolution tooth structure . Important risk factor include frequency dietary carbohydrate intake , intra-oral plaque level , level cariogenic oral bacteria , salivary insufficiency past fluoride exposure . A medical condition show associate increased caries risk caries incidence Sjogren 's syndrome ( Kolavic et al 1997 , Pedersen et al 1999 , Almstahl et al 1999 ) . Sjogren 's syndrome ( SS ) predominantly affect woman auto-immune disorder characterize epitheliitis exocrinopathy . Both primary secondary form describe . Secondary SS see condition co-exist auto-immune disease rheumatoid arthritis ( See review Fox Maruyama 1997 , Fox et al 1999 , Pflugfelder 1998 ) A recent study Sreebny Zhu ( Adv . Dent Res 1996 ) , demonstrated individual diagnosis SS nearly 40 % likely harbor high level specie Lactobacillus plaque saliva healthy individual . LB show major etiological agent dental caries progression . The principal hypothesis study SS patient high risk caries development reduce salivary flow ( xerostomia ) also change output organic inorganic microbial regulatory component saliva secondary auto-immune disease . These alteration favor selective increase proportion cariogenic microflora plaque locate teeth . Specifically , mutans streptococci ( MS ) Lactobacillus ( LB ) specie increase frequency number SS patient compare xerostomic patient detectable auto-immune disease . The propose study investigate microbial count MS LB plaque patient clinical diagnosis markedly reduce salivary flow ( pool unstimulated flow &amp; eq ; 0.1 ml/min ) . All clinical procedure take place NIH . Some sample data , without patient identifier , analyze outside . Plaque sample collect site identify high-risk caries initiation development . It generally accept discernment microbial etiology blunt use salivary pool plaque monitor MS LB surrogate sample plaque area high caries risk . This support current knowledge biology MS/LB expect location carious lesion . Saliva sample collect due difficulty obtain sufficient fluid result concurrent xerostomia . The propose study examine relationship MS/LB reduce salivary flow two patient group : 1 . A patient group reduce salivary flow AND diagnosis primary secondary SS ( per Revised International Criteria diagnosis SS ) OR auto-immune disease non-SS etiology . 2 . A non-disease control group , meet criterion SS , reduce salivary flow AND suffer subjective symptom xerostomia xerophthalmia period longer 6 month OR take medication xerogenic effect . Plaque micro-organisms harvest `` collection device '' bond surface posterior tooth show high risk caries development . Plaque collect way show closely simulate complex ecology mature cariogenic plaque . The harvested organism plat non-selective medium enumeration total microbial load selective medium enumeration specific cariogenic bacteria . More comprehensive knowledge effect SS microbial flora different predeliction sit oral disease would great value effective treatment plan SS evaluation effect oral treatment preventive measure implement individual SS .</detailed_description>
