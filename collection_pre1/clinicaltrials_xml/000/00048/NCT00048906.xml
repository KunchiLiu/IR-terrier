	<brief_summary>This study determine safety drug Replagal treating patient Fabry disease , inherit metabolic disorder . In disease , enzyme call Alpha-galactosidase A , normally break fatty substance call globotriaosylceramide ( Gb3 ) , miss function properly . The result accumulation Gb3 cause problem kidney , heart , nerve , blood vessel . Replagal genetically engineer form Alpha-galactosidase A . Previous study show patient Fabry disease progress end-stage kidney failure tolerate Replagal replacement therapy well . This study examine effect drug patient kidney problem associate Fabry disease . Patients Fabry disease kidney dialysis , kidney transplant , may eligible study . During 6 12-month study , participant receive 40-minute intravenous ( IV ) infusion Replagal every week , close monitoring infusion . Before first infusion , patient evaluate medical history , physical neurological examination , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , routine blood urine test , kidney test , measurement height , weight , vital sign ( blood pressure , pulse , breathe rate , temperature ) . In addition , pharmacokinetic study immediately follow first infusion Replagal . For study , blood sample less teaspoon draw measure level Replagal enzyme activity . The sample collect follow time point : immediately infusion ; 20 minute infusion ; end infusion ; infusion 50 , 60 , 90 minute , 2 , 3 , 4 , 8 hour . Safety evaluation do week first month month rest study period . These evaluation include physical examination , measurement vital sign , electrocardiogram , routine blood urine test , kidney testing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective clinical trial study effect range renal function safety pharmacokinetics Replagal enzyme replacement therapy patient Fabry Disease . Patients clinical genetic biochemical evidence Fabry Disease select clinical trial . Sixty ( 60 ) patient enrol clinical trial . Enrollment stratify base baseline renal function per FDA guideline . This open label clinical study . Baseline evaluation conduct approximately 3 day period . Patients receive intravenous ( IV ) infusion Replagal dose 0.2 mg/kg/dose every 2 week . Pharmacokinetic study perform first administer dose . The safety evaluation patient study include vital sign , physical examination , adverse event ( AE ) assessment , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , battery laboratory test include measurement anti-Replagal antibody . An overview study appear Appendix A .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Patient Fabry Disease : Patient male hemizygote , age 18 , evidence Fabry Disease , define Alphagalactosidase A enzyme deficiency . Alphagalactosidase A deficiency define plasma serum enzyme level le 1.2 nmoles/hr/mL . Patient heterozygous carrier female , age 18 , evidence Fabry Disease define mutation Alphagalactosidase A gene . Patient clinical evidence Fabry Disease . For patient compromised renal function history renal transplant result Fabry Disease , renal disease must consistent Fabry Disease . For patient , clinical evidence define least one ( 1 ) following : neurologic disease ( neuropathic pain ) cardiac disease ( cadiomyopathy ) cerebrovascular disease ( history stroke ) dermatologic disease ( angiokeratomas ) gastrointestinal disease ( malabsorption weight loss ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patient eligible ongoing TKT sponsor placebocontrolled clinical trial accrue patient . The selection criterion ongoing Study TKT010 appear Appendix D. If another TKT sponsor placebocontrolled clinical trial initiate study , selection criterion study append study . Patient disease Fabry cause patient 's renal dysfunction ( example , diabetes hypertension ) . Patient receive another investigational therapeutic agent Fabry Disease . Patient receive renal transplant result renal dysfunction cause disease Fabry Disease . Patient unable comply protocol , eg , uncooperative protocol schedule , refuse agree study procedure , unable return safety evaluation , otherwise unlikely complete study determine investigator medical monitor .</criteria>
