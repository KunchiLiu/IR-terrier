	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer common visceral malignancy second leading cause cancer death men . While androgen ablation therapy cornerstone treatment advanced stage disease , recent study suggest advantage introduce androgen deprivation much earlier . Because androgens essential maintain skeletal integrity men , androgen deprivation therapy constitute major risk factor male osteoporosis . We previously demonstrate men chronic androgen deprivation therapy 20 % loss bone . Our hypothesis : 1 ) chronically increase bone resorption induce long term androgen deprivation therapy men prostate cancer reverse weekly bisphosphonate ; 2 ) improvement bone mass bisphosphonate therapy reflect change biochemical marker bone turnover allow u predict respond therapy ; 3 ) follow termination bisphosphonate therapy , bone mass maintain despite absence antiresorptive therapy . To address hypothesis , enroll 84 men stage D0 prostate cancer chronic androgen deprivation therapy two year , double blind , placebo control , randomize , modify crossover clinical design . During first year , subject randomize bisphosphonate therapy placebo . During second year , subject placebo receive active treatment subject active treatment randomly assign continue therapy change placebo . To evaluate effect bisphosphonate prevent bone loss , assess bone mass spine , total hip , total body , forearm dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry . For hypothesis 2 , ass marker bone resorption formation determine early change marker associate long term change bone mass . For hypothesis 3 , continue follow bone mass biochemical marker bone turnover month 12 24 examine rate change antiresorptive therapy terminate . Few data available prevention bone loss men androgen deprivation therapy . This study examine preventive strategy , potential mechanism bone loss , ability biochemical marker predict bone mass , skeletal outcomes antiresorptive therapy withdrawn .</detailed_description>
