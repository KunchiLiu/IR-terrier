	<brief_summary>Background : - Some cancer , Hodgkin 's disease , anaplastic large cell lymphoma others , protein surface cancer cell call CD30 . - HeFi-1 antibody bind CD30 protein send signal cancer cell cause die . Objectives : - To determine high dose HeFi-1 safely give patient tumor CD30 protein . - To determine response tumor treatment HeFi-1 . Eligibility : - Patients 18 year age old Hodgkin 's disease , anaplastic large cell lymphoma , cutaneous T cell lymphoma adult T cell leukemia lymphoma sign tumor growth recurrence follow standard treatment - Patients ' tumor cell must CD30 protein . Design : - Groups three patient treat increasingly high dose HeFi-1 ( range 0.5 5 mg/kg ) determine high safe dose . - HeFi-1 infused vein 4 day , follow 2 day rest 10-day period . Patients may receive 2 treatment course show response severe side effect . - Blood sample collect several time study determine safety . A lymph node biopsy do begin study test effect HeFi-1 cancer cell test tube , bone marrow biopsy may do end treatment bone marrow positive tumor cell begin treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study HeFi-1 Treat Cancers With CD30 Protein</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The scientific basis study observation antibody direct ligand-binding site CD30 induce apoptosis vitro cure animal bear CD30-positive tumor . HeFi-1 , murine monoclonal antibody develop NCI , specifically bind human CD30 , member tumor necrosis receptor superfamily , ligand-binding site . CD30 express activated T-cells , Reed-Sternberg cell , anaplastic large cell lymphoma , AIDS-related lymphoma cell . Tumor cell patient anaplastic large cell lymphoma sensitive effect HeFi-1 Hodgkin 's disease cell line show variable responsiveness due presence mutation I B kinase result constitutive activation NF- B . OBJECTIVE : The primary objective study determine toxicity maximum tolerate dose HeFi-1 patient CD30-positive malignancy . This study explore pharmacokinetics , dose require saturate CD30 binding site tumor aspirate , frequency time course onset development human anti-mouse antibody ( HAMA ) . These study allow u monitor preliminary fashion clinical tumor response , measure reduction tumor lesion follow tumor marker serum soluble interleukin 2 receptor . ELIGIBILITY : Patients measurable evaluable CD30-positive lymphoma become refractory standard therapy , include Hodgkin 's disease , systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma , cutaneous T cell lymphoma adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma eligible treatment . DESIGN : This phase I dose-escalation trial cohort three patient treat HeFi-1 range 0.5 5 mg/kg/dose ( total dose 2 20 mg/kg per treatment course ) . Four dos give every three day schedule 10-day period cycle . Two cycle therapy administer provide patient partial complete response develop dose-limiting toxicity HAMA .</detailed_description>
