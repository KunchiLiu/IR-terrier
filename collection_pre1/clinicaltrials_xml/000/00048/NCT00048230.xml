	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Patient legally consent age , define local regulation . Patient , investigator 's opinion , willing able comply protocol requirement . Patient give voluntary write informed consent performance studyrelated procedure part normal medical care , understand consent may withdraw patient time without prejudice future medical care . Female patient either postmenopausal surgically sterilize willing use acceptable method birth control ( i.e. , hormonal contraceptive , intrauterine device , diaphragm spermicide , condom spermicide , abstinence ) duration study . Male patient agree use acceptable method contraception duration study . Patient previously diagnose multiple myeloma base standard criterion currently require second , third , fourthline therapy PD , define 25 % increase Mprotein , development new worsen exist lytic bone lesion soft tissue plasmacytoma , hypercalcemia ( serum calcium &gt; 11.5 mg/dL ) , relapse CR . Patient measurable disease , define follow : For secretory multiple myeloma , measurable disease define quantifiable serum monoclonal protein value ( generally , exclusively , great 1 g/dL IgG MProtein great 0.5g/dL IgA ) , applicable , urine lightchain excretion ≥200 mg/24 hour . For oligo nonsecretory multiple myeloma , measurable disease define presence soft tissue ( bone ) plasmacytoma determine clinical examination applicable radiograph ( i.e . MRI , CTScan ) . In patient oligosecretory multiple myeloma , serum and/or urine Mprotein measurement low difficult follow response assessment . Therefore , disease site ( bone marrow ; extramedullary mass ) must assess followed . In patient nonsecretory multiple myeloma , Mprotein serum urine immunofixation . Patient Karnofsky performance status ≥60 % . Patient lifeexpectancy &gt; 3 month . Patient follow laboratory value within 14 day Baseline ( Day 1 Cycle 1 , study drug administration ) : Platelet count ≥50 x 10E+9/L without transfusion support within 7 day laboratory test . Hemoglobin ≥7.5 g/dL , without transfusion support within 7 day laboratory test . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥0.75 x 10E+9/L without use colony stimulate factor . Corrected serum calcium &lt; 14 mg/dL ( 3.5 mmol/L ) . Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) : ≤2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) . Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) : ≤2.5 x ULN . Total bilirubin : ≤1.5 x ULN . Calculated measured creatinine clearance : ≥20 mL/minute . Exclusion Criteria Patient previously receive treatment VELCADE . Patient previously refractory treatment highdose dexamethasone , experience less partial response PD within 6 month discontinue dexamethasone , discontinue dexamethasone ≥Grade 3 dexamethasonerelated toxicity . Previous highdose dexamethasone therapy define &gt; 500 mg dexamethasone equivalent 10week period , whether administer alone part VAD regimen . Patient receive nitrosoureas within 6 week chemotherapy , include thalidomide clarithromycin , radiation therapy within 3 week enrollment . Patient receive corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent ) within 3 week enrollment . Patient receive immunotherapy antibody therapy within 8 week enrollment . Patient receive plasmapheresis within 4 week enrollment . Patient major surgery within 4 week enrollment . ( Kyphoplasty consider major surgery . ) Patient history allergic reaction attributable compound contain boron mannitol . Patient peripheral neuropathy Grade 2 great intensity , define NCI Common Toxicity Criteria ( NCI CTC ) : Grade 2 : Objective sensory loss paresthesia ( include tingle ) , interfere function , interfere activity daily live ( ADLs ) . Grade 3 : Sensory loss paresthesia interfere ADLs . Grade 4 : Permanent sensory loss interfere function . Patient myocardial infarction within 6 month enrollment New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III IV heart failure uncontrolled angina , severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia , electrocardiographic evidence acute ischemia active conduction system abnormality . Patient treat cancer multiple myeloma within 5 year enrollment , exception basal cell carcinoma cervical cancer situ . Patient cardiac amyloidosis . Patient poorly control hypertension , diabetes mellitus , serious medical psychiatric illness could potentially interfere completion treatment accord protocol . Patient known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive . ( Patients assess investigator risk HIV infection test accordance local regulation . ) Patient know hepatitis B surface antigenpositive know active hepatitis C infection . Patient active systemic infection require treatment . Female patient pregnant breastfeeding . Patient currently enrol another clinical research study and/or receive investigational agent reason .</criteria>
