	<brief_summary>This study examine safety effectiveness extracorporeal photopheresis ( ECP ) treat chronic graft-versus-host disease ( GvHD ) . GvHD common complication stem cell transplantation use donated stem cell . It occur donor 's T-lymphocytes ( type immune cell ) see patient 's cell foreign mount immune response reject . The attack cause skin rash , mouth sore , liver lung inflammation , lack appetite , muscle stiffness . Chronic GvHD cause serious illness , even death , long-term effect immune dysfunction toxic effect medication ( cyclosporine prednisone ) use treat . ECP experimental treatment design stop lymphocyte attack body . It involve collect cell cause GvHD , treat combination drug light therapy return body . Sixty 80 percent patient chronic GvHD improve ECP treatment , patient stop treatment prednisone cyclosporine , reduce drug dosage . Patients chronic GvHD whose condition improve minimum 14-day course cyclosporine prednisone may eligible study . Patients must able travel NIH Clinical Center Bethesda , Maryland , twice week 3-month study period . Upon enter study , participant baseline evaluation measure extent GvHD . This assessment include blood test , eye dental examination , skin biopsy patient skin involvement , CT scan lung function test look possible lung involvement . Biopsies lung , liver , mouth , eye may request need confirm GvHD tissue . The skin photograph start ECP treatment month treatment period . Following baseline test , participant undergo treatment evaluation follow : ECP Treatment Patients blood drawn collect lymphocytes cause GvHD . This may do special needle catheter ( tube insert vein ) patient need prefer temporary central venous catheter similar use stem cell transplantation . Patients three 2- 3-hour treatment week first week two treatment week total 25 treatment 3 month . Patients tolerate treatment ...</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This phase 2 study extracorporeal photopheresis ( ECP ) treatment chronic graft versus host disease follow allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . Extracorporeal exposure human mononuclear cell ultraviolet A radiation follow photosensitization 8-methoxypsoralen proven effective treatment cutaneous T-cell lymphoma . Small , single institution study suggest efficacy T-cell mediate disease solid organ rejection graft versus host disease . This phase 2 study ECP treatment chronic graft versus host disease . Eligible patient must objective evidence chronic graft versus host disease refractory conventional therapy must steroid-dependent disease permit steroid dose reduction . The primary objective study well define safety , efficacy mechanism action ECP treatment patient chronic graft versus host disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Objective evidence chronic graft versus host disease involve skin , lung , gastrointestinal tract , liver , eye . 2 . Progressive stable GvHD despite minimum 30 day treatment calcineurin inhibitor ( cyclosporine tacrolimus ) therapeutic plasma level , plus least one another agent different mechanism action use concurrently least 30 day dose known therapeutic cGvHD . In case second agent corticosteroid administer either high level pulse dose ( great equal mg/kg/day prednisone equivalent pulse 3 day longer least two occasion qualify 30 day ) and/or daily dosing ( great equal 0.25mg/kg ) alternate day dose ( great equal 0.50 mg/kg ) prednisone equivalent . In case use steroid medically undesirable contraindicate , second agent may mycophenolate mofetil , sirolimus , hydroxychloroquine , clofazimine , thalidomide , azathioprine , pentostatin , etanercept , Infliximab , Rituximab Daclizumab use dos schedule know provide benefit patient cGvHD . Patients calcineurin inhibitor medically contraindicate may also eligible enrollment least 30 day trial prednisone ( equivalent ) doses/schedules note plus one second agent list . Patients calcineurin inhibitor steroid medically contraindicate agent use limit dos may also eligible least two alternate agent note tried 30 day without improvement symptom cGvHD . Patients stabilization disease calcineurin inhibitor plus steroid ( combination note ) , medication taper without disease flare also eligible . 3 . Adequate ( determine PI ) renal , hepatic , cardiac reserve enable patient tolerate Extracorporeal Photopheresis . 4 . The patient 's malignancy ( applicable ) complete remission patient candidate immunebased antitumor therapy ( donor lymphocyte infusion immunomodulatory cytokine ) due severity GvHD . 5 . WBC great equal 1000 platelet great equal 25,000 . 6 . Weight great equal 30kg . 7 . Female patient pregnant agree use reliable method birth control treatment period 8 . Systolic blood pressure great equal 90 mm Hg . 9 . Karnofsky score Lansky score great equal 30 . 10 . Predicted life expectancy least 3 month . 11 . A minimum 100 day follow stem cell transplantation . 12 . A minimum 30 day without response , 7 day follow cessation , certain investigational 2ndline agent treatment GvHD ( specifically : thalidomide , azathioprine , pentostatin , etanercept , Infliximab , Rituximab Daclizumab ) . 13 . History failure achieve clinical benefit previous treatment ECP least 3 month ( 12 week ) twice week every week therapy administer . 14 . Signed witness informed consent . 15 . Hemoglobin great 9.5 , hematocrit great 28.5 ( patient meet inclusion criterion may treat iron supplementation and/or erythropoietin/darbepoetin hgb/hct Inclusion range may reconsider study entry ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Hypersensitivity allergy psoralen ( methoxypsoralen ) . 2 . Hypersensitivity heparin and/or citrate product . 3 . Patients unable visit NIH clinical center twice week least first four week treatment period ECP treatment ; NIH arrange home treatment ECP thereafter ; every 4 week medical evaluation visit NIH . 4 . Frank gastrointestinal bleeding due GvHD ( occult blood positivity exclude ) . 5 . Patients take cancer chemotherapeutic agent continue treatment malignancy . 6 . Patients undergo radiation therapy . 7 . The patient 's malignancy ( applicable ) NOT complete remission patient candidate immunebased antitumor therapy ( donor lymphocyte infusion immunomodulatory cytokine ) treat GvHD .</criteria>
