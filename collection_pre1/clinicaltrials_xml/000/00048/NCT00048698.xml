	<brief_summary>This study examine effect direct current ( DC ) electrical polarization brain think speed , reaction time , mood , brain wave healthy individual . The result provide information design study examine safety effectiveness technique treat certain brain disease involve impaired cognition ( thought processing ) . The study consist three experiment ; participant take part either one two experiment . Healthy right-handed volunteer 18 80 year age 12 year education may eligible study . Candidates screen medical educational history brief neurological examination . Participants experiment 2 3 also screen verbal fluency test ask say many word begin certain letter 1 minute . Participants undergo follow procedure experiment ( ) participate : Experiment 1 While rest quietly , subject receive 20 minute weak electrical current stimulation sham stimulation current . For stimulation , two gauze pad soak conduct salt solution place head-one leave side one right eye . The current pass pad may cause itch tingle sensation electrode . Before stimulation , participant 's reaction time-tested move finger fast possible sound tone-and mood evaluate . Some participant also electroencephalogram , EEG ( brain wave record ) experiment . After stimulation , participant take two brief test think speed , mood reaction time test repeat . Experiment 2 The participant sit chair electrode attach muscle control movement finger right hand . Reaction time test described experiment 1 . Then , transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) use test activity brain 's motor cortex ( part brain control movement ) . For TMS , insulate wire coil place subject 's scalp . A brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse travel scalp skull cause small electrical current brain cortex . The stimulation may cause twitch right hand arm produce mild snap sensation scalp . During stimulation , electrical activity muscle right hand record computer . Following TMS , DC stimulation apply , describe experiment 1 . The stimulation begin low level follow repeat TMS DC stimulation increasingly high level . This continue clear effect muscle response magnetic pulse , stimulation becomes uncomfortable . At end electrical stimulation , reaction time test . Experiment 3 This experiment use average DC level produce change size response magnetic stimulation experiment 2 . Thinking speed reaction time test DC stimulation , mood test give stimulation . This test use TMS EEG recording .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The passage weak DC current across head ( DC polarization ) do century various effect report . Many report study DC effect human , however , archaic , anecdotal , uncontrolled , scientifically baseless . Recently , show objective mean , control experiment , type treatment robust lasting effect excitability motor cortex healthy human . In vitro animal experiment reveal little mechanism effect , neither convince evidence toxicity find moderate dos . Therefore , become interested whether type treatment use improve cognitive processing individual brain lesion , particularly prefrontal cortex . The purpose project prepare way clinical trial begin establish safety technique human look preliminary evidence potentially useful effect cognition moderate dos apply prefrontal cortex . First , propose test safety 20 min anodal cathodal DC apply left prefrontal area , 1 mV , look clinical-level effect verbal fluency , cognitive processing speed , EEG , mood , motor reaction speed exposure . The duration exposure study match time require gather preliminary efficacy data healthy control patient . Then , dose-finding study , propose find anodal DC amperage necessary produce clear effect excitability , measure increase amplitude motor evoke potential transcranial magnetic stimulation . Then , significant adverse effect first two study , preliminary efficacy study look difference measure group receive anodal , cathodal , sham DC leave prefrontal cortex stimulation .</detailed_description>
