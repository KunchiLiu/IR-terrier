	<detailed_description>Title : Progesterone Treatment Blunt Traumatic Brain Injury Principal Investigator ( ) : Arthur Kellermann , M.D. , M.P.H . Institution : Emory University Biostatistician : Vicki Hertzberg , Ph.D. Institution : Emory University Project phase primary methodology : Phase II pilot , double blind , 4:1 randomize control , clinical trial Target disease : Blunt traumatic brain injury Intervention : Intravenous progesterone infuse three day Number patient enrol : 100 Number clinical center : One ( Grady Memorial Hospital ) Primary Hypothesis : Dose : Intravenous infusion progesterone dose 0.5 mg/kg/hr produce steady state 450 +/- 100 nmol/L male female subject . Safety : Compared study subject receive placebo , subject receive IV progesterone increase risk mortality increase incidence adverse effect . Efficacy : Administering IV progesterone shortly follow TBI produce follow effect , include : - Reduction intracranial pressure therapeutic intensity level ( ICP-TIL ) . - Decreased duration coma . - Decreased inpatient mortality . - Improved neurological outcome one month post-injury . Secondary Hypotheses : Benefit : The benefit IV progesterone TBI evident across range clinically relevant treatment subgroup , regardless : - Time injury drug administration : ( i.e. , &lt; 2 hr . vs. 2-4 hr . vs. 4-6 hrs. ) . - Victim gender . - Presence absence severe extracranial trauma . - Presence absence premorbid confounders outcome ( e.g. , alcohol intoxication , alcoholism , stroke , etc. ) . - Incidence lack confound neurological insult ( e.g. , hypoxemia , hypotension ) . - Severity traumatic brain injury - moderate ( index GCS 9-12 ) versus severe ( index GCS 4-8 ) . - Severity non-brain injury ( AIS , ISS score ) . Description methodology design : Double blind randomize control , clinical trial . Block randomization use insure moderate severely injured patient gender race ( black nonblack ) equal chance allocation either treatment group . Patient selection criterion : Age &gt; 18 ; blunt traumatic brain injury ; moderate severe brain injury ( iGCS 4-12 ) ; arrival &lt; 11 hour Injury Description pre-randomization procedure process : Potential study subject identify Emergency Medical Service ( EMS ) personnel Emergency Medicine attend physician resident ECC GMH . EMS ( ambulance ) personnel notify ECC personnel bring blunt trauma patient Glasgow Coma Score ( iGCS ) 12 less . On arrival , attend emergency physician duty conduct primary secondary trauma survey note patient 's post initial resuscitation GCS . If patient iGCS 4 - 12 meet criteria presumptive eligibility , ECC attend page investigator on-call ( IOC ) ask Hospital Social Services initiate aggressive effort contact patient 's family . To insure prompt administration progesterone/placebo , `` door needle time '' â‰¤ 2 hour establish performance goal . To meet deadline , member research team immediately respond ECC determine patient meet inclusion exclusion criterion . Time injury establish clearly possible EMS report , police report witness interview . Block randomization use insure moderate severely injured patient gender race ( black nonblack ) equal chance allocation either treatment group . To accomplish goal , GMH pharmacy give block set randomly order packet sequential study number subject moderate TBI ( present GCS 9-12 ) severe TBI ( present GCS 4-8 ) . Inside packet instruction prepare infusion progesterone comparable volume placebo . When pharmacist receive copy randomization request , he/she open next packet sequence base patient 's severity brain injury ( moderate versus severe ) , gender , race . Following treatment group assignment , pharmacist record patient 's name , medical record number , dose , time medication prepare confidential log use Safety Committee . Precise treatment dose description protocol : Our goal initiate treatment within 2 hour injury document EMS report , police report witness interview . We accept patient 11 hour post-injury . We attempt achieve serum level progesterone human subject similar normally observed third trimester pregnancy ( i.e. , 450 +/- 100 nmol/L ) . To determine infusion rate need achieve SSSPC progesterone 450 +/- 100nmol/L , conduct dose-escalation study . The first 12 subject randomize progesterone receive load dose 0.714 mg/kg 60 minute follow continuous infusion 0.50 mg/kg/hr three day . Because study personnel blind group assignment , unblinded pharmacologist analyze SSSPC data 12 patient . If target concentration 450 +/- 100nmol/L achieve 90 % subject , infusion rate modify apply next ten subject randomize progesterone therapy . This performed third time necessary . If pharmacokinetic variability precludes achievement target concentration 90 % subject use fixed infusion , adopt individualized dose strategy base real-time serum concentration data . If require , adjustment make placebo infusion well maintain blind study investigator . The total dose give patient three day dose period exceed 7.5 gram . Plan Follow-up : The GOS , DRS , GOAT assess one month post-injury . At time hospital discharge , patient 's disposition note ( morgue , nursing home , rehabilitation facility , another acute care hospital , patient 's home , relative 's home ) , plan make follow-up exam one month post-injury . Subjects still hospitalize GMH , inpatient rehabilitation facility , skilled nursing home , acute care hospital GMH one month post-injury test site . We visit patient homebound time follow-up . All subject ask come study clinic GMH testing . Patients severely impaired test one month post-injury classify `` testable '' . This category consider surrogate marker poor outcome . We utilize reliability code record possible reason non-administration particular measure , physical impairment ( e.g. , hemiparesis ) cognitive impairment ( e.g. , understand instruction ) , intoxication . During follow-up visit , study subject ( proxy respondent ) ask question physical mental health , medical complication ( e.g. , seizure disorder , headache ) , functional status , occupational status , level sexual function , current living situation . Information variables influence outcome , access rehabilitation service , collect well . To encourage participation , subject reimburse $ 25 follow-up visit , plus additional money travel-related expense . Extent type blinding/masking : Hospital pharmacy personnel know patient 's group assignment , information withheld patient , study team , clinical team responsible patient 's care . Both study drug placebo suspend lipid base , indistinguishable color injection characteristic . Endpoints outcomes : Four measure use monitor patient 's clinical response treatment . The first three track daily study nurse . The fourth assess one month post-injury . These four measure : 1 . Reduction ICP , reflect decline patient 's therapeutic intensity level ( ICP-TIL ) measure intensity treatment need reduce increase intracranial pressure ; 2 . Duration coma ( i.e. , total hour injury awaken ) ; 3 . Death prior hospital discharge ; 4 . Neurological outcome one month post -injury , measure Glasgow Outcome Scale ( GOS ) , Disability Rating Scale ( DRS ) , Galveston Orientation Amnesia Test ( GOAT ) . Statistical design sample size calculation : Our data analysis strategy design accomplish three primary one secondary goal : 1 ) achieve maintain predetermine steady state concentration progesterone 90 % study patient , 2 ) confirm safety study drug , 3 ) test hypothesis administration progesterone within 6 hour TBI improve clinical neurological outcome , secondary ; determine benefit IV progesterone equally evident across range clinically relevant treatment subgroup . In process achieving goal , quantify ability identify enroll TBI patient , administer study drug within strict time restraint , adhere study protocol . To assess efficacy progesterone treatment TBI , employ systematic statistical analysis strategy . Our first analytic step compile descriptive statistic ( e.g. , mean , median , standard deviation , range , proportion ) patient demographic . This activity , directly address study hypothesis , serve describe central tendency variability outcome variable covariables . The second step compare treatment group respect suspect important covariates , specifically patient age , gender , cause type brain injury , presence absence intracranial mass lesion , presence/absence extracranial trauma , presence/absence premorbid confounders ( e.g. , alcohol intoxication , alcoholism , stroke , etc . ) , presence/absence confound neurological insult ( e.g. , hypoxemia , hypotension ) , severity TBI , time initial drug administration . This assess balance achieve randomization . The third step analyze data accord specific aim . To estimate sample size need establish efficacy , need specify effect size detect outcome measure . We human data definitively establish effect size expect result treatment . Based animal model , conservatively posit progesterone improve neurological outcome ( i.e. , dichotimized GOS , DRS , GOAT one month post-injury ) 25 % . We expect enroll 100 subject 4:1 randomization ( 80 treat 20 control ) pilot study . With respect duration coma , number patient would allow u achieve 80 % power detect difference least 0.6 standard deviation treatment group two-sided 0.05 significance level 50 treat 50 control . For outcome , difference 0.6 standard deviation unit translate difference + 1.1 day , 29 % , base finding Stambrook , et al.6 However , since change protocol 4:1 randomization , long power detect difference . Similarly , subgroup patient monitor difference ICP-TIL , original 1:1 randomization scheme would able achieve 80 % power detect difference least 1.0 standard deviation treatment group two-sided 0.05 significance level , 4:1 scheme long power detect difference . With respect mortality , pilot insufficient power ( &lt; 50 % ) definitively detect effect size equal 25 % reduction rate death . Similarly insufficient power detect `` good '' neurological outcome hospital discharge one month post-injury use dichotomize GOS ( good moderate recovery versus severe disability ) , expectation 50 % good outcome placebo group , base finding Levin , et al . However , study allow u perceive trend data well determine range prevalence outcome might anticipate multi-center study therapy . This allow u refine future power calculation appropriately . Initially , dose escalation component within progesterone group , difference level circulate progesterone subgroup minimal compare control group . Hence , progesterone treat patient assume respond similarly treatment . ( 2 ) At completion pilot phase least 100 patient randomize study . GMH 's trauma registry indicate least 145 potentially eligible TBI patient ( age â‰¥ 18 , GCS 4-12 , blunt mechanism , &lt; 11 hour injury ) come GMH study interval . Every effort make obtain informed consent proxy order administer study drug within specified time limit ( 2 hour ) . Proposed safety efficacy monitor boundary : Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) : In accordance standard procedure NIH sponsor clinical trial , DSMB chair member select NIH-NINDS . This committee inform subject 's group assignment ( A versus B ) , blind respect group receive study drug . This committee three responsibility : 1 ) monitor identification , enrollment , randomization procedure detect evidence bias ; 2 ) monitor adverse event determine occur disproportionately one group , 3 ) monitor key clinical outcome determine one group significantly well . To assist DSMB work , statistician , Vicki Hertzberg , monitor progress study monthly basis . The DSMB role day-to-day conduct trial . The study statistician report DSMB quarterly meeting . Safety Monitoring : A study nurse and/or research program coordinator round subject daily track clinical progress occurrence serious adverse event ( SAE ) adverse event ( AE ) . All SAEs report IRB , DSMB , FDA within 24 hour . All adverse event report PI , IRB , FDA weekly basis . Specific event potentially relate study drug , base prior knowledge pharmacology progesterone , combination agent include progesterone , Intralipid carrier , closely monitor study team . These event include : ) phlebitis injection site ; b ) sedation unexplained administration CNS medication ; c ) increase liver enzymes ; ) unexplained hyperglycemia ; e ) hypotension hypertension know associate increased intracranial pressure ; f ) unexplained fever ; g ) thromboembolic disease ; h ) sepsis . Baseline metabolic parameter determine initial blood draw prior study drug administration . Blood sample perform least per day drug administration monitoring . In addition , hourly vital sign measurement parameter obtain ICU chart form . Patients examine daily team member sign adverse reaction . Team member also review chart , laboratory report treat physician note daily . In addition , trauma death review interdisciplinary Trauma Outcome Review Committee ( TORC ) determine death non-preventable , potentially preventable , preventable . A member study team attend meeting . If/when TORC review death involve participant study , finding share DSMB well P.I . co-P.I . The DSMB closely monitor incidence death serious adverse event sepsis thromboembolic disease . If concern incidence event link study drug , immediately report concern National Institute Neurological Disorders Stroke ( NINDS ) , well Emory IRB . Furthermore , occurrences death ( regardless cause ) unexpected serious adverse event report Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . Efficacy : To assess efficacy drug interim basis , comparison study group respect endpoint ( mortality , duration coma , ICP-TIL , neurological status indicator one month ) time 12 , 24 , 48 patient enter trial . Comparisons interim point exceed z-score 2.782 ( associate p-value 0.0054 ) consider significant , use O'Brien-Fleming procedure . To determine one treatment group well , team 's study nurse obtain following outcome measure : 1 ) ICP-TIL , 2 ) duration coma , 3 ) in-hospital mortality , 4 ) Glasgow Outcome Score , 5 ) Disability Rating Scale , 6 ) Galveston Orientation Amnesia Test . The DSMB monitor outcomes treatment group ( A versus B ) order promptly identify between-group difference . If significant difference note , code broken finding immediately report Emory IRB , FDA , NINDS DSMB . Patient accrual plan : We enroll first 100 eligible patient two year enrollment period . Ethical consent consideration : Since study involve treatment patient acute neurological impairment , competent give inform consent . We therefore seek proxy consent patient 's family next-of-kin legally authorize representative ( LAR ) . If LAR subsequently locate object study , process halt patient 's participation terminate . Only IOCs , study coordinator , permit approach family member request consent . A write form complies police procedure Emory University 's IRB develop approve . This form include following element : title protocol , name PI , study objective purpose , detailed description procedure intervention , explanation responsibility subject family member ( ) act proxy respondent follow-up interview , foreseeable risk , anticipated benefit , available alternative , explicit statement confidentiality , non-compensation participation , right withdraw time , signature section , number contact PI member study team question . Given sudden , unanticipated nature traumatic brain injury , potential time delay involve get family member hospital , authorize IRB obtain proxy consent participation telephone . When necessary , on-call investigator contact family member , provide brief explanation situation , read consent form verbatim , request verbal consent telephone . A third party listen confirm family member understands provide proxy consent . On signature line form , witness print name consent proxy , write name immediately name , note time date telephone call , check box label `` telephone consent '' . Before recruit first patient study , undertake comprehensive process notify consult target community use GMH trauma center . The Emory University News Information office pledge support . On advice Emory Healthcare marketing , allocate $ 40,000 support marketing community outreach activity first 6 month study . Lesser amount allocate keep community inform year 2 3 . An independent interdisciplinary Safety Committee create provide additional monitoring study safety . In addition designate Safety Committee , convene independent citizen advisory committee . Two influential Atlantans agree co-chair group . One Rev . Gerald Durley , Pastor Providence Missionary Baptist Church , one Atlanta 's large African-American congregation . Rev . Durley also key member Concerned Black Clergy , local activist group . The co-chair Sandy Teepen , TBI survivor , safety advocate , wife national newspaper columnist former editorial page editor Atlanta Constitution , large circulation newspaper Southeastern United States . Progesterone use many year treat variety medical condition . Side effect ascribe use alone minimal . Minor adverse reaction include temperature elevation 1 degree Fahrenheit , mood change ( depression follow drug withdrawal ) , vaginal , cervical uterine lining change , irregular vaginal bleeding amenorrhea , hyperventilation , mild fluid retention , transient increase low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , transient decrease high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) , interference lactation breast feeding , nausea , abdominal cramping , dizziness , headache , breast pain , delay fertility . Most effect associate prolonged administration progesterone ( i.e. , week month ) . They unlikely experience short-course administration ( i.e. , 3 day ) . Throughout pilot trial , subject monitor potential side effect drug therapy ( i.e . hyperglycemia , hypertension unexplained increase ICP , unexplained fever , local phlebitis , thromboembolic disease , abnormal vaginal bleeding ) . The Safety Committee meet quarterly review group-specific clinical outcome side effect . If concerned one group significantly well ( bad ) , authority break code order premature termination trial . Participating pharmaceutical device manufacture company : None Proposed sponsor funding agency : NINDS NIH Significance Research Impact Medical Care : If therapeutic benefit observe animal replicate human , administration intravenous progesterone produce several benefit , include : ) reduction intracerebral pressure ; b ) decrease duration coma ; c ) decrease mortality ; ) improve neurological function one month post-injury . If finding verify , represent major advance treatment traumatic brain injury .</detailed_description>
