	<brief_title>Irinotecan Treating Children With Refractory Advanced Solid Tumors Who Are Receiving Anticonvulsants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine maximum tolerate dose irinotecan child refractory advance solid tumor receive anticonvulsant . - Determine dose-limiting toxicity irinotecan patient population . - Evaluate pharmacokinetic behavior treatment regimen patient . - Determine , preliminarily , antitumor activity treatment regimen patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord type concurrent anticonvulsant ( enzyme activate anticonvulsant vs valproic acid v anticonvulsant ) . Patients receive irinotecan IV 1 hour daily 5 day . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos irinotecan maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) reach . The MTD define dose precede least 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Patients follow every 6 month 4 year annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 3-25 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
