	<brief_summary>The purpose study identify gene gene responsible keloid formation . Keloids raise scar skin form minor injury . A tendency develop keloid often run family , suggest possible genetic basis . People classic ( butterfly-shaped wound-overflowing ) keloid least one year may eligible study . In addition probands ( original participant ) , family member 12 year age either classic non-classic keloid 18 year age old without keloid may participate . Probands family member keloids medical history focus skin problem particularly keloid skin examination . In case , subject permission , photo keloid take . All participant 35 milliliter ( 2 tablespoon ) blood drawn DNA ( genetic ) test measurement blood protein , include cytokine , affect tissue cause scar . Part blood sample use additional genetic study unrelated keloid . The sample cod confidentiality .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Analysis Familial Keloids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Keloids represent pathologic fibrosis occur skin trauma grow beyond boundary injury . Keloids occur people racial background ; however , individual African descent susceptible disease . A familial disposition keloid formation long recognize , genetic basis racial familial predisposition identify . We hypothesize increase risk direct result one disease susceptibility gene . We pursue two approach , present two study module . In module 1 , carry family study . We identify affected pedigree , contain least 3 individual keloid . Blood obtain Epstein Barr virus-transformed permanent B cell line establish . We anticipate take two analytic strategy . We use candidate gene analysis , focus initially CBP TGF1B gene recently identify locus chromosome 14 , use genome-wide marker identify possible disease gene locus . In module 2 , perform genome scan address hypothesis one African origin genetic variant account excess prevalence keloid among African Americans . We carry map admixture linkage disequilibrium ( MALD ) scan , order find genetic region difference distribution particular tag single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) keloid case control indicate excess African ancestry . Further analysis locus carry identify causative genetic variant .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Proband : must butterflyshaped woundoverflowing keloid , present least one year ( description represent classic keloid , avoids hypertrophic scar ) 2 . Affected family member : family member proband either classic keloid , describe , nonclassic keloid , ball shapedkeloids ear . 3 . Unaffected family member : family member lack keloid . 4 . Impaired subject legal guardian provide consent . 5 . Pregnant woman . EXCLSUION CIRTERIA : 1 . Subjects unwilling unable give inform consent assent . 2 . Impaired individual possible obtain parental consent ( minor ) guardian consent ( adult ) . 3 . Keloid patient &lt; 3 relative keoids .</criteria>
