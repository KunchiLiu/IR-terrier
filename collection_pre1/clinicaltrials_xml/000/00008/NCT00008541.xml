	<brief_summary>This study offer evaluation treatment patient certain corneal external disease eye ( diseases surface eye surround structure ) . The protocol design test new treatment ; rather , patient receive current standard care treatment . The purpose study twofold : 1 ) allow National Eye Institute physicians increase knowledge various corneal external condition identify possible new avenue research area ; 2 ) establish pool patient may eligible new study develop . ( Participants protocol require join new study ; decision voluntary . ) Children adult corneal external eye disease may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , brief physical examination , thorough eye examination blood test . The eye examination include measurement eye pressure visual acuity ( ability see vision chart ) dilation pupil examine lens retina ( back part eye ) . Patients also undergo follow procedure : 1 . Eye photography - Special photograph inside eye help evaluate status cornea conjunctiva ( superficial layer eye ) evaluate change may occur future .

	<detailed_description>This protocol permit specialist cornea external disease NEI identify , follow provide `` standard care '' treatment patient various corneal external disease anterior segment disorder . By provide long-term follow-up treatment variety corneal external disease , corneal specialist NEI well able identify research hypotheses diseases addition maintain clinical skill . Another purpose protocol accumulate cohort patient corneal disease possible participation new NEI clinical trial epidemiological protocol . The availability cohorts patient spectrum anterior segment disease valuable training fellow , important component mission NEI . The ability provide follow-up care also facilitate referral effort NEI protocol . The cornea specialist National Eye Institute free choose condition interest . However , total number patient enrol protocol restrict . This protocol design test new treatment . Any evaluation treatment protocol base current standard care appropriate relevant ocular disease . Participants evaluation treatment protocol evaluate potential eligibility NEI clinical trial epidemiologic protocol develop . If eligible , may ask participate new protocol ; however , require enter protocol decision participate entirely voluntary .</detailed_description>
