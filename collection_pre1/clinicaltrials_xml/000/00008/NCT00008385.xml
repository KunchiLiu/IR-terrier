	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Chemoprevention therapy use certain drug try prevent development recurrence cancer . It yet know selenium effective prevent growth new tumor patient previously resect non-small cell lung cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study selenium see well work compare placebo prevent development second primary lung tumor patient undergone surgery remove stage I non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Selenium Preventing Tumor Growth Patients With Previously Resected Stage I Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary Objective : - Determine efficacy selenium term reduce incidence second primary lung tumor participants previously resect stage I non-small cell lung cancer . Secondary Objectives : - Evaluate qualitative quantitative toxicity selenium patient . - Compare incidence specific cancer , mortality cancer , overall survival participant treat selenium v treat placebo . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled , multicenter study . Participants stratify accord smoking status ( actively smoke stop less 1 year ago vs. stop least 1 year ago vs. never smoke 100 cigarette ever ) , gender , stage previous therapy ( stage IA vs. stage IB previous therapy vs. stage IB previous therapy ) . Participants randomize 1:2 ratio arm I arm II . - Arm I : Participants receive oral yeast placebo arm II . - Arm II : Participants receive oral selenium yeast daily 6 month . Treatment repeat every 6 month 8 course total 4 year absence unacceptable toxicity . Participants follow annually ( every 12 month ) 10 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 1,960 participant accrue study within 4 year .</detailed_description>
