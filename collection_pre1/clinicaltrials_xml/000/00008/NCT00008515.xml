	<brief_summary>This study test safety effectiveness fluocinolone implant treat age-related macular degeneration . This eye disease severely impair central vision , affect person 's ability read , drive , carry daily activity . It lead cause vision loss people age 60 . The fluocinolone implant tiny plastic rod pellet steroid fluocinolone end . The pellet slowly dissolve release medication fluid eye . Vision loss macular degeneration cause formation new blood vessel choroid-a thin , pigment vascular layer eye behind retina . These abnormal vessel leak blood macula , part retina determine central vision . Tissue study show evidence inflammation retina patient . This study test whether slow release steroid fluocinolone directly affect part eye prevent slow vision loss . Preliminary animal human study fluocinolone implant show benefit reduce blood vessel growth improve stabilize vision . Patients 50 year age old age-related macular degeneration may eligible study . Study patient randomly assign one two treatment group . One receive 0.5-mg dose implant ; receive 2-mg dose implant . Theoretically , implant release medicine 2 3 year . Participants medical history , physical examination complete eye examination . The latter include vision test , eye pressure measurement , examination pupil , lens , retina , eye movement . Photographs eye take special camera . Patients also undergo fluorescein angiography , test take picture retina use yellow dye call sodium fluorescein . The dye inject blood stream vein . After reach blood vessel eye , photograph take retina . When test complete , patient schedule surgery place implant . The procedure do either local general anesthesia . Follow-up visit schedule 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 week surgery , 3 6 month surgery , every 6 month implant deplete medicine remove . Several exam describe repeated follow-up period evaluate treatment side effect , .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) represent common cause blindness patient age 60 . Most vision loss disease result sequelae choroidal neovascular membrane ( CNVM ) formation . CNVM usually compose well-formed neovascularization occult ( less well-formed ) neovascularization . While clinical trial show patient , mostly well-formed CNVM , may benefit laser photocoagulation photodynamic therapy , present treatment patient large component occult neovascularization . Retinal histopathology patient choroidal neovascularization demonstrate presence inflammatory reparative response . We hypothesize sustained intraocular corticosteroid may able down-regulate many cellular factor involve inflammation repair , result stabilization CNVM formation vision . We test hypothesis use randomize , prospective study . Persons eligible eye occult choroidal neovascularization randomly assign receive either 0.5 microgram/day 2 microgram/day sustained-release fluocinolone intravitreal implant . The study design provide limited safety potential efficacy data regard sustained intravitreal device . The primary outcome study implant safety determine potential , implant relate , adverse advent . These event relate surgical insertion intravitreal implant , endophthalmitis , hypotony , retinal detachment hemorrhage , related complication anesthesia , retrobulbar hemorrhage complication general anesthesia , use , related intraocular fluocinolone development glaucoma cataract formation . The primary efficacy outcome proportion patient , two year , lose two line visual acuity baseline ( best correct visual acuity improve , remain stable , deteriorate 9 letter ) . Secondary efficacy outcome measure include size predominate occult CNVM , determine fluorescein angiography , visual function , measure NEI VFQ . This study allow investigator determine potential risk patient receive intravitreal fluocinolone may provide insight potential role intravitreal placement steroid treatment predominate occult CNVM associate AMD .</detailed_description>

Following DSMC approval , visual acuity 20/60 20/400 study eye remain 10 patient . Patients must ineligibility clinically prove laser photocoagulation protocol . Patients must presence choroidal neovascularization fovea define one follow stereoscopic fuorescein angiogram ( SFA ) feature ( determined Reading Center ) : ) Early stipple hyperfluorescence flat retinal pigment epithelium illdefined boundary little mild leakage late frame fluorescein ; b ) Irregular elevation retinal pigment epithelium exhibit discrete bright hyperfluorescence early transit phase angiogram . Stippled hyperfluorescence may present . Late frame may show persistent fluorescein stain leakage within sensory retinal detachment overlie area ; c ) Early welldefined lacy hyperfluorescence late frame show persistent fluorescein stain leakage ; ) The area late leakage stain must involve least 1 standard disc area ( 1.77 mm ( 2 ) ) exceed 16 standard disc area fovea ; e ) The area hyperfluorescence determine read center welldefined CNVM must less 50 percent total area early late hyperfluorescence identify read center total area CVNM . Patients must ability obtain retinal photograph angiography sufficient quality macular area assess accord standard clinical practice . Patients must great equal 50 year age . No prior retinal detachment surgery history retinal detachment either eye .
