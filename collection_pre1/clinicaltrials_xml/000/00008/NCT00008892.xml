	<brief_summary>The purpose study use brain image technology study connection brain region child attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( AD/HD ) , compare child without AD/HD . This study build upon previous brain image study healthy volunteer child AD/HD . This study use diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging ( DT-MRI ) visualize measure certain part brain identical twin pair one twin AD/HD , combine type . Participants study screen questionnaire interview , psychometric testing , physical examination . Participants ' medical educational record may review . Participants undergo MRI scan brain . Prior MRI , participant train session simulate MRI scanner learn lie still MRI scan . Participants may ask return follow-up scan 2 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) common childhood psychiatric disorder , present 3 10 % child United States ( Wender et al 2001 ) . It think reflect subtle anomaly central nervous system thus structural neuroimaging use extensively delineate neurobiology disorder . Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrate structural anomaly ADHD , affect major lobe particularly severe volume reduction cerebellum relative preservation caudate nucleus ( review see Durston 2003 ) . In structural neuroimaging work , study monozygotic twin discordant disorder prove particularly powerful tool , finding significantly small caudate nucleus affect twin compare unaffected , genetically identical , twin ( Castellanos et al 2003 ) . We previously report overall reduction white matter volume four major brain lobe , deficit appear fix non-progressive . However , recent advance neuroimaging white matter make feasible examination white matter characteristic , degree myelination coherence white matter tract . The propose project build anatomic magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) study perform 1.5-Tesla scanner child Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) normal control . We propose use diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging ( DT-MRI ) conventional T ( 1 ) - T ( 2 ) -weighted image 3-Tesla visualize quantify white matter tract brain normal monozygotic ( MZ ) twin , MZ twin concordant ADHD , MZ twin discordant ADHD . Ages range 6 21 year . Our principal focus development possible abnormality white matter tract link prefrontal-striatal-thalamic circuit hypothesize disruption tract affect twin relative healthy co-twins . We also explore usefulness technique delineate white matter cerebellar circuit characterize normal development white matter age 6 21 use single healthy twin per family .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : PILOT SUBJECTS : Subjects pilot data collection initially 10 unscreened adult volunteer previously study 1.5Tesla Signa scanner . Subjects require provide informed consent , medical exclusion note consent form , particularly metallic object and/or pregnancy . Once procedure optimize , 10 pediatric subject study . These pilot subject derive normal control pool subject previously study 1.5Tesla Signa scanner . Informed consent sign assent require , exclusion . MONOZYGOTIC TWINS : Subjects must monozygotic twin ( MZ ) confirm twinsimilarity questionnaire molecular cheek swab test polymerase chain reaction short tandem repeat multiplex loci set find difference DNA type two cotwins . The primary test set include nine fourteen unlinked locus combine matching probability sibling p less .0001 . Cases yield probability twinship le 0.99 test total 21 locus . Subjects may also request participate associate genetic protocol ( 96M0060 ) . ADHD PROBANDS : Monozygotic twin . Aged 6 21 year . DSMIV diagnosis ADHD ( inattentive , hyperactiveimpulsive combine type ) . Age adjust dimensional rating ( Conners Rating ScalesRevised , Strengths Weaknesses ADHD Normal Behavior ( SWAN ) ) hyperactivity/impulsivity great equal 95th percentile affect twin . Consent assent obtain write . NORMAL PEDIATRIC VOLUNTEERS : Except pilot subject ( 10 subject ) , must monozygotic twin . Same agerange probands . Parent teacher rating within one SD population mean ADHD/hyperactivity factor . Consent assent obtain write . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : ADHD PROBANDS : Presence psychiatric disorder produce symptom similar ADHD ( e.g. , major depression , bipolar disorder , severe anxiety disorder , pervasive developmental disorder , psychotic disorder , posttraumatic stress disorder ) . Presence neuropsychiatric condition may confound evaluation ADHD ( e.g. , Tourette 's syndrome , obsessivecompulsive disorder , PANDAS ( pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associate streptococcus ) . Presence metal object , pregnancy , inability provide specimen urine blood rule pregnancy females age 12 . Presence alcohol and/or substance abuse . NORMAL PEDIATRIC VOLUNTEERS : Presence psychiatric disorder structure psychiatric interview ( DICAIV ) . Presence known genetic condition . Presence history medical condition . Presence metal object , pregnancy , inability provide specimen rule pregnancy female age 12 . Presence alcohol and/or substance abuse .</criteria>
