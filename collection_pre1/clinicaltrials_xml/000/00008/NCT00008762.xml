	<brief_summary>People cystic fibrosis ( CF ) frequently live adulthood extended life expectancy come new clinical problem . Poor bone health , include osteoporosis bone fracture , one increasingly important condition . Preventing negative outcome poor bone health later life primarily relate ensure optimal growth ( weight height ) obtain maximal amount bone mass growth development . This study identify factor influence bone health sample child , adolescent young adult measure dual energy x-ray absorptiometry new bone densitometry method ( peripheral quantitative computerize tomography [ p-QCT ] bone sonometer ) . We also identify factor influence change bone status 12-month follow-up period subsample people CF .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A total 100 subject CF pancreatic insufficiency ( 8-25 , half female ) recruit Children 's Hospital Philadelphia ( CHOP ) Delaware Valley region . All subject baseline measurement obtain Nutrition Growth Lab CHOP . A subset subject return 12-month follow-up measurement . We evaluate influence bone health , include : gender , stage pubertal development , body weight height , food intake ( especially calcium vitamin D ) , use steroid medication mouth , IV administration inhalation , physical activity lung health . We also follow change bone health growth 12 month , see factor associate good poor bone development . In addition , information study important planning future trial medication intervention treat , hopefully , prevent poor bone health people CF .</detailed_description>
