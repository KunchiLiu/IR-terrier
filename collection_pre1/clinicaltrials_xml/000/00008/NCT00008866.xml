	<brief_summary>The purpose study find whether addition hydroxyurea didanosine ( ddI ) anti-HIV medication result good control HIV infection . The Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve ddI treat HIV infection . Hydroxyurea approve treat cancer blood disorder . It work HIV-1 combined ddI .

	<brief_title>Effectiveness Early Delayed Addition Hydroxyurea Three-Drug Anti-HIV Drug Combination Including Didanosine , Advanced HIV Patients Who Failed First Second Anti-HIV Triple-Drug Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increasing frequency treatment failure potent antiretroviral therapy accelerate need new class agent . Hydroxyurea , agent broadly use antineoplastic property , show inhibit HIV-1 vitro vivo combine nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor didanosine ( ddI ) . There urgent need prospectively test safety , tolerability , efficacy hydroxyurea late-stage , treatment-experienced patient . Patients undergo genotypic analysis registration Step 1 . Genotypic antiretroviral resistance test ( GART ) along patient 's antiretroviral drug history use select optimal antiretroviral drug regimen ( non-study drug ) patient . Patients willing initiate GART-based regimen randomize Week 5 Step 2 . They stratify , first level ddI resistance , within stratum CD4+ T cell count , assign 1 3 treatment arm start study drug ( ddI hydroxyurea ) non-study antiretroviral drug day randomization . Patients Arm A receive ddI hydroxyurea placebo ; Arm B , ddI hydroxyurea placebo replace hydroxyurea 8 week ; Arm C , ddI hydroxyurea . Patients receive treatment 48 week . Patients check regularly immunologic , virologic , metabolic parameter . Patients may elect participate substudy A5070s , explore effect study treatment T cell population immunologic evaluation .</detailed_description>
