	<brief_summary>The purpose study see treatment PEG-interferon-alfa-2a ( PEG-IFN ) plus ribavirin effective treatment hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) interferon-alfa-2a ( IFN ) plus ribavirin patient infect HCV HIV . The study also compare 2 regimen see few side effect . HCV infection common patient infected HIV . Patients infected HIV HCV viruses seem severe hepatitis C. A combination IFN ribavirin show lessen severity HCV . PEG-IFN modify form IFN stay blood longer , mean patient would take treatment often . This study compare safety effectiveness PEG-IFN IFN combine ribavirin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Effectiveness , Safety , Tolerability Two Different Hepatitis C Treatments Patients Infected With Both HIV Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infection HCV common patient infected HIV owe similar route transmission . The cellular immunosuppression cause HIV infection appear lead increase HCV plasma load , progressive liver disease , , patient chronic hepatitis C , increase mortality . Ribavirin treatment combine IFN show improved sustain virologic response rate IFN monotherapy . PEG-IFN , chemically modify formulation IFN , circulate much long time blood parent compound . Pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic data suggest PEG-IFN injected weekly would potential superior efficacy compare IFN inject 3 time per week . The efficacy safety profile combination therapy PEG-IFN ribavirin well know . This study compare combination therapy consist PEG-IFN ribavirin IFN ribavirin . Patients stratify accord HCV genotype CD4 count viral load , randomize either Arm A ( IFN plus ribavirin ) Arm B ( PEG-IFN plus ribavirin ) . Patients receive 48 week treatment . Virologic response assess Week 24 decision continue discontinue treatment make . If virologic response show Week 24 , patient continue treatment additional 24 week . If virologic response observe , histologic response assess liver biopsy . If biopsy show histologic response present , treatment continue 24 week . If biopsy show histologic response , treatment discontinue . [ AS PER AMENDMENT 07/20/01 : Patients virologic response discontinue Week 24 liver biopsy time discontinuation . Patients virologic response continue study treatment liver biopsy within 2 week Week 24 , also demonstrate histologic response decide discontinue Week 24 , strongly encourage 2nd liver biopsy end treatment . Patients virologic response discontinue Week 24 liver biopsy time discontinuation . ] Physical examination do regularly blood sample collect routine laboratory test , confidential genetic testing , measure HCV HIV-1 plasma viral load . Women able become pregnant regular pregnancy test . All patient follow additional 24 week treatment discontinuation . Patients may enroll 1 none follow substudies : A5091s , Hepatic C Viral Kinetics Subjects Co-infected Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 ( HIV-1 ) Hepatitis C Virus Genotype 1 ( HCV-1 ) ; [ AS PER AMENDMENT 07/20/01 : The follow text delete : A5092s , Evaluation Effects Ribavirin Zidovudine ( ZDV ) Stavudine ( d4T ) Triphosphate Formation ] [ AS PER AMENDMENT 07/20/01 : Substudy A5092s , Evaluation Effects Ribavirin Zidovudine ( ZDV ) Stavudine ( d4T ) Triphosphate Formation stand-alone study . ]</detailed_description>
