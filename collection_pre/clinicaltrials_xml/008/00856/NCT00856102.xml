	<brief_summary>The objective of the proposed research is to determine the efficacy of a home-based walking exercise program in promoting cognitive-psychosocial functions of men with prostate cancer receiving androgen depletion therapy (ADT). ADT is the mainstay treatment for men with advanced prostate cancer. However, ADT has a number of side effects including compromised cognitive function, depression and anxiety, which negatively impacts the quality of life of men with prostate cancer. The central question of the proposed research is to determine if exercise will have a positive impact on the quality of life of men with prostate cancer undergoing ADT. Hypothesis:</brief_summary>
