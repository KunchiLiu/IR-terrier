	<brief_title>Phase I Safety Study of DMXAA in Refractory Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a multi-centre randomized, double blind study to further characterize the effect of DMXAA on QTc interval, ophthalmic safety and pharmacodynamic effects on tumour blood flow. Patients with refractory tumors were to each undergo six doses of treatment at weekly intervals, receiving each of six doses of DMXAA (300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400 and 3000 mg/m2)</detailed_description>

Patients with severe electrolyte abnormalities and patients in whom transient electrolyte abnormalities may have been expected during any visit of the study 14. Patients in whom concomitant neurotropic drug therapy was known to change or was likely to change during the course of the study, where such therapy was likely to affect the patients ERG measurement 15. Ophthalmic conditions where in the opinion of the investigator they might affect the recording of the ERG</criteria>
