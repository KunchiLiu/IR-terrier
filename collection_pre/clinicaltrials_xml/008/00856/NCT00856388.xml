	<brief_summary>This clinical trial is studying how well giving fludarabine phosphate and melphalan together with total-body irradiation followed by donor stem cell transplant works in treating patients with hematologic cancer or bone marrow failure disorders. Giving low doses of chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells or abnormal cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer or abnormal cells (graft-versus-tumor effect)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fludarabine Phosphate, Melphalan, Total-Body Irradiation, Donor Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Hematologic Cancer or Bone Marrow Failure Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the transplant related mortality (TRM) of this reduced intensity transplantation (RIT) combination in a patient population that is usually not eligible for a full myeloablative allogeneic transplant. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate engraftment, safety, clinical response, evidence of graft-versus-malignancy effect/graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and overall outcomes of treatment with our RIT regimen across a variety of hematological conditions. OUTLINE: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days -5 to -2 and melphalan* IV over 30 minutes on day -2. Patients then undergo total-body irradiation on day -1 and allogeneic stem cell transplantation on day 0. Note: *Patients with chromosomal breakage syndromes, such as Fanconi anemia or dyskeratosis congenita, receive anti-thymocyte globulin IV over 4 hours on day -4 to -2 instead of melphalan. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of a histology documented hematologic malignancy or marrow disorder Bone marrow failure disorders and other nonmalignant hematologic or immunologic disorders: Acquired bone marrow failure disorders include aplastic anemia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH): Primary allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is appropriate for selected patients with severe aplastic anemia; however, patients with aplastic anemia must have failed at least one cycle of standard immunosuppressive therapy with calcineurin inhibitor plus antithymocyte globulin (ATG) if a fullymatched donor is not available Patients with PNH must have a history of thrombosis related to PNH Hereditary bone marrow failure disorders include Fanconi anemia or related chromosomal breakage syndrome dyskeratosis congenita, DiamondBlackfan anemia, ShwachmanDiamond syndrome, Kostmann syndrome, congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia: Fanconi anemia or related chromosomal breakage syndrome: positive chromosome breakage analysis using diepoxybutane (DEB) or mitomycin C if applicable Dyskeratosis: diagnosis is supported by using either telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERC) gene mutation in autosomal dominant Dyskeratosis Congenita or Xlinked DKC1 gene mutation Other nonmalignant hematologic or immunologic disorders that require transplantation Quantitative or qualitative congenital platelet disorders (including but not limited to congenital amegakaryocytopenia, absentradii syndrome, Glanzmann's thrombasthenia) Quantitative or qualitative congenital neutrophil disorders (including but not limited to chronic granulomatous disease, congenital neutropenia) Congenital primary immunodeficiencies (including but not limited to Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Syndrome, WiskottAldrick syndrome, CD40 ligand deficiency, Tcell deficiencies) Acute leukemias: Subjects must be ineligible for conventional myeloablative transplantation; Resistant or recurrent disease after at least one standard combination chemotherapy regime or first remission patients at high risk of relapse OR First remission patients at high risk of relapse: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) antecedent myelodysplastic syndrome, secondary AML, high risk cytogenetic abnormalities or normal cytogenetics with highrisk molecular features (e.g. Flt3ITD mutation, mixedlineage leukemia [MLL], wildtype NPM1); Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) high or standard risk ALL Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML): Chronic phase (intolerant or unresponsive to imatinib and/or other tyrosine kinase inhibitors), second chronic phase or accelerated phase who are ineligible for conventional myeloablative transplantation Myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS): Myelofibrosis (with/without splenectomy) with intermediate to high risk features Advanced polycythemia vera not responding to standard therapy MDS with an international prostate symptom score (IPSS) score of Int2 or higher MDS with lower IPSS scores Int1 or less with severe clinical features such as severe neutropenia or thrombocytopenia or high risk chromosome abnormalities such as monosomy 7 Secondary massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) with any IPSS scores Chronic myelomoncytic leukemia Lymphoproliferative disease: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), lowgrade nonHodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (recurrent or persistent) fludarabine refractory or with less than 6 months duration of complete response (CR) between courses of conventional therapy Multiple myeloma, progressive disease after autologous stem cell transplant or as planned tandem (allogeneic transplant after prior autologous stem cell transplant) Waldenstroms macroglobulinemia (failed one standard regimen) High grade NHL and diffuse large Bcell lymphoma (DLBCL) Not eligible for conventional myeloablative HSCT OR failed autologous HSCT First remission lymphoblastic lymphoma, or small, noncleaved cell lymphoma or mantle cell lymphoma Hodgkin disease: Relapsed or refractory after frontline therapy Failed or were not eligible for autologous transplantation Failed prior autotransplant Age &gt;= 3 and =&lt; 75 years for blood and bone marrow transplants and age &gt;= 3, &lt; 60 for cord blood transplants No serious uncontrolled psychiatric illness No concomitant active malignancy other than nonmelanoma skin cancer Nonpregnant and nonnursing women (women or men with reproductive potential should agree to use an effective means of birth control) Patients may have received prior autologous bone marrow transplant (BMT) or prior myeloablative allogeneic BMT (at least 60 days have elapsed) At least 2 weeks since prior chemotherapy, radiation treatment and/or surgery Informed consent DONOR: Permissible HLA matching: Related donors single antigen mismatch at HLA A, B or DRB 1; unrelated donors a single antigen mismatch at HLA A, B, or C, +/ additional single allele level mismatch at A, B, C or DRB1; cord blood &gt;= 4 out of 6 antigen match at HLA A, B, DRB1) DONOR: Compatibility at the four most informative HLA loci: A, B, C and DRB1 are important for reducing the risk of GVHD and successful transplant outcomes; the A, B, C and DRB1 loci comprise 8 possible alleles (a haplotype being inherited from each parent); one additional locus, HLADQ, is also typed to ascertain haplotypes and assist in the search for a compatible donor; however mismatching at DQ has not been shown to be associated with adverse outcomes; high resolution molecular typing (at the allele level) is now the standard of care for unrelated donor searches and allows greater refinement of the search strategy DONOR: Matched related donor: a single antigen mismatch at A, B, or the DR transplant from a family member is associated with a higher risk of GVHD but similar overall survival when compared to full identity at these 3 regions; related donor/recipient pairs must be matched at 5 of 6 HLA antigens (A, B, DRBl) DONOR: Unrelated donor: when evaluating patients for unrelated donor transplant, a higher degree of matching is preferred due to minimize the risk of GVHD; the A, B, C, DRB1 and DQ loci, comprising 10 possible alleles, will be typed routinely for all unrelated transplants; given the higher risk of TRM in mismatched transplants, RIT is often the best way to mitigate the risk; evolving data from the National Marrow Donor Program now makes it possible to estimate the risks of donorrecipient HLA mismatch at the allele or antigen level; the higher risk from HLAmismatching must be carefully assessed with respect to the clinical urgency and the patient's risk by the transplant physician; antigen level mismatches at DQ are inconsequential to transplant outcomes and are ignored with respect to donor selection for the purposes of this protocol, with matching requirements confined to the 8 loci involving HLA A, B, C and DRB1; for the purpose of this protocol, a single antigen mismatch at HLA A, B, or C, with or without additional single allele level mismatch may participate in this protocol for voluntary unrelated donors (blood or marrow); patients must be at least antigenlevel matched at DRB1 DONOR: If a patient has no suitable family donor matched for 5 of 6 HLA antigens (A, B, DRB1) and no suitable unrelated donor is identified or for reasons of urgency, the patient can be considered a candidate for cord blood transplant, provided a cord blood donor is identified with a &gt;= 4 out of 6 antigen match at HLA A, B, DRB1 antigens; the cord blood product must provide a minimum of 2 x 10^7 nucleated cells/kg, test negative for HIV and Hepatitis A, Band C, and sterility assays have no growth; the cord blood products are located through the National Marrow Donor Program, the American Registry, or the Bone Marrow Donor Worldwide or other established registries, and may be stored in the N.Y Placental Cord Blood Bank, the St. Louis Cord Blood Bank, or any of the established, registered International blood and marrow banks DONOR: Donor must be healthy and have nonreactive test results for all infectious disease assays as required by state and federal regulations; donors who screen seropositive for hepatitis and/or syphilis must be cleared by infectious disease consultation DONOR: The donor must have no uncontrolled cardiopulmonary, renal, endocrine, hepatic or psychiatric disease to render donation unsafe DONOR: The donor must be able to give informed consent for peripheral blood stem cell collection or bone marrow collection DONOR: Syngeneic donors are not eligible DONOR: Donors who have poor peripheral venous access, may require central venous line placement for stem cell apheresis Uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) disease (for hematologic malignancies) Karnofsky (adult) or Lansky (for =&lt;
