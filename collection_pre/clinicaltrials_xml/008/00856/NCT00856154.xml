	<brief_summary>Phase I test of concept study: In an attempt to induce new immunity to HIV-1 during untreated HIV-1 infection the investigators have identified relatively immune silent immune subdominant HLA-A2-restricted HIV-1 CTL epitopes that fit individuals with the HLA-A2 tissue type (about 50% of peoples in Denmark). Immunising with these conserved epitopes could induce new immunity and lower viral load so the patient will live longer before AIDS or Antiviral medicine and a lower viral load will limit spread in the population. As adjuvants the investigators used patients' own autologous Dendritic Cells generated from blood cells in vitro. 12 healthy male HIV-1 infected not in therapy individuals were used for this therapeutic vaccination and tested for safety and induction of new cellular CD8 and CD4 T-cell immunity.</brief_summary>
