	<brief_summary>The AAAS gene has been known to cause achalasia, alacrima, adrenal abnormalities and a progressive neurological syndrome. A considerable proportion of achalasia patients have been known to show alacrima (decreased secretion of tears). However, the genetic mechanism between achalasia and alacrima has not been defined yet. The investigators postulated that some proportions of early-onset achalasia could be correlated with AAAS gene; thus, the investigators aimed to investigate the relationship between the AAAS gene and early-onset achalasia.</brief_summary>
