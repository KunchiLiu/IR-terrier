	<brief_summary>In this modern era, surgeons prefer to perform emulsification through small micro incisions. To accomplish this safely, surgeons raise irrigation bottle heights or use forced infusion systems.We believe that this sustained rise in the IOP during micro-incision phacoemulsification for a substantial period could be detrimental to the ocular structures. Therefore, intra-operative IOP pertaining to micro-incision cataract surgery is an emerging concern. Conventional systems for measuring IOP generate an isolated graph of continuous pressure recording. Interpretation of the IOP fluctuations from these graphs requires a two step superimposition approach to characterize the IOP changes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim of the present study was to describe a new setup for intra-operative monitoring of IOP in a clinical setting and validate it by correlating IOP differences arising with different phacoemulsification parameters in eyes undergoing microincision coaxial phacoemulsification.</detailed_description>
