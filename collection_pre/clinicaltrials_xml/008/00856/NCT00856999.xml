	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if consistent treatment with Botox will lead to longer lasting effects. Botox is an injectable liquid that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to reduce wrinkles on the forehead in the area between the eyebrows. In this study a different dosing schedule of Botox injections will be used to see if the effects of the Botox treatment last longer than the effects of the standard injection regimen.</brief_summary>
