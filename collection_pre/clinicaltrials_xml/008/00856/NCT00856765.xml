	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that patients with Acute ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction may benefit from primary angioplasty with use of a drug eluting balloon/bare metal stent combination without impairing the process of normal vascular healing and endothelial function. The goals of this study are: 1. To compare 6-month angiographic outcome after primary angioplasty using drug eluting balloon/bare metal stent combination versus drug eluting stent versus bare metal stent. 2. To compare stent apposition and stent endothelialization after primary angioplasty using drug eluting balloon/bare metal stent versus drug eluting stent versus bare metal stent. 3. To compare coronary endothelial function after primary angioplasty using drug eluting balloon/bare metal stent versus drug eluting stent versus bare metal stent.</brief_summary>
