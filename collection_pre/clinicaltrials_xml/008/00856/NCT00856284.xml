	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Alogliptin Plus Metformin Compared to Glipizide Plus Metformin in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus, metformin is the usual first-line therapy in addition to diet control and exercise. For those patients with inadequate glycemic control with metformin monotherapy or experiencing serious side effects of metformin, sulfonylurea is a popular choice as a second-line oral antidiabetic treatment. Alogliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor currently being developed by Takeda for use in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study is designed to further explore the durability of efficacy and safety of alogliptin compared to glipizide in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients whose blood sugar level is inadequately controlled with metformin therapy. The duration of this study will be approximately 2 years.</detailed_description>
