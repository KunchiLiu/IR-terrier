	<brief_summary>Literature suggests that route of feeding and/or certain nutrients may cause alterations in the body's immune cells. Immune cells help protect the body and fight infection/disease. Tube feeding (TF) is a method of delivering nutrition directly to the stomach/intestines via a small tube. The immune system may respond differently when receiving continuous TF as compared to receiving intermittent TF. Heart rate variability (HRV, the intervals between heartbeats) is a measurement of the nervous system's response to a stress/illness. The differences in immune cells and/or HRV may influence how the body reacts to complications such as infection.</brief_summary>
