	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the penetration through the blood-brain-barrier of trospium chloride at plasma steady state (Day 10) in elderly subjects with overactive bladder symptoms. Trospium levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peak and trough plasma levels will be measured. Baseline and day 10 post-dose neurocognitive testing will be compared using a reliable change index to assess if any study subject shows evidence of a clinically and statistically significant change in memory.</brief_summary>
