	<criteria>The inclusion criteria are set by at least one of the three following risk factors: 1. Coronary artery disease documented by at least one of the following: Myocardial infarction at least 12 months before enrollment and not planned for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) Angina pectoris or asymptomatic myocardial ischemia undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) at least 12 months before enrollment and not planned for further percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 2. Peripheral arterial disease undergoing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) or peripheral artery bypass grafting at least 6 months before enrollment 3. Symptomatic cerebral infarction or cerebral hemorrhage at least 6 months before enrollment The exclusion criteria are set as follows: 1.
