	<brief_summary>Purpose: To determine whether implantation of an intraocular lens (IOL) with a modified anterior and posterior aspherical surface (Akreos AO, Bausch &amp; Lomb,Inc) results in reduced ocular aberrations (spherical aberration) and in improved contrast sensitivity after cataract surgery. Study hypothesis: the implantation of an intraocular lens (IOL) with a modified anterior and posterior aspherical surface (Akreos AO, Bausch &amp; Lomb,Inc) results in reduced ocular aberrations (spherical aberration) and improved contrast sensitivity after cataract surgery. Setting: Department of ophthalmology, Hospital das Clínicas, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. Overall Study design: This will be an intraindividual randomized double-blinded prospective study. Patients will be randomized to receive an aspheric IOL Akreos AO in one eye (25 eyes; Bausch &amp; Lomb, Inc), and an spheric IOL Akreos Fit (25 eyes; Bausch &amp; Lomb, Inc.) in the fellow eye. Ocular aberrations with a 5.0 mm and 6.0 mm pupil will be measured with a dynamic retinoscopy aberrometer after 1 and 3 months. Uncorrected and best-corrected visual acuity, out-focus performance and contrast sensitivity under mesopic and photopic conditions will be also measured. All patients will be followed for 3 months.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients with bilateral visually significant cataract with corneal astigmatism lower than 2.0D (diopters) will be eligible for inclusion in the study. Exclusion criteria will be any ocular diseases, such as corneal opacities or irregularity, dry eye, amblyopia, anisometropia, glaucoma, retinal abnormalities, surgical complications, IOL tilt, IOL decentration greater than 0.4 mm (estimated by retroillumination), or incomplete follow-up. Patients will be examined before surgery and at 1, 7, 30, 90 days after surgery.</detailed_description>
