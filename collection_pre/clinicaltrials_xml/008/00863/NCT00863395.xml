	<brief_title>Recalcitrant Pruritus in Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Little is known about the fundamental cause of pruritus in CTCL, however we do know the malignant CD4+ T-cells of CTCL accumulate in the epidermis and are in close proximity to the neural, immune and vascular systems that influence and regulate the biology of the skin. The close proximity of malignant CD4+ T-cells with the key mediators in the itch process could result in the pruritus experienced by patients with CTCL. To accomplish this we are collecting and examining skin biopsies for CTCL patients and healthy controls to identify itch-associated local biomarkers of the disease. In addition to these skin biopsies, we are retrospectively examining existing paraffin-embedded skin biopsy tissue blocks from CTCL patients. We are performing comparative and quantitative immunohistochemical analyses on the samples. This study will help to determine which components in the skin are potential key players in the manifestation and maintenance of recalcitrant pruritus in patients with CTCL.</detailed_description>
