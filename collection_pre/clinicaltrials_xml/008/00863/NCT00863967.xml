	<brief_summary>Arteriosclerosis is a common chronic disease with well known risk factors like diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, adipositas and smoking, leading to severe complications like myocardial infarction, stroke or peripheral arterial occlusive disease. In addition to life-style factors there is also a genetic predisposition to develop complicated atherosclerosis. Objective: Improve individual risk prediction by clinical phenotyping and genotyping.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>About 300 patients who are treated for various conditions at the department of general medicine at our hospital will be included prospectively in the study. This observational cohort will be followed for at least 10 years follow-up examinations. At baseline and during follow up visits detailed clinical phenotyping is planned (medical and family history,standardized clinical and physical examinations, lab, RX, ECG, stress-test or echocardiogram). The genotyping is performed by DNA-isolation from leucocytes collected at baseline.</detailed_description>
