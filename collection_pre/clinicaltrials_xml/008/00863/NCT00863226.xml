	<brief_title>Study of the Application of Magnetic Fields for the Treatment of Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial will evaluate a new non-invasive, non-significant risk, device therapy as an adjuvant symptomatic treatment for some of the signs and or symptoms of Parkinson's Disease (PD). The device utilizes patented technology involving extremely low level electromagnetic fields.</detailed_description>
