	<brief_summary>There are no treatments specifically approved after recurrence or progression on a non steroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAI). In light of the need for new treatment options for postmenopausal women after failure of prior NSAI therapy, the purpose of this Phase III study is to compare efficacy and safety of a treatment with exemestane + everolimus to exemestane + placebo in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer refractory to NSAI.</brief_summary>
