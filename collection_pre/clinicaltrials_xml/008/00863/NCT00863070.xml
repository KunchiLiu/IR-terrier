	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients who have undergone exstrophy closure may be at risk for long-term orthopedic issues manifest by gait abnormalities. This study is a descriptive analysis of the study cohort's gait patterns and pelvic structure. Specific Aim 1: to determine whether patients with classic bladder exstrophy who underwent closure demonstrate gait abnormalities. Hypothesis 1: Patients undergoing closure of bladder exstrophy (with or without pelvic osteotomy) demonstrate gait abnormalities compared with a reference population. Hypothesis 2: Patients undergoing closure of bladder exstrophy (with or without pelvic osteotomy) will have below normal functional survey scores.</brief_summary>
