	<brief_summary>35% of Acute Alcoholic Hepatitis patients (AAH) do not respond to corticoids and died after 6 months. Chronic alcohol abuse depletes glutathione in the hepatocytes and makes the latter more sensitive to excessive TNFα levels. Re-establishment of a stock of antioxidants by administration of a precursor (N-acetyl cysteine, NAC) in combination with corticoids (C) could make the hepatocytes more resistant and improve survival. The investigators' study's primary endpoint was improvement of survival at 6 months. The secondary endpoints were survival at 1 and 3 months, tolerance of NAC and a drop in blood bilirubin levels at D7</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>AAH patients (Maddrey score &gt; 32 and compatible histological results) should centrally randomized into the C-NAC or C groups. Both groups received 4 weeks of prednisolone treatment, plus NAC for the combination therapy group (D1: 150, 50 and 100 mg/kg in 250, 500 and 1000 mL of 5% glucose-saline (G5%) respectively, at t=30 minutes, 4 and 16 hours; D2 to D5, 100 mg/kg in 1000 mL of G5%). Group C received 1000 mL of G5%, D1-5</detailed_description>
