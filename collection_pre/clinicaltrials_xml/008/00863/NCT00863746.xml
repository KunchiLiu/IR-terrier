	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to see if sorafenib plus best supportive care (i.e. in addition to the non-cancer treatments patients would normally receive) is an effective treatment for lung cancer compared to best supportive care alone. The safety and tolerability of the two treatment groups will also be compared. The goal of the study is to test the ability of sorafenib to improve survival compared to best supportive care alone.</brief_summary>
