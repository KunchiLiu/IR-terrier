	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study was to assess in subjects with chronic hepatitis C (treatment-naïve, genotype 1) receiving weight-based doses of ribavirin the virologic response to 3 dose levels of Locteron™, dosed every 2 weeks, in comparison with PEG-Intron™ dosed weekly.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2B Dose Ranging Study of Locteron Plus Ribavirin to Treat HCV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of SELECT-2 study was to compare the safety and efficacy of Locteron to PegIntron. SELECT-2 was a 72-week Phase 2b, multicenter, international trial of treatment-naïve genotype-1 chronic HCV subjects who were randomized 1:1:1:1 and dosed with one of three doses [640ug (n=29), 480ug (n=29), 320ug (n=28)] of q2week Locteron or weekly doses of 1.5ug/kg PEG2b (n=30). Subjects received these regimens in combination with weight-based ribavirin (800-1400 mg) for up to 48 weeks. Subjects and staff were blinded to Locteron dose for the first 12 weeks. Subjects without early virologic response by 12 weeks, and without viral negativity by 24 weeks, discontinued treatment for lack of efficacy. Adverse events including flu symptoms and depression, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Short Form-36, HCV RNA and safety labs were measured at standard intervals at clinic visits through Week 72. In addition, daily subject self-reports of flu symptoms using an electronic subject reporting tool (ePRO) were collected for the first 12 weeks.</detailed_description>

Prior antiviral treatment for hepatitis C Coinfection with HIV or hepatitis B virus Subjects with a body mass index (BMI) above 32 kg/m2 Current or prior history of clinical hepatic decompensation Evidence of HCC Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus as evidenced by HbA1C ≥ 8.5% at screening Known hypersensitivity to interferon alfa or ribavirin Chronic liver disease other than HCV not limited to HBV, hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease) Clinically significant hemoglobinopathy such as thalassemia major and sickle cell anemia History of moderate, severe or uncontrolled psychiatric disease including depression and prior suicide attempts History of immunemediated disease Significant renal or neurological disease Severe degree (&gt; GOLD stage III) of chronic pulmonary disease (COPD) or active, severe asthma Subjects with severe cardiac disease (e.g., heart failure, recent [i.e., within 6 months prior to first dosing] myocardial infarction, angina, serious arrhythmias, including prolonged QTc [&gt; 450 mSec], uncontrolled hypertension) History of significant central nervous system (including CNS trauma) or seizure disorders Cancer within the last 5 years, or previous cancer with a high risk of recurrence, including metastatic breast cancer; nonmelanoma skin cancer is not an exclusion criterion History of solid organ or bone marrow transplantation Clinical or laboratory evidence of uncontrolled thyroid disease, e.g., by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level &gt; 1.2 X upper limit of normal Clinically significant retinopathy; this needs to have been excluded by an eye exam performed by an ophthalmologist within the last 6 months prior to screening for subjects with hypertension or diabetes mellitus Drug abuse or alcohol consumption within the last 6 months which, in the opinion of the investigator, may affect study participation or outcome.
