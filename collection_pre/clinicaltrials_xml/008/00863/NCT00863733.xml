	<brief_title>Study of DMXAA (Now Known as ASA404) in Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a dose escalation study conducted at a single center in New Zealand. Patients received dimethylxanthenone acetic acid (DMXAA) IV over 20 minutes once every three weeks, up to a maximum of 12 courses. Cohorts of 3 patients received escalated doses of DMXAA until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients had solid tumors for which there was no standard therapy or were refractory to conventional therapy.</detailed_description>
