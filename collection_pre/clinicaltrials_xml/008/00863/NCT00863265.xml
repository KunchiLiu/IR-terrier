	<brief_summary>Phytosterols and ezetimibe each reduce intestinal cholesterol absorption by 30-55% but appear to have different mechanisms of action. The investigators hypothesis is that phytosterols and ezetimibe given together will block cholesterol absorption nearly completely. The investigators will perform a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover feeding study in 25 subjects with greater than ideal levels of LDL cholesterol who do not require anti-cholesterol drug treatment. Subjects will consume a baseline diet provided by a feeding center that is deficient in phytosterols for three periods of 21 days in random order. During period I placebo phytosterols and placebo ezetimibe will be given; during period II placebo phytosterols and active ezetimibe will be given; during period III active phytosterols and active ezetimibe will be given. Study endpoints are fecal cholesterol excretion and percent cholesterol absorption determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, circulating phytosterol levels and circulating LDL cholesterol levels.</brief_summary>
