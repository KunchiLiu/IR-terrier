	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to understand the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the Merck Trivalent Adenovirus Serotype 5 HIV-1 gag/pol/nef Vaccine (MRKAd 5 HIV-1 gag/pol/nef) vaccine in healthy human volunteers compared to placebo. The study will also evaluate a number of dose levels and the necessity for and timing of booster injections.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of the MRKAd5 Gag/Pol/Nef Vaccine in Healthy Adults (V520-016)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will proceed in four stages. Following stages I, II and III, all subjects will have the Postdose 1 (PD1) clinical and laboratory safety data reviewed by the Safety Evaluation Committee (SEC). If these data are acceptable, the next stage will be initiated. - In Stage I, participants will be randomized to receive 3 doses of the 3x10^9vp/dose level Trivalent vaccine or placebo. - In Stage II, participants will be randomized to receive 2 or 3 doses of the 3x10^10vp/dose level Trivalent vaccine or placebo. - In Stage III, participants will be randomized to receive 3 doses of the Trivalent vaccine with titers of 1x10^11vp/dose, 3x10^6vp/dose, 3x10^7vp/dose, or 3x10^8vp/dose or placebo. - In Stage IV, participants will be randomized to all treatment groups. In addition, some participants will be randomized to an MRKAd 5 HIV-1 gag Monovalent vaccine. In this stage, participants will be pre-stratified by baseline Ad5 titers (=&lt;200, and &gt;200), to ensure an even distribution of participants with high and low Ad5 titers across the various treatment groups.</detailed_description>
