	<brief_title>Serum-Free Thymus Transplantation in DiGeorge Anomaly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Complete DiGeorge anomaly is a congenital disorder characterized by athymia. Without successful treatment, patients remain immunodeficient and usually die by age 2 years. In "typical" complete DiGeorge subjects who have no T cells, thymus transplantation without immunosuppression has resulted in diverse T cell development and good T cell function. In "atypical" complete DiGeorge subjects who have no thymus, a rash, and some T cells that presumably developed extrathymically, thymus transplantation with immunosuppression has resulted in diverse T cell development and good T cell function. Thus far, thymus transplantation studies have used thymus cultured in fetal bovine serum (FBS medium). This protocol's purpose is to determine whether transplanted thymus cultured in serum free medium can safely support thymopoiesis and T cell reconstitution as does FBS medium cultured thymus tissue in DiGeorge anomaly subjects. This protocol includes 2 arms: atypical DiGeorge subjects who will receive immunosuppression and thymus transplantation; and, typical complete DiGeorge subjects who will receive thymus transplantation without immunosuppression. Serum free medium use would reduce concerns of animal product exposure including potential exposure to bovine spongiform encephalopathy(BSE).</detailed_description>
