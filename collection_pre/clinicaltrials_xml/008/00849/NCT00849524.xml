	<brief_summary>This is a Phase II, open label, fixed dose, repeat injection, single institution study. Eligible subjects will receive up to six doses of Ad-ISF35 injected directly into a selected lymph node under ultrasound guidance. The primary goal is to determine and monitor clinical and biological responses in patients treated with repeat intranodal injections of Ad-ISF35.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Repeat Intranodal Injection of Memgen's Cancer Vaccine, Ad-ISF35, in Subjects With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (CLL/SLL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase II clinical trial in which study subjects will be treated with multiple doses of Ad-ISF35 given via intranodal injection using a fixed dose of 3.3 x 10^10 ISF35 viral particles. Intranodal injections will be administered every 2-4 weeks up to six total injections. Because this is the first time that repeat administration of Ad-ISF35 will be performed via intranodal injection, and in order to allow sufficient time to evaluate the safety and toxicity of this procedure, we will treat subjects 1 thru 3 at one month intervals and with inpatient admission for 24 hours observation. After subject three receives their second ISF35 injection we will proceed with enrollment of cohorts of four patients per month at one week intervals until study enrollment has been completed. These subjects will be treated as outpatients and will be observed for 3 hours prior to discharge. ISF35 has already been used in Phase I clinical trials. The trials demonstrated that ISF35 treatment is well-tolerated and patients did not experience any significant or unexpected adverse events. Patients reported flu-like symptoms from ISF35, which disappeared within one to three days. ISF35 is an abbreviation for Immune Stimulatory Factor 35, an offspring of technology discovered by Dr. Thomas J. Kipps, MD, PhD, Professor, Department of Medicine and Deputy Director for Research,UCSD Moores Cancer Center.</detailed_description>
