	<criteria>A histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of nonmucinous epithelial ovarian cancer including primary peritoneal or fallopian tube malignancies Must have measurable disease by CT or MRI scan Must have relapsed radiologically with a randomization date within ≥6 and &lt; 24 months of completion of firstline platinum chemotherapy Have been treated with debulking surgery and firstline platinum and taxane based chemotherapy. Prior bevacizumbab maintenance is allowed. The last dose of bevacizumab must have been at least 30 days before study Day 1. No cytotoxic maintenance therapy (e.g. taxane) or cancer vaccine therapy is allowed. Must be a candidate for carboplatin and taxane therapy Neurologic function: neuropathy (sensory and motor) ≤CTCAE Grade 1 Subjects who never responded to firstline platinumbased therapy or whose first relapse occurs &lt;6 months or &gt;24 months from the last platinum therapy Subjects who have received other therapy to treat their ovarian cancer since relapse Known central nervous system (CNS) tumor involvement Evidence of other active invasive malignancy requiring treatment in the past 5 years Known allergic reaction to a prior monoclonal antibody therapy or have any documented HAHA Previous treatment with MORAb003 (farletuzumab) Clinical contraindications to use of a taxane</criteria>
