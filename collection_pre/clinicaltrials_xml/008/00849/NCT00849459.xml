	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Placing the gene for interleukin-12 into breast cancer cells may help the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of gene therapy in treating women with metastatic breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gene Therapy in Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of intratumoral injection of adenovirus-mediated human interleukin-12 gene in women with metastatic breast cancer. - Determine the tumor response in patients treated with this regimen. - Determine the immune response in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: Patients receive a single dose of adenovirus-mediated human interleukin-12 intratumorally via percutaneous needle placement under ultrasound guidance. Blood and tumor tissue samples are collected periodically for immunological laboratory studies. Samples are analyzed for serum cytokine levels by ELISA; qualitative analysis of immune biomarkers by IHC staining; and immune cell biomarker analysis by FACS. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.</detailed_description>
