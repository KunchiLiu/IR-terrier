	<brief_summary>This is a clinical research study to look at the incidence of proteinuria (a condition in which urine contains an abnormal amount of protein) caused by shortened infusions (given into the vein over 10 or 15 minutes) of bevacizumab (a medication prescribed for colon, lung, or breast cancer). There are currently no published studies or clinical data looking at how safe shortened infusions of bevacizumab are in relationship to the side effect of proteinuria. We hypothesis that shortened infusions of bevacizumab will result in an increased risk for proteinuria compared to the standard infusions of this agent.</brief_summary>
