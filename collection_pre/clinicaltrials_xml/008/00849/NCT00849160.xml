	<brief_summary>Darunavir boosted with ritonavir (darunavir/r) is a powerful protease inhibitor, able to reduce the viral load in patients infected with multi-resistant HIV strains; In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that the induction of resistance mutations in the protease gene is much more difficult with the association darunavir/r compared to the other ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors (PI/r), testifying of a significantly higher genetic barrier to resistance. Moreover, the tolerance to darunavir is good, and the pharmacologic profile of this molecule allows a once daily administration with a 800/100 mg dose in patients infected with a wild HIV strain or with a slightly resistant to darunavir/r strain. Thus, we propose to evaluate the efficacy of the darunavir/r association once daily as a substitute to a protease inhibitor regimen administered twice daily in patients with undetectable viral load receiving a tritherapy including a protease inhibitor administered twice daily.</brief_summary>
