	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to get more information on using BMS747158 (the study drug),a drug with small amounts of radioactivity to allow for heart imaging, during a PET scan which can then be compared to other images such as SPECT. The safety and quality of images will be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development of 1-Day Rest/Stress Cardiac PET Perfusion Imaging Protocol of BMS747158</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objectives of this study are: - To acquire data for the development of one-day rest/stress cardiac PET perfusion imaging protocols for BMS747158 with comparable diagnostic image quality to a two-day rest/stress PET protocol - To assess the safety of multiple doses of BMS747158 The secondary objectives of this study are: - To assess PET imaging parameters and image quality following administration of BMS747158 at rest and at stress (pharmacologic or exercise) same day (at different time intervals) and 16-48 hours after the rest injection - To assess feasibility of gated cardiac PET imaging with BMS747158 for left ventricular function assessment - To assess agreement of one and two day rest/stress PET imaging with BMS747158 in patients with reversible ischemia with rest/stress single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging - To perform a preliminary assessment of the diagnostic accuracy of one-day and two-day rest/stress PET perfusion imaging with BMS747158 as compared with invasive coronary angiography or computed tomography angiography (CTA) for detection of</detailed_description>
