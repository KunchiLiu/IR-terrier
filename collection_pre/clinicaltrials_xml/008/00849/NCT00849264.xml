	<brief_title>Comprehensive Treatment for Different Types of Tumor Thrombi in the Portal Vein for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary liver cancer (PLC) has a great tendency to invade portal vein intravascularly, results in the formation of portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT), which is a crucial factor that can worsen the prognosis of patients with PLC. In clinical, various treatments have been applied to improve this short-term prognosis, but there was no identical indication for treatment of PLC patients with different PVTT. The objective of this study is to evaluate the surgical comprehensive treatment for different types of tumor thrombi in the portal vein for hepatocellular carcinoma patients, to establish a standardized, unified, effective therapeutic program.</detailed_description>
