	<brief_summary>Patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis exhibit numerous hemodynamic and microvascular changes, i.e., low systemic blood pressure and peripheral vasodilatation. In addition, alterations of tissue oxygenation are described in these patients. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been proposed as a tool to quantify microvascular dysfunction, for example in patients with sepsis (1) or after trauma (2). NIRS is a non-invasive technique that uses the differential absorption properties of oxygenated and desoxygenated hemoglobin to evaluate skeletal muscle oxygenation (3). Up to the investigators' knowledge no data exist on NIRS measurements in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis. Aims of this study are to evaluate: - Are there any changes in NIRS parameters in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis in comparison to other critically ill patients (matched to SAPS II Score) or healthy individuals? - Is there a correlation with common accepted prognostic scores (MELD Score or indocyanin green clearance) in decompensated liver cirrhosis patients and initial NIRS parameters? - Does the NIRS trend within the first three days of ICU care in decompensated liver cirrhosis patients receiving fluid replacement therapy correlate with the course of disease? 1.

	<brief_title>Muscle Tissue Oxygenation in Patients With Decompensated Liver Cirrhosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients fulfilling inclusion criteria and without exclusion criteria will be monitored by NIRS using InSpectra™ technology (Hutchinson, USA) for the first three days of their ICU hospitalization. Besides registration of the NIRS parameters (tissue hemoglobin saturation (StO2), total tissue hemoglobin (THI), dynamic test values by using occlusion testing) baseline characteristics (age, sex, SAPS II Score et.), disease relevant information (etiology of liver cirrhosis, cause of ICU hospitalization) and ICU data (catecholamine therapy, mechanical ventilation, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid therapy) will be recorded. Within the observation time, an indocyanin green-clearance measurement and further laboratory testing will be performed on a daily basis. Data will be pseudonymized and kept confidential according to the guidelines of the local ethics committee.</detailed_description>
