	<brief_summary>The circadian system with its centre in the hypothalamus is involved in migraine pathophysiology. Whether it plays a pivotal role is not clarified. The investigators postulate that a destabilized circadian system may increase migraine attack susceptibility, and that stabilization by supplying melatonin a migraine preventive effect will be achieved. A previous open label study has shown effects that certainly warrant a placebo controlled study.</brief_summary>
