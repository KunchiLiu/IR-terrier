	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test if sexual health interventions can reduce the incidence of STIs among African American teens (15 to 21 years old). By doing this study, we hope to help African American teens improve their condom use skills and encourage them to use condoms more frequently. If the number of STIs in this population can be decreased, the health of African American teen males will greatly improve. We also believe that sexual partners (typically African American teen females) will also benefit.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HIV Prevention Program for African American Teen Males</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based on the observation that African Americans are vastly more likely than their white and Hispanic counterparts to be infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has termed AIDS a "health crisis" for African Americans and has called for a heightened national response to this glaring racial disparity. The crisis is especially dramatic in the Southern United States. Thus, the search for effective interventions tailored to this population is a national priority. This study expands upon a previous study conducted among young African American men. In the previous study we developed and tested the efficacy of a brief, clinic-based, program designed to interactively promote safer sex for African American men (18 to 29 years of age) engaging in sex with women. Adjusted findings from the previous study provided relatively robust support for program efficacy, with men who received the intervention program being about two-thirds less likely, than controls, to acquire an STI during a 6-month period. This study expands on the work performed in the previous study by developing and testing a version for younger African American males (i.e., teen males). The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of a brief, clinic-based and theory-guided, intervention designed to reduce STI incidence among African American teen (15 to 20 years old) males presenting themselves for STI testing.</detailed_description>
