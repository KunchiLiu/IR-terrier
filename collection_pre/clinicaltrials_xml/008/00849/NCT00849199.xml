	<detailed_description>The objectives of this study are to be a resource of information on women's cancers, including the availability of a genetics counselor for women at risk for hereditary cancer, especially ovarian cancer; to provide referrals for diagnostic tests and appropriate clinics involved in early detection of cancer; to provide access to clinical trials and investigational screening methods in cancer early detection and prevention, whenever applicable; to provide women with educational materials; to develop a database of information compiled from the questionnaires and clinics for use in future studies; to create a registry of family history data from women of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds who attend our clinic, i.e. who perceive themselves to be at increased risk of breast or gynecologic cancers.Women that participate in the study will be interviewed and asked to fill out a questionnaire. An assessment will then be made based on their information. Based on this assessment, women will be referred to the appropriate clinic or for diagnostic testing or provided with information regarding available protocol studies.</detailed_description>
