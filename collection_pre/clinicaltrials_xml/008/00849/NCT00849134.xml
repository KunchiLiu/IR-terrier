	<brief_summary>This is a first-time-in-human study. The overall purpose of the study is to assess whether the drug is safe and well tolerated after single, increasing doses. At different doses, we will look to see how much of the drug gets into the bloodstream, how the drug is broken down and excreted and whether this is affected by the presence of food.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>First Time in Human Study Evaluating the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and the Effect of Food of Single Assending Doses of GSK1482160.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GSK1482160 is a new drug to be developed for treating inflammatory pain (for example, arthritis). It acts on structures on inflammatory cells, known as P2X7 receptors. Blocking these receptors reduces the release of important inflammatory chemicals which exists within the body and are thought to play an important role in promoting inflammatory pain. This study will start with a very low dose of study drug, which will then be gradually increased in subsequent doses. This is known as dose-rising and is the way to assess safety and tolerability (any side effects that make taking the drug unpleasant). Effects will be compared to those seen when a placebo (a "dummy" drug) is taken. Up to 4 groups of 8 healthy male or female volunteers will be enrolled into the study. In addition, part of the study will be used to check if there is a difference in the blood levels of the study drug when taken with or without a high fat meal.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Healthy as determined by a responsible physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. 2. Male or female aged between 18 and 55 years inclusive. 3. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of nonchildbearing potential: 4. Nonchildbearing potential is defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhoea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and oestradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;140 pmol/L) is confirmatory.]1 5. Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until 5 x terminal halflives after the last dose. 6. Body weight &gt; 50 kg and BMI within the range 18.5 29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive). 7. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. The written informed consent form should be signed and dated. 8. QTcB or QTcF &lt; 450 msec; or QTc &lt; 480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block. A 12lead ECG at prestudy screening, which in the opinion of the Principal Investigator or physician designee has no abnormalities that will compromise safety in this study. The specific inclusion criterion with regard to QT interval (either QTcb or QTcf, machine or manual overread, males or females) is that QTc should be less than 450msec (based on single or average QTc of triplicate ECGs obtained over a brief recording period). 9. No abnormality on relevant clinical chemistry or haematology examination at the prestudy medical examination. Subjects with laboratory parameters outside the reference range for this age group will only be included if the principal Investigator or designee considers that such findings will not introduce additional risk factors. Consultation with the GSK medical monitor is required before such subjects may be included. In any case, liver function tests (including bilirubin, ALT, AST or alkaline phosphatase) and markers of renal function (including urea and creatinine) must be strictly within the normal range at screening. 10. Normal physical examination (providing no evidence of clinically active disease or physical or mental impairment). A subject with a clinical abnormality may be included only if the Principal Investigator or physician designee considers that the abnormality will not introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with study procedures. Consultation with the GSK medical monitor is required before such subjects may be included. 11. A 24hour Holter at prestudy screening, which in the opinion of the Principal investigator or physician designee has no abnormalities that will compromise safety in this study. If a rhythm abnormality is detected, the subject may be included in the study only if the Principle Investigator or physician designee considers that the abnormality will not introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with study procedures. Consultation with Principal Investigator, GSK medical monitor and, if required, a specialist cardiologist will occur before such a subject may be included. 1. The subject has a positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen. A minimum list of drugs that will be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates, cannabinoids and benzodiazepines. 2. A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 months of screening. 3. A positive test for HIV antibody. 4. Subjects with any risk factors for tuberculosis that include: (i) a history of either congenital or acquired immunosuppression (e.g. HIV), (ii) a history of any disorder that may be a function of altered immunomodulation (e.g. autoimmune disease), (iii) a history of any clinical condition or surgical procedure that places them at higher risk of TB (e.g. diabetes, sarcoidosis, gastrectomy and vagotomy, malignancy, leukaemia), (iv) a history of mycobacterial infection, including TB, (v) recent close contact (within the previous 48 months) with an individual known to be infected with TB, (vi) recent immigrants or residents (within the previous 48 months) from countries where TB is considered to be of highprevalence. For the purposes of TB screening amongst applicants for UK visas, high prevalence countries include Bangladesh, Ghana, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Togo, Niger, Kenya, Eritrea, Somalia, Pakistan, Sudan, Tanzania, Thailand, Cambodia and Laos (http://www.ukvisasgov.uk/en/howtoapply/tbscreening). 5. History of regular excessive alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as: 6. an average weekly intake of greater than 21 units or an average daily intake of greater than 3 units (males), or defined as an average weekly intake of greater than 14 units or an average daily intake of greater than 2 units (females). One unit is equivalent to a halfpint (220mL) of beer or 1 (25ml) measure of spirits or 1 glass (125ml) of wine. 7. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current study: 90 days, 5 halflives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer). 8. Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day. 9. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor that the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety.ONFIDENTIAL HH2007/00234/ 10. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof, or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation. 11. Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products in excess of 500 mL within a 90 day period before the screening visit. 12. Pregnant females as determined by positive serum hCG test at screening or urine hCG test prior to dosing. 13. Lactating females. 14. Females of childbearing potential 15. Females receiving Hormone Replacement Theory 16. Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol. 17.
