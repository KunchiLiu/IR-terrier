	<brief_title>SmartSet HV and Palacos R RSA Bone Cements in Primary Total Hip Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The fixation of components in total hip arthroplasty has a significant effect on the long-term survival of the prostheses. Bone cement in total joint replacement acts as an anchoring medium for the prosthesis and provides a barrier to the ingress of wear debris into bone surfaces. However, there are significant differences in cement behaviour among differing types of cement. A clinical study based on the Norwegian Arthroplasty Register demonstrated that there is an increased rate of revision due to aseptic loosening of femoral components implanted with low-viscosity cement compared with that of high-viscosity. Studies have shown that high early migration for certain designs of femoral prosthesis can be a predictor for clinical loosening. RSA is a technique enabling calculation of the three-dimensional translational and rotational movements of the implant relative to the bone, and therefore provides an ideal technique to detect early micromotion of implants.</detailed_description>
