	<brief_summary>In transposition patients after atrial switch operation, the morphological right ventricle serves as the systemic ventricle. These patients often develop signs of heart failure. It is not known, whether physical training can safely be recommended in these patients- like heart failure guidelines recommend training in patients with normal anatomy. Furthermore it is not known, whether these TGA-patients benefit from training with respect to cardiopulmonary exercise capacity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Physical Training in Transposition of the Great Arteries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, controlled, prospective trial on the safety of physical training in TGA patients after atrial switch operation. In transposition patients after atrial switch operation, the morphological right ventricle serves as the systemic ventricle. These patients often develop signs of heart failure. It is not known, whether physical training can safely be recommended in these patients- like heart failure guidelines recommend training in patients with normal anatomy. Furthermore it is not known, whether these TGA-patients benefit from training with respect to cardiopulmonary exercise capacity. Primary endpoints are Systemic Ventricle Ejection Fraction and Volumes, Exercise Capacity. Secondary endpoints are Echo Diastolic Function, as well as laboratory markers of heart failure.</detailed_description>
