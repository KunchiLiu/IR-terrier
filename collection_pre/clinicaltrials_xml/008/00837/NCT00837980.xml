	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to generate a library of functional imaging and anatomical imaging for patients with head and neck cancers for evaluation of new radiotherapy strategies and planning techniques including IMRT. Secondary aims would be to observe the changes in the cancers as the treatment progresses as well as to define the biologically most active part of the tumor (biological target volume) which could be given more intensive treatment. Tumor volumes seen on different imaging modalities will be compared with a hope of finding an optimal imaging methodology for accurate visualization of the head and neck cancers</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adult patients who have a head and neck cancer and are planned to receive chemotherapy and radiotherapy will be invited to participate in the study. Patients who are not in very good health, have diabetes or kidney failure will not be considered for the study. Also patients who can not undergo MRI scan or are allergic to contrast injection given prior to the scan or have had any other form of cancer (except skin cancer) will also be excluded from the study.</detailed_description>
