	<brief_summary>Severe sepsis or septic shock with acute kidney injury shows high mortality in intensive care unit. A few studies have shown CRRT relating the clinical improvement seems to be related to the early initiation of therapy. But there is no consensus for proper time of CRRT may improve the prognosis. The study is a prospective randomized one center trial comparing two treatments in patients suffering from septic shock complicated with acute renal failure admitted to ICU, treated either early by CRRT (35 ml/kg/h) or by conventional RRT.</brief_summary>
