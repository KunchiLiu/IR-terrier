	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if there is an effect on the eye pressure from extreme weight loss by bariatric procedures. The hypothesis is that excess fat in the orbit of the eye compresses on the outflow system, which causes an elevated eye pressure. This can have many consequences, including the risk for glaucoma. We hope to establish if there is an effect between eye pressure and weight.</brief_summary>
