	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of the consumption of different oils (olive oil, sunflower oil, sunflower plus dimethyl-polysiloxane, sunflower plus phenols) previously submitted to heating in postprandial endothelial function, inflammation and oxidative stress in healthy young men.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Different Oils For Frying and Endothelial Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine whether the consumption by healthy persons of an oil exposed to high temperatures, designed to have a composition of healthy fats (predominantly monounsaturated fats and with less than 10% palmitic acid) and to contain an abundance of antioxidants typically found in olive oil (phenolic compounds), will improve the vasodilatory response that depends on the endothelium, and buffer the inflammatory and postprandial oxidative response that is produced by the oils that are being used ever more frequently for frying purposes (sunflower oil and oil to which butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) has been added), using virgin olive oil exposed to the same heating regime as a reference oil.</detailed_description>
