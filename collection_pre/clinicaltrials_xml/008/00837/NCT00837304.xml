	<brief_summary>The dimension of diagnostic procedures and therapy of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases largely depends on the degree of mucosal inflammation. Video colonoscopy is currently the gold standard in the evaluation of the mucosa in patients with Ulcerative Colitis (UC). PillCam Colon Capsule was developed by Given Imaging, Israel, as possible alternative imaging modality to evaluate mucosal changes in patients with UC. The colonic mucosa can be visualized and recorded by video while the colon capsule passes the colon. Many patients suffering from UC ask their physician for possible alternative diagnostic imaging because they are uncomfortable with conventional colonoscopy. The primary aim of the present study is to compare the new Pillcam Colon Capsule with standard colonoscopy with respect to assessing mucosal disease activity and localization of inflamed colonic mucosa in patients with known UC.</brief_summary>
