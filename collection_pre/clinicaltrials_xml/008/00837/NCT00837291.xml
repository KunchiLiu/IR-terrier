	<brief_summary>This study will test the effectiveness of CF101 in treating the symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. Eligible patients will be given either CF101 or matching placebo tablets and their symptoms will be evaluated over the 12 week treatment period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of the Efficacy and Safety of CF101 to Patients With Osteoarthritis of the Knee</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in which patients with knee OA will be randomized to either CF101 1 mg or matching placebo tablets every 12 hours and followed for 12 weeks on treatment. For patients with bilateral knee involvement, only 1 knee will be selected for evaluation, namely, the most severely involved knee that meets study criteria (the "index knee"). Screening examinations will occur within 1 month prior to dosing. Washout of non-specific non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsNSAIDs) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors will occur prior to dosing, and must be followed by requalification before dosing. Disease activity will be assessed using changes from baseline in Patient's Global Assessment (PGA) and Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) scores, and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) index and subscales for pain, physical function, stiffness, according to the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials-Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OMERACT-OARSI) criteria. Assessments will take place at Screening, Baseline (Week 0), and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 14.</detailed_description>
