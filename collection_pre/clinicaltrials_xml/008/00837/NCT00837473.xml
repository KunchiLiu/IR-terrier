	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if Plexur P grows bone in the iliac crest (where bone was removed or "harvested") for the back surgery. The study will be focusing on patients who require back surgery. Often additional bone is required from the hip of the patient (iliac crest). When bone removed from the hip, a "void" is often created. This "void" will be filled in with Osteotech's Plexur P product.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Performance of The Plexur Pâ„¢ Bone Void Filler Device in Patients Undergoing Iliac Crest Harvesting Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective trial is designed to evaluate the ability of the Plexur P device (bone void filler) to reconstitute the iliac crest in patients requiring iliac crest bone harvesting procedures at one single study site. Plexur P Bone Void Filler is: - A biocomposite of mineralized cortical allograft bone fibers and polylactide-co-glycolide co-polymer. - Designed to fill bony voids or gaps of the skeletal system that are not intrinsic to the stability of the bony structure. - Porosity is introduced into the Plexur P Biocomposites to create a cancellous-like structure that provides a scaffold for bone growth. In addition: - Patients will be screened for study eligibility based on the need for iliac crest bone harvesting. - Fifteen (15) eligible patients will be enrolled and will have an iliac crest harvesting defect backfilled with Plexur P to repair the iliac crest defect. - As a part of routine follow up care, patient related outcomes including measurements of pain severity and pain relief will be determined using patient (IRB approved) questionnaires. - Radiographic analysis will also be used to determine amount of bony ingrowth of the Plexur P device.</detailed_description>
