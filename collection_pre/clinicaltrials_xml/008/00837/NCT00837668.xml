	<brief_summary>to determine the genetic pathways operating at the tissue level to cause granulomatous inflammation in the lungs and lymph nodes of patients with sarcoidosis. By so doing, we hope to identify unique genetic mechanisms which will aid in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis and will help us understand the pathogenesis of this poorly understood disease.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>to collect small sample of lung tissue recovered from a clinical procedure such as bronchoscopy, or a mediastinoscopy (a procedure in which a lighted instrument (mediastinoscope) is inserted through a neck incision to visually examine the structures in the top of the chest cavity and to take a sample (biopsy) of tissue.</detailed_description>
