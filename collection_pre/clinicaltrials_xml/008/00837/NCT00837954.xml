	<brief_title>Trial to Evaluate the Hemostatic Effect of Lyostypt® Versus Surgicel® in Arterial Bypass Anastomosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hemostasis in peripheral vascular surgery is made more difficult by the need for direct arterial and arterial graft suturing as well as by systemic anticoagulation to prevent thrombosis during periods of vascular occlusion. Polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) is one of the most frequently used graft materials for vascular replacement or bypass in the case when no autologous venae are available (1). However, the insufficient elasticity of PTFE and its porosity promote the development of suture hole bleeding (2,3) which can cause considerable loss of blood and prolongation of operations (2). This study is designed to demonstrate the superiority of Lyostypt® to oxidized cellulose (Surgicel®) for hemostasis of suture hole bleeding in arterial bypass anastomoses after vascular reconstruction. Lyostypt® is an absorbable, wet stable collagen compress made of collagen fibrils of bovine origin. Collagen leads to thrombocyte adhesion and to activation of coagulation factor XII. Therefore collagen is very effective in hemostasis. Collagen is cell-friendly whereas other hemostats significantly disturb cell growth. Advantages of collagen fleece are fast induction of hemostasis, low tissue reaction and fast absorption (15). Furthermore, collagen was shown to be the best overall hemostatic agent in microvascular surgery. Authors concluded that collagen fleece establish faster hemostasis than oxidized cellulose and that it was resorbed faster than oxidized cellulose (15).</detailed_description>
