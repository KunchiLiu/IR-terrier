	<brief_summary>The syndrome of obstructive sleep apnea (OSAS) is a public health problem that affects 2 to 4% of the general population. The patients with OSAS frequently complain of intolerance to exercise muscle fatigue and a significant even if they have not been fully characterized in the literature. The anomalies in the exercise of patients with OSAS could be due to metabolic changes (insulin resistance and oxidative stress) and cardiovascular (impaired vascular reactivity). Our goal is both to determine whether these anomalies exist in patients with OSAS not obese, consider their relationship with the alteration of exercise capacity, and their reversibility in conventional PPC or by using the effects of physical activity regular.In this study Objectives: To establish whether the metabolic and vascular abnormalities associated with OSAS are associated with decreased parameters of physical fitness in relation to witnesses matched for age, sex and body mass index. Determine the effects of a re-training exercise on these parameters compared to the reference treatment, continuous positive pressure. Main objective: To compare the exercise capacity of OSAS patients compared with that of witnesses matched for age, sex and body mass index. Secondary objectives: To compare the effect of conventional treatment by continuous positive pressure (CPP) on cardiovascular and metabolic abnormalities of OSAS, with a therapeutic modality most original, physical activity. Methodology: Test physiopathological parallel group, controlled, randomized.</brief_summary>
