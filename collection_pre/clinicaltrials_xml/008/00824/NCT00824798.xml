	<brief_summary>Joint damage secondary to recurrent haemarthroses and chronic synovitis represents the commonest clinical manifestation of haemophilia. Incapacitating pain, loss of joint stability and mobility, axial deviation, deterioration and decreased function are the most frequent complains in patients with severe haemophilic arthropathy In this context, the purpose of our study is to examine and analyse specific changes in gait in patients suffering from haemophilic arthropathy and determine the impact on health-related quality of life in terms of conceptual components of pain and stiffness, psychosocial stress, disability, and activity limitations as recommended by the International Classification of Function (ICF) recently published by the World Health Organization.</brief_summary>
