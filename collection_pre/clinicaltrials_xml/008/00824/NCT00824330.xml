	<brief_summary>Older persons with diabetes have a harder time maintaining blood pressure when standing up. When blood pressure drops when standing up, fainting may occur. This study will see how regular exercise can improve the ability of the body to keep blood pressure up when standing. We want to see how this improvement varies with a home-based walking program.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Home-Based Walking Study in Older Adults With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Detailed Summary 1. PURPOSE: Older adults with diabetes faint frequently, due to an impairment in the cardiovascular control mechanisms (arterial baroreceptor function, autonomic nervous system function and cerebral autoregulation) that prevent syncope. The purpose of this study is to examine the ability of a home based walking program to reverse these impairments. 2. HYPOTHESES: a) A home-based walking program will improve the compensatory cardiovascular responses that prevent syncope in older adults with Type 2 diabetes. A moderate, regular exercise program will: - increase arterial baroreflex sensitivity - increase heart rate variability (marker of autonomic nervous system function) - decrease cerebrovascular resistance - improve cerebral autoregulation during upright tilt. b) There will be relationship between the improvement in compensatory cardiovascular responses and regular exercise. c) Design of more practicable training prescriptions than that used in a research setting.</detailed_description>
