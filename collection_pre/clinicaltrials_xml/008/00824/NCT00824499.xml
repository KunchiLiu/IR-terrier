	<brief_title>Development, Implementation and Evaluation of a Complex Regional Intervention for Type 2 Diabetes: Diabetes Project Aalst</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Diabetes is an important chronic condition with significant associated morbidity and mortality, which can be reduced by effective care. An interdisciplinary approach, sharing responsibility and involvement and education of patients are of major importance in diabetes care. In Belgium a research project aimed at creating regional diabetes shared care was set up. Research questions - Is regional implementation of shared care feasible? - Does it increases quality of care (evidence based care) and patient satisfaction with care? - Does it have a positive effect on health status (emotional distress, overall quality of life, Hba1c)? Methods Controlled trial (July 2004 - June 2006) with a regional complex intervention comprising introduction of a care-manager and 2 community based diabetes educators, development and implementation of a shared care protocol (with a central role for the GP), regional feedback on the quality of diabetes care and patient education. Practitioners and patients participate on a voluntary basis. In the control region usual care continues. Biophysical, psychosocial and process outcomes were collected thru GP registration of patients records and self-administered patient questionnaires (PAID, QUOTE).</detailed_description>
