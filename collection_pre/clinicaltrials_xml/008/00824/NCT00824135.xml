	<brief_summary>Patients with refractory hematologic malignancies including those who develop recurrent disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) have a dismal prognosis. Historically, both regimen-related mortality and disease recurrence have been significant causes of treatment failure in this heavily pre-treated patient population. The investigators institution has utilized mismatched family member donors for these patients for several reasons: (1) Only 30% of patients have matched related donors available; (2) transplantation can be performed more rapidly since the time to unrelated donor trans-plantation averages 3 to 4 months; (3) the alloimmune reactivity of natural killer (NK) cells following haploidentical HSCT has been shown to reduce relapse rates in certain patient groups; and, (4) no other curative treatment options are available. In the present trial, the investigators propose a novel conditioning regimen using clofarabine in an effort to enhance cytotoxicity while simultaneously reducing regimen related toxicity. In this phase I trial, the goal is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of clofarabine when used in combination with melphalan and thiotepa pre-transplant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Haploidentical Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Using A Novel Clofarabine Containing Conditioning Regimen For Patients With Refractory Hematologic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of clofarabine in combination with thiotepa and melphalan as a conditioning regimen for a haploidentical stem cell transplant with an engineered graft depleted of CD3+ cells. Study participants will children and young adults with refractory hematologic malignancies. Secondary objectives include the following: - To describe the one-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) rates in these study participants. - To determine the time to hematopoietic recovery and donor cell engraftment following this study treatment. - To estimate the cumulative incidence of relapse in study participants. - To estimate the incidence of overall grade II-IV and grade III-IV acute GVHD and the rate of chronic GVHD. - To estimate the incidence and describe the causes of non-hematologic regimen-related toxicity and regimen-related mortality in the first 100 days post HSCT. - To explore the biologic significance of soluble interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and lymphocyte reconstitution (qualitative and quantitative, V beta spectratyping, TREC</detailed_description>
