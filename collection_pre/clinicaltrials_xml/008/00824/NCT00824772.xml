	<brief_summary>Fentanyl is a widely used opioid analgesic. There are big interindividual variabilities in dose requirements of fentanyl for postoperative pain control. This study aims to reveal the genetic factors affecting the variable requirements of fentanyl during postoperative period.</brief_summary>
