	<brief_summary>Objectives: The purpose of this study is to obtain descriptive information about the nature and extent of body image concerns among surgical patients with head and neck cancer, satisfaction with care received regarding body image issues, and interest in psychosocial services targeting body image disturbance. Findings from this study provide important preliminary data to guide future large scale research on the critical, yet understudied, psychosocial issue of body image functioning for head and neck cancer patients. Information obtained from this study can specifically be used to facilitate the development of appropriate disease-specific body image instruments and to determine the need for body image focused psychosocial interventions to enhance quality of life and the survivorship experience for these patients. Primary Aims 1. To characterize the nature and extent of body image concerns in surgically treated patients with head and neck cancer and determine preferences for psychosocial intervention. 2. To compare body image and quality of life outcomes for patients at different time points relative to initiation of treatment. Specific time points of interest are pre-treatment, within one year of initial surgical treatment, and greater than 1 year following initial surgical treatment. Secondary Aim 1. To compare body image and quality of life outcomes for patients with oral cavity, cutaneous, and midface cancers.</brief_summary>
