	<brief_summary>This project seeks to determine the efficacy of safety education using a safe home model. The 4 X 8 ft. model is designed to look like a house; each of 4 "rooms" has a focused safety message. Families will be enrolled in the clinic and randomized to one of two groups, the safe home model group and the printed safety education materials (TIPP materials) group. The investigators will compare the retention of safety information among caregivers instructed using these two methods. The hypothesis is that families in the safe home model group will have improved retention of safety information.</brief_summary>
