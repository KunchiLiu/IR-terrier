	<brief_title>Ofatumumab Added to Fludarabine-Cyclophosphamide vs Fludarabine-Cyclophosphamide Combination in Relapsed Subjects With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fludarabine is currently approved for treatment of relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia. Studies have shown that drugs in combination with fludarabine have shown more effectiveness than fludarabine alone. The addition of ofatumumab to fludarabine-cyclophosphamide combination offers potentially a more effective therapy, without additional toxicity. The objective of this study is to determine the effect of ofatumumab added to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide in patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia who have responded previously to therapy but later develop progressive disease and require additional therapy.</detailed_description>
