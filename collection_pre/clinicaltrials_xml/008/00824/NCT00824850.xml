	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the "late" immune response to further doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine more than 10 years after primary immunization with Prevnar (7vPnC) in infancy, as compared with individuals who did not receive Prevnar in infancy (the Prevnar naive cohort which received MnCC). The study will take place at a single study center. Study participants must have participated previously in a specific Wyeth Prevnar study (Study D118-P8) and must still be enrolled in the Northern California Kaiser Permanente (NCKP) health plan.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Fully vaccinated perprotocol (4 doses of vaccine given at 2, 4, 6, and 1215 months of age) subjects enrolled in the Prevnar arm of Study D118P8, OR Fully vaccinated perprotocol subjects from the control arm of the same study that did not receive Prevnar after the close of Study D118P8, or at any time following the study, AND Still enrolled in NCKP health plan. Subjects included in either group above must be in good health as determined by medical history, physical examination, and clinical judgment. Previous receipt of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. History of documented recurrent pneumococcal otitis media or any occurence of pneumonia within past 12 months History of documented invasive pneumococcal disease (defined as a positive culture of S. pneumoniae from a normally sterile body site). Known or suspected disease or dysfunction of the immune system, including: HIV infection Malignancy Receipt of immunosuppressive therapy Sickle cell hemoglobinopathy Concomitant vaccination during the study period. Known hypersensitivity to any component of Prevnar. Any major illness/condition that, in the investigator's judgment, will substantially increase the risk associated with the subject's participation in and completion of, the study, or could preclude the evaluation of the subject's response. Receipt of immune globulin within the past 3 months. Positive pregnancy test for menarchal female subjects. Females who are breastfeeding. For control subjects, previous receipt of Prevnar at any time.</criteria>
