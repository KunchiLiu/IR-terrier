	<brief_title>Efficacy and Significance of Antiviral Therapy for Unresectable Hepatitis B Virus-related Primary Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>primary liver cancer(PLC)is one of the world's most common malignancies, especially in East-Asian countries.Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is associated with 70-90% of PLC cases in China. PLC can develop during any stage of the natural course of chronic HBV infection and anti-virus therapy should be considered during the management of PLC. However, there is no definite guide on when or how to practice the anti-virus therapy, especially in unresectable or inoperable PLC. Because of these facts, research on the significant of the anti-virus therapy in the HBV-related PLC is urgently needed. 200 patients will be randomly assigned to anti-virus therapy group and control gruop.The time to progression(TTP) and overall survival within two years will be used to evaluate the effect of anti-virus therapy on PLC. The aim of this study is to research the efficacy and significant of the anti-virus therapy in the unresectable HBV-related PLC so as to establish treatment standards of anti-virus therapy in PLC.</detailed_description>

It is not appropriate to perform liver resection operation. 2. serum positive HBsAg≥6 months. 3. Criteria of liver function: Child A or B level, serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal value, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase ≤ 10 times the upper limit of normal value. 4. hemoglobin≥8.5g/dl, PTINR≤2.3 or PT&gt;6 seconds of normal value. 5. No dysfunction in major organs; Blood routine, kidney function, cardiac function and lung function are basically normal. 6.
