	<brief_summary>We have completed a study in which we examined the response of the retinal circulation to changes in posture from sitting to lying down in patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). This alteration in position produces changes in the local blood pressure at the entrance to the retinal vasculature. In a healthy retina, the vasculature adapts by dilating and constricting in order to maintain a steady blood flow rate. In an eye with POAG, this often does not occur. As a result, there are large fluctuations in blood flow which may produce the retinal neuronal damage associated with glaucoma. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that topical anti-glaucoma treatments with agents that have vasoactive as well as IOP-lowering effects can have a beneficial effect on maintaining a steady retinal blood flow rate even when there are changes in local blood pressure.</brief_summary>
