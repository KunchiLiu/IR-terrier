	<brief_summary>Tranexamic acid has been shown to reduce postoperative blood losses and transfusion requirements in a number of types of surgery. Most trials in orthopedic surgery have been conducted in arthroplasty, hip fracture and spine surgeries. This study would aim to see the effect of tranexamic acid in reduction of blood loss and transfusions for long bone fracture surgery, primarily fracture shaft of femur.</brief_summary>
