	<brief_title>Orthostatic Tolerance in Mamma Cancer Patients After Anaesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is known, that patients undergoing major surgery have problems maintaining upright posture after major surgery. This can be due to fall in bloodpressure, with symptoms like dizziness, nausea/vomiting and fainting. With this investigation, we want to prove that anaesthesia is not the decisive factor, in patients ability to maintain upright posture after surgery.</detailed_description>
