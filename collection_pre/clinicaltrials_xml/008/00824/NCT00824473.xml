	<criteria>1. Male and female subjects 12 years of age and older 2. Provide written informed consent/pediatric assent. If the subject is a minor, a parent or legal guardian must give written informed consent 3. Screening Visit: Have a 12hour reflective TNSS of at least 8 out of a possible 12 and a congestion score of 2 or 3 on visit 1 4. Randomization Visit: Have a 12hour reflective TNSS (AM or PM) of at least 8 on 3 separate symptom assessments (one of which was within 2 days of visit 2, and can include the morning of visit 2) during the Leadin Period. In addition, an AM or PM 12hour reflective nasal congestion score of 2 or 3 must have been recorded on 3 separate symptom assessments (one of which was within 2 days of visit 2, and can include the morning of visit 2) 5. Willing and able to comply with the study requirements 6. At least a 2year history of SAR during Texas Mountain Cedar season 7. The presence of IgEmediated hypersensitivity to Texas Mountain Cedar, confirmed by a positive response to skin prick within the last year. A positive response is defined as a wheal diameter of at least 3 mm larger than the negative control. 8. General good health and free of any disease or concomitant treatment that could interfere with the interpretation of the study results as determined by the investigator or the sponsor's medical officer. When in doubt, the investigator should confer with the sponsor's medical monitor or designee to determine eligibility for the study. 9. Subjects receiving immunotherapy injections (antigen desensitization) must be on a stable maintenance regimen for at least 30 days before the first study visit (adjustments to regimen following a brief period of missed injections do not preclude participation).Dose reduction when a new bottle is used does not preclude participation. 10. Subjects currently receiving sublingual immunotherapy are excluded. A 6month washout period is required following the last dose of sublingual immunotherapy. 1. On Focused Nasal Examination, the presence of any superficial and moderate nasal mucosal erosion, nasal mucosal ulceration, or nasal septum perforation (Grade 1b4) at either screening visit or randomization visit will disqualify the subjects from the study. 2. Other nasal disease(s) likely to affect deposition of intranasal medication, such as sinusitis, rhinitis medicamentosa, clinically significant polyposis, or clinically significant nasal structural abnormalities. 3. Nasal surgery or sinus surgery within the previous year. 4. Chronic sinusitis more than 3 episodes per year 5. Planned travel outside of the study area during the study period 6. The use of any investigational drug within 30 days prior to visit 1. No investigational products are permitted for use during the conduct of this study 7. Presence of any hypersensitivity to drugs similar to azelastine and to either sorbitol or sucralose (SplendaÂ® brand sweetener) 8. Women who are pregnant or nursing 9. Women of childbearing potential who are not abstinent or not practicing a medically acceptable method of contraception 10. Respiratory Tract Infections within 14 days prior to visit 1 11. Respiratory Tract Infections requiring antibiotic treatment 14 days prior to visit 1 12. Asthma (with the exception of intermittent asthma). Subjects with mild, intermittent asthma who only require shortacting inhaled bronchodilators (not more often than twice per week) and who do not have nocturnal awakening as a result of asthma are eligible for enrollment 13. Significant pulmonary disease including COPD 14. Clinically significant arrhythmia or symptomatic cardiac conditions 15. A known history of alcohol or drug abuse within the last 2 years 16. Existence of any surgical or medical condition or physical or laboratory findings, which in the opinion of the investigator or sponsor's medical monitor, might significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of study drug; that might significantly affect the subject's ability to complete this trial; or their safety in this trial. 17. Clinically relevant abnormal physical findings within 1 week of randomization which, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the objectives of the study or that may preclude compliance with the study procedures 18. Participation in MedPointe Protocols MP439 or MP440. 19. Employees of the research center / private practice and their family are excluded</criteria>
