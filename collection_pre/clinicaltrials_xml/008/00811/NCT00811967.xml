	<brief_summary>The objective of the study is to evaluate the superiority of treatment with PegIntron and Rebetol over no antiviral therapy (control group) in subjects with chronic hepatitis C and type C compensated cirrhosis. Subjects will be randomized in a ratio of 2:1 (Treatment Arm to Control Arm). Subjects in the Treatment Arm will receive combination therapy with PegIntron and Rebetol for 48 weeks; then will enter a 24-week post-treatment Follow-up. Subjects who have detectable Hepatitis C Virus-RNA at Treatment Week 24 will discontinue treatment and enter Follow-up.</brief_summary>
