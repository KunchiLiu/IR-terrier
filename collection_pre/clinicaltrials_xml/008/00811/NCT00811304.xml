	<brief_summary>Specific Aim: The purpose of this study is to determine if labor epidural placement using real-time (concurrent) ultrasound guided placement is superior to the conventional "standard" epidural technique without the use of ultrasound at Magee-Womens Hospital. Hypothesis: Ultrasound guided labor epidural placement in real-time will decrease the traditional epidural failure rate from 5% to 1%.</brief_summary>
