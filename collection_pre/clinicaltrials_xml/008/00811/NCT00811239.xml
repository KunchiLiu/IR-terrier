	<brief_summary>In northern Vietnam, a vast majority of the most severe envenomed patients are bitten by Bungarus multicinctus. Hitherto, these victims have received supportive care only. The aims of this study were to assess the possible efficacy and side effects of a newly produced antivenom.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Controlled Clinical Trial on The Use of a Specific Antivenom Against Envenoming by Bungarus Multicinctus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Venomous snakebites constitute a serious health problem in many Asian countries. In Vietnam, the burden of snakebite on the public health stimulated Calmette to conduct original studies at the Vaccine Institute in Saigon over a hundred years ago and to develop the first snake antivenom ever. In northern Vietnam, a vast majority of the most severe envenomed patients are bitten by Bungarus multicinctus, which is the only krait species giving rise to significant morbidity and mortality in the area. Its venom contains toxins which can cause severe neuromuscular blockade but which do not give rise to swelling or necrosis at the site of the bite. Supportive care is an important part of the management of snakebites, but antivenom administration is the mainstay therapy in the majority of medically significant envenomings. Such specific therapy may dramatically reduce the consequences of the envenomation. In Vietnam, no specific antivenom against B. multicinctus has been available until recently when it has produced for clinical use.</detailed_description>
