	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to prospectively monitor the incidence of adverse drug reactions, specifically NSF during routine use of gadoversetamide in a large number of patients with moderate renal insufficiency (eGFR 30-59) and severe renal insufficiency or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis (eGFR &lt;30).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Referred for contrastenhanced MRI using gadoversetamide; Have a documented estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 within the past 6 months or ESRD requiring dialysis; and Willing and able to provide written consent (themselves or by a legally authorized representative) and agree to abide by study requirements, including being seen by a dermatologist and undergoing a skin biopsy if NSF is suspected. Have experienced a previous hypersensitivity reaction to a GBCA; Have preexisting NSF or NSFlike symptoms; or Have been exposed to a GBCA within 12 months prior to the index procedure; or Has a medical condition or other personal situation that would prevent providing followup information, completing clinic visits or otherwise supplying meaningful data to meet study objectives.</criteria>
