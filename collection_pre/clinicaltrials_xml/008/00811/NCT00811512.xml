	<detailed_description>Microphthalmos is a developmental ocular disorder defined as a small eyeball. The condition can be associated with abnormalities of anterior and posterior segments. The most common anterior characteristics include corneal opacities, angle-closure and a shallow anterior chamber and cataract. The main findings of posterior segment are uveal effusion, retinal folds, abnormalities of macular capillary vascularization, absence of foveal depression and peripheral retinoschisis. We performed on 3 patients with microphthalmos and their OCT features of posterior segment.</detailed_description>
