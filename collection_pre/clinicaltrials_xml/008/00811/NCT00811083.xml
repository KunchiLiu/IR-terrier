	<brief_summary>Many children with autism have a reduced level of glutathione and a reduced ability to excrete mercury, resulting in elevated levels in their bodies as demonstrated by blood, hair, provoked urine, and baby tooth testing. Our earlier studies have demonstrated that DMSA, an FDA-approved medication for treating lead poisoning in children, is effective in increasing excretion of mercury and other toxic metals. Based on many clinical reports, we hypothesize that a 3-month treatment with glutathione and DMSA will result in a reduction of autistic symptoms in some children with autism.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study will assess the safety and efficacy of the use of DMSA (an FDA-approved medication for treating lead poisoning in children) for the off-label treatment of symptoms of autism in children with autism and significant body burden of toxic metals.</detailed_description>
