	<brief_summary>Octagam is a human normal immunoglobulin (IGIV) solution for intravenous administration. Octagam 5% is currently registered in more than 60 countries. This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety and the kinetics of Octagam 10% for replacement therapy in primary immunodeficiency diseases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy, Safety and Kinetics Study of Octagam 10% in Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of the study is to investigate the safety of Octagam 10% in replacement therapy in PID and to compare the pharmacokinetic profile of Octagam 10% with that of the previously used Octagam 5%. The secondary objective is to investigate the efficacy of Octagam 10% in replacement therapy in PID by monitoring the rate of occurence of serious bacterial infections, the rate of other infections, the trough (pre-next-dose) levels of total serum IgG and IgG subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4), the trough (pre-next-dose) levels of selected antigen specific antibodies, the use of antibiotics, the rate of absence from school/ work, and the number of days in hospital.</detailed_description>
