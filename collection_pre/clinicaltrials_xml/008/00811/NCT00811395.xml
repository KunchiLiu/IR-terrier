	<brief_summary>The primary objective was to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of teriflunomide when added to treatment with interferon-β [IFN-β] or glatiramer Acetate [GA] in patients with multiple sclerosis [MS] with relapses. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the long-term effect on relapse rate, disability progression and Magnetic Resonance Imaging [MRI] parameters. This study is the extension study of the PDY6045 (NCT00489489) and PDY6046 (NCT00475865) studies. Participants who successfully completed the initial study were offered to continue their treatment (same compound, same dose) for 24 additional weeks.</brief_summary>
