	<brief_title>HEMOTOL: Efficacy and Safety of Hemodialysis On-line Monitoring Devices on Hemodynamic Stability in Intensive Care Unit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with high mortality and morbidity rates in critically ill patients despite advances in renal replacement therapy (RRT). Over the last few years, new devices in dialysis equipment, such as blood temperature and blood volume on-line monitors, have been developed to improve hemodynamic tolerance, and these new modalities have demonstrated their positive impact on decrease in intra-dialytic hypotension rate in chronic hemodialysis patients. In order to evaluate these new devices in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury we decided to conduct a prospective randomized controlled trial. We based calculation of the sample size on a power analysis that assumed an expected decrease in intra-dialytic hypotension rate of 40% (from a crude intra-dialytic hypotension rate of 30% to 18%) in groups B and C, compared with group A. Analysis is done by intention to treat, according to prescribed new dialysis on-line monitoring devices.</detailed_description>
