Neutropenia &gt;= 7 days caused by the following reasons Standard or doseintense chemotherapy, anthracyclines or other acceptable chemotherapies ( any investigational drug is not permitted) for Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) treatment Retreatment of chemotherapy in case of AML recurrence Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) shifts to AML and bone marrow arrest induction chemotherapy is required (not including acute phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia [CML]) Informed consent obtained from participant or legal guardian Participants previously treated with amphotericin B (AMB), fluconazole (FLZ), or itraconazole (ITZ) within 30 days of enrollment. Participants who have taken the following drugs: terfenadine, cisapride, and ebastine within 24 hours before entry astemizole at entry or within 10 days before entry cimetidine, rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifabutin, barbiturates, isoniazid atharanthine and anthracyclines within 24 hours before entry The above drugs are refrained during the investigation Serious organ diseases except hematological disorder such as cardiac or neurologic disorders or impairment expected to be unstable or progressive during the course of this study (eg, seizures or demyelinating syndromes, acute myocardial infarction within 3 months of study entry, myocardial ischemia, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate &lt;60/min, or history of torsades de pointes, symptomatic ventricular or sustained arrhythmias), unstable electrolyte abnormalities. Participants who have used any investigational drugs or biologic agents other than their chemotherapy regimens within 30 days of study entry. Prior enrollment in this study.
