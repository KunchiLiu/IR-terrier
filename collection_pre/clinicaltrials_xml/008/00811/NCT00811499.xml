Patients may continue on specified stable background therapies for ankylosing spondylitis (doses should be stable for at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug). Additional criteria exist. Key Diagnosis of any other active or uncontrolled inflammatory or noninflammatory articular disease that may interfere with disease activity assessments. Previously treated with intravenous immunoglobulins within 6 months prior to first dose of study drug. Patients requiring prohibited concomitant medications including moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors, CYP3A inducers and Biologic Response Modifiers (BRMs) while on study.
