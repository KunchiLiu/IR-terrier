	<brief_summary>The use of tacrolimus in the long term as part of the immunosuppressive regimen after transplantation is associated to complications such as chronic nephrotoxicity, impaired glucose metabolism (diabetes mellitus) and an increase of the incidence of neoplasia. The conversion from a tacrolimus based therapy to a sirolimus based therapy associated with mycophenolate mofetil could improve the incidence of such complications. The aim of this study is to assess the risk/benefit ratio of this switch performed in stable renal transplant recipient between 12 months and 36 months after transplantation. The incidence of a composite endpoint (worsening of GFR evaluated by MDRD formula, incidence of cancer and diabetes) will be assessed 24 months after conversion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Compare the Safety and Efficacy of Sirolimus (Rapamune) to Tacrolimus (Advagraf) Associated to Mycophenolate Mofetil (CellCept) Between 12 and 36 Months After Kidney Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two doses of Sirolimus will be evaluated accorded to the CYP 3A5 genotype. Patients carrying at least CYP 3A5 *1 allele will receive 4 mg per day whereas the others (CYP 3A5 *3/*3) will receive 2 mg.</detailed_description>
