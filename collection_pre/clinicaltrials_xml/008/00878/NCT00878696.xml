	<brief_summary>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is already broadly used in different areas of neuroscience research. Last year, special attention was drawn to TMS in tinnitus. The aim of the researchers' study is to investigate the stimulation characteristics of TMS in tinnitus patients, in particularly the effect of tonic and burst stimulation of the superior temporal lobe.</brief_summary>
