	<brief_summary>The antiphospholipid-antibody syndrome (APLA), which includes lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-beta-2-glycoproteinI antibodies, is a thrombophilic disorder associated with arterial thrombosis, venous thrombosis or both. Patients diagnosed with APLA have a higher risk of recurrent thrombosis than do patients without known antibodies. Currently, warfarin is considered the anticoagulant of choice for prophylactic antithrombotic treatment for APLA patients after their first episode of thrombosis. In some patients with APLA who are treated with warfarin, the INR values determined on plasma are unreliable due to an influence of the APLA on the INR. In these individuals, alternative monitoring methods, such as factor II activity, chromogenic factor X activity or prothrombin-proconvertin time should be used to assess adequate anticoagulation. These tests are expensive and not widely available to some clinicians. Point-of-care (POC) instruments, on the other hand, are readily accessible to clinicians. Previous research has shown that INR values from 3 older point-of-care (POC) instruments are unreliable in 1/3 of APLA patients (CoaguChekTM, ProTimeTM, INRatioTM). However, there are now newer versions of these POC instruments available (CoaguChek XSTM, an investigational ProTime device, and a newer INRatioTM device) and it is unknown if these newer POC instruments are reliable in patients with APLA. The purpose of this study is to determine whether newer POC instruments are reliable in patients with APLA.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>APLA Prolongation of a phospholipiddependent screening assay, 2) lack of correction of a prolonged screening assay after a 1:1 mix with pooled normal plasma, and 3) correction of a prolonged screening assay by the addition of excess phospholipid. Two positive lupus anticoagulant confirmations at least 3 months apart will be required. Diagnosis of anticardiolipin antibodies defined as elevated levels of ACAIgG (&gt;30) and/or ACAIgM (&gt;15) on two separate occasions at least 3 months apart. Stable warfarin therapy, defined as the maintenance of a warfarin dose for a minimal of 2 weeks regardless of INR. APLA Patients whose warfarin dose has changed within the past 2 weeks. Control No evidence of either a positive LA or ACA diagnosis by confirmation of negative laboratory values and/or documentation of no clinical signs and symptoms concurrent with these conditions. Stable warfarin therapy, defined as the maintenance of a warfarin dose for a minimal of 2 weeks regardless of INR. Control Patients whose warfarin dose has changed within the past 2 weeks.</criteria>
