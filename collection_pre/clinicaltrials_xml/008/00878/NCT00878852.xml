	<brief_summary>Cannabis use among Spanish adolescents has been increasing in the last decade. It has been related to poor school achievement, delinquency, substance use and psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, psychoactive substance use in adolescents presenting psychiatric disorders can result in the development of substance use disorders or the worsening of psychopathology. Thus, there's an urge to develop efficient interventions in the treatment of these disorders. Therapeutic approaches based on cognitive-behavioural therapy and motivational interviewing have demonstrated a limited efficacy in this population. Programs based on contingency management have been reported to be useful both in adult and adolescents, too. But it still remains unclear whether a combination of these therapeutic approaches is feasible and brings a better cost-benefit relation. The investigators' project aims to evaluate the added benefits of supplementing a standard intervention on cannabis use, based on combined approach that includes motivational and cognitive-behavioural elements, with a contingency management program. Therefore, pre and post-treatment evaluation will be carried forward in a sample of 30 adolescents (aged 12-18) that initiate treatment for cannabis use related disorder at the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Department of the Hospital Clinic in Barcelona. Participants will be randomly assigned to a standard treatment group or an experimental group in which standard treatment will be supplemented with a contingency management protocol. As a secondary objective, a prospective assessment of neuropsychological performance related to cannabis use or abstinence will be carried forward.</brief_summary>
