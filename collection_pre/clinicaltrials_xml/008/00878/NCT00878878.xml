	<criteria>Must be already scheduled for left and/or right heart catheterization for clinical reasons. Must be in sinus rhythm, without an arrhythmia likely to affect the ability to assess pulmonary hemodynamics by catheterization, as determined by the investigator. Women of childbearing potential must be using adequate birth control and have a negative pregnancy test. History of righttoleft, bidirectional, or transient righttoleft cardiac shunts or diagnosed by color flow Doppler echocardiography during screening. Hypersensitivity to Optison, perflutren, blood, blood products, or albumin. Female subjects who are nursing mothers.</criteria>
