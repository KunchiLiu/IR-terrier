	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study Comparing Two Alprazolam 1 mg Tablets Under Fed Conditions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a phase I, open, randomised, crossover, single dose pharmacokinetic study performed in a single centre. The study consists of 2 treatment periods, during which the study subjects will receive the test product and the reference product in a randomised order. During both treatment periods, the study subjects will receive 1 mg of alprazolam as a single oral dose administered after a high-calorie, high-fat meal. Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, the study subjects will eat the standardised meal 30 minutes prior to administration of the study treatments. Blood samples will be drawn during both treatment periods. The duration of the study per subject will be approximately 5 weeks and at most 9 weeks including a screening visit, 2 treatment periods with a wash-out between the study treatment administrations and a post-treatment period.</detailed_description>
