	<brief_summary>The main objective of the trial is to document the safety and antivascular effect of escalating doses of NGR-hTNF, from 60 mcg/sqm to 325 mcg/sqm, in patients affected by advanced or metastatic solid tumors not amenable of standard therapies. Safety will be established by clinical and laboratory assessment according to NCI-CTCAE criteria (version 4.02).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of NGR-hTNF Administered at High Doses in Patient With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumour</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pre-clinical studies provide the support that NGR-TNF is endowed with a higher therapeutic index in animal models and studies of the mechanism of action showed that NGR-TNF can induce tumour necrosis when used at relatively high doses. Recently, a phase I dose-escalation study of NGR-hTNF has explored the dose range between 0.2 and 60 µg/m2, showing DLT at 60 mcg/m2 experienced as transient acute infusion reaction few minutes after the first administration start. Considering the relationship with the infusion of these events, a further dose escalation will be explored in the present phase I study by using both a longer infusion time (i.e., 120 minutes instead of 60 minutes) and a mild premedication. The first cohort (n=4) of patients will be treated with NGR-hTNF administered at 60 mcg/m2 IV every three weeks, that is a dose level 33% higher than MTD and recommended dose selected in the previous phase I trial (i.e., 45 mcg/m2). If ≤1 of 4 patients experience DLT during the first cycle, following cohorts will be treated with escalating doses (from 80 to 325 mcg/m2) of NGR-hTNF IV every three weeks.</detailed_description>
