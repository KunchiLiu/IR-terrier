	<brief_summary>The study is a randomized placebo controlled trial to determine whether repeated postoperative prophylactic ondansetron ("Zofran") administration will prevent postoperative and/or postdischarge nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing ambulatory hip arthroscopy. Ondansetron will be administered in the intra- and post-operative period. These individuals will be followed on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3. It is hypothesized that the incidence of postdischarge nausea and vomiting (PDNV) will be significantly decreased by postoperative prophylactic administration of multiple doses of ondansetron (Zofran).</brief_summary>
