	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of pleural fluid in the laboratory from patients with lung cancer may help doctors identify early lung cancer cells. It may also help the study of lung cancer in the future. PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at malignant pleural effusion samples from patients with primary lung cancer to see if early lung cancer cells can be identified.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identifying Early Lung Cancer Cells in Malignant Pleural Effusion Samples From Patients With Primary Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Isolate and identify lung cancer precursor cells in discarded pleural fluid specimens obtained during routine thoracentesis procedures for the diagnosis and treatment of malignant pleural effusions. OUTLINE: Malignant pleural effusion specimens obtained from the Pathology Department at the University Hospitals of Cleveland are analyzed using an immunomagnetic bead enrichment assay to isolate cells of epithelial origin. The isolated cells are then stained with fluorescent DNA binding dye, Hoechst 33342, and other markers (i.e., CD133, CD24/CD44) and sorted by flow cytometry into progenitor and nonprogenitor subpopulations. The sorted subpopulations are separated and examined functionally by in vitro and in vivo studies. Sphere culture studies are also performed on the sorted subpopulations. The specimens may also be utilized for transcriptional profiling studies, RNAi studies, and for the establishment of long-term cultures and cell lines. DNA is also isolated and stored from tumor and nonepithelial normal cell compartments for future genetic studies on known and unidentified genetic abnormalities contributing to the development of lung cancer, such as EGFR, ErbB2, K-ras, and p53 mutational status.</detailed_description>
