	<brief_summary>Although the prognosis of patients with low-grade glioma (LGG) is generally good, recurrence seems unavoidable in some patients because of the infiltrative growth of the tumors. How to treat LGGs is still under controversy. The role of radiation therapy and chemotherapy in the treatment of LGG need to be further investigated. The purpose of this study is the following: 1. to investigate the role of early radiation therapy in MRI-determined total resected LGGs; 2. to compare the efficacy of early radiation therapy and that of initial chemotherapy in the LGGs without total resection.</brief_summary>
