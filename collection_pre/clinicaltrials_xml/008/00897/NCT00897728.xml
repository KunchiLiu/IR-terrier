	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue and blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research study is looking at tumor and blood samples from women with breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Tumor and Blood Samples From Women With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Assess relapse locally or remotely using biomarkers collected from primary tumor and blood samples from women with breast cancer during the first 2 years after diagnosis. Secondary - Evaluate all relapses. - Assess survival without relapse. - Determine correlation between biomarkers and relapse. OUTLINE: Primary tumor and blood samples collected during usual care of patients during the first 2 years after diagnosis are analyzed for biomarkers useful in monitoring and diagnosing breast cancer.</detailed_description>
