	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Changing the genes in laboratory mice to create a living model of human breast cancer may help doctors learn more about breast cancer. PURPOSE: This research study is developing mouse models of breast cancer using tissue samples that were previously collected from women with breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Developing Mouse Models of Breast Cancer Using Tissue Samples From Women With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To develop new in vivo models of human breast cancer. - To correlate response in this model to actual treatment outcome in patients, if the in vivo model is proven feasible. OUTLINE: Previously collected breast tumor fragments are implanted into the renal capsule site of SCID mouse hosts (mouse with severe combined immune deficiency) to establish metastatic spread patterns, and both histologic and molecular tumor characteristics. Patients' medical charts are reviewed to obtain relevant information, including general demographics, smoking and alcohol use, as well as outcome data such as survival and response to treatment.</detailed_description>
