	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and bone marrow from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about T cells and plan better treatment for multiple myeloma. PURPOSE: This research study is looking at T cells in blood and bone marrow samples from patients with multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Studying T Cells in Blood and Bone Marrow Samples From Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To evaluate the feasibility of expanding myeloma-specific T cells using autologous ex vivo expanded B cells loaded with myeloma antigens as antigen-presenting cells (B-APCs) in peripheral blood and bone marrow samples from patients with multiple myeloma. Secondary - To examine the feasibility of selecting and expanding myeloma-specific T cells ex vivo using interferon γ release and CD3/CD28 stimulation. OUTLINE: Peripheral blood and bone marrow samples are collected periodically for laboratory studies. Samples are analyzed to assess the feasibility of expanding autologous B cells ex vivo using CD40L and IL-4; the antigen-presenting phenotype of autologous B-cell antigen-presenting cells (B-APCs) using flow cytometry; and the antigen-presenting function of B-APCs using ELISPOT and chromium-release assay. Myeloma-specific interferon γ secreting T cells are isolated and selected using Miltenyi beads. The selected myeloma-specific T cells are expanded ex vivo using anti CD3/CD28 beads.</detailed_description>
