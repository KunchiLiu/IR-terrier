	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of deferiprone in subjects with Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA). The secondary objective is to evaluate the long-term efficacy of deferiprone for the treatment of FRDA. The tertiary objectives are to evaluate the effect of deferiprone on: 1. cardiac function, 2. quality of life, and 3. functional status.</brief_summary>
