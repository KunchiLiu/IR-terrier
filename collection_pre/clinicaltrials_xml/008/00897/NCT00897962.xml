	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research study is looking at blood glycan biomarkers in women with stage IV breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Blood Glycan Biomarkers in Women With Stage IV Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To profile serum glycan biomarkers in women with metastatic stage IV breast cancer, healthy controls, and patients with noncancer medical illness. - To determine whether serial serum glycan biomarkers correlate with response of metastatic disease to treatment. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Blood is collected from patients with metastatic breast cancer, patients with noncancerous illness, and healthy volunteers. Samples are analyzed for serum glycan biomarkers by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and Fourier transform ion-cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT ICR MS) methods. Blood samples are collected every 3 months for up to 18 months from patients with metastatic breast cancer. Patients without cancer have a single sample collected.</detailed_description>
