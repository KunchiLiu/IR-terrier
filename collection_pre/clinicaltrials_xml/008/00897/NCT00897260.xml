	<criteria>Patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis at The Vancouver General Hospital or the BCCAVancouver. Eligible patients will have one of the following underlying diseases: High risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first complete remission, with high risk being defined by the presence of t(4;11), t(9;22) or t(1;19) or patients presenting with extreme hyperleukocytosis (WBC &gt;100x109/L) or failure to achieve a complete remission after standard induction therapy. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first complete remission with high risk cytogenetics or failure to achieve complete remission after standard induction therapy. ALL or AML in second or subsequent remission Myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia. Chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic (failed interferon and/or Gleevec) or accelerated phase. Myelodysplastic syndrome with IPSS risk category &gt;Int1 Aplastic anemia NonHodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia or Hodgkin's disease in relapse or second or subsequent remission. Multiple Myeloma No active central nervous system (CNS) disease. No 9/10 or better HLA antigen matched related donor or VUD available. The patient's condition precludes waiting to search and find a VUD in the Unrelated Donor Registries Acceptance of standard blood product support Adequate organ function as defined by current Leukemia/BMT Program of BC standards (Appendix 10.1) Karnofsky performance status â‰¥ 80 (Appendix 10.2) Active infection Pregnancy Significant psychiatric disorder Progressive disease</criteria>
