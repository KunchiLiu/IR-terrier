	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research study is looking at blood samples from patients with non-small cell lung cancer and from healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Blood Samples From Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and From Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Measure plasma cathepsin D levels in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and in healthy volunteers using mass spectometry. - Measure fatty acid synthase levels in these patients and healthy volunteers using mass spectometry. OUTLINE: Blood samples are collected from patients and healthy volunteers to measure the levels of cathepsin D and fatty acid synthase by proteomic profiling and mass spectrometry.</detailed_description>
