	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research study is looking at tumor samples from women who have undergone chemotherapy for breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Studying Tumor Samples From Women Who Have Undergone Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To identify gene sets for risk of recurrence using molecular profiling in samples from women with lymph node-positive or high-risk lymph node-negative breast cancer on clinical trial ECOG-E2197. Secondary - To define a set of significant genes as prognostic markers of recurrence. - To compare the prognostic value of the Oncotype DX™ (ODX) 21 gene assay of clinical trial with gene sets determined in this study. - To compare the DASL™ assay of the ODX 21 genes with ODX assay results of clinical trial. - To compare the prognostic value of selected genes with gene sets determined in this study. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Samples are used in molecular profiling by applying a custom panel of breast cancer-related genes to a cDNA-mediated Annealing, Selection, Extension, and Ligation (DASL™) assay, immunohistochemistry, and other studies.</detailed_description>
