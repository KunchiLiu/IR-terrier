	<brief_summary>Red yeast rice may be useful to lower cholesterol, especially in a population of patients who cannot tolerate traditional therapy with statins. The addition of an over-the-counter phytosterol to red yeast rice may offer additional lipid lowering benefits when compared to red yeast rice alone. These supplements will be given to all participants. Up to one-half will enroll in a lifestyle intervention program called Change of Heart and will be compared to patients who do not participate in the program. The study will last one year.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Red Yeast Rice and Phytosterols In Statin Intolerance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although recent studies have shown that red yeast rice is an effective therapy in the treatment of hyperlipidemia, additional supplements may be required to lower cholesterol to levels that have been associated with decreased coronary events. Specifically a target has been to lower low-density lipoprotein-C (LDL-C) to levels below 100 mg/dl. Red yeast rice has been found to be effective in lowering cholesterol in the context of the Change of Heart Program, where participants are encouraged to make significant lifestyle changes. This has been documented in two recent trials that we have published in the past year in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings (July 2008) and The Annals of Internal Medicine (in press). Clinically, we have found it necessary to add a phytosterol supplement to red yeast rice to lower LDL-C levels below 100 mg/dl. There has been a great deal of interest in phytosterols in both the lay and medical press in the past several years. This over the counter supplement lowers cholesterol by acting in the intestine to decrease the absorption of cholesterol. As it is not absorbed, there have not been any reports of significant side effects. The purpose of this study is to examine the lipid lowering effects of red yeast rice with and without adding a phytosterol. Some participants will attend the Change of Heart Program and take these supplements. Another group of participants will take the same supplements, with their usual medical care, but not enroll in the Change of Heart Program. The study will last one year, and participants will have been intolerant of statins in the past.</detailed_description>
