	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that may occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This laboratory study is examining blood samples from patients with cancer to identify biomarkers that may help in the early detection of pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identification of Biomarkers for Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Identify specific proteins of interest to evaluate for their potential role as markers for pancreatic cancer. - Analyze serum proteins directly by mass spectrometry to identify new biomarkers of pancreatic cancer that can be used for early diagnosis. OUTLINE: Blood from patients is collected prior to treatment. Plasma proteins are analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) and/or electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI/MS). PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
