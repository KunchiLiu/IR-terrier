	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare and evaluate the efficacy of distilled water vs Mitomycin C on preventing the recurrences of intermediate risk group recurrent superficial bladder cancer administered as a single dose immediate instillation after complete Transurethral Resection(TUR) of the tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Distilled Water Versus Mitomycin C on Preventing Recurrences of Bladder Cancer After Transurethral Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We plan to administer 200ml of distilled water as a single peroperative instillation and block the catheter for 2 hours to our eligible recurrent superficial bladder cancer patients who were in our follow-up schedule since 2002. We plan to look over the histories of the same patients in terms of the pathologies, recurrence patterns, the presence of peroperative intracavitary therapy after their previous TURs for recurrences. So we shall compare the effectiveness of MMC and distilled water on reducing the recurrences over the same patient pool. The patients will be scheduled for a follow-up program after TUR as; - cystoscopy - urine cytology - bladder wash cytology for the probability of recurrence for 2 years to see if there is any difference in the recurrence patterns after instillation with distilled water vs MMC.</detailed_description>
