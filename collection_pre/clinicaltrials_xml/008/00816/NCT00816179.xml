	<brief_title>Diagnostic Endoscopic Exploration for Pancreatic Head Mass</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is being done to find out if an endoscope (a small, flexible tube with a camera mounted on the end) passed down the throat, through the stomach, and into the abdomen can quickly and accurately examine the organs and tissue of the abdomen and take biopsies if needed. We wish to determine if this endoscopic route is as fast and efficient as the laparoscopic route, which is the current standard of care.</detailed_description>
