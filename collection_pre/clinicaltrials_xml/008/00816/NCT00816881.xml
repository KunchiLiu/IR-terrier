	<brief_title>Application and Generalization of Flutter Mucus Clearance Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Respiratory diseases are still increasing in elder population. Sputum detaining is a common contributing factor to acute exacerbation. The fluttering mucus clearance technique is expected to be a physical assisting therapy enhancing airway secretion clearance but need more clinical randomized control trial evidence.</detailed_description>
