	<brief_title>Drug /Cue Interactions In Alcohol-Tobacco Comorbidity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present project will improve and expand upon previously published work in several ways. First, Study 1 will assess reactivity to alcohol and smoking cues in the same session. Second, both studies will include within-subjects design factors to manipulate alcohol and nicotine intake, as well as cue types. Third, craving indices will represent three important response domains: subjective, physiological, and behavioral (e.g., Niaura et al., 1991). Fourth, each study will evaluate a range of drinkers and smokers, which will provide maximal information concerning influences on alcohol and smoking cue reactivity across various subject populations. The proposed studies are not only important from a theory development perspective, but they will provide an excellent foundation for future laboratory-based and clinical research.</detailed_description>
