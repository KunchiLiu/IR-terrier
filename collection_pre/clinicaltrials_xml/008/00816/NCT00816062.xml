	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine, through the endpoints established in this protocol, the long-term safety and effectiveness of the Talent Abdominal Stent Graft System, in a post-approval environment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post-Approval Trial of the Talent™ Abdominal Stent Graft to Treat Aortic Aneurysms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Talent Abdominal Stent Graft System is a next-generation modular system for endovascular repair of AAA. The system was designed with the following enhancements: a suprarenal wire frame to provide migration resistance, and improved flexibility designed to treat difficult anatomies. Medtronic Vascular submitted a Pre-Market Application (PMA) to the FDA on October 17, 2007, and received market approval for the Talent Abdominal Stent Graft System on April 15th, 2008. As a condition of approval, the FDA has requested a post-approval study. Medtronic has therefore designed a post-approval study, in collaboration with FDA, to document the performance of the Talent Abdominal Stent Graft System under market conditions.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject must have an abdominal aortic aneurysm, with or without iliac involvement. Iliac/femoral access vessel morphology that is compatible with vascular access techniques, devices, and/or accessories; A proximal aortic neck length of ≥ 10mm; Proximal aortic neck angulation ≤ 60°; Distal iliac artery fixation length of ≥ 15mm; An aortic neck diameter of 1832mm and iliac artery diameters of 822mm; and Vessel morphology suitable for endovascular repair. Are less than 18 years of age Are pregnant or lactating Have a dominant patent inferior mesenteric artery and an occluded or stenotic celiac and/or superior mesenteric artery Have aneurysmal involvement or occlusion (surgically performed or naturally occurring) of the bilateral internal iliac arteries Have vessels and/or aneurysm dimensions that cannot accommodate the Talent Abdominal Stent Graft as per the indications in Section 3. Have no distal vascular bed (one vessel lower extremity runoff required) Have contraindications for use of contrast medium or anticoagulation drugs Have an uncorrectable coagulopathy Have an SVS/AAVS score greater than 2 Have a mycotic aneurysm Have circumferential mural thrombus in the proximal aortic neck Have had a recent (within 3 months) myocardial infarction (MI), cerebral vascular accident (CVA), or major surgical intervention Have traumatic aortic injury Have leaking, pending rupture or ruptured aneurysms Have pseudoaneurysms resulting from previous graft placement Require a revision to previously placed endovascular stent grafts. Have genetic connective tissue disease (e.g., Marfan's or EhlersDanlos' Syndromes) Have concomitant thoracic aortic or thoracoabdominal aneurysms Are patients with active systemic infections Are patients who have a condition that threatens to infect the graft. Are patients with sensitivities or allergies to the device materials. Have access vessels (as determined by treating physician) that preclude safe insertion of the delivery system. NOTE: Iliac conduits may be used to ensure the safe insertion of the delivery system.</criteria>
