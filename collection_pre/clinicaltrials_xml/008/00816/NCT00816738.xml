	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Treatment of Recurrent Corneal Erosions by Anterior Stromal Puncture With Nd: YAG Laser</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants: From 2000 to 2005, thirty-three eyes in 33 patients with unilaterally recurrent corneal erosions who showed poor response to conservative managements and were treated with Nd:YAG laser were studied. Intervention: Anterior corneal stromal puncture with Nd:YAG laser was performed in the loosened epithelium or epithelial defect area. The causes and frequency of corneal erosions and the spot numbers and total energy of the Nd:YAG laser were recorded. Slit-lamp biomicroscopic examination, refraction, corneal topography, and times of laser were reviewed. A questionnaire regarding the preoperative and postoperative difference in the intensity of pain and frequency of corneal erosion was provided. Main Outcome Measures: Rate of recurrence and pain assessment by numerical rating scale.</detailed_description>
