	<brief_summary>This is the first in human study of AGS-8M4 given every 2 weeks to subjects with advanced ovarian cancer. AGS-8M4 will be administered as an IV infusion until the disease worsens.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of AGS-8M4 in Subjects With Advanced Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All Subjects will receive AGS-8M4 treatment. Subjects will be enrolled sequentially into 1 of the 4 planned dose cohorts according to a standard dose escalation study design. A disease assessment will be performed at study week 9 (+/- 3 days). The assessment will be based on clinical signs and symptoms, changes in radiographic images, and changes in CA-125 levels. Subjects without evidence of disease progression may continue to receive AGS-8M4 during the extended treatment period at the dose and schedule of their assigned cohort until disease progression intolerability of AGS-8M4 or consent withdrawal. For subjects that continue dosing, disease assessments will be performed every 8 weeks during the extended treatment period. A safety follow-up visit will occur 4 weeks after the last infusion of AGS-8M4.</detailed_description>
