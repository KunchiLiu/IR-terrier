	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Dasatinib and vorinostat may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving dasatinib together with vorinostat may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of dasatinib when given together with vorinostat in treating patients with accelerated phase or blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dasatinib and Vorinostat in Treating Patients With Accelerated Phase or Blastic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia or Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To define the maximum tolerated dose of dasatinib and vorinostat in patients with accelerated phase or blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. - To assess the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. - To assess, preliminarily, the efficacy of this regimen in these patients. Secondary - To perform correlative studies relevant to this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral dasatinib twice daily on days 1-21 and oral vorinostat twice daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo bone marrow aspiration and blood sample collection periodically for correlative laboratory studies. Samples are assessed by RT-PCR for DNA damage response and proapoptotic elements (GADD45, FANC, and FOXO3A); cytogenetic analysis; flow cytometry; mutation analysis of bcr-abl; and gene expression array analysis.</detailed_description>
