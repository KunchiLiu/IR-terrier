	<brief_title>Fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET/CT Imaging in Finding Cancer in Patients Undergoing Surgery for Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: 1. To determine if the perioperative PET/CT imaging (consisting of preoperative PET/CT imaging, specimen PET/CT imaging, and postoperative PET/CT imaging) combined with intraoperative use of the handheld gamma probe is feasible during a surgical procedure to resect malignancy. 2. To evaluate if perioperative PET/CT imaging can assist in intraoperatively localizing tumor and verify complete resection of disease. 3. To evaluate intraoperative detection of tumor sites using a handheld gamma probe after preoperative injection of 18F-FDG combined with preoperative PET/CT imaging. 4. To evaluate specimen PET/CT imaging using the preoperative 18F-FDG dose for detecting presence of tumor within the specimen and for assessing surgical margins. 5. To evaluate specimen MRI imaging for detecting presence of tumor within remnant tissue of appropriately selected resected specimens and for assessing surgical margins. 6. To evaluate standard pathology sampling with image guided pathology sampling (using specimen PET/CT imaging) in order to determine if sensitivity and accuracy of pathologic evaluation may be improved with PET/CT image guidance. 7. To compare activity of surgical specimen samples in a well counter and correlate activity with pathologic findings and tumor burden in order to determine if the concepts in the previous two specific aims can be utilized to benefit patients treated at centers without access to PET/CT imaging equipment. OUTLINE: Patients undergo pre- and postoperative fludeoxyglucose F 18 (^18FDG) PET/CT imaging. An intraoperative handheld gamma probe is used to detect ^18FDG-avid tissues. Resected specimens are assessed by ^18FDG PET imaging for intraoperative verification of complete tumor resection.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must be 18 years of age or older. Patients must either have a histologicconfirmed solid malignancy or have a suspected solid malignancy which has required a diagnostic preoperative PET/CT scan or for which a diagnostic preoperative PET/CT scan has been recommended Patients must clinically have been determined to be a candidate for the indicated surgical procedure. Patients may have had prior surgery and/or chemotherapy with no limit to the number of prior therapeutic procedures or chemotherapeutic regimens. Patients must have a performance status of 0, 1 or 2 by ECOG standards. Patients must give written informed consent, including consent to have IV line placed for 18FFDG administration. Females of childbearing age must have a negative pregnancy test (by Beta HCG qualitative analysis), must have had a history of a surgical sterilization, or must give history of no menses in past twelve months. Fasting blood sugar less than 200 mg/dl. Any patient with active CNS tumor involvement. Any patient who is pregnant or lactating. Any patient with a body size and habitus that is determined to prohibit use of the diagnostic equipment. Any patient with a tumor burden that is determined to be so great (as determined by preoperative PET/CT scanning or intraoperative findings) that further surgery is not advised.</criteria>
