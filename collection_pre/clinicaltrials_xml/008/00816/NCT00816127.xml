	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate how effective and cost saving 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (desmopressin, DDAVP) is as opposed to the transfusion of blood products in preventing bleeding after teeth extraction in persons with severe liver disease being evaluated for liver transplant.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevention of Bleeding in Patient With Cirrhosis Undergoing Dental Extraction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Liver cirrhosis is associated with dysregulation of the coagulation system resulting in an increased bleeding tendency in cirrhotic patients. The treatment approach to offset these abnormalities may involve transfusion with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelets. Fluid overload may become a concern as the large amount of FFP (10-20mls/kg or &gt;1,500ml) required to achieve the hemostatic effect could be contraindicated in some patients. Furthermore, repeated platelet transfusion induces alloimmunization and refractoriness to new transfusion, which is an important issue in patients on the waiting list for liver transplantation in which HLA-matched and cross-matched platelets may be required. Non-transfusional drugs that help to stop bleeding have been used in patients with congenital bleeding disorders. 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP, Desmopressin), a synthetic analogue of the antidiuretic hormone, L-arginine, has been used as a non-transfusional form of replacement therapy in a variety of congenital and acquired bleeding disorders. Through unknown mechanisms, DDAVP shortens the prolonged bleeding times of cirrhotic patients despite the high plasma concentrations of Factor VIII and von Willebrand factor sound in chronic liver disease, indicating that it might be useful as a prophylactic treatment in cirrhotic patients undergoing minimally invasive procedures, i.e. dental extraction.</detailed_description>
