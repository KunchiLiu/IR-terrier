	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to estimate the efficacy of intracervical versus paracervical block on pain experienced during first trimester suction curettage without the use of preoperative cervical ripening. Because of the theoretical improved reliability of stromal block, the investigators hypothesize that intracervical block would produce lower pain scores than paracervical block at the time of cervical dilation.</brief_summary>
