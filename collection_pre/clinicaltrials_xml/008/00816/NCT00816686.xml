	<brief_summary>This is a first in human study of AGS-16M18 given every week to subjects with advanced renal cell cancer. AGS-16M18 will be administered as a 60 minute IV infusion on consecutive days until the disease worsens.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of AGS-16M18 in Subjects With Advanced Renal Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be enrolled sequentially into 5 planned dose cohorts according to a standard, dose escalation study design. A disease assessment will be performed at study week 5 (+/- 3 days) by the investigator. The assessment will be based both on changes in clinical symptoms, and radiographic images. Subjects without evidence of disease progression may receive AGS-16M18 extended therapy at the dose and schedule of their assigned cohort until disease progression or intolerability of AGS-16M18. Disease assessments will be performed every 8 weeks during the extended period. A safety follow-up visit will occur 4 weeks after the last infusion of AGS-16M18.</detailed_description>
