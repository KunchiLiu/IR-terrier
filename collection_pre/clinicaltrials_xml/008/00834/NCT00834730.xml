	<brief_summary>- Ketamine provides effective and relatively safe sedation analgesia for primary closure of lacerated pediatric patients - However, deep sedation and adverse effects suggest the opportunity to develop alternative strategies - We compared the efficacy and adverse effects of ketamine to those of N2O gas for analgesia and anxiolysis during primary repair of lacerated pediatric patients</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of N2O Inhalation and Ketamine in Pediatric PSA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- There were 32 children who were randomly assigned - Recovery times were markedly shorter in the N2O group compared with those in the ketamine group (median, 0.0 min (interquartile range [IQR], 0.0-4.0 min) vs. median, 21.5 min (IQR, 12.5-37.5 min), N2O vs. ketamine, respectively, p &lt; 0.05) - Sedation levels were deeper in the ketamine group than in the N2O group, but pain scales were comparable between groups - No difference was observed in the satisfaction scores by physicians, parents, or nurses. - N2O inhalation was preferable to injectable ketamine for pediatric patients because it is safe, allows for a faster recovery, maintains sufficient sedation time, and does not induce unnecessarily deep sedation</detailed_description>
