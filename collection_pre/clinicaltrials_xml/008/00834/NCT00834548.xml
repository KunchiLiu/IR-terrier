	<brief_summary>To compare to different approaches in whole-body magnetic resonance angiography of patients suffering peripheral arterial disease. Our hypothesis is that use of a new protocol improves the diagnostic quality of the WB-MRA procedure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Whole-Body MRA at 3T - A Comparison Between Two Different Scan Protocols</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients suffering peripheral arterial disease must undergo imaging procedures before endovascular or surgical procedures. WB-MRA is an imaging procedure that can visualise the arterial system. WB-MRA can be performed in different manners. On option is to start the scan in the head region and continue down the body to the feet (standard protocol). Another option is to use a hybrid protocol that first examines the head and lower leg followed by examination of the pelvic and upper leg region. A comparison between the standard and hybrid protocols has not been performed in a 3T high magnetic field system, therefore we will perform such a study.</detailed_description>
