	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Noninstitutionalized subjects consisting of university students and members of the community at large. All subjects selected for this study will be males 18 to 45 (inclusive) years of age. Weight of the subjects shall not be more than 15% ± from the normal for height and body frame (Metropolitan Life, 1993, Height, Weight, Body Chart). Each subject shall be given a general physical examination within 21 days of initiation of the study. Such examination includes, but is not limited to, blood pressure, general observations, and history. At the end of the study the subjects will have an exit evaluation consisting of interim history, global evaluation, and clinical laboratory measurements. Adequate blood and urine samples should be obtained within 21 days before the beginning of the first period and at the end of the trial for clinical laboratory measurements. Clinical laboratory measurements will include the following: Hematology: hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, platelets, and white blood cell count (with differential) Clinical Chemistry: creatinine, BUN, glucose, SGOT, SGPT, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase Urine Analysis: pH, specific gravity, protein, glucose, ketones, bilirubin, occult blood, and cells HIV Screen: (prestudy only) HepatitisB, C Screen: (prestudy only) Drugs of Abuse Screen: (prestudy and at each dosing period checkin) Subjects will be selected if all above are normal. Electrocardiograms of all participating subjects will be recorded before initiation of the study and filed with each subject's case report forms. Exclusion Criteria Subjects with a history of chronic alcohol consumption, drug addiction, or serious gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, or cardiovascular disease, tuberculosis, epilepsy, asthma, diabetes, psychosis or glaucoma will not be eligible for this study. Subjects whose clinical laboratory test values are greater than 20% outside the normal range may be retested. If the clinical values are outside the range on retesting the subject will not be eligible to participate in the study unless the clinical investigator deems the result to not be significant. Subjects who have a history of allergic responses to the class of drug being tested should be excluded from the study. Subjects who use tobacco in any form will not be eligible to participate in the study. Three months abstinence is required. All subjects will have urine samples assayed for the presence of drugs of abuse as part of the clinical laboratory screening procedures and at each dosing period checkin. Subjects found to have urine concentrations of any of the tested drugs will not be allowed to participate. Subjects should not have donated blood and/or plasma for at least thirty (30) days prior to the first dosing of the study. Subjects who have taken any investigational drug within thirty (30) days prior to the first dosing of the study will not be allowed to participate. Subjects who have been exposed to known hepatic enzyme inducing or inhibiting agents within (30) days prior to dosing will not be allowed to participate.</criteria>
