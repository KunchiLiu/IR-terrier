	<brief_summary>The purposes of this study were: - To evaluate the plasma pharmacokinetic profile of tramadol and its principal metabolite, the O-desmethyltramadol, after a single oral administration of 100, 200 and 300 mg of tramadol as the Labopharm extended-release formulation prepared with Contramid. - To assess the dose linearity of tramadol and its principal metabolite, the O-desmethyltramadol, between 100 mg and 300 mg following a single dose administration of the Labopharm extended-release formulation prepared with Contramid under fasting conditions in young healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>

Nonsmoker or subjects smoking no more than 5 cigarettes per day (or equivalent) and able to abstain from smoking during inpatient phases of the study. Subjects covered by Social Security in compliance with the recommendations of French Law relating to biomedical research. Subjects with normal dietary requirements (neither vegetarian, nor on a diet). History of hypersensitivity to tramadol or any other compounds.

Presence or significant history of cardiovascular, pulmonary, haematological, neoplasic, neurological, psychiatric, endocrine, immunological or dermatological disease. Presence or significant history of glaucoma. Supine pulse rate lower than 45 beats per minute (bpm) after 5 minutes at rest or higher than 100 bpm. History of hypotensive episodes or a standing systolic blood pressure reading of &lt;100 mmHg or a diastolic reading of &lt;45 mmHg, measured on the screening day. History of hypertensive episodes or a supine systolic blood pressure reading of &gt;145 mmHg or a diastolic reading of &gt;95 mmHg, measured on the screening day.

History of fainting upon blood sampling. Evidence of psychiatric disorder, antagonistic personality, poor motivation, emotional or intellectual problems likely to limit the validity of the consent to participate in the study or to limit the ability to comply with the protocol requirements. Subjects unable to abstain from intensive muscular effort or sport competitions during the week prior to the study and throughout the study itself. Subjects who had forfeited his freedom by administrative or legal award or who were under guardianship.
