If the clinical values are outside the range on retesting, the subject will not be eligible to participate in the study unless the clinical investigator deems the result not to be significant. Subjects who have a history of allergic responses to the class of drug being tested should be excluded from the study. All subjects will have urine samples assayed for the presence of abuse as part of the clinical laboratory screening procedures and ath checkin each study period.
