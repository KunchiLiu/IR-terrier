	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to determine how effective and how safe it is to give an Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) immunotherapy product to participants with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) associated with EBV that has come back or spread to other parts of the participants body. The EBV immunotherapy product will be made with white blood cells from the participants blood and takes about 16 weeks to create. This EBV immunotherapy product may stop cancer cells from growing and cause the tumors to disappear.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study of Epstein-Barr Virus-Specific Immunotherapy for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will register and provide a blood sample which will be used to create the immune therapy product. This will take about 16 weeks during which time they will receive chemotherapy for their nasopharynx cancer. When the immune product is ready the chemotherapy will be stopped and the immunotherapy product will be given to the participant by infusion. On the first day of the research treatment, participants will receive infusion #1 of the EBV immunotherapy product. Fourteen days later, the participant will receive infusion #2. Eight weeks after infusion #2, the research doctor will do some tests to determine the effects that the EBV immunotherapy product has had on the participants tumor. If the research doctor thinks that they would benefit from a third infusion of the EBV immunotherapy product and there is sufficient immunotherapy product remaining, the participant my be given infusion #3. - Before each infusion of the EBV immunotherapy product participants will have a physical exam, blood work and fiberoptic exam of the nasopharynx if needed. - Within 28 days of receiving the EBV immunotherapy product for the first time, we will evaluate the participants tumor by using CT scan and/or MRI.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically proven NPC of an WHO grade, associated with EBV infection documented by the presence of EBER expression by in situ hybridization in the tumor. Positive EBER staining from another institution must be confirmed by pathology review at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Other confirmation of EBVassociated disease is acceptable, such as EBV DNA in situ hybridization, if EBER analysis is not adequate Incurable NPC Recovery from toxicity from any prior NPC therapy to grade 1 or better 18 years of age or older Evaluable or measurable disease, according to modified RECIST ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1 Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function as outlined in protocol Radiotherapy for primary NPC within 8 weeks of enrollment, or radiotherapy for any other reason within 6 weeks Chemotherapy for NPC within 2 weeks of enrollment Other cancer in the past 5 years, except for carcinoma in situ of the cervix or bladder, or nonmelanomatous skin cancer Uncontrolled central nervous system metastases Active hepatitis, known HIV, or other condition that requires immunosuppressive therapy, including current use of high dose systemic corticosteroids Autoimmune disease, such as systemic lupus erythematosis or rheumatoid arthritis, that is active and requires current immunosuppressive therapy Active uncontrolled serious infection Women of childbearing potential who have a positive pregnancy test or are breastfeeding</criteria>
