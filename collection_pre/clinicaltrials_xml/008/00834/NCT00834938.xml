	<brief_summary>Bariatric surgery can lead to improvement or even resolution of type 2 diabetes in about 80% of patients submitted to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGP). Otherwise, many patients experienced no resolution of their diabetes despite massive surgical-induced weight loss. There appears to be a variable response to surgery depending on surgical and patient factors. To explore potential factors affecting diabetes outcomes after RYGP, this study is proposed to make a description of effects of surgical procedures on incretin, insulin production and sensitivity and a comparison between patients with or without remission of Type 2 Diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Between Patients With or Without Diabetes Recovery After Bariatric Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes reversion is observed after bariatric surgeries even before significant weight loss could explain it, mainly in predominantly malabsorptive procedures (98,9% for biliopancreatic diversion or duodenal switch), followed by those combining malabsorption and gastric restriction (83,7% for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass). Changes in the hormonal communication between the digestive system and the pancreas would explain the antidiabetogenic role of the surgery, so this effect could be obtained in nonobese, diabetic individuals. To explore potential factors affecting diabetes outcomes after RYGP, this study is proposed to make a description of effects of surgical procedures on incretin, insulin production and sensitivity and a comparison between patients with or without remission of Type 2 Diabetes.</detailed_description>
