	<criteria>All subjects selected for this study will be nonsmokers at least 18 years of age. Subjects will have a BMI (body mass index) between 19 kg/m² and 30 kg/m² (inclusive). Each subject will be given a general physical examination within 28 days of initiation of the study. Such examination includes but is not limited to blood pressure, general observations, and history. Each female subject will be given a serum pregnancy test as part of the prestudy screening process. Adequate blood and urine samples should be obtained within 28 days before beginning of the first period and at the end of the trial for clinical laboratory measurements. Clinical laboratory measurements will include the following: Hematology: hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, platelets, and white blood cell count (with differential). Clinical Chemistry: creatinine, BUN, glucose, SGOT, SGPT, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase. Urine Analysis: pH, specific gravity, protein, glucose, ketones, bilirubin, occult blood, and cells. HIV Screen HepatitisB, C Screen Drugs of Abuse Screen: prestudy and at each dosing period checkin Subjects will be selected if all above are normal. Electrocardiograms of all participating subjects will be recorded before initiation of the study and filed with each subject's case report forms. Subjects with a history of alcoholism or drug addiction (during past 2 years) or serious gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic or cardiovascular disease, tuberculosis, epilepsy, asthma (during past 5 years), diabetes, psychosis or glaucoma will not be eligible for this study. Subjects whose clinical laboratory test values are outside the reference range may be retested at the discretion of the clinical investigator. If the clinical values are outside the range on retesting, the subject will not be eligible to participate in the study unless the clinical investigator deems the result to not be significant. Subjects who have a history of allergic responses to the class of drug being tested (including penicillin, any penicillin derivative, or any cephalosporin product) should be excluded from the study. All subjects will have urine/saliva samples assayed for the presence of drugs of abuse as part of the clinical laboratory screening procedures and at each study period checkin. Subjects found to have urin/saliva concentrations of any of the tested drugs will not be allowed to participate. Subjects should not have donated blood and/or plasma for at least thirty (30) days prior to the first dosing of the study. Subjects who have taken any investigational drug within thirty (30) days prior to the first dosing of the study will not be allowed to participate. Female subjects who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or who are likely to become pregnant during the study will not be allowed to participate. Female subjects of child bearing potential must either abstain from sexual intercourse or use a reliable barrier method (e.g. condom, IUD) of contraception during the course of the study (first dosing until last blood collection) or they will not be allowed to participate. Subjects who have used implanted or injected hormonal contraceptives anytime during the 6 months prior to study dosing, or used oral hormonal contraceptives within 14 days before dosing will not be allowed to participate. All female subjects will be screened for pregnancy at checkin each study period. Subjects with positive or inconclusive results will be withdrawn from the study. Subjects who do not tolerate venipuncture will not be allowed to participate. Subjects who use tobacco in any form will not be eligible to participate in the study. Three months abstinence is require. Subjects who have difficulty fasting or consuming the standard meals will not be allowed to participate. Subjects who have had a clinically significant illness within 4 weeks prior to the first dosing of the study will not be allowed to participate. Subjects who have used a known hepatic enzyme inducer or inhibitor within 30 days prior to the first dosing of the study will not be allowed to participate.</criteria>
