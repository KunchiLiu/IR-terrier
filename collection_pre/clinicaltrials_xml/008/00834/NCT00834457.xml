	<brief_summary>Open-label study of a regimen of antiretrovirals for the treatment of AIDS-KS. This study will be conducted at a single site, the Parirenyatwa Hospital KS Clinic. Step 1 was conducted to determine the extent of clinical resolution of AIDS-KS disease in response to treatment with antiretroviral therapy and to investigate whether clinical resolution of KS is associated with suppression of KSHV replication. Step 2 was developed to then evaluate the clinical, immunological, and virological effects of a switch from a twice-daily all-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) antiretroviral regimen to a once-daily regimen of 2 NRTIs plus a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor in persons with AIDS-KS and good virologic suppression an all NRTI regimen. Step 3 was included to evaluate the clinical, immunological, and virological effects of intensification with a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor in persons with AIDS-KS who have virological failure on an all NRTI regimen.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Of the Effects of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy on Kaposi's Sarcoma in Zimbabwe</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To identify factors associated with successful treatment of KS with antiretroviral therapy and to determine if highly active antiretroviral therapy improves survival and quality of life for persons with AIDS-KS in Zimbabwe. A secondary objective is to investigate the durability of HIV-1 suppression by the combination of ABC/3TC/ZDV in persons infected with HIV-1 subtype C and to evaluate the timing and characteristics of mutations in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase in subjects who fail to achieve, or to maintain suppression of HIV-1 replication during treatment with ABC/3TC/ZDV. An important objective is to assess adherence to a simplified antiretroviral regimen in a resource-limited setting. The study will evaluate the clinical, immunological, and virological effects of a switch from a twice-daily all-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) antiretroviral regimen to a once-daily regimen of 2 NRTIs plus a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor in persons with AIDS-KS and good virologic suppression on ABC/3TC/ZDV (see above).</detailed_description>
