	<brief_summary>No accurate, inexpensive and non-invasive test for gastric cancer screening is currently available. The investigators' recent study identified a1-antitrypsin and other proteins as potential biomarkers of gastric cancer in gastric juice. The aim of this study was to develop a novel non-invasive modality for detecting gastric cancer by measurement of biomarkers in gastric juice.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients and methods: The study consisted of two parts: (1) investigating the differences in gastric juice biomarker concentrations between gastric cancer patients and controls, and (2) screening gastric cancer using string test to obtain gastric juice followed by immunoassay for biomarker concentration.</detailed_description>
