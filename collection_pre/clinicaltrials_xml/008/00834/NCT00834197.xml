	<criteria>Screening Demographics: All subjects selected for this study will be healthy men or women 18 years of age or older at the time of dosing. The subject's body mass index (BMI) should be less than or equal to 30. Screening Procedures: Each subject will complete the screening process within 28 days prior to Period I dosing. Consent documents for both the screening evaluation and HIV antibody determination will be reviewed, discussed, and signed by each potential participant before fill implementation of screening procedures. Screening will include general observations, physical examination, demographics, medical and medication history, an electrocardiogram, sitting blood pressure and heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature. The physical examination will include, but may not be limited to, an evaluation of the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory and central nervous systems. The screening clinical laboratory will include: Hematology: hematocrit, hemoglobin, WBC count with differential, RBC count, platelet count; Clinical Chemistry: serum creatinine, BUN, glucose, AST(GOT), ALT(GPT), albumin, total bilirubin, total protein, and alkaline phosphatase; HIV antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis C antibody screens; Urinalysis: by dipstick; full microscopic examination of dipstick positive; and Urine Drug Screen: ethyl alcohol, amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine metabolites, opiates and phencyclidine. Serum Pregnancy Screen (female subjects only) If female and: of childbearing potential, is practicing an acceptable barrier method of birth control for the duration of the study as judged by the investigator(s), such as condoms, sponge, foams, jellies, diaphragm, intrauterine device (IUD), or abstinence; or is postmenopausal for at least 1 year; or is surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy). Subjects with a recent history of drug or alcohol addiction or abuse. Subjects with the presence of a clinically significant disorder involving the cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, immunologic, hematologic, endocrine, or neurologic system(s) or psychiatric disease (as determined by the clinical investigators). Subjects whose clinical laboratory test values are outside the accepted reference range and when confirmed on reexamination are deemed to be clinically significant. Subjects demonstrating a positive hepatitis B surface antigen screen, hepatitis C antibody screen, or a reactive HIV antibody screen. Subjects demonstrating a positive pregnancy screen. Subjects who are currently breastfeeding. Subjects with a history of clinically significant allergies including drug allergies. Subjects with a history of allergic response(s) to mirtazapine or related drugs.

Subjects who report donating greater than 150 mL of blood within 28 days prior to Period I dosing. All subjects will be advised not to donate blood for four weeks after completing the study. Subjects who have donated plasma (e.g. plasmapheresis) within 14 days prior to Period I dosing. All subjects will be advised not to donate plasma for four weeks after completing the study. Subjects who report receiving any investigational drug within 28 days prior to Period I dosing. Subjects who report taking any systemic prescription medication in the 14 days prior to Period I dosing. Subjects who report an intolerance of direct venipuncture.
