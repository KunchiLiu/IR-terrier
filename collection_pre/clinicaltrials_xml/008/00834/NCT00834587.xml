	<criteria>Screening Demographics: All subjects selected for this study will be healthy men and women 1845 years of age, inclusive, at the time of dosing. The subject's body mass index (BMI) should be less than or equal to 30. Screening Procedures: Each subject will complete the screening process within 28 days prior to Period I dosing. Consent documents for both the screening evaluation and HIV antibody determination will be reviewed, discussed, and signed by each potential participant before full implementation of screening procedures. Screening will include general observations, physical examination, demographics, medical and medication history, an electrocardiogram, sitting blood pressure and heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature. The physical examination will include, but may not be limited to, an evaluation of the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory and central nervous systems. The screening clinical laboratory procedures will include: Hematology: hematocrit, hemoglobin, WBC count with differential, RBC count, platelet count; Clinical Chemistry: serum creatinine, BUN, glucose, AST(GOT), ALT(GPT), albumin, total bilirubin, total protein, and alkaline phosphatase; HIV antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis C antibody screens; Urinalysis: by dipstick; full microscopic examination if dipstick positive; and Urine Drug Screen: ethyl alcohol, amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine metabolites, opiates, and phencyclidine. Serum Pregnancy Screen If female and: of childbearing potential, is practicing an acceptable method of birth control for the duration of the study as judged by the investigator(s), such as condom with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, intrauterine device (IUD), or abstinence; or is postmenopausal for at least 1 year; or is surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy). Subjects with a recent history of drug or alcohol addiction or abuse. Subjects with the presence of a clinically significant disorder involving the cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, gastrointestinal, immunologic, hematologic, endocrine, or neurologic system(s) or psychiatric disease (as determined by the clinical investigators). Subjects whose clinical laboratory test values are outside the accepted reference range and when confirmed on reexamination are deemed to be clinically significant. Subjects demonstrating a reactive hepatitis B surface antigen screen, a reactive hepatitis C antibody screen, or a reactive HIV antibody screen. Subjects demonstrating a positive drug abuse screen when screened for this study. Female subjects demonstrating a positive pregnancy screen. Female subjects who are currently breastfeeding. Subjects with a history of allergic response(s) to glipizide, metformin hydrochloride, or related drugs. Subjects with a history of clinically significant allergies including drug allergies. Subjects with a clinically significant illness during the 4 weeks prior to Period I dosing (as determined by the clinical investigators). Subjects who currently use or report using tobacco products within 90 days of Period I dose administration. Subjects who have taken any drug known to induce or inhibit hepatic drug metabolism in the 28 days prior to Period I dosing. Subjects who report donating greater than 150 mL of blood within 28 days prior to Period I dosing. All subjects will be advised not to donate blood for four weeks after completing the study. Subjects who have donated plasma (e.g. plasmapheresis) within 14 days prior to Period I dosing. All subjects will be advised not to donate plasma for four weeks after completing the study. Subjects who report receiving any investigational drug within 28 days prior to Period I dosing. Subjects who report taking any systemic prescription medication in the 14 days prior to Period I dosing. Subjects who report an intolerance of direct venipuncture. Subjects who report consuming an abnormal diet during the 28 days prior to Period I dosing.</criteria>
