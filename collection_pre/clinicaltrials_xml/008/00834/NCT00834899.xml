	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety of eptifibatide in sickle cell patients and how well it works during the course of painful crises. The overall hypothesis that we seek to test is that increased platelet activation and the resultant inflammatory responses are important contributors to the problems of sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease has been referred to both as a condition associated with increased risk of blood clots and increased inflammation. A painful crisis represents the most common cli nical problem in sickle cell disease, but the treatment of these crises remains inadequate.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety Study of Eptifibatide in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease has been referred to both as a condition associated with increased risk of blood clots and increased inflammation. Despite the abundant laboratory evidence of abnormal blood clotting and inflammation, the contribution of these changes to the problems experienced by patients with sickle cell disease remains uncertain. In additional to abnormal blood clotting, platelets (small blood cells that help blood clotting) are more activated in sickle cell disease patients compared to healthy patients without this disease. In addition, when sickle cell disease patients experience a painful crisis, there is evidence that the platelet activation and abnormal blood clotting increase even further. Activated platelets release a substance called cluster of designation 40 ligand, which can increase how sticky the lining of blood vessels are and can increase the abnormal blood clotting. The level of cluster of designation 40 ligand is much higher in sickle cell disease patients compared to healthy individuals without this disease. In addition, the levels increase even further when sickle cell patients are experiencing a painful crisis. Painful crisis represent the most common clinical problem in sickle cell disease, and are largely responsible for making the lives of these patients so unpredictable. However, the treatment of these painful crisis remains inadequate, consisting mainly of strong pain medications. In this study, we will evaluate the safety of eptifibatide in sickle cell patients and how well it works during the course of painful crises. At the completion of this trial, we will have an improved understanding of the contribution of platelet activation and inflammation to the problems in sickle cell disease. The overall hypothesis that we seek to test is that increased platelet activation and the resultant inflammatory responses are important contributors to the problems of sickle cell disease. We believe that by decreasing platelet stickiness, and the release of mediators of inflammation and abnormal blood clotting, eptifibatide will affect the clinical course of complications in this disease. If the results from our study support the hypothesis that eptifibatide is safe and effective in this population, we plan on carrying out larger studies to more definitively evaluate the safety of eptifibatide and how well it works in the treatment and/or prevention of painful crises in sickle cell disease.</detailed_description>
