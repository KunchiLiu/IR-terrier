	<brief_title>Safety Study of PEGPH20 Given to Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a study of PEGPH20 in human subjects and is designed to evaluate the safety of PEGPH20 and to determine the maximum tolerated dose of PEGPH20. All patients will receive PEGPH20. Each group of patients will receive a higher dose than the previous group. This will continue until the group with the highest planned dose completes the study or until a group has major side effects from their assigned dose.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Pathologic (histologic or cytologic) confirmation of metastatic or locally advanced solid tumor. Patients who have experienced disease progression after receiving appropriate standard / approved chemotherapy and for whom no further standard or palliative treatment measures exist, or who have chosen to decline standard or palliative treatment. One or more tumors measurable by RECIST criteria. Karnofsky performance status â‰¥ 70%. Recovery from any toxic or other effects of all previous therapy, including radiation, chemotherapy and surgery. Negative serum or urine pregnancy test result in women of childbearing potential.
