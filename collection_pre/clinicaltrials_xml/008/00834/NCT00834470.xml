	<brief_summary>- Ketamine seems an obvious choice in the setting of an emergency department - Ketamine leads to increased production of salivary and tracheal secretions - Antisialagogues(atropine)therefore have been recommended as a routine adjunct - We compare atropine with placebo as an adjunct to ketamine sedation in children undergoing primary closure of lacerated wound</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjunctive Atropine During Ketamine Sedation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The degree of secretion was significantly less in the atropine group compared with the control group at the end of the procedure (VAS score: 16.5 ± 9.9 vs. 27.0 ± 15.9, atropine vs. control, p = 0.00). The change in the degree of secretion between the start and end of the procedure was significantly greater in the atropine group than in the control group (p = 0.00) (Fig. 2). However, the frequency of hypersalivation as predefined (VAS score ≥50) did not differ between the groups (p = 0.06). The only complication that differed significantly between the two groups was tachycardia (p &gt; 0.05). Complications such as aspiration, laryngospasm, and apnea were not documented in the hospital. There were fewer interventions for hypersalivation in the atropine group, but the difference was not significant (p &gt; 0.05). As interventions, O2 administration and endotracheal intubation were not needed. After discharge, the control patients tended to have more complaints of nausea, vomiting, and ataxia, although the difference was not significant (p &gt; 0.05) Heart rate was increased significantly in the atropine group (p = 0.00). The frequency of tachycardia according to patient age was also significantly higher in the atropine group than in the control group (p = 0.00)</detailed_description>
