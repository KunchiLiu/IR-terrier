	<brief_title>Safety and PK of Nikkomycin Z in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol will serve as a Phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multiple-dose study to evaluate the safety, tolerance and pharmacokinetics of nikkomycin Z. Nikkomycin Z has previously been studied in a single dose protocol in healthy male subjects. This study is designed to run in parallel to protocol VFCE-2007-001 to provide additional data on safety and pharmacokinetics. The study will involve a total of 32 subjects (6 active/2 placebo per group) with a multiple, rising dose strategy.</detailed_description>
