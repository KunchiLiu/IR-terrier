	<brief_summary>Severe sepsis and septic shock are diseases of infectious origin with a high risk of death. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the intravenous application of selenium (given as sodium-selenite) can reduce mortality in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Additionally, it is investigated, whether the measurement of procalcitonin - a marker of infection - can be used to guide anti-infectious measures in this disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Placebo Controlled Trial of Sodium Selenite and Procalcitonin Guided Antimicrobial Therapy in Severe Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter trial of the German Network Sepsis (SepNet) on patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. This study is supported by unrestricted grants. The release of reactive oxygen species is an important factor in the development of sepsis induced multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. Common protection mechanisms are impaired in this syndrome. Serum levels of selenium, a cofactor of the glutathionperoxidase, are reduced. Several studies suggest a benefit of selenium application in patients with severe sepsis but data from large clinical trials are not available. After inclusion into the study, patients are randomly allocated to a placebo or selenium group. Treating physicians and patients are blinded regarding the allocation. The selenium group receives sodium selenite intravenously - 1000 µg as a bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 1000 µg per day until the end of ICU treatment but not longer than 21 days. Procalcitonin (PCT) is a biomarker which is elevated in the blood of patients with severe sepsis/septic shock. Data from patients with community acquired pneumonia demonstrated that this biomarker can be used to decide on the duration of antimicrobial therapy. Studies with small sample size seem to confirm this in ICU patients with severe sepsis. However, this needs to be confirmed in a larger cohort. All patients are randomly allocated to a PCT guided algorithm or a control group. In the PCT-guided group, PCT is measured at randomization, day 4, 7, 10, and 14. Depending on the PCT course, the protocol recommends to change, alter, or stop anti-infectious measures. In the control group, anti-infectious therapy is left to the discretion of the treating physician.</detailed_description>
