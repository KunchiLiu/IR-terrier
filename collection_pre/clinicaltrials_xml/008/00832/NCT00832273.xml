	<brief_summary>VTI had established other clinical protocols to study the effects of ELAD® plus standard therapy compared with standard therapy alone in patients with acute on chronic (AOCH) (VTI-201, VTI-206) and fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) (VTI-202) and acute alcoholic hepatitis (AAH). However, liver failure (LF) patients who do not qualify for other protocols may benefit from ELAD use. In order to accommodate physician requests for the use of ELAD in LF patients who do not qualify for open Protocols, without the need to resort to individual Emergency Use INDs for each case, VTI has developed a Treatment Protocol with Cost Recovery to provide for expanded access to ELAD for those with LF. This uncontrolled Treatment Protocol has been designed to provide expanded access to ELAD in subjects with LF while assuring that sufficient data are collected to adequately monitor ELAD safety when used in this setting at multiple centers in the United States.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of the ELAD® in Patients With Liver Failure to Provide Expanded Access With Cost Recovery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ELAD® therapy is designed to provide continuous liver support to a subject with compromised liver function, allowing time for the subject's native liver to regenerate to a healthy state, or to stabilize the subject until a suitable donor organ can be found for transplantation.</detailed_description>
