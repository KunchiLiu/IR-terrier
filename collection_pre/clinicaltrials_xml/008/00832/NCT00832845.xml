	<brief_summary>Schizophrenia is associated with significant cognitive and functional deficits. As patients with schizophrenia grow older, the impact of these deficits at a personal and public health level is likely to increase. Cognitive Behavioral and Social Skills Training (CBSST) is a recently developed group therapy that increased the frequency of social activities among middle-aged patients with schizophrenia. It also increased cognitive insight, a measure of the ability to reduce confidence in aberrant beliefs. To date, CBSST has not been studied in late-life schizophrenia. In addition, its impact on medications management, an instrumental function that is particularly salient in late life, and its interactions with cognition are largely unknown. Thus, we propose to study the efficacy of CBSST in improving social skills and medications management in patients with late-life schizophrenia, and to study the interactions between the patients' cognitive characteristics and their response to CBSST. Previous studies show that cognitive deficits are strong predictors of response to CBSST. Cognitive Remediation Treatments (CRTs) have been shown to improve cognition in patients with schizophrenia especially when combined with psychosocial interventions that focus on function such as CBSST. Thus, we also propose to assess the tolerability and impact of CRT on patients with late-life schizophrenia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cognitive Behavioral Social Skills Training for Patients With Late-Life Schizophrenia: a Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eighty subjects will be randomized into 2 arms, CBSST Group and Treatment as Usual Group. Both Arms will run for a total of 52 weeks. The CBSST Group will attend 2-hour weekly sessions for 9 months and attend follow up assessments every 4 months. The Treatment as Usual Group will continue with their normal psychiatric treatment as usual and also attend follow up assessments every 4 months. After subjects in the Treatment as Usual Arm finish, they will continue on to the CBSST Group arm. After the completion of the CBSST Group Arm, 24 subjects who are willing to consent to CRT will continue with an additional 2-hour weekly session of Cognitive Remediation Treatment for 8 weeks.</detailed_description>
