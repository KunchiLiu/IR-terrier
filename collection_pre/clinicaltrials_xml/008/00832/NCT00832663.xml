	<detailed_description>The model employed to induce muscle damage is electrical stimulation. Muscle biopsies will be examined to follow the response of satellite cells and muscle regeneration. Study participants will be randomly assigned to a placebo or NSAID group in a double-blinded manner.</detailed_description>
