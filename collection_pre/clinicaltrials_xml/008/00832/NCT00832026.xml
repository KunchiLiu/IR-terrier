	<brief_summary>This research is being done to examine if a nasal cannula can be used to keep the throat open during sleep, thereby treating sleep apnea. People with sleep apnea and people who snore without sleep apnea may take part in this study. Sleep apnea is a disorder caused by pauses in breathing due to repetitive closure of the throat. The most common form of treatment for sleep apnea is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. While CPAP therapy remains the simplest and most effective treatment for snoring and sleep apnea, patients have to wear a nasal mask throughout the night. For this reason, patients often have difficulty sticking to therapy. Participants enrolled in this study will spend 3-nights in a sleep laboratory. In all nights, the investigators will monitor your sleep and your breathing throughout the night. The investigators will apply several electrodes (sensors) to your scalp and face to monitor your sleep and breathing, and other sensors to your chest, abdomen, cheek, and a finger to monitor your breathing and oxygen level.</brief_summary>
