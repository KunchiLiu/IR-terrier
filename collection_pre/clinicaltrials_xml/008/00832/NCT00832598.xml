	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to help us understand gliomas, one type of brain tumor. This research protocol makes pictures of gliomas. We will take pictures of the glioma before and after treatment. The pictures are made with a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner. PET scans use radioactive markers to "see" cancer cells. We plan to use two different radioactive markers, [18F]FACBC and [18F]FLT, to "see" if the glioma responds to the treatment being recommended by the doctor. We are investigating whether one or both of these types of PET scans can help us to better understand gliomas and their response to treatment. We expect these pictures will give us information the your tumor and may help us to understand why the treatment that the patient is receiving is affecting the tumor the way that it is. We also hope to collect information about the amount of radioactivity exposure. We will measure radioactivity exposure to the tumor, brain and other organs.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Registered patient at MSKCC. Childbearing age females must be nonpregnant,(documented by a negative pregnancy test within the last 2 weeks), nonlactating, and must be using adequate contraception or be surgically sterile. Patients with gliomas Patients planning to start antiAKT and/or antiVEGF directed therapies . Patients with measurable disease on MRI or CT neuroimaging. Patient is incontinent of urine or stool (which would make them unable to tolerate lying still for 60 minutes). Patient cannot tolerate lying still for a 60 minute session in the PET tomograph.</criteria>
