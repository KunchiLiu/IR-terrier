	<brief_summary>This is a phase I clinical study to evaluate feasibility, safety and kinetics of cellular therapy with autologous bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMMC) in patients with liver cirrhosis due to virus C hepatitis. Another aim is to study liver tissue changes induced by the BMMC presence. All the patients have moderate liver disfunction and will be submitted to a liver biopsy before BMMC injection. The cells will be labeled with 99mTc and infused through a peripheral vein. Scintigraphy will be performed 24 hours after infusion. Patients will be submitted to frequent clinical, laboratorial and image evaluation during a one-year follow-up. A second liver biopsy will be done in the 3rd month after infusion to check histological, cellular and molecular evolutive changes.</brief_summary>
