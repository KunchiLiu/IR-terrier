	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Current age greater than and including 15 and up to and including 25 years of age at time of consent Diagnosis of a first cancer &gt; or = to 14 and up to and including 21 years of age At least 6 months posttreatment according to participant's selfreport. Able to provide informed consent (or parent or legal guardian consent and participant assent for those participants under 18 years of age) Able to speak English. This inclusion criterion is included because study assessments were designed and validated in English and many of them are not currently available in other languages. Translation of questionnaires into other languages would require reestablishing the reliability and validity of these measures. Therefore, participants must be able to communicate in English to complete the assessments. Will exclude survivors with severe cognitive impairment that precludes them from being able to give information consent and/or complete the questionnaires.</criteria>
