	<brief_summary>This Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, dose-ranging study will compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of cicletanine hydrochloride (HCl) to placebo in subjects with PAH. Study drug will be administered alone, or on the background of stable PAH therapy. The study will consist of 3 periods: a screening period, a 12-week placebo-controlled treatment period, and a long-term, blinded extension period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Cicletanine for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to compare the change in exercise capacity following treatment with cicletanine HCl or placebo in subjects with PAH. The secondary objectives of this study are: 1. To compare the change in other clinical measures of PAH following treatment with cicletanine HCl or placebo in subjects with PAH 2. To compare the safety and tolerability of cicletanine HCl to placebo in subjects with PAH Additionally, the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of cicletanine HCl treatment will be evaluated.</detailed_description>
