	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well sorafenib works in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer that has not responded to sunitinib or bevacizumab.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer That Has Not Responded to Sunitinib or Bevacizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the tumor burden reduction rate in patients with sunitinib malate- or bevacizumab-refractory, metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma treated with sorafenib tosylate. Secondary - To determine the safety of sorafenib tosylate in these patients. - To record the duration of tumor reduction, time to disease progression, and overall survival of patients treated with sorafenib tosylate. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
