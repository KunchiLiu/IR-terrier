	<brief_summary>The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MK-0683 in the treatment of PV and ET. This agent has most recently been shown to be a potent inhibitor of the autonomous proliferation of haematopoietic cells of PV and ET patients carrying the JAK2 V617F mutation. Accordingly, it may be anticipated that MK-0683 - by decreasing the JAK2 allele burden - may influence clonal myeloproliferation and in vivo granulocyte, platelet and endothelial activation , which are considered to be major determinants of morbidity and mortality ( thrombosis, bleeding, extramedullary haematopoiesis , myelofibrosis ) in these disorders. The effects of MK-0683 at the molecular level will be studied by global/ focused gene expression profiling, epigenome profiling and proteomics.</brief_summary>
