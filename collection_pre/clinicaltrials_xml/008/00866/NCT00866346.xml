	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To determine the maximally tolerated dose of donor PR1-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (PR1-CTL) as treatment for relapsed or persistent chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) after allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation from an HLA-matched related or unrelated donor. Secondary Objectives: 1. To evaluate the immunological response following PR1-CTL treatment 2. To evaluate the clinical efficacy by determining clinical, cytogenetic and molecular response rates within 6 months</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Before treatment starts, you will have a complete physical exam, including blood (about 2 tablespoons) tests. You will have a chest x-ray and bone marrow will be collected. To collect a bone marrow sample, an area of the hip or chest bone is numbed with anesthetic and a small amount of bone marrow is withdrawn through a large needle. Women who are able to have children must have a negative blood pregnancy test. You will be treated with donor immune cells (T lymphocytes) that will specifically target certain leukemia cells in your body. Each participant will receive two doses of donor cells, 60 days apart. The second dose will be given 60 days after the first dose, at a higher dose level, as long as no serious side effects occur after the first dose and there is still disease present. Four dose levels of PR1-specific T lymphocytes will be considered. Up to 30 patients will be treated in cohorts of 3, starting at the lowest dose level, and not skipping an untried dose level when escalating. The trial will be stopped early if the lowest dose level is found to be unacceptably toxic. These cells will be given on an outpatient basis. After each donor cell infusions, you will be followed once a week in the outpatient clinic for at least 1 month and then every 3 months for at least one year. You will have routine blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine tests at these visits. Participants experiencing side effects from their leukemia or leukemia treatment may need to be hospitalized earlier. You will also receive several other medications to help decrease the risk of infections while your immune system is weak. These include preventative antibiotics, antiviral drugs, and antifungal drugs. Bone marrow samples will be taken before the second cell infusion, and then 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months and 1 year after the second cell infusion. This is an investigational study. A total of up to 30 patients will be take part in this study. All will be enrolled at UTMDACC.</detailed_description>
