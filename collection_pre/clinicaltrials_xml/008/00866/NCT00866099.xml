	<brief_title>Dementia Early Recognition and Response in Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dementia presents many challenges for primary care. Early diagnosis is important as this allows those with dementia and their family care networks to engage with support services and plan for the future. These actions can relieve the significant psychological distress that people with dementia and close supporters may experience , and provide knowledge about the availability of medical and psycho-social support that can improved functioning and morale The main efforts to improve the identification and diagnosis of dementia should logically be targeted at primary care as this is the first point of contact for most individuals and their carers when faced with experiences of 'ill health'. There is, however, evidence that dementia remains under-detected and sub-optimally managed in general practice . An educational intervention that could enhance clinical practice, improving the skills of practitioners in the recognition of and response to dementia syndromes, could therefore be beneficial to people with dementia and their families, and potentially to health and social services.</detailed_description>
