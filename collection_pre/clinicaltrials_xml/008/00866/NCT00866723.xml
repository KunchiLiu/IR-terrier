	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate how the participant's disease (ovarian, primary peritoneal serous, fallopian tube, or papillary serous endometrial cancer) responds to additional treatment with Avastin (bevacizumab). Participants have already received Avastin as part of maintenance therapy for their cancer. Maintenance therapy is a medical therapy that is given to people to prevent a relapse. However, cancer may return after maintenance therapy. This research study hopes to determine whether additional treatment with Avastin will be effective in treating the participant's cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Avastin in Patients With Epithelial Ovarian, Primary Peritoneal Serous or Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary: To determine the activity of bevacizumab in patients with epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal serous, papillary serous endometrial or fallopian tube cancer who relapse after achieving an initial complete response to first-line therapy that included at least 6 month bevacizumab maintenance as defined by: 1) clinical response rate OR 2) clinical benefit response Secondary: - To assess duration of progression free survival (PFS) - To assess the safety - To correlate response with the Avastin-free interval STATISTICAL DESIGN: This study used a two-stage design to evaluate efficacy of bevacizumab based on a patient achieving either clinical response or clinical benefit response. The null and alternative response rates were 10% and 30%. If two or more patients enrolled in the stage one cohort (n=10 patients) achieved response than accrual would proceed to stage two (n=19 patients). If response was achieved by at least 6 patients in the final set of 29 evaluable patients then bevacizumab would be deemed worthy for further study. This design had 80% power given one-sided 0.05 significance level.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal serous cancer, papillary serous endometrial cancer, or fallopian tube cancer Must have responded and remained clinically stable (as defined by normal clinical examination, normal serum CA125 level and normal CT scan) after firstline platinumbased regimen followed by bevacizumab maintenance therapy Must have developed relapsed disease at least 3 months after completion of bevacizumab maintenance therapy as defined by a) development of new, measurable lesions by RECIST criteria, but no lesion with maximum diameter greater than 3 centimeters OR b) newly elevated CA125 level at least 2 x ULN on 2 separate occasions, obtained at least 1 day but not more than 3 months apart ECOG Performance Status 02 No prior cytotoxic chemotherapy or biologic therapy for disease recurrence allowed Prior hormonalbased therapy for ovarian, primary peritoneal serous or fallopian tube cancer is allowed Toxic side effects related to prior chemotherapy or hormonal therapy must have resolved to grade one or less or to baseline before initiation of bevacizumab 18 years of age or older Life expectancy of 6 months or greater Normal organ and marrow function as outlined in the protocol Prior cytotoxic chemotherapy or biologic therapy for disease recurrence Known CNS disease, except for treated brain metastasis Pregnancy or breast feeding Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to hypertension, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to day 0, or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of the study Core biopsy or other minor surgical procedure, excluding placement of a vascular device, within 7 days prior to enrollment History of abdominal fistula, GI perforation, intraabdominal abscess, or CT evidence of bowel obstruction or bowel wall thickening Symptoms of intestinal obstruction, or requirement of parenteral hydration and/or nutrition History of active malignancy during the last 3 years, except nonmelanomatous skin cancer or in situ breast or cervical cancer Evidence of preexisting uncontrolled hypertension. If patient has hypertension, it must be medically controlled (&lt; 150/90) prior to starting bevacizumab Proteinuria at screening Dementia or significantly altered mental status that would prohibit the understanding and/or giving of informed consent Therapeutic anticoagulation is not by itself and exclusion criterion. However, for certain high risk patients on therapeutic anticoagulation, eligibility will be determined after discussion with the overall PI Any active bleeding Serious, nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture Prior history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy NYHA Grade II or greater congestive heart failure History of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months prior to Day 1 History of stroke or transient ischemic attack within 6 months prior to day 1 Significant vascular disease within 6 months prior to day 1 History of hemoptysis within 1 month prior to day 1 Presence of measurable lesion(s) by RECIST criteria with maximum diameter greater than 3 centimeters</criteria>
