	<brief_summary>Controversy exists in the treatment of airway hemangiomas ranging from tracheotomy, various lasers, to open removal, none of which have proven to be a gold standard. Venous malformations of the airway are difficult to treat and also require laser therapy or open removal and often repeated treatments are required. Similarly airway lymphatic malformations can require multiple treatment modalities as well as multiple procedures and are infrequently eradicated when extensive. New uses for various lasers and differing treatment protocols are frequently developed. Review of the treatment modalities and efficacy of these methods is required. The goal of this research is to determine protocols for treatment of airway vascular malformation and to evaluate our results from treatment of these lesions.</brief_summary>
