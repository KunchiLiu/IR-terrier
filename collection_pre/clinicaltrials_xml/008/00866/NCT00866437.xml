	<brief_summary>The EVE-PMS technology is intended for determination of intolerance or sensitivity to sex hormones, among women suffering from severe PreMenstrual Syndrome (PMS). The system includes skin testing panel for identification of hormones to which the patients might be sensitive. Tests are applied close to the ovulation period and the skin reaction is examined in 20 minutes, 48 hours and daily during the following month. Results of skin tests and patient's history will determine the value of EVE-PMS Skin-Test Panel as a diagnostic tool for severe PMS patients.</brief_summary>
