	<brief_title>The Neuroprotective Effects of RPC on the Neurosurgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: Brain ischemia and injury are commonly contributed to perioperative morbidity and mortality after neurosurgery. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a phenomenon whereby brief periods of ischemia followed by reperfusion in one organ provide systemic protection from prolonged ischemia. To investigate whether remote preconditioning protects the brain injury in patients undergoing elective neurosurgery, a randomized trial will be performed in current study. DESIGNING Thirty patients undergoing craniotomy for supratentorial meningioma will be randomize assigned to neurosurgery with RIPC or conventional neurosurgery (control). Remote ischemic preconditioning consist of three 5-min cycles of right upper limb ischaemia, induced by an automated cuff-inflator placed on the upper arm and inflated to 200 mm Hg, with an intervening 5 min of reperfusion during which the cuff is deflated. Cerebral injury was assessed by S-100b, NSE, and neurological function scores in different time points. EXPECTED RESULTS RIPC will reduce the incidence of cerebral injury. CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing elective craniotomy for supratentorial meningioma, RIPC reduces the incidence of postoperative cerebral injury.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients referred for primary elective neurosurgery were invited to participate in the study at the time of scheduling for operation Potential participants were excluded if they were &gt;70 years of age Required concomitant procedures other than neurosurgery Had experienced an acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infraction within 3 months Were unable to give informed consent Were taking sulfonylurea oral hypoglycemic agents or nicorandil drug therapy because these agents have been shown to effect preconditioning.</criteria>
