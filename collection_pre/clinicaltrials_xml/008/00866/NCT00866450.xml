	<brief_summary>This study will look at the inflammatory (changes usually associated with infection/injury to the body) and bowel permeability (bowel's ability to allow contents to enter the body) effects of a Western-style diet (high fat and low in calcium) and a prudent-style diet (low fat and high in calcium) on the colon (large bowel). This study may provide information to prevent colorectal cancer in a high-risk population</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of a Western-type Diet on Colorectal Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis: Compared to a prudent-style diet, does a western-style diet increase colorectal inflammation thereby increasing gut permeability and causing increased endotoxins and markers of systemic inflammation. This is a single blind crossover study. Subjects will be randomized to begin on either a WD or a PD for 30 + 3 days. Once that dietary intervention is complete, subjects will have a four (4) week wash-out period and then will be placed on the other dietary intervention for 30 + 3 days. The following study measures are performed during both the dietary intervention study periods. All the baseline tests will be repeated at the end of each dietary intervention period.</detailed_description>
