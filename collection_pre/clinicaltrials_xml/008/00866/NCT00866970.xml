	<brief_title>Safety, Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics of ALD518 in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer-related Fatigue and Cachexia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of ALD518 in patients with NSCLC related fatigue and cachexia. It is estimated that a total of 120 patients will be randomized to ALD518 80 mg, 160 mg, 320 mg, or placebo in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. A total of eight visits (excluding the Screening visit) will take place over a period of 24 weeks: Day 1, Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24. Enrolled patients will be screened within a 4 week period (Day 35 to 7). Randomization to treatment will be within a 12 day period (Day 14 to 3), before initial dosing on Day 1. Patients will receive treatment eight weeks apart (on Day 1, and Weeks 8 and 16). All patients will remain at the clinic for at least 4 hours from the time the infusion is started. Follow-up visits will occur four and eight weeks after the last dose of study drug, at Weeks 20 and 24, respectively.</detailed_description>
