	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Pazopanib Monotherapy After First Line Chemotherapy in Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, two-arm, placebo controlled, double-blind, multicenter, intergroup Phase III study in women with non-bulky FIGO Stage II - IV ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that has not progressed (i.e., CR, PR, SD) after completing their first-line chemotherapy for advanced ovarian cancer. Approximately 900 subjects will be enrolled into the study.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Ovarian Neoplasms</mesh_term>
	<criteria>written informed consent At least 18 years old. Histologically confirmed, FIGO stage IIIV epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma that was treated with surgical debulking and at least five cycles of platinumtaxane doublet chemotherapy. Study randomization at least 3 weeks and not more than 12 weeks from the date of the last chemotherapy dose, and all major toxicities from the previous chemotherapy must have resolved. No evidence of disease progression ECOG status of 0 or 1. Able to swallow and retain oral medication. Adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal system function as follows: Hematologic Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at least 1.5 X 10^9/L Hemoglobin at least 9 g/dL (or 5.59 mmol/L) Platelets at least 100 X 10^9/L Prothrombin time (PT) or international normalized ratio (INR) up to 1.2 X ULN Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) up to 1.2 X ULN Hepatic Total bilirubin up to 1.5 X ULN AST and ALT up to 2.5 X ULN Renal Serum creatinine up to 1.5 mg/dL Or, if greater than 1.5 mg/dL: Calculated creatinine clearance at least 50 mL/min Urine Protein Urine protein is 0, trace, or +1 determined by dipstick urinalysis, or &lt; 1.0 gram determined by 24 hour urine protein analysis. Nonchildbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant) OR childbearing potential, and agrees to use adequate contraception. Either (a) bulky disease, or (b) any residual disease which in the opinion of the investigator will need imminent secondline therapy Synchronous primary endometrial carcinoma, or a past history of primary endometrial carcinoma, are excluded unless certain conditions are met. Clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities Prolongation of corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt; 480 msecs History of any one or more cardiovascular conditions within the past 6 months prior to randomization Poorly controlled hypertension History of cerebrovascular accident (including transient ischemic attacks), pulmonary embolism or untreated deep venous thrombosis (DVT) within the past 6 months prior to randomization Major surgery (including interval debulking) or trauma within 28 days, or minor surgical procedures within 7 days, prior to randomization, or has any nonhealing wound, fracture, or ulcer. Evidence of active bleeding or bleeding diathesis. Hemoptysis within 6 weeks prior to randomization. Endobronchial metastases. Serious and/or unstable preexisting medical (e.g., uncontrolled infection), psychiatric, or other condition that could interfere with subject's safety, provision of informed consent, or compliance to study procedures. Investigational or antiVEGF anticancer therapy prior to study randomization. Known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs chemically related to pazopanib.</criteria>
