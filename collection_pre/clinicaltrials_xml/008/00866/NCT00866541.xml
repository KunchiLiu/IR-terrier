	<brief_summary>Flow proportional pressure support (FPPS) is a new mode of spontaneous breathing assistance. In patients with increased respiratory resistance the role of FPPS in comparison with the pressure support assist breathing mode is still unclear. In this study the investigators evaluate objective and subjective measured data in healthy volunteers with artificial increased resistance and FPPS breathing assistance.</brief_summary>
