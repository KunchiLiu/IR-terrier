	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well MEK inhibitor AZD6244 works in treating patients with stage III or stage IV melanoma. MEK inhibitor AZD6244 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MEK Inhibitor AZD6244 in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response in patients with V600E or V600K BRAF-mutated or NRAS-mutated stage III or stage IV melanoma with low or high phospho-pAKT expression treated with MEK inhibitor AZD6244. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Identify other genetic predictors of sensitivity to MEK inhibition. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to pAKT expression (low vs high). Patients receive oral MEK inhibitor AZD6244 twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Tumor tissue samples are collected for correlative laboratory studies. Samples are assessed for expression of pAKT, pPRAS40, and PTEN by IHC and mutations in BRAF, NRAS, KIT, and PIK3CAP by MALDI-TOF. PTEN is sequenced in tumors using whole genome amplification followed by high-throughput bidirectional dideoxynucleotide sequencing of PCR-amplified gene products. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4 weeks.</detailed_description>
