	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Apremilast (CC-10004) in the Treatment of Behçet Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 2, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study with an equal randomization between the apremilast and placebo treatment groups. Following the randomized Treatment Phase, each participant will enter an active-treatment Extension Phase. The study will consist of four phases: a Pre-randomization Phase, a Treatment Phase, an Extension Phase, and an Observational Follow-up Phase. Pre-randomization Phase Screening procedures must be performed no more than 90 days prior to the start of study medication at Visit 2 (Day 1). Treatment Phase Participants who qualify for randomization will be randomized 1:1 to receive study medication (apremilast) or placebo. Since the incidence and severity of Behçet Disease differ between males and females, randomization will be stratified by gender, to minimize the imbalance between the two treatment groups. To mitigate the potential gastrointestinal (GI) side effects of apremilast (primarily mild-to-moderate nausea), dose titration for the first week of treatment will be implemented for this study. Participants will be dosed orally twice per day (PO BID) with 10 mg apremilast or identically-appearing placebo on Days 1 and 2, followed by 20 mg BID or placebo on Days 3 and 4, and by 30 mg BID or placebo on Days 5-7. Thereafter, participants will take 30 mg BID of apremilast or matching placebo through Day 85. If participants are unable to tolerate the adverse events of the full dose of study medication, they may be permitted to take a reduced dose of 20 mg BID of apremilast after the investigator consults with the study sponsor. Participants who are dose reduced while on placebo medication will receive identically-appearing 20 mg placebo tablets. Participants who are randomized after Amendment 2 is implemented will be seen at regularly scheduled visits until Day 86 or until study medication is discontinued for another reason. Participants who were randomized prior to the implementation of Amendment 2 will be re-consented at their next study visit and will be scheduled accordingly. Extension Phase On Days 86 through 91, participants who received placebo during the Treatment Phase (including those who were "dose reduced") will be dose titrated up to 30 mg BID with apremilast as described previously. Participants who were previously randomized to apremilast (including those who were dose-reduced to 20 mg BID) will continue to receive apremilast at the same dose as in the Treatment Phase, using blister cards that are identical in appearance to the titration cards. The study medication during Days 86-169 will remain blinded, to prevent study personnel and participants from knowing the study medication assignment in the Treatment Phase. As in the Treatment Phase, dose reduction to 20 mg BID apremilast will be permitted after the investigator consults with Celgene, if the participant is unable to tolerate the adverse events of the full 30 mg BID dose. Participants who are randomized after Amendment 2 is implemented will be seen at the scheduled visits until Day 169 or until study medication is discontinued for another reason. Participants who were randomized prior to the implementation of Amendment 2 will be re-consented at their next study visit and will be scheduled according to the revised Schedule of Assessments. Observational Follow-up Phase All participants (including those who discontinue study medication prematurely for any reason) will be followed for 28 days after the last dose of study medication to monitor for adverse events and worsening of disease after study medication is withdrawn. Participants who are randomized after Amendment 2 is implemented will be seen at the scheduled visits until Day 169 or until study medication is discontinued for another reason. Participants who were randomized prior to the implementation of Amendment 2 will be re-consented at their next study visit and will be scheduled according to the revised Schedule of Assessments.</detailed_description>
