	<brief_summary>This study is undertaken to generate clinical data on GSK Biologicals' combined measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine manufactured with measles and rubella obtained from newly established working seed viruses which are one passage further than the current working seed viruses. The measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine manufactured with the current working seed viruses will serve as comparator. A seed lot system is a system according to which successive batches of a vaccine are derived from the same master seed virus. For routine production, a working seed lot is prepared from the master seed virus.</brief_summary>

Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products during the six months before entering the study or planned administration during the study period. Planned administration/ administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 30 days prior to until 42 days after each study vaccine dose with the exception of oral polio vaccine (OPV) which can be given at any time and routine inactivated vaccines such as pneumococcal, meningococcal or Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccines, inactivated influenza or diphtheria/tetanus containing vaccines which can be administered up to eight days before each study vaccine dose. Previous vaccination against measles, mumps, rubella and/or varicella. History of measles, mumps, rubella and/or varicella/zoster diseases. Known exposure to measles, mumps, rubella and/or varicella within 30 days prior to study start. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine(s), including systemic hypersensitivity to neomycin.
