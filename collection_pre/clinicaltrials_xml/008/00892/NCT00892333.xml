	<brief_summary>The rate of hernia recurrence at one year following repair of a large abdominal hernia with a biologic mesh is high, ranging from 30% to 100%, with a reported historic average rate of 40%. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the rate of hernia recurrence at one year following repair with SurgiMend 3.0, an FDA-cleared novel biologic mesh, the hypothesis being that such rate will be less than 20% at one year, representing a 50% reduction over the historic rate of 40%.</brief_summary>
