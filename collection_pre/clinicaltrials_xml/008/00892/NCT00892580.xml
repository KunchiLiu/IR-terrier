	<brief_summary>The subjects that meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria and consent to participate in protocol 22003 will be offered participation in 22003A which will evaluate secreted protein before and after treatment with STX209 and placebo to determine if they correlate with effectiveness of treatment or susceptibility to treatment with STX209. These same subjects will also be asked to contribute a blood sample for DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) collection. The investigators will study the DNA to determine if STX209 works better in people with specific gene variations, or to find new gene variations that predict how well STX209 works.</brief_summary>
