	<brief_summary>Epiretinal membranes (ERM) are cellular membranes on the surface of the retina that result in distortion of the vision (metamorphopsia), and decreased best-corrected visual acuity. They are most frequently found in patients over the age of 50 and have a reported prevalence of 7-12%. [1,2] Epiretinal membranes are caused by posterior vitreous separation, retinal detachment, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, cataract surgery, trauma, inflammation, retinal vascular disease, and idiopathic. [1-4] Epiretinal membrane removal by pars plana vitrectomy combined with internal limiting membrane peeling leads to improved vision, decreased metamorphopsia, and improved quality of life after surgery. [2] Internal limiting membrane (ILM) peel has been associated with decreased rates of epiretinal membrane recurrence and is also performed during vitrectomy for repair of macular holes or vitreomacular traction. [5,6] Internal limiting membrane peeling can be performed by using an instrument to make a break in the membrane followed by peeling with forceps, or by utilizing ILM forceps alone to pinch and peel an unviolated ILM. No study exists comparing different intraoperative techniques used for ILM peeling on visual outcomes and operating time. The investigators hypothesize that using a "pinch and peel" technique will equal outcomes with shorter operating time than other techniques. 1. McDonald HR, Johnson RN, Ai E, Jumper JM, Fu AD.

	<criteria>Epiretinal membrane with associated macular thickening or cystoid macular edema present; ETDRS best corrected visual acuity 20/50 or worse attributed to the effects of the epiretinal membrane; Pars plana vitrectomy/membrane peel planned for treatment of the epiretinal membrane; Patients older than 19 years of age; No coexistent retina pathology or optic neuropathy that may influence the visual field. Patient unwilling or unable to provide informed consent; Coexisting retina pathology (proliferative diabetic retinopathy, central retinal vein occlusion, branch retinal vein occlusion, central/branch retinal artery occlusion, ERM secondary to trauma, prior surgery for ERM); Coexisting lenticular opacity; Optic neuropathy causing a preexisting visual field defect involving the central 10 degrees of vision.</criteria>
