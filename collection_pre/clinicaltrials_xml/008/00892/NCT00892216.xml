	<brief_summary>Post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is not only unpleasant for patients but also can delay hospital discharge and increase cost of stay. In some cases, when severe vomiting occurs, pain scores seem to be increased. The overall incidence of PONV is 30% and increases to 79% in patients at high risk for this post-operative outcome. The NUSS procedure is considered to be a procedure with a high risk for the outcome of nausea and vomiting.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The rationale is to do a prospective study in patients who have been diagnosed with Pectus Excavatum and who are undergoing a NUSS procedure (pectus excavatum correction) and to evaluate the effect of Acupressure on the post-operative outcome of PONV in these patients. Also, to determine whether there are any secondary outcomes related to pain scores and length of hospital stay.</detailed_description>
