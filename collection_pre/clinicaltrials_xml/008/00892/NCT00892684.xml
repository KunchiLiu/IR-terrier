	<brief_summary>The incidence of allergic diseases has increased and a relation between allergy and dietary fatty acids has been proposed. Modulation of the maternal immune function during pregnancy may have an impact on future clinical outcomes in the child. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of omega (ω) - 3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) supplementation during pregnancy and lactation on the development of allergic disease (i.e., allergic eczema) in the child at 2 years of age. Pregnant women with allergic disease in their immediate family were supplemented daily with 2.7 g ω-3 LCPUFA (n=70) or 2.8 g soybean-oil as placebo (n=75) from gestational week (gw) 25 until the third month of breastfeeding. Skin prick tests, detection of circulating specific IgE antibodies and clinical examinations of the infants were performed at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months of age. The mothers and children were monitored regarding immune modulatory effects during the entire study period.</brief_summary>
