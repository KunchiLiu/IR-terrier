	<brief_summary>Post-operative nausea and vomiting are the major complications after spinal anesthesia with intrathecal morphine, therefore antiemetic drugs should be administered for best satisfaction of anesthesia to prevent these complication. Furthermore, administration of a combination of antiemetic drugs with different mechanisms of action appears reasonable and synergistic effect of drugs. In conclusion, we study efficacy of antiemetic effect of single antiemetic drug compare with combination antiemetic drugs.</brief_summary>
