	<brief_summary>This study will examine a contingency management (CM) intervention designed to provide incentives for losing weight versus participating in a manual-guided behavioral weight loss intervention alone. Participants in the CM condition will earn the opportunity to win prizes by losing weight and completing activities that contribute to weight loss, such as keeping daily food and physical activity diaries, choosing healthy foods, exercising, and using other weight loss strategies. The investigators will determine if the CM improves weight loss relative to the usual care manual-guided intervention alone.</brief_summary>
