	<brief_summary>The primary purpose is to assess the role of sympathetic activation for the development and progression of chronic renal failure. Using microneurography sympathetic activity will be registered in various stages of kidney affection or failure and hypertension. A sympatholytic agent will be compared with a non-sympatholytic drug to asses the effect sympathetic activation and on the progression of kidney disease. The effects of a sympatholytic agent on cardiovascular reactivity to various stressors wil be examined.</brief_summary>
