	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, efficacy, predictability, and stability of laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) to correct high anisometropia in patients 8 to 15 years old in whom conventional treatments have failed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ten-year Follow-up of Laser in Situ Keratomileusis in Patients 8 to 15 Years Old</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nine eyes of nine patients (3 male and 6 female) with high anisometropia (&gt;3.50 D), were included in this study. Minimum follow-up was 10 years. All patients were treated with the Chiron Technolas 217 excimer laser.</detailed_description>
