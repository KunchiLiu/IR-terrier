	<brief_summary>INTRODUCTION: Acting directly on the anti-radical enzyme chain, the superoxide dismutase (SOD), a major enzyme of the anti-oxidant system, provides an alternative of the antioxidants treatment in ARMD. Its synthesis depends on the cellular oxygenated reactive species, and leads to the conversion of the superoxide ion (O2-) into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). This compound is the cell watch guard continuously regulating a free radicals' detoxifying chain. Subsequently, by increasing the production of H2O2, the administration of SOD can trigger endogenous/internal antioxidant mechanisms. Oral administration of SOD is possible in its galenic form, Glisodine. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of SOD on the bilateralization of the disease.</brief_summary>
