	<brief_summary>This single arm study will provide treatment or re-treatment with PEGASYS as monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin (Copegus), to patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) who have participated in a previous Roche or Roche partner protocol where access to treatment or re-treatment was promised or deemed appropriate following completion of the original protocol ('donor' protocol). Patients who qualify for treatment or re-treatment will begin PEGASYS monotherapy, at a maximum dose of 180 µg weekly, or combination therapy with Copegus, 800-1200 mg daily, as continuation of treatment after the wash-out period defined in their donor protocol. PEGASYS treatment is not to exceed the approved treatment duration of 48 weeks in genotype G1 with a treatment-free follow up period of 24 weeks.</brief_summary>
