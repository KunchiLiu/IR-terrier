	<brief_summary>The objectives of the proposed study are to determine whether culturally diverse community residents with diabetes are willing to participate in our community health worker intervention using randomized controlled trial (RCT) methods and to explore and document effective processes and protocols for RCT methods in these communities. The investigators will examine retention rates, identify reasons for attrition through interviews and focus groups, and determine strategies for improving recruitment, retention, and intervention methods. As a secondary objective, the investigators will explore the potential impacts of the intervention for improving healthy lifestyles, diabetes self-management, and selected health outcomes of participants.</brief_summary>
