	<brief_title>Beta Cell Function in (Pre) Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will establish criteria indicating short-term loss of beta cell mass and therefore accelerated progression towards type 1 diabetes. These criteria may help to determine the time point and type of prevention may contribute to the composition of homogeneous groups of study subjects (based on residual beta cell mass, homogeneous risk of beta cell destruction during intervention) and may lead to the identification of functional markers that could be used as surrogate endpoints. This may reduce the number of subjects needed to treat as well as the follow-up time necessary to study significant effects of the test substance.</detailed_description>
