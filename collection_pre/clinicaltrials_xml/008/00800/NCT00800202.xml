	<brief_summary>This study will assess the efficacy and safety of Avastin combined with first li ne paclitaxel-carboplatin (cohort 1) or second line Tarceva (cohort 2) in patien ts with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer with asymptomatic untreated brai n metastasis. Two cohorts of patients will be studied; the first will receive Av astin 15mg/kg iv every 3 weeks combined with first line paclitaxel 200mg/m2 iv p lus carboplatin AUC6 iv every 3 weeks for a maximum of 6 cycles, and the second cohort will receive Avastin 15mg/kg iv every 3 weeks combined with second line T arceva 150mg/kg po.The anticipated time on study treatment is until disease prog ression, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.</brief_summary>
