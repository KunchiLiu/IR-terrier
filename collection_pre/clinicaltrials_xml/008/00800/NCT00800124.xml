	<brief_summary>The objective is to study the overall frequency and cumulative rate (during one year) of clinical morbidity (defined as any hospitalization without fatal outcome) and mortality in all consecutive patients undergoing HF surgery (pins and prosthetic implants) and compare this to the group of patients receiving prosthetic implants and further find out if there is a difference between the non-cemented and cemented groups. Between the same prosthetic groups, the investigators want to study the overall frequency of in-hospital subclinical organ damage and dysfunction of myocardium, liver and lungs, using biochemical plasma markers. Finally, the investigators want to perform perioperative cost benefit calculations and out of hospital quality of life analysis between the surgical groups.</brief_summary>
