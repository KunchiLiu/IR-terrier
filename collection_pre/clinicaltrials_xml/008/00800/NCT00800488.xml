	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to study the value of serum procalcitonin as a predictive marker for severe bacterial infection in febrile infants. 2200 febrile infants aged less than 3 months will prospectively be included. All infants will have a measure of Procalcitonin concentrations. Comparison of the mean value of Procalcitonin concentration in infants with and without serious Bacterial infection. Evaluation of the area under the ROC for Procalcitonin concentration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Procalcitonin for Predicting Serious Bacterial Infection in Infants Less Than 3 Months</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Serious bacterial infections are often difficult to detect in infant with fever without source. Procalcitonin is a better blood marker of infection than White blood cell count and possibly than C-reactive protein. This could lead to a reduction in antibiotic prescription. Our objective is to evaluate the impact of Procalcitonin result on antibiotic prescription in children 1 to 3 month old with fever without source and our hypothesis is that it will lower the antibiotic prescription rate.</detailed_description>
