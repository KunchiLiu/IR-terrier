	<detailed_description>Long Term Oxygen Therapy (LTOT) is one of the main non pharmacologic treatments for patients with severe lung disease. This continuous or sub-continuous oxygen supplementation is generally introduced at home in patients who have chronic cardio respiratory failure and severe resting hypoxemia to maintain sufficient blood oxygenation and therefore preserve vital organ function. LTOT effectiveness has mainly been evaluated and documented in patients with COPD, which also accounts for most of its prescriptions. In these patients, LTOT has been shown to have a beneficial impact on haemodynamics, exercise capacity, lung mechanics and mental state. Its implementation was furthermore associated with reduced yearly hospitalisation days and increased survival Measuring adherence is an extremely important and under-evaluated component of oxygen therapy. NOWOX, medical device has been designed,developed and manufactured to measure adherence to LTOT and additionally to measure patient's respiration rate</detailed_description>
