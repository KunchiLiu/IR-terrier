	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of GS-9411 in healthy male volunteers. GS-9411 is a sodium channel inhibitor, that may restore airway hydration and mucociliary clearance in the lung.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial to Assess the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of GS-9411 in Healthy Male Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GS-9411 is being evaluated as a potential therapy to improve airway hydration and mucociliary clearance in patients with cystic fibrosis. This study is evaluating the safety and tolerability of 3 dose levels of GS-9411 as an inhaled product, compared to a matched placebo.</detailed_description>

A need for any medication during the period 0 to 5 days before entry to the study, except those deemed by the principal investigator/clinical investigator not to interfere with the outcome of the study. Existence of any surgical or medical condition which, in the judgment of the clinical investigator, might interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the drug.

Subjects with significant history of respiratory, renal, hepatic, cardiovascular (including history of systemic hypertension requiring therapy), metabolic, neurological, hematological, gastrointestinal, cerebrovascular, or other significant medical illness or disorder which, in the judgment of the investigator, may interfere with the study or require treatment which may affect the evaluation of efficacy and safety of the study drug.
