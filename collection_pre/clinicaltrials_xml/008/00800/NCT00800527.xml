	<brief_title>Efficacy of Gabapentin in the Treatment of Chest Pain and Paresthesia in Patients With Sternotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of different drugs on chest pain and paresthesia, we choose the prospective, randomized, open label, blinded end point design for this study. According to this design, both patients and physicians making first assessment are aware of the treatment but the investigators making second and third assessment are blinded to treatment. Therefore, two separate cardiovascular surgeons wil select and randomize the patients and a cardiologist blinded to treatment assignments will evaluate the patients at second interview at thirty day and 3 months later. The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee and informed consent was obtained from each patient. The study was conducted in Usak State Hospital with collaboration the Department of Cardiology of Ataturk Education and Training Hospital.</detailed_description>
