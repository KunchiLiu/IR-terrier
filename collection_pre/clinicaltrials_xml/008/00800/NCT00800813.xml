	<brief_summary>Some men complain of changes in the shape or dimensions of their penis after undergoing radical prostatectomy (removal of the prostate) for prostate cancer. Changes in penile dimensions include shortening or decreased girth. Changes in shape include a curvature or bending of the penis, and/or the appearance of indentation. These changes may be associated with formation of scar tissue involving the covering of the erection chambers, known as "plaque". The appearance of indurated plaque and a resultant curvature or indentation is a well described medical condition known as "Peyronie's Disease" and may occur in men who did or did not undergo radical prostatectomy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate these changes in penile shape and dimensions.</brief_summary>
