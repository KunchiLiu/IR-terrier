	<brief_summary>This 3 arm study will assess the safety and efficacy of combination treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a + ribavirin in participants with chronic hepatitis C. Three groups of participants will be studied; 1) those with elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) level, 2) those with normal ALT level, and 3) those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection. Participants with genotype 1, 4, 5 or 6 will receive peginterferon alfa-2a 180 micrograms (mcg) subcutaneous (SC) once weekly (qw) + ribavirin 1000-1200 milligrams (mg) orally (PO) daily (dependent on body weight) for 48 weeks, those with genotype 2 or 3 will receive peginterferon alfa-2a 180 mcg SC qw + ribavirin 800 mg PO daily for 24 weeks, and all participants with HIV co-infection will receive peginterferon alfa-2a 180 mcg SC qw + ribavirin 800 mg PO daily for 48 weeks. The anticipated time on study treatment is 48 weeks, and the target sample size is 300 individuals.</brief_summary>
