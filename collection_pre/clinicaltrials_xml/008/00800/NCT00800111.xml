	<brief_summary>Endothelial keratoplasty is a cornea-sparing transplant technique that replaces only the diseased endothelial cell layer of the patient's cornea. This technique offers many advantages compared with traditional full-thickness cornea transplants. Patients experience minimal change in glasses prescription and usually recover useful vision within weeks. Visual fluctuations are minimal during the healing process. The patient's cornea remains structurally intact and is more resistant to injury. Endothelial keratoplasty is undergoing rapid and widespread adoption. Between 2005 and 2007, the number of corneas placed by US eye banks for endothelial keratoplasty increased ten-fold (2007 Eye Bank Association of America Annual Report). However, the procedure is less than 10 years old, and little is known about long term outcomes. Endothelial keratoplasty candidates at our center are invited to participate in an open enrollment, prospective study of the long-term outcomes of this procedure.</brief_summary>
