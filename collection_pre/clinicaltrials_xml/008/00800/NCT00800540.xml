	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to compare the short term effects of two intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering medications on ocular perfusion pressure (OPP), ocular blood flow, intraocular pressure, and blood pressure in patients with glaucoma. Ocular perfusion pressure (OPP) is defined as the difference between arterial blood pressure (diastolic and systolic) and intraocular pressure. The primary efficacy assessment is based on diastolic ocular perfusion pressure.</brief_summary>
