	<brief_summary>This trial will assess the safety of defibrillator testing and the influence of defibrillation testing on the efficacy of clinical shocks. The trial will test the hypothesis that implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation without defibrillation testing (DT) is non-inferior to implantation with testing against the composite endpoint of ineffective first appropriate clinical shock or arrhythmic death. It will also test the hypothesis, that defibrillation testing increases the peri-operative (30 days) complication rate of ICD implantation.</brief_summary>
