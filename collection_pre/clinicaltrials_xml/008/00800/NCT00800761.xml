	<brief_summary>Myocardial iron overload is the leading cause of death in patients with beta-thalassemia major (TM). Therapy with deferoxamine (DFO) combined with deferiprone (DFP) reduces myocardial iron and improves cardiac function. However, the prognosis for TM patients with established cardiac disease switched from DFO monotherapy to combined DFP/DFO chelation is unknown. Twenty-eight TM patients with cardiac disease were enrolled in a prospective study lasting 42Â±6 months. Fifteen (9 high-ferritin and 6 low-ferritin) were placed on DFP/DFO (DFP, 75 mg/kg t.i.d.; DFO, 40-50 mg/kg over 8-12 h at night 5-7 d/wk), while 13 (5 high- and 8 low-ferritin) received DFO alone. No cardiac events were observed among high-ferritin patients on combination therapy, whereas 4 cardiac events (p=0.0049), including three deaths, occurred in high-ferritin patients on DFO monotherapy. These findings demonstrate that in TM patients with well-established cardiac disease combined iron-chelation therapy with DFP/DFO is superior to DFO monotherapy.</brief_summary>
