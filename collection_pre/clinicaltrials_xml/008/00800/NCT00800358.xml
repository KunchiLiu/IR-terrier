	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Paricalcitol Versus Calcitriol in the Treatment of Secondary Hyperparathyroidism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Secondary hyperparathyroidism, a common consequence of chronic kidney disease, results from abnormal regulation of calcium and phosphate homeostasis. The early administration of calcium supplements or vitamin D attenuates the development and progression of hyperparathyroidism, preventing or retarding the emergence of many of the serious complications of chronic kidney disease. However, these vitamin D derivatives also have serious side effects, including hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia and, as a result, a high level of the calcium-phosphate product. These adverse outcomes have prompted the development of novel, "nonhypercalcemic" vitamin D analogues. Three of these analogues have recently been marketed for clinical use in patients with chronic kidney disease: 19-nor-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 (paricalcitol), 1 -hydroxyvitamin D2 (doxercalciferol), and 22-oxacalcitriol. Oral paricalcitol was developed to provide a convenient, alternative therapy, particularly for Peritoneal Dialysis patients in whom regular intravenous administration of paricalcitol is not practical. This study is designed to determine the proportion of patients with 'End stage renal failure' on haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis and secondary hyperparathyroidism who achieved more than 30% reduction in baseline iPTH concentration at 24 weeks of treatment with Paricalcitol or Calcitriol capsules.</detailed_description>
