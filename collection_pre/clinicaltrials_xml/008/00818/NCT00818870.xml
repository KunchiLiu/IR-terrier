	<brief_title>Effect of Vecam 40/300 and Vecam 20/300 Compared to Omeprazole 20 mg on Gastric pH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible H. pylori negative, normal gastric acid secreting, healthy volunteers will be treated by the study medications in a randomized, open-label, cross-over study.Up to 60 volunteers may be enrolled to ensure that at least 30 subjects will complete all the study treatments. Omeprazole 20 mg will be administered before breakfast. Vecam 40/300 and Vecam 20/300 will be administered at bedtime w/o food. 24-hour gastric pH will be measured after the fifth dose (day 5).Following screening procedures, subjects will be randomly assigned to receive the different treatments. All pH measurements will be done in the study center under supervised conditions. All drug administrations will be supervised. This study is part of the Vecam clinical development plan.</detailed_description>
