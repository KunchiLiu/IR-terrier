	<brief_summary>Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare metal stent (BMS) in patients with renal insufficiency has shown unsatisfactory results. Indeed, drug-eluting stents (DES) might reduce the incidence of restenosis and therefore of target lesion revascularization procedures in these patients. We therefore designed a prospective, randomized, multicenter, not-sponsored study to directly compare the efficacy in the prevention of clinical restenosis of everolimus-eluting stent (Xience V) and bare-metal stent (Vision) (both 2nd-generation DES and BMS, respectively), both implanted in the same patient with multivessel disease and renal insufficiency in order to obviate for the multiple and unpredictable characteristics of this high-risk population.</brief_summary>
