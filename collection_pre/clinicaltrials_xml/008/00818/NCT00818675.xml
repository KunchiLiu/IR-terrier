	<brief_summary>This is a randomized discontinuation study of ridaforolimus in patients with advanced NSCLC who have failed at least 1 but no more than 3 prior treatment regimens and who have KRAS mutant lung cancer. Following 8 weeks of open-label ridaforolimus lead-in there will be an assessment of disease status. Patients assessed by the investigator to have stable disease after 8 weeks will be randomized to double-blind treatment with ridaforolimus or placebo. Patients assessed to have partial or complete response will continue on open-label ridaforolimus. Patients assessed to have disease progression will be discontinued from study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Ridaforolimus in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Patients With Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog (KRAS) Mutations (MK-8669-021 AM1)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allocation and Arms Additional Information: All Patients will receive an 8-week open-label lead-in treatment of ridaforolimus. After this 8 week period patients will be re-assessed for disease status. Patients who are stable after 8 weeks are randomized in a double-blind fashion to continue treatment with ridaforolimus or to a placebo until disease progression. (Those patients who have stable disease but are randomized to placebo may cross-over to open-label ridaforolimus at the time of disease progression.) Those patients with tumor shrinkage during the open-label lead-in treatment will continue on open-label ridaforolimus, while those patients who have disease progression at 8-weeks are taken off-study.</detailed_description>
