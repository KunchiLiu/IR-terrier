	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Giving low doses of chemotherapy before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving a monoclonal antibody, such as alemtuzumab, before transplant and tacrolimus and methotrexate after transplant may stop this from happening. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of donor stem cell transplant and to see how well it works in treating patients with high-risk hematologic cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To evaluate the safety and toxicity of a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen followed by allogeneic bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation from an HLA-matched unrelated donor in patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies. - To evaluate engraftment by peripheral blood chimerism analysis. - To determine the incidence and severity of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease following the transplant. - To examine the possibility of controlling hematologic malignancies by induction of a graft-versus-leukemia/tumor effect. - To determine the disease-free survival, relapse, transplant-related mortality, and death from all causes. OUTLINE: - Reduced-intensity conditioning regimen: Patients receive 1 of 2 conditioning regimens according to diagnosis. - Regimen 1 (acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, myeloproliferative syndrome, or chronic myelogenous leukemia): Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes and busulfan IV over 3 hours on days -6 to -3 or orally 4 times daily on days -7 to -3. - Regimen 2 (lymphoproliferative malignancies): Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -5 to -3. Patients with CD20+ malignancies also receive rituximab IV over 4-6 hours on days -13, -6, 1, and 8. - Transplantation: Patients undergo allogeneic bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day 0. - Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients receive low-dose alemtuzumab subcutaneously on days -11 to -9 and tacrolimus IV over 24 hours beginning on day -3 and then orally twice daily beginning on day 14 and continuing until day 60, followed by a taper until day 180 in the absence of clinically significant GVHD. Patients also receive methotrexate on days 1, 3, and 6. Patients who exhibit persistent mixed chimerism or disease relapse/progression despite full withdrawal of immunosuppression may receive up to 3 donor lymphocyte infusions. Blood samples are taken on days 30, 60, and 100 and then every 4 weeks thereafter for chimerism studies by PCR analysis. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 60 months.</detailed_description>
