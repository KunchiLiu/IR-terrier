	<brief_summary>Compared with MS in white populations, in people of China descent multiple sclerosis (MS)is characterized by lower prevalence, more frequent and severe involvement of the visual system at onset and during the entire clinical course, more common occurrence of optic and spinal involvement, relatively rapid progression and less common occurrence of a progressive course. Data are not available for mainland China that are focused on characteristic studies of MS. In this study, the investigators sought to explore the characteristics of MS among Chinese in China, by conducting a study on genetics, pathogenesis, pathology, neuroimaging characteristics, and so on. Based on these data, the investigators try to explore the difference in neuromyelitis optical (NMO) and MS and provide clinical data for treatment guidelines for NNO and MS.</brief_summary>
