	<brief_summary>The objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the prevalence of biological aspirin resistance in women at risk for CHD taking low dose (81 mg) aspirin. Aspirin responsiveness will be measured with the VerifyNow device (Accumetrics; San Diego, CA). Those women identified as biologically resistant will be switched to aspirin 325 mg for 14 days and then re-tested for aspirin responsiveness.</brief_summary>
