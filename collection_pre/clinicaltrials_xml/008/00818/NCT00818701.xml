	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to show that low dose recombinant BNP coupled with phosphodiesterase V inhibition will improve renal dysfunction and promote relief of volume overload in patinets with acute decompensated heart failure complicated by the cardiorenal syndrome.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Low Dose Nesiritide With or Without Sildenafil in Congestive Heart Failure Patients With Renal Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Renal dysfunction is a common comorbidity, as well as a common and progressive complication, of heart failure (HF). Increasingly, the clinical syndrome of HF is one of "cardiorenal" failure owing to the frequent presentation of combined cardiac and renal dysfunction. Recent studies have established the prognostic importance of renal dysfunction in patients with chronic HF. An analysis of the patients in the second prospective randomized study of Ibopamine on mortality and efficacy (PRIME) by Hillege et al1 demonstrated that estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the most powerful predictor of mortality, exceeding functional status and ejection fraction (EF). In an ongoing prospective study, we are assessing the neurohumoral and renal hemodynamic profile of hospitalized patients with ADHF who do or do not develop the CRS. Our preliminary findings suggest that indeed the combination of pronounced activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), decreased renal perfusion pressure and importantly, a relative deficiency of the natriuretic peptides (despite marked volume overload) predisposes to the development of CRS.</detailed_description>
