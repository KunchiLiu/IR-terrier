	<brief_summary>The presence of plaque on tooth surfaces as a predictor of chlorhexidine side effects has not been evaluated especially because most studies utilized a previous disruption of biofilms in all dental surfaces before the beginning of rinsing. The purpose of this study is to compare staining and calculus formation after 0.12 percent chlorhexidine between previously plaque-free and plaque-covered surfaces by means of an experimental gingivitis model.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Test panel The test panel will be recruited from the dental students of the Lutheran University of Brazil, Canoas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. At recruitment, subjects will be asked about their medical and dental history. Written and oral explanations detailing the study purpose and design will be given for each subject. Subjects that preliminarily met inclusion/exclusion criteria will be selected for a dental screening appointment. If the subject met all the inclusion/exclusion criteria, an informed consent was handed out and, upon acceptance, signed by the volunteers. The following clinical parameters were assessed in the order listed below from all teeth, excepting the third higher/lower molar. Presence of calculus (C) in all teeth, at 6 sites per tooth (mesio-buccal, mid-buccal, disto-buccal, mesio-lingual, mid-lingual and disto-lingual) was scored as a dichotomous index: 0 - Absence of calculus; 1 - Presence of calculus. Discoloration Index proposed by Lobene 36 and modified by Macpherson et al. 2000. This involves visual stain assessment of the buccal/labial and lingual/palatal aspects of the index teeth.</detailed_description>
