	<brief_summary>This study is intended to test an experimental drug called EMD 525797 (Abituzumab). This drug is not yet approved for sale and has only been tested in a small number of people to date (prior to this study starting another research study was carried out involving 37 healthy volunteers receiving the study drug). Until more is known about this study drug, it can only be used in research studies. This research study is planned to answer important questions about how the study drug is tolerated and how it may work in subjects with ovarian and colorectal cancer which has spread to the liver (i.e. metastatic cancer). The Sponsor (Merck KGaA) of this study is developing the study drug.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Provision of signed written informed consent Male or female subjects, aged at least 18 years Subjects with liver metastases (3 to 10 centimeter [cm] diameter) from colorectal and ovarian cancers Failure of standard cancer therapy Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1 at study entry and an estimated life expectancy of at least 3 months Adequate haematological function, defined by absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 1.5 x 10^9 per liter (/L), platelet count &gt;= 100 x 10^9 / L, and haemoglobin concentration &gt;= 9 gram per deciliter (g/dL) As subjects with documented liver metastases are treated in this trial, liver function test values are accepted as followed: up to the upper limit of Grade 2 as defined by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 3.0. This includes total bilirubin level less than or equal to (=&lt;) 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels =&lt;5 x ULN Adequate renal function defined by serum creatinine =&lt;1.5 x ULN or a creatinine clearance of &gt;=50 milliliter per minute (mL/min) calculated by CockcroftGault Effective contraception (example: double barrier method) for both male and female subjects if the risk of conception exists. These subjects must be willing to avoid pregnancy during the study (screening to end of study [EOS]) as well as for at least 3 months after the last dosing.
