	<brief_title>Diabetes Management in Low-Income Hispanic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are randomly assigned to a Usual Care condition or to the Cognitive Behavioral Intervention condition. The unit of randomization and analysis is the patient. The intervention is implemented by a nutritionist, a nurse diabetes educator and an assistant, and patients are encouraged to bring a family member or friend living in the same household to facilitate home-based support for the intervention. The intervention emphasizes patients' ethnic preferences and traditions (e.g., adapting ethnic recipes to meet dietary goals) and the use of available community resources (e.g., available areas for exercise), and is delivered utilizing strategies and materials appropriate for low-literate/illiterate pts.</detailed_description>
