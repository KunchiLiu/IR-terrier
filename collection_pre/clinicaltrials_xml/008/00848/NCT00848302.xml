	<brief_summary>Up to 30 patients with lower extremity disease scheduled to undergo diagnostic angiography will undergo baseline bloodwork and IVUS (intravascular ultrasound), followed by dosing with L-arginine to assess changes in endothelial function.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We will assess doses of regional L-arginine supplementation in patients undergoing elective angiography for lower extremity PAD. Assessment of EDR and EIR with IVUS in patent arteries will be performed with one of 3 doses of catheter-directed L-arginine. We will obtain plasma samples from the peripheral arteries and assay amino acid levels and protein oxidation products using mass spectrometry. These experiments will determine the optimal L-arginine supplementation dose to be used in further studies. We expect to show that L-arginine supplementation will have a more significant effect on vessels less affected by atherosclerosis, but that this effect diminishes with greater atheroma accumulation as measured by IVUS virtual histology. Also, we expect L-arginine supplementation to be most effective in vessels with low baseline L-arginine levels. Lastly, we will compare local arterial factors obtained via catheter-directed arterial sampling (NOx, L-arginine, nitrotyrosine levels) to traditional serum risk factors (glucose, HbA1c, LDL, homocysteine and hs C-reactive protein).</detailed_description>
