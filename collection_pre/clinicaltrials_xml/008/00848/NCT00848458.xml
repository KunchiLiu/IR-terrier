	<brief_title>Azelaic Acid Iontophoresis Versus Topical Azelaic Acid Cream in the Treatment of Melasma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be randomized and allocated in concealed manner to one of the two treatment arms: AAI or topical azelaic acid cream. Azelaic acid iontophoresis treatment schedule: Patients randomized to the AAI group will receive iontophoresis with 15% azelaic acid twice weekly over a period of 12 weeks. Azelaic acid topical treatment schedule: Patients randomized to the topical treatment group will receive topical treatment with 20% azelaic acid cream twice daily over a period of 12 weeks. Besides emollients no additional specific treatments will be allowed during the study. The use of broad spectrum (UVA+UVB) sunscreen is recommended over the entire study period (9 month).
