	<brief_summary>Survival after invasive coronary revascularization is worse in patients with chronic kidney disease than in those without it. The investigators aimed to examine whether oral administration of nicorandil, a hybrid of nitrate and adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channel opener, could improve the survival of end-stage renal disease patients with coronary artery disease by inhibiting cardiac death after coronary revascularization.</brief_summary>
