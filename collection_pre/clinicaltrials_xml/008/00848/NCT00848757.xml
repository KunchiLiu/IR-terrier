	<detailed_description>This project is a clinical outcome study that merges the expertise of a senior Yale clinical investigator, the clinical and translational research resources of YCCI, the clinical and community expertise of the FHCHC Diabetes Team, and the high-need patient population of FHCHC. In addition to determining the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of an ILI for diabetes prevention in an inner-city community health center setting, this project will evaluate the effectiveness of pooling academic expertise with direct clinical services to disadvantaged, at-risk populations.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>In order to be eligible for this study, the following criteria must be met: Subjects must be willing to travel to the clinic for all regularly scheduled study visits, and to the lifestyle intervention program site for the ILI (the John Martinez School). Subjects must have had a 2 hour 75 gram Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) with fasting glucose between 100 and 126, or 2 hour glucose between 140 and 200 mg/dl in order to participate in this study within the 4 months prior to enrollment. Willingness to undergo fasting blood testing: HOMAIR, fasting lipid profile (including total cholesterol, HDL, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides) at the beginning of the study (if not previously obtained with the OGTT) and repeated at 12 months. Subjects must have no medical contraindications to exercise or dieting. Subjects will be excluded from the study if they have diabetes or other serious medical or psychiatric condition that would preclude participation in the ILI program.

Women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant will not be enrolled in this study. Any behavioral or psychosocial issue that will interfere with the subject's completion of the program, including an eating disorder will prohibit subjects from participating in this study. Subjects cannot participate if they have concurrent membership in a comprehensive weight management program.</criteria>
