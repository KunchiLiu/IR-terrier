	<brief_summary>This study aimed to measure the degree of thoracic kyphosis in elderly women with those affected by osteoporosis in the spine, through photogrammetry computer and check the difference between the values obtained with the assumption of greater thoracic kyphosis in osteoporotic women.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The decrease in bone density of vertebrae leads to a reduction of the anterior vertebral bodies, resulting in compression and collapse of vertebrae, with narrowing of intervertebral disc spaces and, determining a number of deformities in the spine and postural changes, among which can highlight the increase in thoracic kyphosis. This becomes significantly higher with age and after menopause, defined as an increase in curvature in the sagittal plane of the thoracic spine. Radiographic images have been used for the measurement of thoracic kyphosis, but with some drawbacks of this method such as radiation exposure, radiographic image quality unsatisfactory hampering its analysis and the lack of equipment in the physical environment to monitor clinical evolution of the treatment, causing thus the search for noninvasive methods for evaluating the curves of the spine, including the photogrammetry computed. According to the American Society of Photogrammetry, the computed photogrammetry is "the art, science and technology of information on physical objects and environment through processes of recording, measuring and interpreting photographic images and patterns of electromagnetic radiant energy and other sources." It is a widely used tool for assessment by quantifying the postural changes through the application of photogrammetric principles to photographic images obtained in body movements, adding to the diagnostic evaluation for physical therapy in different areas.</detailed_description>
