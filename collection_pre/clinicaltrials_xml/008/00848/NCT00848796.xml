	<brief_summary>Two heparin brands have been in the market in Canada for several years. Heparin Leo from Leo Pharma and Hepalean from Organon. The former is standardized by B.P (British pharmacopeia) while the latter is standardized by U.S.P (United states pharmacopeia). Previous studies have shown Heparin Leo to have roughly a 10% less efficacy then Hepalean. It has also been demonstrated that more protamine is required to reverse Heparin Leo. It is the investigators' intention to study the post-operative effects of the two brands of heparin and whether one of the two causes less bleeding after bypass surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Study of Two Brands of Heparin Already on the Market</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study protocol attempts not to change the normal protocol for cardiac surgery too much. The two different brands of heparin-Heparin Leo (Leo pharma) and Hepalean (Organon) are randomized by the float perfusionist using the program research randomizer.A 50 ml syringe is loaded with heparin for the Anesthesiologist and labelled. A 20 ml syringe is loaded with heparin and thenn labelled. It is a double blinded trial with the surgeon and anesthetist not knowing which brand heparin is being used. All cases are isolated Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (C.A.B.G) with no concomittant conditions. The following are the patients excluded from the trial 1. RE-DO 2. COMBINATION PROCEDURE 3. VALVE REPAIR/REPLACEMENT 4. IABP-PRE/INTRA//POST-OP 5. CELL SAVER INTRA-OP 6. ANEMIA (70 g/L)/BLEEDING DISORDER eg:Jehovah's witness,hemophilia etc. 7. USE OF APROTININ 8. SMALL ADULT &lt; 50 KG 9. AORTIC SURGERY WITH/WITHOUT CIRC ARREST 10. EMERGENT PATIENT WITH HEART FAILURE Heparin will be administered in the trial to elevate the A.C.T-Activated clotting time to 480 s and above and the heparin level to 300u/Kg to intiate cardio-pulmonary bypass (C.P.B). Additional heparin will be given to maintain the above-mentioned levels. The following data will be studied - BSA - Height - Weight - Diagnosis - Procedure - Surgeon - Anesthetist - Perfusionist Pre pump Hb Pump Hb Post pump Hb Pre pump ACT Pump ACT Post pump ACT Projected heparin conc.
