	<brief_summary>The goals of this R21 exploratory pilot and feasibility study were to: 1) design an Internet-based self-management intervention for adolescents with type 1 diabetes; 2) test that intervention in a small randomized trial to establish technical feasibility, intervention acceptability, and competence in completing the necessary recruitment and research procedures. Although not powered to detect statistically significant changes, possible outcomes of this study include improvements in problem-solving, coping, and self-management behaviors.</brief_summary>
