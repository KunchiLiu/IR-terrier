	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well gossypol acetic acid works in treating patients with recurrent, metastatic, or primary adrenocortical cancer that cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy such as gossypol acetic acid, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gossypol Acetic Acid in Treating Patients With Recurrent, Metastatic, or Primary Adrenocortical Cancer That Cannot Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: I. To determine the proportion of patients with recurrent, metastatic, or primary unresectable adrenocortical carcinoma who achieve an objective response to R-(-)-gossypol acetic acid. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:: I. To evaluate the safety of this drug in these patients. II. To determine the progression-free and overall survival of these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral R-(-)-gossypol acetic acid once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2 years.</detailed_description>
