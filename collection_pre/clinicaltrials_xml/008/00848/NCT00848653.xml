	<brief_title>ELECTION - The Electrode Configuration Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) Study (ELECTION)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an accepted treatment for selected heart failure patients. This therapy is delivered using a device (pacemaker (PM) +/- defibrillator (ICD) ) and leads placed in the right atrium (RA), right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle (LV). Rates of LV lead implantation failure and post operative lead related have decreased dramatically over the years, however, the incidence of lead dislodgement and phrenic nerve stimulation is still high. This study is a prospective evaluation of the benefits of having various pace/sense electrode configurations available in a CRT system.</detailed_description>
