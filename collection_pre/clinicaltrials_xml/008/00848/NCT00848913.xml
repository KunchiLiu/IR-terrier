	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of progressive strength training of the fractured limb in patients with hip fracture, during admittance in an acute orthopedic ward. The primary study hypothesis is that the training will reduce the strength deficit in the fractured limb in comparison with the non-fractured limb. Secondary, that patients following the intervention will present larger improvements in physical function compared to controls.</brief_summary>
