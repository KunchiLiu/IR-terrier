	<brief_title>Irinotecan/Cisplatin, Potentially Curative Surgery With or Without Floxuridine, Followed by Capecitabine for Stomach and Gastro-esophageal Junction (GEJ) Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A previous Phase-II trial conducted by the same principle investigator(s), utilizing preoperative chemotherapy and intraperitoneal consolidation, was conducted in patients with locally advanced, potentially resectable gastric cancer or cancer of the gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ), both staged as T3N0, T4N0, any TN1 or TN2 disease. The data suggest that for patients with locally advanced gastric or GEJ cancer, systemic induction therapy, curative surgery with high Ro resection rates, and IP adjuvant therapy, has acceptable toxicity and encouraging survival outcome. The Medical Research Council Adjuvant Gastric Infusional Chemotherapy (MAGIC) trial has also shown that perioperative chemotherapy - chemotherapy given both before and after surgery - can provide a significant survival benefit. The investigators hypothesize that adjuvant intraperitoneal salvage of cancer micrometastatic residues after surgery contributes to disease-free survival. The goal of this trial is to determine whether IP Floxuridine, added to adjuvant postoperative chemotherapy, prolongs patient's survival. This will be tested during the randomized open-label trial.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Only untreated patients with histologically documented gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma, clinical American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage grouping (11) IBIV (Mo) by CT scan and laparoscopy/endoscopic ultrasound, are eligible. Excluded are patients in need of urgent surgery for gastrointestinal obstruction, perforation or hemorrhage. Both men and women &gt;= 18 years of age with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 02, members of any ethnic group and minorities. Patients without another invasive malignancy, with adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, free for 5 years or more of insitu cervix cancer or other insitu cancer. Since immune deficiency increases the risk of terminal infections when aggravated by bone marrow suppressive therapy, patients must be without active or uncontrolled infection including HIV. Patients without psychiatric disorders that may interfere with their consent and/or with protocol followup. An adequate bonemarrow reserve (absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/ mmL, thrombocytes &gt;= 100,000 mmL, hemoglobin &gt;= 9 gm/dL). Preserved liver and renal function (total serum bilirubin &lt;2 mg/dL, SGOT/SGPT =&lt; 3x the upper limit of normal, alkaline phosphatase =&lt; 3x the upper limit of normal, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) =&lt; 30 mg/dL, serum creatinine concentration &lt;1.5 mg/dL and creatinine clearance &gt;= 50 mL/min) are required. Creatinine clearance should be normalized for 1.73 M^2 BSA. The prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and thrombin time should be within the range of normal values. Since chemotherapeutic agents to be used are known or suspected to be teratogenic or with other adverse effects, women must not be pregnant or breastfeeding. All females of childbearing potential must have a blood test or urine study within 2 weeks prior to registration to rule out pregnancy. All patients of reproductive age may not participate unless they agree to use an effective medically acceptable contraceptive method. Patients without diagnosed Gilbert's disease and bilirubin level &gt;= 2.0 mg/dL, as these patients may have excessive CPT11 toxicity. No prior severe reaction to fluoropyrimidine therapy or known hypersensitivity to 5fluorouracil. Capecitabine (Xeloda) is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment, i.e., creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min, determined by CockcroftGault equation shown on page 15 under (i) Renal impairment. In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 3050 mL/min), which develops during the course of adjuvant treatment with Capecitabine, the drug is decreased to 75% of the starting dose. Patients should be without any severe concurrent disease, such as cardiac condition not responding to medication, myocardial infarction within the last 12 months, active infection or uncontrolled pulmonary disease, or any other disease which in judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study. Patients who signed written informed consent.</criteria>
