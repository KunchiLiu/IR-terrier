	<brief_summary>This study will be performed on patients who come to labbafinejad ophthalmic clinic from 20 March 2008. Keratoconus diagnosis will be determined by clinical finding in slit lamp, keratometery and topographic characteristics. Patients will be randomly placed in group A and B. In group A, Anwar surgical method and in B, Melles surgical method, will be done. This is not a blind study due to surgeons' knowledge. All patients will receive Btamethazone drop and Chloramphenicol every 6 hours and will be tapered in two months. In the end anatomical results, complications, BCVA, UCVA, astigmatism, endothelial cell numbers will be compared in two groups by using specular microscopy. Contrast sensivity, central corneal diameter, interface wrinkling and opacity will be measured by metrovison, Confoscan, Photoslit in months 3, 6, 12, respectively and will be evaluated afterwards.</brief_summary>
