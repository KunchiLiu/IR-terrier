	<brief_summary>This is a Phase Ib/IIa open-labeled multi-center trial evaluating the feasibility of dasatinib given after standard induction therapy with daunorubicin (DNR) and cytarabine (ARA-C), after consolidation therapy with high-dose cytarabine (HDAC), and as single agent in a one-year maintenance therapy in patients with newly diagnosed CBF AML. 82 patients with newly diagnosed CBF AML will be enrolled at AMLSG study centers. All AML patients will be assessed for the CBF fusion genes via the central laboratory of the AMLSG within 48 hours of diagnosis of AML, and only patients with CBF AML will be enrolled into the study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Core binding factor (CBF) AML with molecular diagnosis of RUNX1RUNX1T1 fusion transcript resulting from t(8;21)(q22;q22) (or a variant form) or of CBFBMYH11 fusion transcript resulting from inv(16)(p13.1q22)/t(16;16)(p13.1;q22) as assessed in one of the central AMLSG reference laboratories. Age ≥ 18; there is no upper age limit. No prior chemotherapy for leukemia except hydroxyurea for up to 5 days during the diagnostic screening phase. Nonpregnant and nonnursing. Due to the unknown teratogenic potential of dasatinib in humans, pregnant or nursing patients may not be enrolled. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL within 72 hours prior to registration. Women of childbearing potential must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth control one highly effective method (e.g., IUD, hormonal, tubal ligation, or partner's vasectomy), and one additional effective method (e.g., latex condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap) AT THE SAME TIME, at least four weeks before she begins dasatinib therapy. "Women of childbearing potential" is defined as a sexually active mature woman who has not undergone a hysterectomy or who has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months. Men must agree not to father a child and must use a latex condom during any sexual contact with women of childbearing potential while taking dasatinib and for 4 weeks after therapy is stopped, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy.

If edema/effusion resolves to CTC Grade ≤ 1, patients can be treated with dasatinib.
