	<brief_summary>Diabetic pregnant patients are at risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, including larger than expected fetuses and unplanned operative deliveries, due to elevated blood glucose levels. the one-hour glucola test is currently used to screen pregnant patients for gestational diabetes. This involves ingesting a 50-gram glucose load, followed by a blood test one hour later. We wish to compare 7-day continuous glucose monitoring to the one-hour glucola test, and determine which one correlates better with adverse pregnancy outcomes as well as which one more accurately identifies patients at risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Correlation of Continuous Glucose Monitoring and Glucose Tolerance Testing With Pregnancy Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All pregnant patients without pre-existing diabetes will be eligible for the study. Interest in participation will be determined at their initial prenatal visit. Those that are interested will be consented. Between 24-28 weeks of gestation, the recommended period of glucola testing, a soft sensor for continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) will be inserted superficially under the skin. The patient will be instructed on how to wear and care for the device. She will wear the CGMS for 7 days, then return to the clinic for removal of the device, and downloading of the data. She will perform the routine glucola test sometime between days 2 to 7 . Finger stick blood glucoses will be checked by the patient 2 times daily during the 7 days of wearing the CGMS. Results of CGMS will not be available to the patient or her physician until after completion of the pregnancy. The patient will be treated routinely, based on the results of the routine glucola test.</detailed_description>
