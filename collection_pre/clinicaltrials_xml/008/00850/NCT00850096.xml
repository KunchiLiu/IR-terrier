	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is: - To assess the efficacy of Nasulin vs. placebo as indicated by time spent in euglycemia, assessed by continuous glucose monitoring data and serum fructosamine levels in patient volunteers with Type 2 Diabetes. - To asses the safety and tolerability of Nauslin at 50 IU and 100IU doses in patient volunteers with Type 2 Diabetes</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This proof of concept trial has a randomized, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled design with a 4-week single-blind placebo and diet run-in period. Given a ratio of 1:1, patient volunteers will be randomized into one of two parallel treatment arms, Nasulin in a combination with insulin glargine or placebo in combination with insulin glargine. The randomization period will be 6 weeks in length. The total length of individual patient volunteer participation, including screening and follow-up will be approximately 13-14 weeks.</detailed_description>
