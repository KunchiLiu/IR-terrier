	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to examine the short-term effects of Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone (GHRH, tesamorelin) administration in healthy men. We hypothesize that GHRH will increase GH pulse height and will not affect insulin sensitivity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Short Term Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone in Healthy Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to determine the effects of growth hormone releasing hormone (Tesamorelin) on endogenous overnight growth hormone secretion and pulsatility, as well as insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Healthy male subjects will receive 2mg Tesamorelin, subcutaneously, daily for two weeks. At baseline and after two weeks of treatment, we will assess overnight growth hormone by frequent sampling as well as insulin stimulated glucose uptake by clamp. Subjects will then stop the Tesamorelin and will return for an identical assessment after a 2 week withdrawal period.</detailed_description>
