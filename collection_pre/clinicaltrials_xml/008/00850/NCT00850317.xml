	<brief_summary>A research study for patients with Fanconi Anemia whose bone marrow has changed and now failed, giving rise to a pre-leukemia or leukemia. This study is a Phase II clinical trial in which patients will undergo allogenic transplant of stem cells, meaning they will receive bone marrow cells from a healthy donor. The purpose of this study is to see if transplant course of treatment will lower the risk of graft vs. host disease.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis: Patients must have a diagnosis of Fanconi anemia (confirmed by mitomycin C or diepoxybutane [DEB] chromosomal breakage testing at an approved laboratory) Hematologic Diagnosis and Status: Patients must have one of the following hematologic diagnoses: 1. Severe Aplastic Anemia (SAA), or Severe Isolated Single lineage Cytopenia with bone marrow cellularity of &lt; 25% AND at least one of the following features: Platelet count &lt; 20 x 109/L or platelet transfusion dependence ANC &lt; 1000 x 109/L Hgb &lt; 8 gm/dl or red cell transfusion dependence 2. Myelodysplatic Syndrome (MDS) (Appendix 1: MDS Classification). MDS at any stage, based on either one of the following classifications: WHO Classification Refractory anemia and transfusion dependence Any of other stages IPSS Classification Low risk (score 0) and transfusion dependence Any other risk groups Score &gt; 0.5 3.
