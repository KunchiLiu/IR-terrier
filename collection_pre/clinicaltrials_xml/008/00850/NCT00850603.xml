	<brief_summary>The objective of this trial is to study the administration of the Menomune vaccine given intradermally and low-dose subcutaneously versus standard subcutaneously. This study will describe the immunogenicity of Menomune® - A/C/Y/W-135 administered subcutaneously (standard dose) versus intradermally over a dose range (1/10th, 2/10th, and 3/10th of standard dose) and a low dose (2/10th of standard dose) subcutaneously. The secondary objective is to describe the safety of the subcutaneous (SC) and intradermal (ID) routes at different dosages</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This trial will provide a proof of concept that a dose range of Menomune given ID can induce an immune response that is comparable to standard dosing by the SC route, and is equivalent or superior to a low dose given SC. Subjects will be randomized according to a computer-generated randomization schedule to receive the vaccine by SC injection or by ID injection at different dosages.</detailed_description>
