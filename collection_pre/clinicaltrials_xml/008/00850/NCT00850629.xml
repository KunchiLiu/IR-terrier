	<brief_summary>The investigators here propose to perform a collaborative clinical research effort including a randomized controlled trial investigating the mechanisms of weight maintenance and their relation to a lifestyle intervention in children, adolescents and adults. The detailed investigation and analysis of the variability and dynamics of the endocrine circuits responding to a negative energy balance and weight loss will be accompanied and enhanced by specific clinical projects targeting peripheral and central-nervous aspects of hormonal counter-regulation after weight loss. Mechanisms of endocrine counter-regulation and potential therapeutic approaches will be studied.</brief_summary>
