	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of the radiopharmaceutical 3'-deoxy-3'-[F-18]fluorothymidine, [F-18]FLT, a tracor of cell proliferation, using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging for the tumor diagnosis and prognosis in a group of 50 patients with different type of brain tumors.[F-18]FLT PET imaging will be compared to the current used imaging techniques of MRI, spectroscopy imaging, PET imaging using [11C]MET tracer, immunohistochemical analysis and clinical parameters.</brief_summary>
