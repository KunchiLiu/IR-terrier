	<brief_summary>Ovarian cancer patients are often at risk of malnutrition because of weight loss, lack of appetite and reduced food intake. Being malnourished can contribute to the incidence and severity of cancer treatment side effects and increase the risk of infection. Currently patients with advanced ovarian cancer do not receive early nutrition using a feeding tube. The purpose of this study is to compare enteral nutrition along with standard post-surgery care against current standard post-operative care alone. This study will see if early nutrition using a feeding tube has an impact on length of hospital admission, recovery from surgery, complications from surgery, nutritional status and ultimately a reduction in treatment costs in people with Advanced Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC). Primary Peritoneal Cancer (PPC) or Fallopian Tube Cancer. Nutritional support has been shown to ; - Prevent and treat under-nutrition, - Enhance anti-tumour treatment effects, - Reduce adverse effects of anti-tumour therapies, - Improve quality of life.</brief_summary>
