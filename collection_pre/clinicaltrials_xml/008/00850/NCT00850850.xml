	<brief_summary>Recovery after general anaesthesia is often prolonged in the elderly. This group is particularly exposed to post-operative confusion. This has negative personal consequences as well as consequences for the postoperative care for these patients. The hypothesis is that physostigmine will decrease the amount of time in the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU ), the postoperative amount of pain and shivering and finally post-operative confusion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Physostigmine After General Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The researchers wish to investigate the use of physostigmine in the elderly patients (age &gt; 60 yrs, ASA I-III) in the postoperative recovery-phase after general anesthesia. Apart from the beneficial effects for the patient, the lessened amount of time in the PACU will release caregiving resources and thereby increase the efficacy of the PACU.</detailed_description>
