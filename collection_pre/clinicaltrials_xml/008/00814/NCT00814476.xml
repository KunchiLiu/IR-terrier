	<brief_title>The Effects of Regular Home Use Vs Diabetic Team- Supported Use of the Medtronic CareLink Therapy Management System.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized, two arms, controlled, open study in order to compare the efficacy, short and long term effects of regular home-use Vs diabetic team- supported use of the Medtronic CareLink therapy management system in patients with diabetes. Primary objective: To assess the efficacy, short term (4 months) and long term (8 months) effects of using the Medtronic CareLink® Therapy Management System for Diabetes on the following parameters: 1. Metabolic control as expressed by HbA1c. 2. Hypoglycemic events- number and severity of episodes. 3. DKA and ketosis events- number and severity of episodes. 4. Patient's satisfaction and quality of life measured by treatment satisfaction and quality of life questionnaires. 5. 7 points glucose profile. Secondary objective: To compare the efficacy of 4 months treatment using the CareLink® Therapy Management System, accompanied with intensive contact (at least once a month) initiated by diabetic team via the internet/electronic mail Vs home use treatment - without monthly contact initiated by the diabetic team Study design: The study will be comprised of two consecutive segments. At the first segment that will last during the first 4 months of the study, patients will be randomized to the CareLink treated group or non CareLink treated group. At this segment of the study the usage of the CareLink system will be accompanied by the diabetic team, through at least monthly contact via the internet initiated by the diabetic team. At the second segment of the study, during the following 4 months, both groups will use the CareLink system, home-use, without support initiated by the diabetic team.</detailed_description>
