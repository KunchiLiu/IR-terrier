	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the immunogenicity in terms of antibody response and the safety/reactogenicity in terms of solicited and unsolicited symptoms and serious adverse events following primary vaccination of Indian infants with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine GSK1024850A co-administered with a diphtheria, tetanus, whole cell pertussis (DTPw)-combined vaccine during the first 4 months of life. The study will be conducted in India.</brief_summary>
