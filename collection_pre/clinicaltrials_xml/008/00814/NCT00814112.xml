	<brief_summary>We have previously shown that the plasma level of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) in septic shock patients are elevated compared to controls. The purpose of this study is to investigate the temporal dynamic of the blood level of GAG in ten septic shock patients. In addition, to assess the kinetics of GAG during septic shock we examine the liver function by galactose elimination capacity as well as excreted urinary GAG.</brief_summary>
