	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between the plasma concentrations of the study drug and the amount of the study drug bound to the D3 receptors of the brain after dosing of a new compound GSK618334.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open Label Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Study of GSK618334 in Healthy Male Subjects Using 11C-PHNO as PET Ligand</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This imaging study will be an open label, non-randomised PET receptor occupancy study using healthy male volunteers. The time course and degree of D3 receptor occupancy (RO) after single doses of GSK618334 will be determined using 11C-PHNO as a PET ligand labeling dopamine receptor. The PK/PD relationship between plasma concentrations of GSK618334 and D3 RO will be described. Potential relationships between D3 RO and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) endpoints will be assessed as an exploratory aim.</detailed_description>
