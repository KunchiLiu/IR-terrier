	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Sunitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well sunitinib works in treating patients with kidney cancer that has spread to the brain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sunitinib in Treating Patients With Kidney Cancer That Has Spread to the Brain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the objective response rate in the brain after 2 courses of sunitnib malate in patients with previously untreated or recurrent brain metastases secondary to renal cancer following radiotherapy or surgery. Secondary - Evaluate duration of response. - Evaluate objective response of non-CNS targets. - Evaluate time to disease progression. - Evaluate overall and progression-free survival. - Evaluate neurological symptoms associated with the tumor. - Evaluate feasibility and overall tolerance of this drug. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily for 4 weeks. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months.</detailed_description>
