	<brief_title>A Phase 3 Study to Compare Efficacy and Safety of Masitinib to Placebo in the Treatment of Patients With Smouldering Systemic, Indolent Systemic or Cutaneous Mastocytosis With Handicap</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mastocytosis is a disease characterized by mast cell invasion in various organs. Mast cells are bone marrow derived cells which produce histamine and other substances causing allergic and anaphylactic reactions. Accumulation of mast cells in body organs can inhibit the functionality of the organ and eventually cause degeneration. Mutations of the mast cell growth factor receptor (KIT protein, the product of the c-Kit proto-oncogene) might be found in patients with mastocytosis. Masitinib (AB1010) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), selectively and effectively inhibiting c-kit. Its effect may include inhibition of cell proliferation, inhibition of cell cycle progression and induction of apoptosis resulting in the reduction of mast cell accumulation in body tissues. This drug is thereby specific to mastocytosis and active in slowing or reducing the number of mast cells particularly in aggressive forms of the disease.</detailed_description>

Change in the symptomatic treatment of mastocytosis or administration of any new treatment of mastocytosis within 4 weeks prior to baseline 6. Treatment with any investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to baseline</criteria>
