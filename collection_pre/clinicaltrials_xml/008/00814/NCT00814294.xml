	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this trial is to compare the reduction in mean glycated hemoglobin levels (HbA1c) between 2 doses of oral HDV-I and placebo in type 2 diabetic patients on background metformin therapy at the end of 18 weeks of treatment. The secondary objectives are: - To evaluate the effects of oral HDV-I versus placebo on the 7-point glucose test, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function (HOMA-β), frequency of hypoglycemic events, body weight, and lipid levels; and - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral HDV-I.</brief_summary>
