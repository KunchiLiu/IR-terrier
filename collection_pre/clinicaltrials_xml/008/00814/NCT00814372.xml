	<brief_summary>To define the relative efficacy, safety and tolerability profiles of oral daily MBX-102 at daily doses of 400 and 600 mg vs. placebo and Actos® 30 mg (up-titrated to 45 mg after 8 weeks) when administered for up to 24 weeks in patients inadequately controlled with a stable dose of metformin (≥ 1500 mg/day).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluate Safety and Effectiveness of MBX-102 in Type 2 Diabetes Patients With Poor Glycemic Control on Metformin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 240 patients will be randomized in this study, 60 to each of two MBX-102 treatment groups (400 and 600 mg daily), 60 to placebo, and 60 to the Actos® group. Patients in the Actos® group will receive Actos® 30 mg/daily for the first eight weeks of the treatment phase and Actos® 45 mg/daily for the last 16 weeks of the treatment phase. Patients in the MBX-102 400 mg group and MBX-102 600 mg group will continue MBX-102 400 mg and 600 mg, respectively for the full 24 weeks. All study medication will be over-encapsulated; thus, each patient will take two blinded capsules each day containing either placebo, MBX-102 or Actos®. This sample size provides the minimum number expected to ensure a power of at least 90% in detecting a difference of 0.64% in HbA1c between the placebo and experimental treatment, using a two-tailed, two-sample t-test with type 1 error of 0.05, when the pooled standard deviation is ≤ 1.0%, and the discontinuation rate is ≤ 12.5%.</detailed_description>
