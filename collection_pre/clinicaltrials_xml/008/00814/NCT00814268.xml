	<brief_summary>Primary objective: - Comparison of efficacy of the combination therapy (clopidogrel plus aspirin) and the aspirin alone (main comparison) to prevent any recurrent ischemic lesion . Secondary objectives: - Comparison of Modified Rankin scale (mRS) scores; - Comparison of the Incidence of all kinds of stroke and vascular death; - Comparison of the Incidence of bleeding episodes (major and minor) and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhages during the follow-up period.</brief_summary>
