	<brief_title>Examining the Effects of CXB722 in Neuroendocrine Stress Response in Healthy Males</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute stress produces a cascade of physiological and psychological effects, including increased cardiovascular function, increases in circulating levels of stress hormones and neurotransmitter levels, and changes in mood and subjective state. The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) is a standardized, well-validated procedure that was developed in order to provide a controlled method for exposing subjects to a stressor. The TSST consists of a public speaking and a mental arithmetic test performed in the context of a mock job interview. A drug that could safely block or mitigate the stress response would have multiple applications in medicine, beyond treating anxiety, because stress is associated with many disease states, including cardiovascular disease. The drug being studied, CXB722, is thought to show promise in diminishing the physiologic and psychological effects of stress.</detailed_description>
