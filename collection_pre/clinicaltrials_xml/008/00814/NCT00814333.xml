	<brief_summary>Epistaxis is a common problem among people of all ages and backgrounds. However, occasionally epistaxis can be severe enough to require emergency room admission. Among the treatment options for epistaxis, nasal packing is the most common approach. This approach requires a return visit to the clinic for removal of the packing. Additionally, there is a great deal of pain during the insertion and removal of this packing. This study aims to justify the further investigation of thrombin as a potential treatment approach for these patients. Thrombin could provide a treatment approach that reduces pain and eliminates the need for a return visit to the clinic.</brief_summary>
