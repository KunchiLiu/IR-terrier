	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficiency of permanent biventricular pacing using three ventricular leads in terms of reduction in adverse cardiac events rates, improvement in cardiac capacity and patients' functional status in subjects with congestive heart failure and a physiologic (sinus) rhythm.</brief_summary>
