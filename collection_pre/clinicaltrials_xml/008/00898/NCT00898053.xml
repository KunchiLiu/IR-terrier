	<brief_summary>This laboratory study is looking at tumor samples from patients with Ewing sarcoma. Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Tumor Samples From Patients With Ewing Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Subtype: Ancillary/Correlative Observational Study Model: Cohort Time Perspective: Prospective Biospecimen Retention: Samples With DNA Biospecimen Description: Tissue Study Population Description: Samples collected from AEWS0031 and patients registered on AEWS08B1 Sampling Method: Non-Probability Sample PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine if mutation of p53, and/or deletion of the p16 locus, have prognostic value in patients with Ewing sarcoma. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the incidence of p53 mutation in Ewing sarcoma samples collected from COG studies. II. Estimate the incidence of p16 deletions in Ewing sarcoma samples collected from COG studies. III. Prepare and archive amplified genomic DNA from Ewing sarcoma samples collected from COG studies for future biologic analysis. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Previously archived tumor samples are analyzed for p53 mutations and p16 deletion by immunohistochemistry, FISH, PCR, and DNA sequencing.</detailed_description>
