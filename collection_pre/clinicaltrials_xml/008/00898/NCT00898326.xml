	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and tissue from patients with prostate cancer after receiving implant radiation therapy and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist may help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer and help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment. PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at PSA levels and biopsy samples after undergoing implant radiation therapy and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy in patients with stage I or stage II prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PSA Levels and Biopsy Samples After Implant Radiation and Hormone Therapy in Patients With Stage I or Stage II Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To analyze biopsy results at 36 months after permanent iodine I 125 implantation therapy and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy for patients with untreated intermediate-risk prostate cancer. OUTLINE: Patients received luteinizing hormone releasing-hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy and permanent iodine I 125 implantation on protocol JUSMH-BRI-GU05-01. Patients undergo blood sample collection and tissue biopsy for biomarker/laboratory analysis at 36 months after receiving brachytherapy and releasing-hormone agonist therapy. PSA levels and biopsy results are compared.</detailed_description>
