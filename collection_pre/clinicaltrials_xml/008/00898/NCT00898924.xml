	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Collecting and storing samples of tissue from patients with cancer to study in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that may occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at epidermal growth factor receptor mutations and k-ras oncogene mutations in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor and K-ras Mutations in Patients With Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the frequency of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and K-ras mutations in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated on CALGB 30106. - Correlate presence or absence of EGFR and/or K-ras mutations with radiographic response to treatment in these patients. OUTLINE: Tissue samples are analyzed for epidermal growth factor receptor and K-ras mutations.</detailed_description>
