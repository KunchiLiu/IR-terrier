	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Collecting and storing samples of blood from patients with cancer to study in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about cancer and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at biomarkers of angiogenesis and disease in patients with unresectable malignant mesothelioma treated on clinical trial CALGB-30107.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers of Angiogenesis and Disease in Patients With Unresectable Malignant Mesothelioma Treated on Clinical Trial CALGB-30107</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine if elevated levels of thrombospondin I serum levels, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor I, fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor, and mesothelin portend a poor prognosis in patients with unresectable malignant mesothelioma treated with vatalanib on protocol CALGB-30107. - Determine if elevated levels of thrombospondin I serum levels, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor I, fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor, and mesothelin correlate with response or stable disease in these patients. OUTLINE: Serum samples previously obtained from patients on protocol CALGB-30107 are tested for levels of thrombospondin I serum, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor I, fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor, and mesothelin using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 47 specimens will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
