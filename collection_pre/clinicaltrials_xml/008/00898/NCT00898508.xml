	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Collecting and storing samples of blood and tumor tissue from patients with cancer to test in the laboratory may help the study of cancer in the future. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying blood and tumor tissue samples in women with invasive breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ, lobular carcinoma in situ, or benign breast disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Studying Blood and Tumor Tissue Samples in Women With Invasive Breast Cancer, Ductal or Lobular Carcinoma in Situ, or Benign Breast Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To establish a specimen bank from peripheral blood specimens collected from women with a full spectrum of breast disease (invasive breast cancer [IBC], ductal or lobular carcinoma in situ [CIS], or benign breast disease [BBD]) with standardized clinical follow up and serial specimen collection for those with IBC. - To determine the ability of quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) to discriminate between patients with IBC, CIS, and BBD by comparing baseline assay values from pre-biopsy specimens to the histologic diagnosis. - To determine the ability of qRT-PCR to predict treatment response by comparing serial assay values from patients with evaluable IBC to their objective response. - To determine the ability of qRT-PCR to predict relapse by comparing the serial assay values from all patients with IBC to their disease status. - To determine the ability of qRT-PCR to perform as an independent prognostic factor by comparing baseline assay values from all patients with IBC to their disease status, stratified by known breast cancer prognostic factors. Secondary - To perform exploratory studies identifying potential targets for novel nucleic acid and proteomic-based early detection assays. OUTLINE: Patients undergo baseline peripheral blood specimen collection pre-biopsy and then periodically for up to 10 years. Specimens are analyzed for circulating tumor cells via quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR, immunofluorescence, and bidirectional pyrophosphorolysis-activated polymerization allele-specific amplification; and for protein profiles via mass spectometry, liquid chromatography, enzyme digestion, and tandem mass spectometry. Patients' tumor tissue (invasive breast cancer [IBC] only) is analyzed for p53 via IHC. Medical records are reviewed periodically. Patients with IBC complete a quality of life assessment at baseline and every 6 months for up to 10 years.</detailed_description>
