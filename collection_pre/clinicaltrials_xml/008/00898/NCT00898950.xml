	<brief_summary>This study was set up to assess the effects of different doses of aspirin when compared with placebo (dummy drug), used sequentially over a 2 week study period with a 2 week wash-out (rest period) in between, in people with type-2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk. Specifically, its effects on different factors which are thought to contribute to diabetes such as insulin resistance (body's ability to effectively use insulin), dysglycaemia (excess glucose in the blood), oxidative stress (effects from accumulation of by-products of metabolism), endothelial function (function of lining of blood vessels) and inflammation were studied.</brief_summary>
