	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue in the laboratory from patients with cancer may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict which patients will respond to treatment. PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at prognostic factors in patients receiving tegafur-uracil for stage II colon cancer that was completely removed by surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identifying Prognostic Factors in Patients Receiving Tegafur-Uracil for Stage II Colon Cancer That Was Completely Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Identify the prognostic factors in patients with curatively resected stage II colon cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy with tegafur-uracil. - Identify predictive factors of chemosensitivity to this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Available tumor tissue samples are analyzed by real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR for TS, DPD, TP, OPRT, VEGF, cyclooxygenase-2, and FPGS; by PCR for microsatellite instability and genomic deletions on chromosome arm 18q; and pathologically for tumor budding, Crohn's-like lymphoid reaction, category of extent of poor differentiation, and fibrotic cancer stroma. The candidate prognostic and predictive markers are analyzed for correlation with disease-free survival, relapse-free survival, and overall survival of patients.</detailed_description>
