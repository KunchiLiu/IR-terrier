	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at DNA in tissue samples from patients with head and neck cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DNA Analysis of Tissue Samples From Patients With Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Assess common genetic mutations in tumor and germline DNA samples from patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). - Search for viral DNAs and relate this information to demographics, tumor characteristics, and patient prognosis. - Search for novel viral sequences and cancer-associated gene mutations in young nonsmoking HNSCC patients and in other distinct head and neck cancers. - Determine tumor suppressor gene mutations in HNSCC patients and relate this information to gene expression data. - Validate gene expression information using independent techniques such as real-time PCR on expressed sequences and immunohistochemistry. OUTLINE: Genetic mutation analysis and gene expression studies are performed on tissue samples from patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Techniques used include real time-PCR and immunohistochemistry.</detailed_description>
