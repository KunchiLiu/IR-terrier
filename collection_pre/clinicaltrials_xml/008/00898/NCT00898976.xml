	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue in the laboratory from Native American women with breast cancer may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to breast cancer in these patients. It may also help doctors learn more about the prognosis of these patients. PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at biomarkers in Native American women with breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers in Native American Women With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Evaluate a selected panel of molecular markers in tissue specimens from Native American women with breast cancer. - Determine which molecular markers provide independent prognostic information with respect to traditional prognostic factors in these patients. - Compare and contrast the prevalence of positivity in Native American women with breast cancer with an age- and stage-matched cohort of Caucasian women with breast cancer enrolled on clinical trial NCCTG-77-30-51 or the Mayo Breast Cancer Registry. OUTLINE: Immunohistochemistry is performed on tumor samples to analyze the following molecular markers: estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, c-erbB2, p53, Ki-67, Bcl-2, Bax, cyclin D-1, and insulin-like growth factor-1R.</detailed_description>
