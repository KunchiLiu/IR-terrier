	<brief_title>Effect of Myoma Removal on Blood Pressure and Erythropoetin Level</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Myoma is the most common gynecoid tumor and produces many vasoactive substances, which may be a cause for secondary hypertension. Early reports suggested the association of myoma and hypertension. We studied the effect of myoma removal on hypertension and erythropoietin level to evaluate this hypothesis. Patients &amp; Methods: In this single centered prospective cohort study, in twenty eight patients who were candidates for myomectomy due to myoma, 24 hour holter monitoring of blood pressure and serum erythropoietin were checked before and 6 weeks after hysterectomy.</detailed_description>
