	<brief_summary>Introduction: Graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients submitted to the Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT). The oral manifestations can be very debilitating and interfere in the results of medical therapy, leading to systemic complications, committing the prognosis and quality of life of the patient. The early diagnosis can be done through biopsies of oral mucosa with or without apparent injury clinic. The association between the clinical and histopathological tables of GVHD, especially through the use of recent consensus established in these areas, can bring new benefits to physicians. Objective: This study aims to apply and compare the two classifications histological to GVHD, Horn (1995) and Consensus (2006) in specimens obtained from clinical oral lesions suggestive of GVHD; correlate them with clinical classification according Akpek (2001) and with the survival of the patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods: For this study we analyzed histological samples of oral mucosa of 10 patients with clinical diagnosis of GVHD, which have areas of epithelium, and salivary gland. The histopathological aspects were observed by the author of this work and his advisor, so blinded by applying the criteria for Horn and the Consensus. We consistency between the two classifications obtained and histological correlation with the clinical classification of GVHD (Akpek, 2001) and the curve of survival.</detailed_description>
