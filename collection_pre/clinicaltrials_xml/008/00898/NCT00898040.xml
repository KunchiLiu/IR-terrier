	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that may occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at DNA samples from patients with multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of DNA Samples From Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine whether there is an increased frequency of 1 or more polymorphic alleles that are associated with clinical endpoints using custom myeloma single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip analysis of banked DNA samples from patients with multiple myeloma. - Determine SNPs associated with toxicities caused, not by variations in tumor cell genetics, but by individual genetic variations affecting drug activation, distribution, metabolism, and export (ADME). - Determine SNPs associated with response, influenced by the same ADME. - Determine SNPs associated with bone disease (as a variable) among patients with multiple myeloma. - Determine SNPs associated with epidemiology (i.e., risk factors for the development of multiple myeloma). OUTLINE: This is a retrospective, multicenter study. Banked DNA samples are analyzed using a custom single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip to assess approximately 3,590 SNPs from 1,061 genes that are associated with myeloma growth and response. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 600 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
