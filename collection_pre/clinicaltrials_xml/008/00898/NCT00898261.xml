	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying the genes expressed in samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer may help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at gene expression in tissue from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia enrolled in clinical trial ECOG-2993.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gene Expression in Tissue From Patients With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Identify genes involved in specific biologic processes or molecular functions that contribute to the mechanisms by which the BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase induces a leukemic phenotype using RNA banked from patients with BCR/ABL-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) enrolled on ECOG-2993. - Compare patterns of mRNA expression of BCR/ABL fusion protein in patients with B-lineage ALL vs patients with ALL and no cytogenetic abnormalities enrolled on ECOG-2993. - Determine both shared and differing expression patterns in patients with BCR/ABL-positive and cytogenetically negative ALL with respect to achievement of complete remission and duration of disease-free and overall survival. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Total RNA is isolated from stored tissue samples and integrity is verified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). cDNA libraries are created from total RNA and gene expression is analyzed via microarray analysis. Genes of interest are further analyzed by flow cytometry and RT-PCR. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 137 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
