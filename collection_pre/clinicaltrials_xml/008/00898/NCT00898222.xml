	<brief_title>Effect of Daily Low Dose Aspirin on Exhaled Inflammatory Mediators in Normal Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim: 1. To study the effect of low dose aspirin on exhaled breath inflammatory mediators 2. To compare the change to that seen in diseased states such as asthma and Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) We will interview healthy volunteers to confirm that they do not have any major underlying medical conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, stroke and bleeding disorders. We will collect breath condensate before and after two weeks of low dose over the counter enteric coated aspirin 81 mg/day therapy. Side effects are extremely rare at this dose, but include bleeding, heart burn and allergic reaction.</detailed_description>
