	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of breast tissue in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about the genes and proteins found in breast tissue. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying genes and proteins in breast tissue from women undergoing surgery for breast cancer or core biopsy of the breast.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gene Expression in Tumor Tissue From Women Undergoing Surgery for Breast Cancer or Core Biopsy of the Breast</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Assess tumor gene expression information from women undergoing surgery for breast cancer or core biopsy sampling of the breast. OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Tumor tissue is collected and analyzed for tumor gene expression by DNA microarray analysis for research studies. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
