	<brief_title>Collecting and Storing Samples of Blood From Patients With Pancreatic Cancer and Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Establish a central pancreatic cancer specimen (including serum and peripheral blood lymphocytes) repository to serve as a resource for current or future scientific studies. - Utilize the clinical database to perform clinicopathologic correlation with the results of those studies. - Test new hypotheses as they emerge. OUTLINE: This is a prospective study. Blood is collected from patients with pancreatic cancer at baseline and then every 3-6 months for up to 2 years. All other participants have blood collected at baseline and complete questionnaires at baseline and then every 3-6 months for up to 2 years. Serum and peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from the blood samples are frozen and stored. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients and 200 other participants will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
