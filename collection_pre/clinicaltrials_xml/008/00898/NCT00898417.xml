	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood in the laboratory from patients undergoing treatment for non-small cell lung cancer may help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment. PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at proteomic patterns in stored blood samples from patients undergoing treatment for non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarker Study of Blood Samples From Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treated With Carboplatin and Paclitaxel With or Without Bevacizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To develop a serum proteomic classifier using matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis of blood samples from patients with non-squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer to predict benefit, in terms of survival and time to progression, from treatment with bevacizumab in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel. Secondary - To better quantitate candidate biomarkers by using more advanced mass spectrometric technologies, including multiple-reaction monitoring and heavy-labeled peptides. OUTLINE: Previously collected pre-treatment samples of serum or plasma are randomly selected from patients enrolled on protocol ECOG-4599 (i.e., 60 from the bevacizumab arm and 30 from the control arm). Samples are analyzed by matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry to identify patterns from protein spectra that correlate with patient survival.</detailed_description>
