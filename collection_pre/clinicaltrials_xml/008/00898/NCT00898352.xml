	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy or Surgery in Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Vulva Cancer With Positive Groin Lymph Nodes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy of pelvic node resection vs. bilateral groin and pelvic node irradiation for invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva in patients having positive groin nodes. OUTLINE: Randomized study. Arm I: Surgery. Deep pelvic node dissection on sides containing positive nodes only. Arm II: Radiotherapy. Megavoltage (1 MeV or greater) to bilateral groin and pelvic nodes. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Anticipated annual accrual is approximately 200 patients, with an active phase estimated at 2.5-3 years. Protocol closed July 1984.</detailed_description>
