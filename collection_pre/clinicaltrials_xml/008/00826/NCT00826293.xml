	<brief_title>The Clinical Efficacy of Belting Stabilization for Shoulder Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stabilization through belts is commonly used as an adjunct for treatment of musculoskeletal problems. Although this treatment is popular among clinicians, there is a paucity of evidence on its use for shoulder pathology. The objective of this double-blinded longitudinal randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to determine the clinical efficacy of stabilization belting applied to patients receiving rehabilitation treatment for shoulder impingement syndrome. The study population will include patients who have been referred to the physiotherapy department of the Holland Orthopaedic &amp; Arthritic Centre for conservative treatment. Patients will be randomized into the treatment and control groups. The primary outcome measure is the Quick Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH) questionnaire.</detailed_description>
