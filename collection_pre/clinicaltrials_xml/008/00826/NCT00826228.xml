	<brief_summary>Individuals with spinal cord injury sustain significant loss of bone mass in their lower extremities (20-40% or more). This study evaluates the ability of PTH and weight-bearing, two interventions that build bone, to increase bone mass in this population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) and Weight-Bearing on Bone in Spinal Cord Injury (SCI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot project aims to evaluate PTH with weight-bearing in a group of individuals with chronic SCI and loss of bone mass in their lower extremities. A convenience sample of 12 people with SCI will be enrolled into a 6 month study assessing the effects of a weight-bearing regime plus daily PTH (Forteo 20ug sc) on BMD and bone markers. Subjects will be evaluated at 3 and 6 months after initiating treatment with measurement of bone density as well as bone markers of formation and resorption. An optional extension to 12 months will be offered to all subjects.</detailed_description>
