	<brief_summary>Observe whether the administration of caffeine prior to regadenoson will affect the interpretation of test results in subjects with coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing SPECT MPI</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Caffeine's Effect on Regadenoson Administration With Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All subjects will undergo rest and stress scans. Those subjects who qualify by demonstrating at least 1 reversible defect, will undergo a third scan. All stress scans will involve the injection of regadenoson as the pharmacologic stress agent. Prior to the third scan, the subject will be administered blinded capsules of placebo or caffeine.</detailed_description>
