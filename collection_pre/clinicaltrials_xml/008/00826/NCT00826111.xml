	<brief_summary>The study examined the effects of adding the sleep aid eszopiclone to Lexapro on mood and levels of the neurotransmitters glutamate, glutamine, and GABA in women with depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Specifically, the objective was to determine the role of glutamate, glutamine, and GABA in mediating the response the to the combined treatment. The hypothesis was that levels of glutamine and glutamate will be increased in women receiving eszopiclone compared to those receiving placebo. The antidepressant effect of the medication combination and its effect on sleep status was also assessed.</brief_summary>
