	<brief_summary>Acute lung injury is a common complication of cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, and it is significantly related to prolonged postoperative recovery, hospital stays and medical cost. Currently available predictors of acute lung injury after cardiac surgery are still limited within clinical data. Several genetic polymorphism of inflammatory mediators have been reported to be associated with severity of sepsis and ARDS, but the association of these inflammatory polymorphism and acute lung injury after cardiac surgery has never been reported. This study is performed to investigate the association of genetic polymorphisms including TNF -308A/G, IL-10 -1082A/G and IL-6 -572C/G and postoperative lung injury.</brief_summary>
