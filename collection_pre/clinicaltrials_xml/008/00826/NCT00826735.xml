	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of guided imagery on the third stage of labor. Blood loss from hemorrhage during childbirth, most commonly due to uterine atony, is one of the leading causes of maternal mortality in the United States and the leading cause of maternal death worldwide. The hypothesis was that the use of physiologic guided imagery would reduce the amount of bleeding during the third stage of labor.</brief_summary>
