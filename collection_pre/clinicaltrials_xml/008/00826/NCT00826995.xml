	<brief_title>Comparison of Video-Based Versus Written Patient Education on Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We plan to conduct a randomized, controlled trial comparing the effect of video-based patient education with written instruction on subjects' understanding of melanoma. Subjects randomized to the video-based education arm will be instructed to watch a video on the definition of melanoma, risk factors associated with the development of melanoma, and signs that should prompt an evaluation for melanoma. Subjects randomized to the written education arm will receive written information on the definition of melanoma, risk factors associated with the development of melanoma, and signs that should prompt an evaluation for melanoma. The contents of the video and the written educational materials will be comparable. At the end of the study period 1 month later, subjects will be interviewed via telephone regarding their understanding of melanoma. Subjects will also be interviewed regarding their comprehension and attitude towards video-based and written education materials.</detailed_description>
