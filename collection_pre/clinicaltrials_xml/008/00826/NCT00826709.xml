	<brief_title>Prospective Evaluation of the Fluid Rapid Influenza Test</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the fluID Rapid Influenza Test in detecting influenza A and influenza B, as evaluated with respect to fresh samples collected prospectively from individuals presenting with signs and symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI). Test results will be compared with those obtained from viral culture testing of samples using the same specimen types, obtained from the same subjects. The specimen types under evaluation in this study will be nasal swab, nasopharyngeal swab, nasal wash and aspirate specimens. A secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of the fluID Rapid Influenza Test in detecting each of the H1 and H3 subtypes of influenza A, in nasal swab, nasopharyngeal swab, nasal wash and aspirate specimens.</detailed_description>
