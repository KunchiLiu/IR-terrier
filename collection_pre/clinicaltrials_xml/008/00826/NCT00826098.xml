	<brief_summary>The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the effect of platelet rich plasma (PRP), a derivative of a patient's whole blood, on short-term patient outcomes following total knee replacement (TKR). The hypothesis is that change in short-term hemoglobin (Hgb) levels is less dramatic in patients who undergo TKR with the addition of PRP when compared to patients who undergo TKR without PRP.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Patient is a male or female who is undergoing primary unilateral surgery or the first surgery of a staged bilateral total knee replacement where the second stage will be at least 6 weeks later PRP in Total Knee. 2. Patient agrees to be blinded to their treatment group assignment. 3. Patient is willing and able to return for followup over at least a six (6) week postoperative period although longer followup is desired 4. Patient agrees to participate by signing an IRB approved Informed Consent Form 1. Patient will have a staged bilateral total knee replacement with the second stage to be performed less than 6 weeks after the first stage surgery 2. Patient has had previous surgery on the operative knee that will necessitate the removal of existing hardware (e.g. previous osteotomy) 3. Patient has a known adverse reaction or sensitivity to bovine (cow) thrombin (used as part of the platelet rich plasma system) or other bovinederived products 4. Patient has hemoglobin &lt; 12.0 (males), &lt; 11.0 (females) 5. Patient clinically significant anxiety disorder 6. Patient is on therapeutic anticoagulation medication and has an INR &gt; 1.3 7. Patient has a severe bleeding disorder 8. Patient has a known addiction to drugs or alcohol, including, but not limited to: chronic daily use of narcotic medications for more than 90 days prior to surgery 9. Patient is pregnant 10. Patient is a prisoner 11. Patient is involved in a personal litigation (e.g. Worker's Compensation) that relates to their knee surgery 12. Patient is actively participating in an investigational medical device, drug, or biologic clinical trial (active defined as having treatment within the last 30 days)</criteria>
