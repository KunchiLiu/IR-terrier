Presence of other tumours different from basal cell carcinoma of the skin, with disease free survival less then 3 years. Pregnancy or breastfeeding. In women of childbearing potential and in men, an adequate contraceptive method must be used Social or psychological condition that render the patient inadequate for the followup of the study Contraindication for any of the study drugs (e.g. history of hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of the study drugs) The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
