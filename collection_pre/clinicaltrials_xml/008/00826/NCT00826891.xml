	<brief_summary>This is a single arm, open-label study in women from China who have Advanced (stage IVB) Recurrent or Persistent cervical cancer to ⑴assess the response rate (i.e., CR + PR) of Cisplatin combined with Topotecan in treatment of advanced (stage IVB) recurrent or persistent Cervical cancer; ⑵assess the toxicities of CT regimen in treatment of cervical cancer. Prior to treatment, written informed consent should be obtained from all patients. Eligible patients will be assigned to CT regimen. The CT regimen is topotecan 0.75 mg/m2 IV during 30minutes days 1, 2, and 3; followed by cisplatin 50 mg/m2 IV on day1, repeated every 21 days. The study will consist of two phases: the safety run-in phase and study phase.</brief_summary>

Patients must have adequate organ function. Patients without history of sensitivity to camptothecin or platinum. Patients who are nonchildbearing potential, or consistent and correct use of methods of birth control from 2 weeks prior to administration of the first dose of study medication until 28 days after the final dose of observational medication. performance status 0 to 2; to have recovered from the effects of recent surgery, chemoradiotherapy, or radiotherapy; and to be free of clinically significant infection. Written informed consent Patients with uncontrolled infections. Patients with concurrent severe medical problems unrelated to the malignancy which would expose the patient to extreme risk. Patients who received another investigational drug within 30 days prior to study entry. Patients who are receiving concurrent other chemotherapy, hormonal, immunotherapy or radiotherapy. Radiotherapy for palliation of related bone metastases is permitted. Patients with a history of allergic reactions to compounds chemically related to topotecan or platinum.
