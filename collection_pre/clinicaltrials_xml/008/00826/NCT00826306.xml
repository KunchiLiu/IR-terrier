	<brief_title>Comparison Of Video-based Versus Written Patient Education on Sunscreen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We plan to conduct a randomized, controlled trial comparing the effect of video-based patient education with written instruction on subjects' adherence to sunscreen application. Subjects randomized to the video-based education arm will be instructed to watch a video on the importance of sunscreen application and the proper technique of applying sunscreen. Subjects randomized to the written education arm will receive written information on the importance of sunscreen application and the proper technique of applying sunscreen. The contents of the video and the written educational materials will be comparable. At the end of the study period, 3 months later, subjects will be interviewed via telephone regarding their sunscreen application behavior during the last month of the study period. Subjects will also be interviewed regarding their comprehension and attitude towards video-based and written education materials.</detailed_description>
