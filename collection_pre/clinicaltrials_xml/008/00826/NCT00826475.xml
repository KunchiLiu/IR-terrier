	<brief_summary>Patients suffering from migraine will be randomly allocated to one of two different behavioral interventions: - mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) an eight week intervention program based different meditation &amp; yoga techniques and teaching information regarding the relationship between stress and health. - into an active control group teaching three times within eight weeks relaxation techniques (progressive muscle relaxation PMR) and giving psychoeducation on migraine. The investigators will measure the frequency and intensity of migraine attacks before during and after the intervention as well as secondary variables on quality of life and psychological functioning. The hypothesis is that patients allocated to the MBSR intervention will reduce the frequency of their migraine attacks compared to the active control group and compared to their own baseline.</brief_summary>
