	<brief_title>Orally Fludarabine, Adriamycin and Dexamethasone (FAD) in Newly Diagnosed Peripheral T-cell Lymphomas (PTCL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Doxorubicin is often used to treat Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL). However, patients with PTCL have an especially poor outcome with a 5-year overall survival rate of only 26% following treatment with standard doxorubicin containing regimens. There is general agreement that results with conventional chemotherapy are so poor in patients with most PTCL that new approaches are warranted.The nucleoside analogs are Fludarabine being combined with other agents in PTCL (excluding ALK positive ALCL and primary cutaneous ALCL) is reported by others.We conduct a II stage clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of Orally Fludarabine, Adriamycin and Dexamethasone (FAD) as first line therapy in patients with in Newly Diagnosed PTCL.</detailed_description>
