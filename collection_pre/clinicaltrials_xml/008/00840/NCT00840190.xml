	<brief_summary>This is a phase I open label study to evaluate safety and efficacy of P1446A-05 in subjects with advanced refractory malignancies. Subjects of solid tumors or hematologic malignancies will be included. This is a dose escalation study following an accelerated titration design. It is expected that around 50 subjects would be enrolled in the study.Safety assessment will be conducted on the basis of vital signs, physical examination and laboratory investigations undertaken at regular intervals as per the schedule.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Of Selective Cyclin Dependent Kinase Inhibitor P1446A-05 In Subjects With Advanced Refractory Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase I open label study to evaluate safety and efficacy of P1446A-05 in subjects with advanced refractory malignancies. Subjects of solid tumors or hematologic malignancies will be included as per selection criteria. Starting dose for P1446A-05 in this study is 75 mg orally once daily for 14 days followed by 7 days rest. This constitutes one cycle for P1446A-05.Three patients will be enrolled in first cohort at this starting dose of P1446A-05. If this dose is well tolerated then dose escalation will be undertaken for subsequent cohorts as per accelerated titration design as described in protocol till maximum tolerated dose(MTD) for P1446A-05 is determined. The MTD will be the recommended phase 2 dose. 10 additional patients might be enrolled at this MTD to further evaluate safety and efficacy. It is expected that around 50 subjects would be enrolled in the study.Safety assessment will be conducted on the basis of vital signs, physical examination and laboratory investigations undertaken at regular intervals as per the schedule.</detailed_description>

Subjects who have received autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplant within 6 months of day 1 of study drug administration 3. Subjects with known brain metastases at the time of screening 4. Subjects who had received any other investigational drug within 1 month or within five halflives of the other investigational agent, whichever is longer prior to day 1 of study drug administration or who have not completely recovered from adverse effects of the investigational agent received prior to this period. 5. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical structure to P1446A05. 6. Subjects on immunosuppressive therapy. 7. History of unstable angina or myocardial infarction or stroke within previous 6 months. 8. Subjects with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. 9. Subjects known to be suffering from infection with HIV, Tuberculosis, Hepatitis C or Hepatitis B. 10. History of any other prior malignancy except for curatively treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of skin, in situ cervical cancer, in situ breast cancer, in situ prostate cancer or any other cancer for which the subject has been diseasefree for at least 3 years. 11. Women who are pregnant or lactating. 12. Women of childbearing potential [defined as a sexually mature woman who has not undergone hysterectomy or who has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e. who has had menses any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months)] and men, not agreeing to use adequate contraception (e.g., hormonal or barrier method of birth control or abstinence) prior to study entry (after signing the informed consent document), during the duration of study participation and for at least 4 weeks after withdrawal from the study, unless they are surgically sterilised. 13. Any condition, including laboratory abnormalities, that in the opinion of the investigator places the subject at an unacceptable risk or deems the subject not suitable for participation in the study.</criteria>
