	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Sex: Males or females who are surgically sterile or have been postmenopausal for at least 6 months; similar proportions of each preferred. Age: At least 18 years. Qualifying subjects must be in good health and physical condition as determined by medical history, complete physical examination, and laboratory tests, all obtained within four (4) weeks prior to study start. The subjects may not have a history of significant past illness expected to affect the investigation. The normal status of subjects will be confirmed by the following procedures: 1. Laboratory Tests: Hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC, WBC, differential count, serum electrolytes (Nz, K, Cl), fasting blood glucose, BUN, bilirubin,m creatinine, AST, ALT, LD, alkaline phosphatase and urinalysis. HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and drugs of abuse testing will be done for screening purposes only. Urine drugs of abuse testing will be repeated at each checkin. Female subjects will have a serum pregnancy test done at screening and a urine pregnancy test prior to each study period at checkin. Postmenopausal females will have an FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) level performed to confirm postmenopausal status. Laboratory values which are greater than Â±20% of the normal range will not qualify unless specifically accepted (with comment) by the Principal Investigator. Results of HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and drugs of abuse must be negative or nonreactive for the subject to qualify for the study. 2. Electrocardiogram A 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be obtained for all subjects. The original tracings, plus interpretation, will be included in the case report form packet. Subjects must read and sign the Consent Form. Exclusion Criteria Subjects not complying with the above inclusion criteria must be excluded from the study. In addition, any one of the conditions listed below will exclude a subject from the study: 1. History of treatment for alcoholism, substance abuse, or drug abuse within past 24 months. 2. History of malignancy, stroke, diabetes, cardiac, renal or liver disease, or other serious illness. 3. History of treatment for any gastrointestinal disorder within the past 5 years. 4. History of treatment for asthma within the past five (5) years. 5. History of diarrhea within 24 hours prior to dosing. 6. Females who are pregnant or lactating. 7. History of hypersensitivity to clarithromycin or any macrolide antibiotic. Conditions upon screening which might contraindicate or require that caution be used in the administration of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride, including: 1. Sitting systolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg, or diastolic pressure below 50 mm Hg. 2. Heart rate less than 50 beats per minute after a 5minute rest in a seated position. Inability to read and/or sign the consent form. Treatment with any other investigational drug during the four (4) weeks prior to the initial dosing for this study. Subjects who have donated blood within four (4) weeks prior to the initial dosing for this study. Subjects who smoke or use tobacco products or are currently using nicotine products (patches, gums, etc.). Three (3) consecutive months abstinence is required.</criteria>
