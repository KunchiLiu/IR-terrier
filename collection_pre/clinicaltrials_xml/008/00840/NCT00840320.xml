	<brief_title>Repeat Dose Safety Study for Compound to Treat Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Compound 1278863A is a novel small molecule agent, which stimulates erythropoiesis through inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-prolyl hydroxylases (EGLNs). This compound is being developed for the treatment of anemia. Compound 111427 was the first administration of compound 1278863A to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of single oral doses up to 300 mg in healthy adult subjects. This study, PHI112842, will be the first administration of compound 1278863A to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of repeat oral doses up to 300 mg for 14 days in healthy adult subjects. At least 6 subjects will complete each cohort. Multiple blood samples for pharmacokinetic analyses will be obtained post-dose in each cohort. Safety will be assessed by measurement of vital signs, cardiac monitoring, collection of adverse event assessments and laboratory safety tests. Blood samples will be collected for pharmacodynamic analyses.</detailed_description>
