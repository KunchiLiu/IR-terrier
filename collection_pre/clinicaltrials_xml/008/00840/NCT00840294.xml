	<brief_title>Randomized Trial of Ciprofloxacin Versus Observation for Men With Elevated Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Objectives: Primary Objective: To assess the impact of ciprofloxacin on the change in PSA from baseline/randomization to prostate biopsy Secondary Objective: To assess the impact of ciprofloxacin on the overall infectious complications following prostate biopsy The impact of observation versus ciprofloxacin on PSA levels will be assessed by PSA change from baseline. The first PSA measurement will be at the study entry and randomization. The second PSA measurement will be immediately prior to prostate biopsy, which will occur 21-45 days following randomization.</detailed_description>
