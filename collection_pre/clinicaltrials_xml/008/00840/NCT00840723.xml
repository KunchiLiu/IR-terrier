	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to collect cells and liquid from the air passages of healthy adults, both smokers and non-smokers. These samples will be used for test-tube studies to explore mechanisms of diseases of the respiratory tract, and to compare the samples between people who smoke cigarettes and people who don't. Obtaining these samples requires an invasive procedure called "bronchoscopy".</brief_summary>
