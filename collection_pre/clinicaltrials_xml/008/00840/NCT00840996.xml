	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is determine if epidural anesthesia administered after surgery or lidocaine administered during surgery will decrease inflammation after spinal surgery and decrease the need for post operative pain medication compared to intravenous patient controlled analgesia. Participants undergoing spine surgery will be randomized into one of two groups; - A.) General Anesthesia and postoperative Patient Controlled Analgesia and placebo IV infusion. B.) General Anesthesia plus perioperative intravenous lidocaine infusion, and post operative Patient Controlled Analgesia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>According to a survey of 1570 U.S neurosurgeons, in the United States about 527.000 spine surgeries were done in 1999. This represents close to 65% of the procedures performed by neurosurgeons. Furthermore, the number of hospitalizations related with spine surgery has significantly increased since 1970. IV PCA is considered the standard of care for postoperative pain control after surgery. Intravenous opioids have significant side effects such as respiratory depression, postoperative nausea and vomiting and sedation. Furthermore, they cause delayed return of bowel function and ileus. There is the possibility of surgically inserting a catheter into the epidural space at the end of surgery. In general epidural analgesia provides excellent pain relief after surgery and decreases opioid consumption significantly und thus opioid related postoperative complications. Furthermore epidural anesthesia affects the surgical stress response and might decrease inflammatory responses after surgery, thereby improving postoperative recovery and mobilization of the patients. Intravenous local anesthetics have potent anti-inflammatory properties. They also decrease postoperative opioid consumption. Clinical studies have shown that perioperative local anesthetic administration significantly reduces the incidence of thrombosis and postoperative pain, shortens postoperative ileus and decreases duration of hospitalization.</detailed_description>
