	<brief_title>Phenotyping Diabetic Retinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to validate and characterize phenotypes of diabetic retinopathy (DR) progression using ophthalmic and systemic data from type-2 diabetic subjects followed at the AIBILI Clinical Trial Center in the last 10 years. Macular Edema (ME) development during the study period, mainly Clinically Significant ME (CSME) needing treatment, will be the primary indicator for DR progression. CSME will be considered as the primary end-point and will be used to identify phenotypes (and risk markers) of DR progression.</detailed_description>
