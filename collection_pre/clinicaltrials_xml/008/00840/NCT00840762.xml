	<brief_summary>The investigators seek to determine whether Virco®TYPE HIV-1 provides benefits equivalent to those provided by local expert review. The investigators propose that clinic patients of the Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center who are having genotypic testing performed will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to local expert review and to Virco®TYPE HIV-1. Results of either method will be shared with primary HIV care providers. Patient outcomes will be reviewed at a time point equal to or greater than 2 months and 6 months following the change in antiretroviral medications following the testing</brief_summary>
