	<brief_title>Brief Behavioral Treatment of Insomnia in Military Veterans: Phase 2 (BBTIMVII)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Insomnia is one of the most common reasons for referral to mental health services in active duty personnel. Chronic insomnia often persists post-deployment, contributes to poor mental and physical health outcomes, and requires targeted interventions. Effective behavioral treatments of insomnia have not been adapted and tested for the treatment of chronic insomnia comorbid to combat-related mental disorders and stress reactions. In addition, effective behavioral insomnia treatments are typically delivered over an 8-week period. This format may not be easily exportable to primary and community care settings where military returnees and veterans seek help. The goal is to adapt and test the effects of a 4-week behavioral treatment that targets chronic insomnia (lasting &gt;1 month) in service members returning from Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), and who present with the typical psychiatric comorbidities associated of combat-related anxiety and mood disorders and stress reactions. We call this intervention the Brief Behavioral Treatment of Insomnia for Military Veterans (BBTI-MV). The proposed study includes two phases. The specific aims of Phase II are: (1) To explore the effects of BBTI-MV on sleep and daytime symptoms of psychiatric distress. We anticipate that participants randomized to BBTI-MV will show a higher categorical response rate and remission for sleep symptoms than subjects randomized to IC. (2) To evaluate in a preliminary manner the durability of therapeutic gains and by conducting a naturalistic follow-up assessment six months post-treatment in responders. (3) To explore whether the nature of combat-related experiences, time since deployment and since, return to the US, deployment theater, medication use and change in dosage, mood and anxiety or disorders affect sleep treatment adherence and outcomes.</detailed_description>
