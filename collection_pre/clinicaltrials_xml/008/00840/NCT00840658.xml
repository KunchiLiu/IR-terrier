	<brief_summary>The investigators propose a highly efficient four-arm (factorial) trial to simultaneously test the efficacy of two behavioral interventions aimed at: - increasing condom use in the context of ongoing drug use and - decreasing needle and paraphernalia sharing among female sex workers who also inject drugs in two Mexican-U.S. border cities: Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Behavioral Intervention to Reduce Sexual and Injection Risks Among Female Sex Workers Who Also Inject Drugs in Mexico</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our specific aims are: - Aim 1: To evaluate the efficacy of a behavioral intervention to decrease sharing of syringes and injection paraphernalia among FSW-IDUs. We hypothesize that FSW-IDUs in the active experimental injection risk reduction condition will report: (a) less receptive and distributive needle sharing; (b) less sharing of injection paraphernalia; (c) obtaining syringes and injection paraphernalia from safer sources. - Aim 2: To evaluate the efficacy of a behavioral intervention to increase condom use among FSW-IDUs in the context of ongoing drug use. We hypothesize that FSW-IDUs in the active experimental sexual risk reduction condition will: (a) report less unprotected vaginal and anal sex; and (b) have fewer incident cases of specific STIs. - Aim 3: To evaluate the joint effects of these two behavioral interventions to increase condom use and reduce sharing of needles and syringes/injection paraphernalia among FSW-IDUs. We hypothesize that the joint effect of these interventions will generate greater risk reductions compared to either intervention alone. - Aim 4: To determine the extent to which theoretically-important components of our interventions (i.e., self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, attitudes, intentions) represent underlying mechanisms of change in primary outcomes (i.e., sexual- and injection-related risk reductions). - Aim 5: To explore subgroup differences in the efficacy of: a) the sexual risk reduction, and b) the injection risk reduction intervention based on background characteristics, contextual factors, social factors and intrapersonal factors.</detailed_description>
