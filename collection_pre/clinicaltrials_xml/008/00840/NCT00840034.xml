	<brief_summary>The primary purpose is to study the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of LY2216684 as an adjunctive treatment for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), who were identified as partial responders to an adequate course of treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (as defined by history).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Adjunctive Treatment to Antidepressant Therapy for Adults With Major Depressive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 12 week multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study on the efficacy of LY2216684 augmentation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in patients with MDD who have a partial response to treatment with an SSRI. While remaining on a steady dose of their SSRI treatment at entry into the study, patients will be randomly assigned to adjunctive treatment with LY2216684 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio for 10 weeks of acute treatment.</detailed_description>
