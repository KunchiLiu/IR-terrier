	<brief_summary>This study evaluates how ectopic fat (in the pancreas, heart, liver and skeletal muscle), visceral fat, and subcutaneous fat changes following surgically induced weight loss using gastric banding. The investigators also evaluate whether changes in pancreatic fat content correlate with improvement in beta-cell function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Changes in Ectopic Fat Following Surgically Induced Weight Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We are looking for volunteers for this study,wich involves 7 visits over a period of 13 months, the first visit taking place about 2 weeks prior to the planned surgery. Visit 1 - baseline, before starting your pre-operative diet Visit 2 - just before the surgery Visit 3 - around the time your first band inflation occurs Visit 4 - 1 month after the band inflation Visit 5 - 3 months after the first band inflation Visit 6 - 6 months after the first band inflation Visit 7 - 12 months after the first band inflation At each visit we do the following tests: 1. MRI to measure your fat in the liver, pancreas, heart, muscle (leg), subcutaneous fat and visceral fat. 2. Frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test - it is a 3.5 hrs test which determines the amount of insulin your body produces and how well your own insulin is being used by the body 3. Body measurements (waist, hip circumference), cholesterol panel, liver function tests, HbA1c (to monitor diabetes control), blood pressure, weight. We also do an oral glucose tolerance test to check for diabetes on 3 occasions: visit 1, visit 5 and at the end, visit 7.</detailed_description>
