Body mass Index (BMI = weight/height²) greater than or equal to 18.5 kg/m² and less than or equal to 29.9 kg/m². Availability of subject for the entire study period and willingness to adhere to protocol requirements, as evidenced by a signed Informed Consent Form. Normal findings in the physical examination, 12lead ECG and vital signs (blood pressure between 100140/6090 mmHg, heart rate between 5099 beats/min, temperature between 35.8ºC and 37.5ºC). Negative for drugs of abuse, nicotine, alcohol, hepatitis Bsurface antigen, hepatitis C and HIV, and for female subjects, pregnancy (serum ßCG). No clinical laboratory values outside of the acceptable range as defined by BCR, unless the Principal Investigator decides they are not clinically significant.

Known history of hypersensitivity to meloxicam (for example Mobic®), or related drugs such as any other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) such as acetylsalicyclic acid (e.g. Excedrin®, Aspirin®), ibuprofen (e.g. Motrin®), celecoxib (e.g. Celebrex®), Feldene®, Indocin®, Naprosyn®, Vioxx®, Toradol®, Clinoril®, Tolectin®, or Lodine®. Known history or presence of cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, endocrine, musculoskeletal, neurological, hematological, or liver disease, unless judged not clinically significant by the Principal Investigator, or medical designate. Any history or presence of peptic ulcer disease, gastrointestinal bleeding, or kidney disease. Known history or presence of food allergies, or any condition known to interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs. Any clinically significant illness during the last four weeks prior to entry into this study. Presence of any significant physical or organ abnormality. Any subject with history of drug abuse. Any psychiatric or psychological disease (including depression) unless deemed not clinically significant by the Principal Investigator, or medical designate. Use of any prescription medication within 14 days preceding entry into this study. Use of overthecounter (OTC) medication within seven days preceding entry into this study (except for spermicidal/barrier contraceptive products). Female subjects: use of oral contraceptives or contraceptive implants (such as Norplant®) within 30 days prior to drug administration or a depot injection of progestogen drug (e.g. DepoProvera®) within one year prior to drug administration. Female subjects: presence of pregnancy or lactation. Female subjects at risk of becoming pregnant must consent to using two medically acceptable methods of contraception throughout the entire study, including the washout period and for one month after the completion of the study. Medically acceptable barrier methods of contraception that may be used by the subject and/or partner include diaphragm with spermicide, IUD, condom with foam, and vaginal spermicidal suppository. Complete abstinence can be used alone as a method of contraception. Any subject who has had blood drawn within 56 days preceding this study, taken during the conduct of any clinical study at a facility other than BCR or within the lockout period specified by a previous study conducted at BCR. Participation in a clinical trial with an investigational drug within 30 days preceding this study. Any subject who has donated blood within 56 days preceding this study. Any subject who has participated as a plasma donor in a plasmapheresis program within seven days preceding this study. Any subject with a recent (less than one year) history of alcohol abuse.
