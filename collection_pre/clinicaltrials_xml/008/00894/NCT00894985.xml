	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to verify, through a randomized, open, multicentre, parallel and comparative study, the effectiveness of heparin sodium of porcine origin in patients undergoing heart surgery at that require the aid of cardiopulmonary bypass, through the control of hemostasis during and after surgery, based on the strengths of markers of coagulation TCA, TTPA, Anti-Xa, heparin bioavailable and loss of excessive blood (bleeding) at the end of the surgery.</brief_summary>
