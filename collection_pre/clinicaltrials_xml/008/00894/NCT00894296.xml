	<brief_summary>The objective of the suggested study is to identify changes in MEG correlates caused by the add-on treatment with the changes in negative symptoms of schizophrenia by comparing the change in the MEG correlates of the subjects before and during usage of new add on treatments for negative symptoms. The investigators hypothesize that the gravity of negative symptoms will correlate with a trend towards more aberrant electroencephalographic correlates mainly in continuous parameters, with an emphasis on alpha and delta bands</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) Correlates of Negative Symptoms in Patients Suffering From Schizophrenia and Their Influence by Add-on Treatments</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a paucity of information regarding electrophysiological correlates of negative symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia. The proposed study is set out to compare the MEG correlates of negative symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia to those of healthy controls in terms of both relevant ERP components and quantified (continuous) MEG. The presented study will include two parts: Part A will explore the electrophisological correlates of negative symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia using MEG. The study will do so by comparing the electrophisological correlates of schizophrenia patients suffering from negative symptoms and stable on psychiatric treatment to those of healthy controls. In the second part of the study data from part A of patients that have started new add-on treatments for negative symptoms will be compared to parallel data acquired after stabilization on the new treatment.</detailed_description>
