	<brief_summary>This study evaluated the effect of early initiation of aliskiren therapy, compared to standard therapy, in the reduction of cardiovascular death and heart failure re-hospitalization events within 6 months, in congestive heart failure (CHF) patients hospitalized for an episode of acute decompensated heart failure.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Patient hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of worsening heart failure ≥ 18 years of age, male or female. Patients with a diagnosis of acute heart failure expressed by symptoms (dyspnea or fatigability NYHA Class IIIIV) and signs of fluid overload (i.e., jugular venous distension, edema or positive rales auscultation or pulmonary congestion on chest xray) at the time of hospitalization. LVEF &lt; 40% (measured within the last 6 months). Hospitalization for ADHF and remain "stabilized" for at least 6 hours (defined as SBP ≥ 110 mm Hg after acute decompensated episode) and did not receive IV vasodilators (other than nitrates) and/or IV inotropic drugs at anytime from ADHF presentation to time of randomization. Elevated BNP at Visit 1 or at randomization (BNP ≥ 400 pg/ml). Patients with a history of chronic heart failure on standard therapy defined as requiring HF treatment for at least 30 days before the current hospitalization (NYHA Class II IV). Patients that required any use of IV vasodilators (except nitrates), and/or any IV inotropic therapy from the time of presentation for worsening HF to randomization. Concomitant use of ACEI and ARB at randomization. Right heart failure due to pulmonary disease. Diagnosis of postpartum cardiomyopathy. Myocardial infarction or cardiac surgery, including percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), within past 3 months. Patients with a history of heart transplant or who are on a transplant list. Unstable angina or coronary artery disease likely to require coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or PTCA before randomization. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria applied.</criteria>
