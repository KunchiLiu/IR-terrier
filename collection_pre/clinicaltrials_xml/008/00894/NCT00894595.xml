	<brief_summary>Football-related knee injuries are common and especially the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury constitute a serious problem in football regardless of the playing level. The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effect of a training program designed to prevent acute knee injury in female adolescent football players. The investigators' hypotheses are: 1. a preventive training program reduces the incidence of ACL injury, and 2. a high match frequency and match play at senior level increase the risk of ACL injury.</brief_summary>
