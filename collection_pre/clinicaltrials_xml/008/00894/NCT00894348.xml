	<brief_title>Factors Predicting Positive Yields on Biliary Brush Cytology During Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are only 3 studies available that have tried to evaluate factors influencing the yield of brush cytology. Two of the 3 studied one parameter. The third study, which is also the largest, reported on 199 samples which the authors evaluated in a retrospect fashion. We plan to conduct a larger study assessing several other factors that have not been studied before. The study findings would help develop strategies to improve sensitivity of brush cytology specimens. This would ultimately result in more effective use of health care resources and improve patient outcomes.</detailed_description>
