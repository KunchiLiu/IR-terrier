	<brief_title>Safety and Effectiveness Study of Actinic Keratosis Treatment Following Cryosurgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the efficacy and safety of imiquimod 3.75% cream following cryosurgery to treat clinically typical visible or palpable AK lesions on the face was compared with that of placebo cream. Based on a 1:1 randomization, approximately 120 subjects applied imiquimod 3.75% cream daily (up to 500 mg cream daily [18.75 mg imiquimod]) and approximately 120 subjects applied placebo cream daily during two 2-week periods (Cycle 1 and Cycle 2) separated by 2 weeks of no treatment. Subjects visited the clinic 9 times—1 screening/cryosurgery visit (additional visits might be needed during the screening period to assess healing from the cryosurgery), 4 treatment visits(treatment initiation at Weeks 0 and 4 and treatment follow-up at the end of Weeks 2 and 6), and 4 posttreatment visits (4, 8, 14, and 20 weeks after the last administration of study treatment at the end of Week 6). The total study duration for a subject, including a 2-week screening period, was up to 28 weeks. Prior to cryosurgery, subjects had to have ≥10 clinically typical visible or palpable AK lesions in an area that exceeded 25 cm^2 on the face to be eligible for participation in the study. At screening, a minimum of 5 visible lesions were not treated with cryosurgery, and 5 to 14 visible lesions were treated with cryosurgery. Subjects had to have at least 5 AK lesions after the skin healed sufficiently from the cryosurgery to be eligible for randomization to either imiquimod 3.75% or placebo cream. Subjects applied up to 2 packets of study cream (500 mg total) as a thin layer to the entire face, avoiding the periocular areas, lips, and nares; ears were excluded from both assessment and treatment. Study cream was applied prior to normal sleeping hours and removed approximately 8 hours later with mild soap and water. Rest periods from daily treatment could be approved by the investigator as needed, with treatment resumption at the investigator's discretion.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>In good general health Negative urine pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential) and agree to use an approved method of birth control while enrolled in the study. Prior to cryosurgery, have ≥ 10 clinically typical (visible or palpable) AKs in an area that exceeds 25 cm2 on the face. Must have had cryosurgery on 5 to 14 AKs on the face after giving informed consent and prior to receiving study medication. Lesions previously treated with cryosurgery must be healed sufficiently prior to randomization to study cream. Following cryosurgery, have ≥ 5 clinically typical (visible or palpable) AKs in an area that exceeds 25 cm2 on the face that are suitable for treatment with the study cream. Women who are pregnant, lactating, or planning to become pregnant during the study Had a medical event within 90 days of the visit (e.g., stroke, heart attack, etc.). Have any skin condition in the treatment area that may be made worse by treatment with imiquimod (e.g., rosacea, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, eczema). Have received specific treatments/medications in the treatment area within the designated time period prior to study treatment initiation</criteria>
