	<brief_summary>This pilot study is designed to determine the feasibility of conducting a randomized clinical trial comparing fondaparinux sodium (Arixtra) once daily with enoxaparin (LovenoxÂ®) twice daily with respect to preventing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) after bariatric surgery in obese patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Comparing Enoxaparin to Fondaparinux to Prevent Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) in Bariatric Surgical Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order to determine the feasibility of such a trial we need to determine the necessary sample size. In order to determine the necessary sample size, we need to obtain estimates of the incidence of DVT and the prevalence of PE using MRV in each treatment group. Descriptive statistics and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated to determine the incidence of DVT and the prevalence of PE using MRV in obese patients who have received treatment to prevent DVT and PE associated with bariatric surgery. Anti-factor Xa levels will be used to help determine if treatments are reaching appropriate levels.</detailed_description>
