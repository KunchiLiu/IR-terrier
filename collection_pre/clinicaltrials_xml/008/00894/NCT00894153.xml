	<brief_summary>This is multicenter, open-label, randomized, active-controled, phase IV study of local direct intra-tumor injection of rAd-p53 monotherapy, with concurrent chemotherapy , with concurrent radiotherapy, or combination with surgery for treatment of head and neck malignant tumors in advanced stage .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>p53 Gene Therapy for Head and Neck Malignant Tumors in Advanced Stage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objectives of this study is to determine the efficacy profiles of rAd-p53 intra-tumor injection alone, with concurrent chemotherapy, with concurrent radiotherapy, or combination with surgery for treatment of head and neck malignant tumors in advanced stage (stage III or IV) including target lesion complete response rate (LCR) and overall target lesion response rate (OLR), response duration (RD), and progress-free survival (PFS). The secondary objectives of this study is to investigate overall response rate (OPCR) and overall complete response rate (OCR), overall survival (OS), ECOG, and safety of rAd-p53 monotherapy and combined with chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery.</detailed_description>
