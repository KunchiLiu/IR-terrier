	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test whether a medication reduces the number, severity and bothersomeness of menopausal hot flashes. Escitalopram (also called Lexapro®) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). It is sold by prescription for depression and general anxiety disorder. An SSRI increases serotonin, a brain substance that is believed to influence mood. Serotonin may also affect brain levels of estradiol, a hormone related to hot flashes. This research study will test whether escitalopram reduces menopausal hot flashes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The MsFLASH-01 study, Efficacy of a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) for Menopausal Symptoms in Midlife Women is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel arm clinical trial. The design includes: 3 weeks of daily recording of hot flashes prior to drug treatment; 8 weeks of double-blind treatment with escitalopram or placebo with dose escalation at 4 weeks among non-responders; 1 week of drug taper for those on higher dose, followed by 2 weeks with no treatment; and a telephone follow-up post-treatment. This study is one of five clinical trials to be conducted as part of the Menopause Strategies - Finding Lasting Answers for Symptoms and Health (MsFLASH) study, a network of investigators and clinical trials designed to find new ways to alleviate the most common, bothersome symptoms of the menopausal transition.</detailed_description>
