	<brief_summary>Focal cortical dysplasia is one of the most common lesions responsible for medically refractory epilepsy in the pediatric population. In patients with medically intractable epilepsy, surgery is the only treatment that will lead to seizure freedom. The outcome of epilepsy surgery is worse in patients when there is no lesion identified on routine structural MRI, also known as MRI-negative partial epilepsy. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a novel MRI technique, can be used to evaluate the integrity of the microstructure of the white matter, even when the white matter appears normal on routine MRI.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Lesion Detection in Children With Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-Negative Partial Epilepsy Using Diffusion Tensor Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aims of this study are firstly to identify DTI abnormalities in the white matter of children with MRI-negative partial epilepsy and MRI-visible FCD compared to normal controls; and secondly to determine if the location of DTI identified abnormalities correlate with the epileptogenic zone as defined using magnetoencephalography (MEG) dipole clusters. Our hypotheses are firstly DTI can demonstrate the anatomic delineation of white matter abnormalities in MRI-negative partial epilepsy and the alteration in DTI indices are similar in MRI-negative partial epilepsy and MRI-visible FCD, which is the positive control; and secondly the anatomical location of DTI identified abnormalities correlate with the epileptogenic zone as defined by MEG dipole clusters. The long-term goal of this study is to improve detection of subtle lesions in children with MRI-negative partial epilepsy so as to improve the surgical outcome of these patients who undergo epilepsy surgery for seizure control.</detailed_description>
