	<detailed_description>The purpose of the research is to study the level of visual functioning in individuals with various eye conditions when using different types of eyeglass lenses. Therefore, the goal of this study is to determine factors that may account for variability in the visual functioning of individuals with a range of refractive errors and their ability to perform everyday activities when equipped with different types of lenses. We hypothesize that the subjects will perform visual tasks of function better when using iZonâ„¢ Wavefront-Guided Glasses than with conventional glasses. This hypothesis is based upon the glasses yielding better visual acuity and because the design of the glasses reduces the effects of glare. This research is important so that alternate treatments and vision correction may be implemented which will have a more beneficial impact on those with refractive errors and visual impairment.</detailed_description>
