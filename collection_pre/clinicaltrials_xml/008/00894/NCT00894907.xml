	<brief_summary>Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common disorder with rising incidence varying between 35 and 80 per 100,000 in Europe and the USA. About 15% of patients develop necrotizing pancreatitis (NP) with a mortality of up to 42% and frequently prolonged hospitalisation in the survivors. Despite a fulminant pathophysiology comparable to that of sepsis, the management of NP is still re-active, symptomatic and mainly based on paradigms with low grade evidence. In sepsis beneficial effects of early goal-directed fluid resuscitation resulting in reduced mortality have been clearly shown. With regard to these data and several studies of NP demonstrating the deleterious effects of fluid loss and haemoconcentration within the first 24h after admission, early goal-directed fluid resuscitation has the potential of improving outcome also in NP. Therefore, it is the aim of this RCT to demonstrate beneficial effects of early goal-directed resuscitation using an algorithm based on modern haemodynamic parameters such as Intra-thoracic Blood Volume Index (ITBI), Extravascular Lung Water Index (ELWI) and Stroke Volume Variation (SVV) which can be easily and safely obtained due to recent progress in haemodynamic monitoring. The algorithm is aimed at maintaining adequate resuscitation (ITBI, SVV) as well as preventing pulmonary over-hydration (ELWI).The use of a similar algorithm in cardiac surgery patients resulted in a significant reduction in catecholamine use, lactate levels, duration of ventilation and ICU stay.</brief_summary>
