	<brief_summary>Background: - The prevalence of arthritis which needs celecoxib prescription is high in patients with coronary artery disease. - The main concern is that celecoxib would increase thrombogenicity by inhibiting the synthesis of prostacyclin in endothelial cells. - It is not known whether the administration of celecoxib would deteriorate antiplatelet effects of aspirin and clopidogrel which are used after stenting. Methods: - Healthy volunteers (n=40) - Randomization into five subgroups - aspirin, celecoxib, aspirin+celecoxib, aspirin+clopidogrel, aspirin+clopidogrel+celecoxib - Medication schedule : medication of each drug for 6 days, blood samples at day 0 and day 7 - Celecoxib 200mg twice a day, and/or aspirin 100mg daily, and/or clopidogrel 75 mg daily - Platelet function test : light transmittance aggregometry and arachidonic acid metabolite assay among subgroups. Study hypothesis : The addition of celecoxib does not deteriorate antiplatelet function of aspirin and clopidogrel.</brief_summary>
