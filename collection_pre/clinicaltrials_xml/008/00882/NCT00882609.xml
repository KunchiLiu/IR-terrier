	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to compare the diagnostic performance of 18F- Fluoride PET/CT scanning to that of conventional bone scanning for detecting cancer that has spread to the bone (bone metastasis). The intent of the study is to determine whether 18F-Fluoride PET/CT will lead to improved treatment and patient outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>F18PET/CT Versus TC-MDP Scanning to Detect Bone Mets</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial will accrue four hundred-eighty eight (488) evaluable patients with breast cancer, prostate cancer or lung cancer (approximately 163 of each cancer type) referred for routine bone scanning by their respective physicians. The specific stages of cancer required for eligibility are described in the eligibility criteria. Approximately eleven to fifteen qualified clinical centers will participate in the trial, with target enrollment for each site set at roughly 40-50 patients per site. The images of the patients will be transmitted to ACR Image Metrix, an imaging contract research organization (iCRO), for quality assurance and archival. iCRO will conduct blinded core lab interpretations by 3 radiologists who have not been involved in the design of the trial nor the clinical image interpretation. The data from the core lab readings will be compared with the deliberations of a multidisciplinary panel of oncology experts who will be blinded to the initial scan results and will determine the standard of evidence (truth) for each patient. The analysis will be based on this comparison.</detailed_description>
