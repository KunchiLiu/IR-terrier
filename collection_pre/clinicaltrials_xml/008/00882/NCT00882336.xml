	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to describe the management of patients with cardiovascular risk factors in primary prevention among different European countries. The patient's participation consists of a single study visit during a routine visit of the patient to the clinic/office. Study variables will be measured: - By an interview between physician and patient during the visit and/or available medical records' information: social and demographic patient characteristics, relevant family medical history, current medication. - By questions asked to the physician: physician perception of patients' CV risk factor, guidelines adherence and cost-containment. - By measurement performed to the patient during the visit: weight, height, BMI, waist and hip circumference will be measured. - CV risk factors (blood parameters) will be measured by collecting available data documented within the last year in the medical records and by the collection and analyses of a blood sample during the visit.</brief_summary>
