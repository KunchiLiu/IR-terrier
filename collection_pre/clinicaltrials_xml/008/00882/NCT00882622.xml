	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of Remote Ischemic Preconditioning on cardiac function in patients undergoing cardiac surgery compared to control intervention.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Remote Ischemic Preconditioning on Cardiac Function After Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In detail, we will focus on new onset of atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmias, myocardial injury, and cardiac function. Furthermore, we aim to investigate underlying pathways of RIPC in modifying the perioperative stress response.</detailed_description>
