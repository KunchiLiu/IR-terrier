	<brief_summary>Treatment in interstitial lung diseases (ILD) is frequently ineffective. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an excellent therapeutic option in another chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This prospective randomized controlled study aims to evaluate the short and long-term effects of PR in patients with ILD. For this purpose, 60 ILD patients will be randomly assigned to a PR or a control group. The investigators hypothesize that PR will improve exercise capacity, increase muscle force, reduce dyspnea and improve quality of life and daily life activities in ILD patients.</brief_summary>
