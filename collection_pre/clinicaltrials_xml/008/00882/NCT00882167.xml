	<brief_summary>Official title: Sensitivity and predictive value of functional cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detecting intra-abdominal adhesions Background: Adhesions are a frequent problem in abdominal surgery. The formation of adhesions is part of a normal wound healing. However in some patients adhesions cause severe complications such as chronic pain, obstruction and strangulation of the bowel. Adhesions can also obstruct access to the peritoneal cavity and complicate reoperations. Accurate imaging of adhesions would be of benefit avoiding adhesion related complications at repeated laparotomy or laparoscopy. At present no validated diagnostic tool mapping adhesions exists. Purpose: To define the sensitivity and specificity of functional cineMRI in detecting and mapping adhesions in patients undergoing reoperation. Design: Prospective multicenter observational trial Primary outcome: Sensitivity and specificity of functional MRI detecting adhesions to the abdominal wall Secondary outcome: Sensitivity and specificity of functional MRI detecting organ-to-organ adhesions. Estimated enrollment: 100 Start study: april 2009 Estimated study completion date: dec 2010 Estimated primary completion date: jun 2010</brief_summary>
