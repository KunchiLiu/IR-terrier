	<brief_title>Fibromyalgia Acupuncture Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is hypothesized that acupuncture treatment will be effective in reducing pain and improving lower body strength and overall functionality more than the sham acupuncture treatment in people with Fibromyalgia (FM). The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of acupuncture with simulated acupuncture in patients with FM using a randomized controlled design. More specifically, the objectives of this study are to determine if acupuncture can (1) reduce pain, (2) improve lower body strength, and (3) improve overall functionality.</detailed_description>
