	<brief_summary>There is actually two techniques of subclavian vein ultrasonography-guided venous catheterization : the axial and longitudinal approach. Currently, nothing makes it possible to privilege one technique compared to the other. This study aims to determine the best ultrasonography-guided method.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Subclavian Vein Ultrasound Guided Cannulation in Adult</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective randomized study will concern 100 adult patients operated of cardiac surgery under general anesthesia and requiring a central venous catheter. Patients will be randomized by an operator experienced in echoguided venous catheterization to be included in the axial (50 patients) or the longitudinal (50 patients) approach group. The device used will be a vascular probe of 7.5 MHz (Sonosite I Look®). The principal outcome measure will be the time from percutaneous puncture to the rise of the metallic guide (seldinger technique). The secondary criteria will be the rate of complication and failure. A series of echographic (size and depth of the subclavian vein and biometric (BMI, theoretical distance not from puncture (way of Aubaniac)/réel) measurements will be done to identify predictive conditions of success or failure depending of the echographic approach.</detailed_description>
