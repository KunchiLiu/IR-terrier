	<brief_summary>This study is conducted in Europe and North and South America. The primary aim of this observational study is to evaluate the frequency and pattern of bleeding episodes in haemophilia patients receiving preventative treatment with activated recombinant human factor VII. The secondary aim is to evaluate which patients are selected for this treatment, the dose and dose intervals used, and the safety of activated recombinant human factor VII when used as prevention. The study also aims to increase understanding of the unmet medical need and clinical relevance of preventative treatment in haemophilia patients.</brief_summary>
