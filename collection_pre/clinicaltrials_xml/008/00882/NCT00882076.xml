	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to establish toxicity and a maximum tolerated dose recommended phase 2 dose of Clofarabine in combination with Etoposide and Mitoxantrone for therapy of relapsed or refractory acute leukemias. The investigators will observe responses with these therapy agents and assess the impact of Clofarabine interacting with Etoposide in induction of DNA strand breaks.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This will be a phase I study with a standard 3x3 design. Patients will proceed to treatment through a series of cohorts with the three drugs being delivered over five days beginning with a dose of Etoposide 100 mg/m2 on days 1-5,Mitoxantrone 8 mg/m2 days 1-3, and clofarabine at 20 mg/m2 IV on days 2-6. Presuming this and subsequent cohorts are tolerable and no more than 1 patient per cohort develops DLT, MTD patients will be treated in cohorts of 3-6 patients up to a final dose level of Etoposide 100 mg/m2 on days 1-5,Mitoxantrone 8 mg/m2 days 1-5, and Clofarabine at 30 mg/m2 IV on days 2-6. Patients failing to enter remission may receive 4 days of therapy with Etoposide 100 mg/m2 on days 1-4,Mitoxantrone 8 mg/m2 days 1-2 or 1-4,and Clofarabine at 20-30 mg/m2 IV on days 1-4. According to established definitions for dose limiting toxicity a recommended phase II dose will be established. After this is established the final cohort will be expanded to 15 patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adequate renal and hepatic function. Capable of understanding the investigational nature, potential risks and benefits of the study and able to provide valid informed consent. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to enrollment. Male and female patients must use an effective contraceptive method during the study and for a minimum of 6 months after study treatment. LVEF must be â‰¥ 50% within 2 weeks. Current concomitant chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy other than as specified in the protocol. Use of investigational agents within 30 days or any anticancer therapy within 2 weeks before study entry with the exception of hydroxyurea. The patient must have recovered from all acute toxicities from any previous therapy. Have any other severe concurrent disease, or have a history of serious organ dysfunction or disease involving the heart, kidney, liver or other organ system that may place the patient at undue risk to undergo treatment. Patients with a systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection not controlled. Any significant concurrent disease, illness, or psychiatric disorder that would compromise patient safety or compliance, interfere with consent, study participation, followup or interpretation of study results. Have had a diagnosis of another malignancy, unless the patient has been disease free for at least 3 years following the completion of curative intent therapy with the following exceptions: patients with treated nonmelanoma skin cancer, in situ carcinoma or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, regardless of the diseasefree duration, are eligible for the study if definitive treatment for the condition has been completed. Patients with organconfined prostate cancer with no evidence of recurrent or progressive disease based on prostatespecific antigen values are also eligible for this study if hormonal therapy has been initiated or a radical prostatectomy has been performed. Additionally, patients with prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy are also eligible for the study.</criteria>
