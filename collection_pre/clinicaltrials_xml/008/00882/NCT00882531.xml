	<brief_summary>A national, multicentre, prospective, randomised, double-blind, phase III study in 2 parallel groups of isotretinoin versus placebo in patients presenting papular-pustular rosacea resistant to standard therapy. A non-balanced group (2 isotretinoin /1 placebo) design was selected since, given the nature of the study disease, fewer patients will receive the placebo than active isotretinoin. Treatment duration for each patient : 4 months, with monthly evaluation Follow-up at 2 months and 4 months for patients responsive after 4 months of treatment.</brief_summary>
