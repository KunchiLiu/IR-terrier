	<brief_summary>Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) has been used in severe aplastic anemia as a part of the conditioning regimen. Among the many kinds of ATG preparations, thymoglobulin had been found to be more effective in preventing graft versus host disease (GVHD) and rejection of organ transplants. As the fludarabine based conditioning regimens without total body irradiation have been reported to be promising for transplantation from alternative donors in SAA, thymoglobulin was added to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide conditioning to reduce GVHD and to allow good engraftment in unrelated donor transplantation. Our previous phase II study of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide plus thymoglobulin conditioning resulted in good engraftment (100%) and survival rate (74%). But grade III/IV toxicities occurred in 25% of patients and all events were treatment related mortalities. As cyclophosphamide is more toxic agent than fludarabine, we plan a new phase II study re; 'reduced toxicity fludarabine, cyclophosphamide plus thymoglobulin conditioning regimen for unrelated donor transplantation in severe aplastic anemia' by reducing dosage of cyclophosphamide and increasing dosage of fludarabine.</brief_summary>
