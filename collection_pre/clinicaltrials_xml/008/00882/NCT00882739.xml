	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Three Different Loading Doses of Clopidogrel, in Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will enroll STEMI patients, who were planned to undergo PCI, and will randomize them to three different clopidogrel loading dose regimens at first medical contact: no pre-treatment, 600 mg or 900 mg. Platelet activity after administration of clopidogrel will be evaluated by VerifyNowâ„¢ P2Y12 point-of-care system. The study is powered to demonstrate significant differences in the primary end point (the rate of TIMI Myocardial Perfusion Grade=3).</detailed_description>
