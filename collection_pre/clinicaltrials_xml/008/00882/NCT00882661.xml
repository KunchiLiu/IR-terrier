	<brief_summary>The purpose of the pivotal IDE clinical study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the SECURE®-C Cervical Artificial Disc for the treatment of symptomatic cervical disc disease at one level between C3 and C7, compared to anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. The purpose of the Postmarket Approval Study is to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy associated with the use of the SECURE-C Cervical Artificial Disc</brief_summary>
