	<brief_title>A Study of Adalimumab in Japanese Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the inhibition of radiographic progression by adalimumab compared with placebo in adult Japanese patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who had not been previously treated with methotrexate (MTX). Eligible participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either a subcutaneous injection of adalimumab 40 mg or matching placebo every other week (eow) during the 26-week double-blind phase. All participants also received 6 mg to 8 mg MTX weekly as basal treatment for their disease. Participants who experienced an increase in disease activity (more than 20% increase in tender joint count and swollen joint count) at Week 12, 16, or 20 compared with Baseline after having increased MTX dose to 8 mg per week for at least 4 weeks were discontinued from the double-blind phase and were eligible to receive open-label adalimumab 40 mg eow as rescue treatment. Participants who completed the 26 weeks of treatment (either double-blind study drug [adalimumab or placebo] treatment or open-label adalimumab treatment) were eligible to enter the 26-week open-label phase in which they received adalimumab 40 mg eow. Efficacy and safety assessments were performed at Baseline and at designated study visits.</detailed_description>
