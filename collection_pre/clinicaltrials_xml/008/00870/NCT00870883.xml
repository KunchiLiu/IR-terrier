	<brief_summary>Oxidative stress is associated with kidney damage in several different situations, including hypotension. In animal models it has been shown that the combination of n-acetylcysteine plus deferoxamine is superior to its isolate use in the treatment of several diseases. Thus the investigators aimed to determine if the administration of n-acetylcysteine plus deferoxamine could prevent renal failure in critical ill patients who develops hypotension.</brief_summary>
