	<brief_title>Transconjunctival Sutureless 25-Gauge Vitrectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of 25-gauge transconjuntival sutureless vitrectomy (TSV) in patients with persistent vitreous floaters who underwent multifocal intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Setting: Hospital Oftalmológico de Brasília, Brasília, DF, Brazil. Methods: Fourteen eyes of 11 patients with multifocal IOL implant associated with vitreous opacities that underwent 25-gauge vitrectomy were prospectively analyzed. Information collected included near and distance uncorrected visual acuity (UCDVA), best corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA), and the spherical equivalent (SE) before and 3 months after vitrectomy. Patients were questioned about surgery satisfaction and visual improvement after vitrectomy.</detailed_description>
