	<brief_summary>The underlying goal of this study is to assess 123-I MNI-168 SPECT imaging as a tool to detect ß-amyloid deposition in the brain of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) research participants and similarly aged and gender matched healthy subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain Imaging Study in Subjects With Alzheimer Disease in Comparison to Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall research questions to be addressed by this protocol are as follows: - To assess the dynamic uptake and washout of (123I) MNI-168, a potential imaging biomarker for β-amyloid burden in brain, using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in Alzheimer's (AD) subjects and similarly aged and gender matched healthy controls. - To perform blood metabolite characterization of (123I) MNI-168 in healthy and AD subjects to determine the metabolic fate and nature of metabolites in assessment of (123I) MNI-168 as a single photon computed tomography (SPECT) brain imaging agent. - To acquire initial safety data following injection of (123I) MNI-168. - Obtain test/retest reproducibility information in AD subjects with (123I) MNI-168 based on initial studies.</detailed_description>
