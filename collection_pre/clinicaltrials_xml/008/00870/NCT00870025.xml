	<brief_summary>There is a decline in androgen concentration with ovarian aging. Also, ovarian response to COH in IVF cycles diminishes with ovarian aging. Recent evidence suggest that testosterone or DHEA may improve ovarian response in poor prognosis patients by increasing intraovarian androgen concentration. A physiological way to induce androgen synthesis within the ovary is to stimulate theca cells androgen production by hCG stimulation. By doing this in the previous cycle we might expect a better response to COH.</brief_summary>
