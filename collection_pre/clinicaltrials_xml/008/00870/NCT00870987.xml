	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of a new malaria vaccine, the DNA-Ad vaccine. The study is specifically looking at a vaccine regimen against Plasmodium falciparum, the most deadly form of malaria.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial for Malaria Vaccines to Test for Safety, Immune Response and Protection Against Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this study is to evaluate if the DNA-Ad vaccine that targets both the liver and blood stages of the malaria life cycle is safe and protective, in hopes to develop a vaccine to prevent infection and/or lessen the severity of disease caused by the P. falciparum malaria parasite. More specifically, this DNA-Ad vaccine contains a liver stage antigen (circumsporozoite protein) and an antigen (apical membrane antigen 1) that is present in both the liver and blood stages designed to prevent infection by killing the majority of developing parasites in the liver and to prevent severe disease and death should break-through blood stage infections occur. This study is an open-label, Phase 1/2a study designed to assess the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of a DNA-Ad vaccine in healthy adults who are Ad5 seropositive or seronegative. The vaccinated study group will consist of up to 20 healthy, malaria-na√Øve adults aged 18 to 50 years, who have been previously screened to meet inclusion and exclusion criteria and will receive three priming doses of the DNA vaccine and a single dose of the boosting component, an adenovirus-vectored vaccine to be given 4 months after the last dose of DNA. Follow up visits will occur after each immunization. The control group will consist of six non-immunized subjects that will participate in a challenge to assure that vaccinated subjects were indeed exposed to P. falciparum. Subjects in both the immunized and control cohorts will receive malaria challenge. Subjects will be assessed for development of parasitemia by daily blood smears and will be closely observed in hotel after the challenge. Subjects will then be followed periodically and have the final in-person visit twelve weeks after the challenge, followed by annual contact by phone, email, or mailings up to five years after the first dose of immunization per FDA recommendation.</detailed_description>

Abnormal baseline EKG obtained at screening Acute disease at the time of enrollment Hepatomegaly, right upper quadrant abdominal pain or tenderness: noted by physical exam during the screening process. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding immunization during the study period Use of kanamycin or related antibiotics Suspected or known current alcohol abuse/drug abuse as obtained by history and physical examination Inability to make followup visits Any other significant finding that in the opinion of the investigator would increase the risk of having an adverse outcome from participating in this study.</criteria>
