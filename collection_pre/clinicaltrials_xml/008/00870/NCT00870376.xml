	<brief_summary>Urodynamic study is an objective method to evaluate female patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). However, this method includes place a urinary catheter, thus prevents it as a routine method to evaluate and follow up patients with LUTS. Therefore, it is necessary to find a simple and objective method to help in evaluating female patients with LUTS. Several kinds of biomarker had been reported in diagnosing patients with overactive bladder; however, the sensitivity remained poor. The aim of this study is to find a useful biomarker, biomarkers, or combinations, with the aid of urodynamic study, to objectively and precisely in evaluating the female patients with LUTS.</brief_summary>
