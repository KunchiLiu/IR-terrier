	<brief_summary>This study is being done to see if most patients are willing and able to report how they are feeling after surgery using the internet, and if this information can help doctors and nurses detect concerning symptoms after surgery. This study uses a special new website called WEBCORE. Patients can logon to WEBCORE and answer questions about how they are feeling. Then, doctors and nurses can look at this information during clinic appointments. We are doing this study to see if WEBCORE is a helpful way for us to keep track of information about how patients are feeling and quality of life. If WEBCORE is helpful, we will use it in the future to collect more information about patients' symptoms and quality of life. We can use what we learn to help find better ways of helping patients to prepare for what they will go through while they recover from surgery.</brief_summary>
