	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well everolimus works in treating patients with relapsed or metastatic endometrial cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Estimate the rate of non-progression after 3 months of treatment with everolimus in patients with relapsed or metastatic endometrial cancer. Secondary - Evaluate the partial and complete response rate after 3 months of treatment with everolimus in these patients. - Evaluate the duration of response in these patients. - Evaluate the clinical benefit after 6 months of treatment with everolimus in these patients. - Evaluate the time to progression in these patients. - Evaluate the progression-free and overall survival of these patients. - Evaluate the nature, frequency, and severity of side effects of everolimus in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral everolimus daily in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly for 3 months and then every 3 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
