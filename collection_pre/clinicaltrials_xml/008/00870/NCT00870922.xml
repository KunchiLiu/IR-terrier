	<brief_summary>Muscles and myofascial dysfunction are more often the mechanism and source of pain in oral fascial disorders (OFD) than the TMJ. Masticatory muscles in patients with TMJ alterations are more hypertonic, less efficient and more prone to fatigue compared to age and sex matched controls. It is our opinion that Active Release Technique can be a reliable assessment and treatment tool in the resolution in cervical-cranio mandibular disorders. Our goal is to improve masticatory function through treatment of trigger points in the masseter.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recruit 45 patients with TMD determined by questionnaire. Measure pre and post mandibular active range of motion and VAS pain scale. Treatment will include 4 visits over a two week span measuring before first treatment and after last treatment. There will be 3 treatment groups; active release technique, post isometric relaxation and a no treatment control group. We will analyze data for any change in mandibular range of motion and VAS pain scale.</detailed_description>
