	<brief_summary>The SENSE-AF study aims to determine the performance of the OptiSense lead in sensing fine episodes of Atrial Tachyarrhythmia/Atrial Fibrillation (AT/AF) and rejecting Far-Field R Wave (FFRW). The performance of the lead will be measured as a difference in device-determined time in AT/AF and surface-ECG determined time in AT/AF. This measurement will be compared to the control group which will be randomized to receive SJM's Tendril™ RA leads.</brief_summary>
