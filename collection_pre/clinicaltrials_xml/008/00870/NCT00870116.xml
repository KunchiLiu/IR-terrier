	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate local disease control after 2 years in patients with non-metastatic, non-operated non-small-cell lung cancer treated by radiotherapy. Eligible patients will be recruited and registered consecutively (no randomization). The estimated inclusion period is approximately 24 months. The duration of the research is 4 years. The number of patients required in this multicentric prospective study is 120: - 20 patients in the SBRT-1 arm (cyberknife), - 80 patients in the SBRT-2 arm (linear accelerator-based) - 20 patients in the conformational radiotherapy arm. This is a prospective, multicentric, non comparative and non randomized study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main objective of this study is to do a health economic evaluation of innovating techniques in radiotherapy. SBRT is the very precise delivery of high-powered radiation to small target volumes, using multiple low-intensity beams. Extremely precise patient positioning and target location is essential for accurate treatment delivery. Several studies have shown a benefit of SBRT in terms of local control and progression-free survival, in particular for the treatment of cerebral metastases of limited number and size. The development of this technique is recent. The number of treatment sessions is low: 1 to 4. But the patient is exposed to a major risk of toxicity in several organs: the bronchi, the lungs, large vessels, the oesophagus and the spinal-cord. Pulmonary SBRT imposes strict rules and the use of specific equipment. Extra-cranial SBRT can be realized using either: - Conventional linear-accelerator equipped SBRT, - Cyberknife SBRT. 3 groups of treatment will be evaluated in this study: - SBRT by cyberknife, - SBRT by linear accelerator, - Conformational radiotherapy (free breathing or breath holding).</detailed_description>
