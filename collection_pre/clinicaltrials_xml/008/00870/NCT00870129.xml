	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the ability of these advanced MRI scans in predicting areas within a malignant glioma (brain tumor) that are at a high risk of recurring. If these advanced MRI scans are able to identify the cancerous part of the tumor, then radiation therapy can be targeted to those sites and possibly improve patient survival.</brief_summary>
