	<brief_summary>This is a randomized double blind clinical trial to test the effect of Naltrexone on HIV infected heavy drinkers. The study will select 40 HIV positive patients who meet criteria for heavy drinking. Treatments include Naltrexone (25-100mg)and placebo. Patients will be treated, followed up, and assessed for a duration of 12 weeks. The investigators associated hypotheses Hypothesis 1: Naltrexone will reduce the frequency of heavy drinking. Hypothesis 2: Naltrexone will lead to maintenance or improvement in CD4 lymphocyte count and decreased HIV RNA levels. Hypothesis 3: Naltrexone will lead to a reduction in sexual risk behaviors. Hypothesis 4: Naltrexone will lead to improved adherence to HAART. Hypothesis 5 (Exploratory): Naltrexone will be well-tolerated with minimal side effects and patients will exhibit good treatment retention.</brief_summary>
