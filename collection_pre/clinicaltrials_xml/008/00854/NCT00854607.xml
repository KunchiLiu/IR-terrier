	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between fungal biomarker levels during anti-fungal therapy and the success of treatment for fungal infection. The primary hypothesis is that over the initial two weeks of anti-fungal therapy, fungal biomarkers from participants with invasive aspergillosis (IA) will be lower for those with a successful clinical outcome compared to those with a failed clinical outcome.</brief_summary>
