	<brief_summary>Determine time-to-progression (TTP) for an escalating dose schedule for subjects with progressive metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with sorafenib</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Toxicity Study of Sorafenib in Patients With Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sorafenib to be administered as 28-day cycles. Sorafenib dose escalation by cycle is: - Cycle 1: 400 mg BID - Cycle 2: 600 mg BID - Cycle 3+: 800 mg BID Within subject dose escalation and maximum dose is dependent on observed tolerability. Dose escalation only occurs after acceptable tolerability is demonstrated by subject.</detailed_description>
