	<brief_summary>The ATLET study will assess the effect of manual or robotic body-weight supported locomotor training of patients with stable motor incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) on gait and overall ADL function as well as on estimated health care costs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The ATLET Study: Can Subjects With Incomplete Spinal Cord Injury Learn to Walk?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are approximately 100 new cases of spinal cord injuries (SCI) each year in Norway. Most of the SCI occur after traumatic accidents among young people and adults during the time of their productive life. Loss of walking and standing ability restricts their independent mobility and autonomy and severely impacts their quality of life. The study has two arms: 1) manual locomotor training (Tromsø) and 2) robot assisted training (Oslo). Each study arm has 30 patients, randomized to receive standard care or intervention. The intervention group receives 60 days of intensive locomotor training over 6 months. Single-blind, before/after evaluation of effect will be performed at Sunnaas hospital using a standardized set of evaluation tools.</detailed_description>
