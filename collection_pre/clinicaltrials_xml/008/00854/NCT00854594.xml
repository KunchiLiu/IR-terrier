	<brief_summary>The investigators' study focuses on improving the care of diabetes, a complex chronic illness, by providing important insights into interprofessional training and its potential role in fostering the necessary interdisciplinary management needed for chronic conditions and in addressing the gap between best practice and actual care provided.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interprofessional Training to Improve Diabetes Care: The ReSPECT Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The complexity of diabetes management challenges the acute care-oriented healthcare system. Some experts suggest part of the problem is that the healthcare system fosters a separate silos decision making model. While there is increasing recognition that quality diabetes care is best provided in an interdisciplinary manner, interprofessional training models are limited, as is understanding of the links between interprofessional training, actual practice, and patient outcomes. Advancing our understanding of interprofessional training models is critical because most of the complications associated with diabetes (e.g., amputations, renal failure, strokes) can be prevented or delayed with proper management. The investigators' objective is to better understand the processes and mechanisms by which interprofessional training impacts on chronic care management (practice patterns) and the ways it translates into improved patient outcomes.</detailed_description>
