	<brief_title>L-asparaginase Monotherapy as Salvage Treatment in Patients With NK/T Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prognosis of patients with progressive and recurrent NK/T cell lymphoma is poor partially due to lack of effective treatment. L-asparaginase was reported to be effective in this setting by several case reports. The investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of L-asparaginase monotherapy in a prospective phase II study.</detailed_description>
