	<brief_summary>Trabeculectomy is an ocular surgery intended to reduce intra-ocular pressure the surgery creates a sub-conjunctival filtering bleb which filters aqueous humor fluid out. A rather common adverse event of the surgery is increasing vascularity of the conjunctiva overlying the bleb. This leads to adherence of the conjunctiva to the sclera and fibrosis and finally failure of the bleb (and of the surgery) this study intends to demonstrate that post operative subconjunctival bevacizumab injection will reduce incidence of bleb vascularity and ultimately, bleb failure.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>trabeculectomy is an ocular surgery intended to reduce intra-ocular pressure the surgery creates a sub-conjunctival filtering bleb which filters aqueous humor fluid out. a rather common adverse event of the surgery is increasing vascularity of the conjunctiva overlying the bleb. this leads to adherence of the conjunctiva to the sclera and fibrosis and finally failure of the bleb (and of the surgery) this study wishes to demonstrate that post operative subconjunctival bevacizumab injection will reduce incidence of bleb vascularity and ultimately, bleb failure. during the study, one study group will be given subconjunctival bevacizumab 1 week after surgery, another study group will be given subconjunctival bevacizumab 2 week after surgery, and a third group will serve as control and will not receive bevacizumab. if bleb vascularity will be diagnosed all patients will be treated according to current guidelines.</detailed_description>
