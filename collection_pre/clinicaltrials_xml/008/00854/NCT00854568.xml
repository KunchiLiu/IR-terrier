	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to compare CHOP versus CEOP-induced cardiotoxicity in patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma. The hypothesis is epirubicin is associated with less cardiotoxicity without compromising the efficacy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Study of Doxorubicin Versus Epirubicin-induced Cardiotoxicity in Patients With DLBCL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The doxorucin-containing regimen (CHOP) and epirubicin-containing regimen (CEOP) are both frequently used in patients with aggress B-cell lymphoma in out institution. According to a Cochrane meta-analysis, epirubicin is less cardiotoxic than doxorubicin on a mg per mg basis. However, compared with 50mg/m2 of doxorubicin in CHOP, epirubicin was usually used at a higher dose (70mg/m2) to treat non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Because of the correlation between cumulative dose and risk of cardiotoxicity, it is reasonable to speculate that CEOP (70mg/m2) has less cardiotoxicity than CHOP (50mg/m2) when both regimens are administered with similar cycles.</detailed_description>
