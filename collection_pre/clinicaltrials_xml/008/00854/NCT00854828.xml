	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter study evaluating the effectiveness of nonoperative and operative treatments. The investigators wish to identify important clinical and radiographic determinants of outcomes in the management of adults with symptomatic lumbar scoliosis (ASLS).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Multicenter Prospective Study of Quality of Life in Adult Scoliosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aim #1: Compare the outcomes of surgery and nonoperative treatment in patients aged 40 to 80 with ASLS defined as a lumbar curve with a coronal Cobb measurement ≥ 30°, and either of the following: Oswestry (ODI) score of 20 or more; or Scoliosis Research Society Quality of Life instrument (SRS-QOL) score of 4.0 or less, in the domains of pain, function and/or appearance. Specific Aim #2: Evaluate the impact of patient factors (age, gender, socioeconomic status, education) and comorbidities [mental health, body mass index (BMI) and bone mineral density (BMD)] on adverse events and treatment outcomes for both the nonoperative and operative arms. Incorporate these variables into a prediction model to help identify those patients most likely to benefit from either a surgical or nonoperative approach</detailed_description>

	<criteria>aged 40 to 80 years with ASLS defined as lumbar curve with a coronal Cobb measurement ≥ 30°, and either of the following: Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score ≥ 20 or SRSQOL score ≤ 4.0 in the domains of pain, function and/or appearance. If assigned to surgical intervention (by randomization or patient preference), the intervention plan would include, at a minimum, the Cobb levels of the Thoracolumbar/lumbar spine. Substantial cardiac, pulmonary, renal or metabolic disease that, in the judgment of the surgical team, would preclude performing an operative procedure without undue risk of morbidity and mortality Concomitant highgrade spondylolisthesis (Grade 3) Prior thoracic or multiple level lumbar laminectomy or decompression [single or two level lumbar decompression (e.g., herniated disc) will not be an exclusion] Prior thoracic or lumbar fusion Osteoporosis evidence by a dualenergy xray absorptiometry (DEXA) Tscore &lt;3.0 at hip or lumbar spine for patients considered to be at risk (post menopausal females, males &gt; 60 years of age, steroid dependent rheumatoid arthritics, status post organ transplantation, etc.). Patients may be randomized prior to obtaining DEXA results. Non Surgical patients may initiate non surgical treatments prior to completion of DEXA (if required) as non surgical treatments will not affect DEXA results BUT DEXA must be completed and results entered within 3 months of enrollment. Surgical patient must have DEXA prior to surgical intervention. Neuromuscular scoliosis (e.g., spinal muscular atrophy, cerebral palsy, Parkinson's Disease, postpolio syndrome, Charcot Marie Tooth disease) Congenital scoliosis in the lumbar spine. Congenital anomalies of the cervical or thoracic spine are acceptable. Spine tumor, infection or connective tissue disorder Cognitively impaired or unable/unwilling to comply with followup Pregnancy or planning on conceiving during time of study involvement Ankylosing Spondylitis Past history of vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty of the thoracic or lumbar spine</criteria>
