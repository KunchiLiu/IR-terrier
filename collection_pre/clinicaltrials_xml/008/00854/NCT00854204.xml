	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the bioavailability (the degree to which a drug becomes available in the body after administration) of 3 different pharmaceutical preparations of a combination of two drugs, TMC114 and TMC41629. There will be 1 single oral intake (intake by mouth) of each of the 3 preparations. The study will also investigate the safety of use and the potential side effects of TMC114 and TMC41629, and determine the circulating levels of both compounds in your blood over time (pharmacokinetics), after a single intake.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Innovation-TiFP4-C101: A Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics of TMC114 and TMC41629 After a Single Oral Dose of 2 Controlled-release Coformulations as Compared to an Immediate-release Coformulation of TMC114/TMC41629</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TMC41629 is a new investigational drug for the treatment of HIV. TMC114, is also known as Darunavir. In this randomized (study medication assigned by chance), open label trial (investigator and healthy volunteer know the name of the study medication), each healthy volunteer will receive a single dose of TMC114/TMC41629, in 3 subsequent sessions, Treatment A, Treatment B and Treatment C. Each capsule is equivalent to a dose of 200 mg of TMC114 and 23.67 mg of TMC41629. Treatment A (immediate-release formulation) will serve as reference formulation. All medication intakes will be orally and in fasted conditions.The study duration is at least 19 days, excluding screening and follow-up visits with three single intakes with 72 hours follow-up per intake. Each volunteer will receive a single dose of each formulation. TMC114/TMC41629 is formulated as an oral immediate-release hard-gelatin capsule, as an oral gastro-resistant hard-gelatin capsule, enteric-coated and as an oral gastro-resistant hard-gelatin capsule, colon-targeted. Each capsule is equivalent to a dose of 200 mg of TMC114 and 23.67 mg of TMC41629.</detailed_description>
