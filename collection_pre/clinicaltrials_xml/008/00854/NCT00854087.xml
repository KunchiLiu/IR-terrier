	<brief_summary>Current treatment of chronic liver disease relies upon removing the primary insult to the liver (e.g., alcohol) or treating the underlying viral infection (HBV, HCV, etc.). However, in the case of hepatitis C, a significant number of individuals will not clear the virus with current approved standard antiviral therapy, leaving them no options to manage their hepatic fibrosis, which can progress to cirrhosis and ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Fuzheng Huayu has been used in numerous studies in China and has been found to have a satisfactory prophylaxis effect on the chronic liver injury and formed liver fibrosis in rats and humans. In addition, it enhances the degradation of liver fibrosis and protects hepatocytes from injury and death, manifesting as decreasing of ALT and AST, and enhancement of albumin level. In addition, preliminary studies indicate that the Fuzheng Huayu has a good safety and tolerability profile with promising efficacy. The number of patients failing Interferon based therapy (i.e. not achieving SVR) is increasing. There are no approved standard of care treatment options for this population nor for patients who are intolerant or unwilling to receive Interferon; thus they are at higher risk for the progression of fibrosis. Moreover, there are no approved therapies to treat hepatic fibrosis, but basic research is exploring the pathophysiological mechanisms. Fuzheng Huayu is easy to administer, with a good safety and efficacy profile against fibrosis. Therefore, the investigators propose to further study the safety and efficacy profile of Fuzheng Huayu in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind study in Chronic Hepatitis C patients with hepatic fibrosis who have failed prior anti-HCV therapy or are intolerant or refuse Interferon based therapy. The primary objective of this study is to establish the safety and efficacy of Fuzheng Huayu treatment in chronic hepatitis C subjects who have failed prior anti-HCV therapy or cannot receive or refused Interferon based therapy in improving liver fibrosis.</brief_summary>
