	<brief_summary>Thesis: Is drug-induced anticholinergic activity additive resulting in a total anticholinergic load causing harmful side effects in old, fragile patients? Is it possible to reduce the anticholinergic load by multidisciplinary medical review including a pharmacist and a physician? The effects of the medical reviews are measured by cognitive tests (MMS and CERADS word lists), a measure of mouth dryness, serum levels of anticholinergic activity, activity of daily living and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Design: A randomized, controlled, single blinded interventional study in Norwegian nursing homes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Several studies have claimed that drugs showing anticholinergic activity in vitro cause high levels of serum anticholinergic activity in vivo that might cause impaired cognitive and functional functions in elderly. Pathophysiological changes in Alzheimer`s dementia makes these patients particularly vulnerable for anticholinergic cognitive impairments. The PRADA-study is the first interventional study evaluating the clinical effects of reducing drug-induced anticholinergic load in patients with dementia. This is also the first interventional study in the Nordic countries evaluating the clinical effects of clinical pharmacy.</detailed_description>
