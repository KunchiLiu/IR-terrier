	<brief_title>Study to Determine the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetic (PK) Profile of EGT0001474 in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>EGT0001474 is an inhibitor of human sodium dependent glucose co-transporter II being developed for the treatment of Type II Diabetes mellitus. This is a singe center, Phase-1, double blinded,placebo controlled, dose escalation study of single and multiple ascending doses of EGT0001474 in healthy male and female subjects. In part-1, subjects were randomized to receive single doses of EGT0001474 at 2.5-150 mg or placebo in the ratio of 3:1. In part-2, subjects were randomized to receive 14 daily doses of EGT0001474 at 10, 50 and 150 mg or placebo in the ratio of 4:1. When the various doses were analysed, the maximum dose 150 mg was found to be tolerable. Although there was no serious adverse events, mild adverse events were observed. This study provided information on human safety, tolerability, PK and pharmacodynamic effects of EGT0001474.</detailed_description>
