	<brief_summary>High levels of mannose-binding lectin (MBL), an activator of a part of the immune system called the complement system, have been associated with increased mortality and risk of early signs of kidney damage in patients with type 2 diabetes. The effect of weight loss and changes in insulin resistance on MBL levels have been poorly elucidated. This study includes 36 nondiabetic obese subjects, who will receive a very low- calorie diet (VLCD) of 800 kcal/day for 8 weeks. Fasting blood samples will be obtained at baseline and after 8 weeks of VLCD and concentrations of MBL, glucose and insulin will be measured. Insulin resistance is assessed using the HOMA-IR method.</brief_summary>
