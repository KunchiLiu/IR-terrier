	<brief_summary>This study will further the understanding of the genetic events leading to the development of RCC; explore the genetic basis for genetic instability and how it affects cancer risk; and eventually provide a means of identifying a subgroup of individuals who are most likely to develop RCC. Such individuals may then be targeted for intervention programs such as chemoprevention or dietary modification.</brief_summary>
