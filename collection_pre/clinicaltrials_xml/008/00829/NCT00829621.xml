	<brief_summary>People who have been scheduled for surgery using Bone Morphogenic Protein (called BMP-2) and an incisional vacuum assisted closure device (called IVAC) will be asked to join this study. The purpose of this study is to see if using the IVAC device removes BMP-2 from the wound. BMP-2 is a protein used by the body to increase bone healing, decrease the need for additional surgery, and reduce infection rates. The IVAC is a device that involves a foam dressing secured with an adhesive drape to make an airtight seal over a surgical incision. Tubing runs from the foam dressing to a device that uses gentle suction to drain fluid out (like a vacuum). The IVAC stays on for 48-72 hours depending on amount of drainage. The IVAC by itself helps reduce wound swelling and complications (such as infection).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Incisional Vacuum Assisted Closure (IVAC) Device and Its Effect on Implanted Bone Morphogenic Protein (BMP-2)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is hypothesized that the negative pressure associated with an IVAC is not sufficient to remove BMP-2 from a surgical wound. BMP-2 is commonly used in open tibia fractures at the time of definitive wound closure, and these wounds are prone to increased swelling and wound complications. The recent observation that IVAC decreases wound edema and increases oxygenation has led to their use in such cases. Used in conjunction, it is entirely possible that the negative pressure exerted by the IVAC can remove BMP-2 from surgical site and therefore decreases the effectiveness of BMP-2. We seek to determine if BMP-2 is present in effluent from the IVAC. If in this study the hypothesis is found to be wrong, and BMP-2 is found within the IVAC effluent, we are prepared to proceed with a follow-up study to quantify the BMP-2 removed by the IVAC.</detailed_description>
