	<brief_summary>This study is being conducted to investigate the potential benefits of using a special type of fluid that can be applied to the skin (Integuseal) in addition to standard surgical skin preparation in patients undergoing total hip replacement (THA) or total knee replacement (TKA). Integuseal is supposed to lock down the skin bacteria and reduce skin infection and other problems. This study will investigate whether Integuseal is effective in reducing persistent wound drainage when used in addition to standard surgical skin preparation for total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee replacement (TKA).</brief_summary>
