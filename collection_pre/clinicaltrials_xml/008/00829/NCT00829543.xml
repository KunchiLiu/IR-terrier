	<brief_title>Unguided Sacroiliac Injection: Effect on Refractory Buttock Pain in Patients With Spondyloarthropathies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A 20 weeks open-label clinical trial study of 35 patients, with different subtypes of spondyloarthropathies, is conducted In spondyloarthropathy's patients with refractory inflammatory buttock pain (fulfilling inclusion criteria), we performed outpatient guide-free sacroiliac injection of triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg in each joint. Patient (pain, stiffness, sleep disturbance) and Clinician assessments (sacroiliac tenderness, Finger to floor and Schober tests ) are recorded at baseline and every 4 weeks until the end of the study. MRI scoring of sacroiliac joint is recorded according to the Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) index for scoring inflammatory lesions in the sacroiliac joints, at baseline and in the end of the study.</detailed_description>

Tenderness over sacroiliac joint: pain over the sacroiliac sulcus with 45 kg/cm2 direct pressure. 1. Spinal infections (such as Brucellosis). 2. Local infection in the site of injection. 3. Sacroiliac ankylosis based on pelvic XRay (sacroilitis grade IV). 4. Patients who had received anti TNF, corticosteroid pulse or an investigational drugs during 4 months before.</criteria>
