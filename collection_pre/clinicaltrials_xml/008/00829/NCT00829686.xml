	<brief_summary>Patients will be enrolled in a multi-center study (WHMC and BAMC) to prospectively evaluate outcome after treatment for an uncomplicated skin abscess. All patients will receive incision and drainage and wound cultures. Patients will then be randomized to 1)no antibiotic or 2) bactrim DS (800/160) two tablets PO BID x 7 days. This is the dose recommended for treating skin and soft tissue infections. (Ellis et al. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases. 18(6):496-501, December 2005) Patients will then return to the ER on days 3 and 7 for wound repacking and evaluation. The primary outcome is clinical cure of abscess at 7 days after incision and drainage and recurrence rates within 30 days of treatment. Patients who are not improving at the following visit will then be treated with additional antibiotics or admission if needed. Data will be analyzed both by initial randomization and intention to treat. This serves as the pilot for the full placebo controlled randomized trial.</brief_summary>
