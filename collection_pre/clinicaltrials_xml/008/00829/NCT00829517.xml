	<brief_summary>This project seeks to demonstrate that computer kiosks in a clinic waiting room can improve access to hormonal contraception and screening for sexually transmitted infections. The study will be a randomized controlled trial which will evaluate the use of a computer kiosk module to compare the proportion of women of reproductive age who receive a prescription for hormonal contraception when computer-assisted provision of hormonal contraception is offered (intervention) to encounters when the study clinic provides standard contraceptive care (control). Subjects will be contacted approximately 3 months (range 2-4 months) after the clinic visit to complete a follow-up phone interview. The study population will include English and Spanish-speaking women ages 18-45 who seek care at this clinic. Our hypothesis is that computer-assisted provision of hormonal contraception (intervention)will increase the proportion of women of reproductive age who receive a prescription for hormonal contraception versus standard contraceptive care(control).</brief_summary>
