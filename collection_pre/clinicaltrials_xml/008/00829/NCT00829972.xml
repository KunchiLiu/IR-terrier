	<brief_summary>The investigators aim to evaluate the levels of serum Vitamin D in children having their tonsils removed and appropriate controls. The investigators hypothesize that children undergoing tonsil removal will have lower Vit D levels than accepted norms and when compared to controls. The investigators also hypothesize that Vitamin D deficiency will correlate with indicators of inflammation such as C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and tonsil size.</brief_summary>
