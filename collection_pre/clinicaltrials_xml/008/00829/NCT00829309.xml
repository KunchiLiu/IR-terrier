	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Screening Demographics: All subjects selected for this study will be healthy men 18 years of age or older at the time of dosing. The subject's body mass index (BMI) should be less than or equal to 30. Screening Procedures: Each subject will complete the screening process within 28 days prior to period I dosing. Consent documents for both the screening evaluation and HIV antibody determination will be reviewed, discussed and signed by each potential participant before full implementation of screening procedures. Screening will include general observations, physical examination, demographics, medical and medication history, an electrocardiogram, sitting blood pressure and heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature. The physical examination will include, but may not be limited to, an evaluation of the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory and central nervous systems. The screening clinical laboratory procedures will include: HEMATOLOGY: hematocrit, hemoglobin, WBC count with differential, RBC count, platelet count CLINICAL CHEMISTRY: serum creatinine, BUN, glucose, AST(GOT), ALT(GPT), albumin, total bilirubin, total protein, and alkaline phosphatase HIV antibody, hepatitis GB surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody screens URINALYSIS: by dipstick; full microscopic examination if dipstick positive URINE DRUG SCREEN: ethyl alcohol, amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine metabolites, opiates and phencyclidine Exclusion Criteria Subjects with a recent history of drug or alcohol addiction or abuse. Subjects with the presence of a clinically significant disorder involving the cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, gastrointestinal, immunologic, hematologic, endocrine, or neurologic system(s) or psychiatric disease (as determined by the clinical investigators). Subjects whose clinical laboratory test values are outside the accepted reference range and when confirmed on reexamination are deemed to be clinically significant. Subjects demonstrating a reactive screen for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody or HIV antibody. Subjects demonstrating a positive drug abuse screen when screened for this study. Subjects with a history of allergic response(s) to pravastatin or related drugs. Subjects with a history of clinically significant allergies including drug allergies. Subjects with a clinically significant illness during the 4 weeks prior to Period I dosing (as determined by the clinical investigators). Subjects who currently or report using tobacco products within 90 days of Period I dose administration. Subjects who have taken any drug known to induce or inhibit hepatic drug metabolism in the 28 days prior to Period I dosing. Subjects who report donating greater than 150 mL of blood within 28 days prior to Period I dosing. All subjects will be advised not to donate blood for four weeks after completing the study. Subjects who have donated plasma (e.g. plasmapheresis) within 14 days prior to Period I dosing. All subjects will be advised not to donate plasma for four weeks after completing the study.
