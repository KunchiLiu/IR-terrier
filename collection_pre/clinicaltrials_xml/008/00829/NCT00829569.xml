	<brief_summary>The purpose of this experimental study is to investigate whether an acute lipid infusion added marine n-3 fatty acids produces effects on insulin sensitivity in subjects with type 2 diabetes, when compared with an acute lipid infusion without marine n-3 fatty acids. Furthermore other effects on intermediary metabolism are tested for.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>n-3 Fatty Acid Infusion and Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evidence indicates that n-3 fatty acids exert several beneficial effects. However, the effects of marine n-3 fatty acids on intermediary metabolism have not been completely elucidated. In a previous study of a high intake of marine n-3 fatty acids during 9 wk we demonstrated reduced insulin sensitivity and altered proportion of carbohydrate vs. fat oxidation in subjects with type 2 diabetes. These results question the use of high doses of n-3 supplements in type 2 diabetes. It is not known to what extent such effects in type 2 diabetes can be reproduced by intravenous administration of n-3 fatty acids and/or whether short term intravenous administration has other effects.</detailed_description>
