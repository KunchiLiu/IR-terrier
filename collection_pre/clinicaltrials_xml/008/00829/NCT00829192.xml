	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether afamelanotide (CUV1647) is effective in reducing the number of actinic keratoses and squamous cell carcinomas developing in immune compromised organ transplant recipients, who are at particularly high risk, over a 24 month test period. The number of lesions formed on the head, hands and forarms will be monitored over this 24 month test period.</brief_summary>
