	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether acarbose therapy can reduce cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality in patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) who have established coronary heart disease (CHD) or acute coronary syndrome (ACS). A secondary objective of the study is to determine if acarbose therapy can prevent or delay transition to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in this patient population.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female, aged 50 years or more. Definite CHD, defined as a, b or c below: 1. Previous myocardial infarction (MI) or Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS), but not within the last 3 months, with any two of the following: Typical clinical presentation Confirmatory ECG changes Appropriate elevation of cardiac enzymes/biomarkers 2. Previous unstable angina (UA) or Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS), but not within the last 3 months, with any two of the following: Typical clinical presentation Confirmatory ECG changes Either elevation of a cardiac biomarker or a &gt;50% stenosis in ≥1 major epicardial coronary artery shown on coronary angiography or CT angiography. Where stenosis is reported in a qualitative manner, the categories "moderate" and "severe" will be taken as equating to &gt;50% stenosis. 3. Current stable angina defined as: Typical clinical history with symptoms occurring within the last month, and A &gt;50% stenosis in ≥1 major epicardial coronary artery shown on coronary angiography or CT angiography. Where stenosis is reported in a qualitative manner, the categories "moderate" and "severe" will be taken as equating to &gt;50% stenosis. Impaired glucose tolerance diagnosed on a single standard OGTT, defined as a 2hour plasma glucose (2HPG) value ≥7.8 but &lt;11.1 mmol/l and a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) &lt;7.0 mmol/l within six months prior to enrollment. Optimised cardiovascular drug therapy. At least 80% adherent to single blind placebo Study Medication during the runin period. Provision of written informed consent. Previous history of diabetes, other than gestational diabetes. MI, unstable angina, stroke or a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) within the previous three months. Planned or anticipated coronary, cerebrovascular or peripheral arterial revascularisation or other major surgical intervention. NYHA class III or IV heart failure. Evidence of severe hepatic disease. Evidence of severe renal impairment or an eGFR &lt;30 ml/min/1.73m2 (derived using the MDRD Chinese equation) Any other condition likely to reduce adherence to the protocol e.g. alcoholism, major active psychiatric disorder, cognitive impairment or a condition likely to markedly limit life expectancy e.g. malignancy. Pregnancy (or planned pregnancy within the next five years). Concurrent participation in any other clinical interventional trial. Known intolerance to alpha glucosidase inhibitors or gastrointestinal problems. Thought by the investigator for any reason to be unsuitable for participation in this clinical study.</criteria>
