	<brief_summary>The objective of this randomized, single-dose, two-way evaluation is to compare the bioequivalence of a test dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride formulation to an equivalent oral dose of the commercially available dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride (Focalin®, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation) in a test population of 24 adult subjects under fed conditions.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1. Sex: Male and Female; similar proportion of each preferred. 2. Age: At least 18 years. 3. Weight: BMI (Body Mass Index) less than or equal to 30. 4. Qualifying subjects must be in good health and physical condition as determined by medical history, complete physical examination, and laboratory tests, all obtained within four (4) weeks prior to study start. The subjects may not have a history of significant past illness expected to affect the investigation. The normal status of subjects will be confirmed by the following procedures: Laboratory Tests: Hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC, WBC, differential count, serum electrolytes (Na, K, Cl), fasting blood glucose, BUN, bilirubin,m creatinine, AST, ALT, LD, alkaline phosphatase and urinalysis. HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, breath alcohol test, and drugs of abuse testing will be done for screening purposes only. Urine drugs of abuse testing and breath alcohol testing will be repeated at each checkin. Female subjects will have a serum pregnancy test done at screening and a urine pregnancy test prior to each study period at checkin. Laboratory values which are greater than ±20% of the normal range will not qualify unless specifically accepted (with comment) by the Principal Investigator. Results of HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and drugs of abuse must be negative or nonreactive for the subject to qualify for the study. Electrocardiogram: A 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be obtained for all subjects. The original tracings, plus interpretation, will be included in the case report form packet. 5. Subjects must read and sign the Consent Form. Exclusion Criteria 1. Subjects not complying with the above inclusion criteria must be excluded from the study. 2. In addition, any one of the conditions listed below will exclude a subject from the study: History of treatment for alcoholism, substance abuse, or drug abuse within past 24 months. History of malignancy, stroke, diabetes, cardiac, renal or liver disease, or other serious illness. History of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), stricture of the esophagus, achalasia, malabsorption syndrome, colon cancer, or chronic colitis, including Crohn's disease. History of upper gastrointestinal disorder such as dysphagia, esophagitis, gastritis, ulcers. History of treatment for asthma within the past five (5) years. History of marked treatable anxiety, tension, agitation. History of glaucoma History of motor tics Family history or diagnosis of tourettes syndrome History of treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors History of seizures Inability to sit upright for a period of at least 30 minutes Females who are pregnant or lactating History of hypersensitivity to dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride, methylphenidate or any central nervous system stimulant 3. Conditions upon screening which might contraindicate or require that caution be used in the administration of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride, including: Sitting systolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg, or diastolic pressure below 50 mm Hg. Heart rate less than 50 beats per minute after a 5minute rest in a seated position. 4. Inability to read and/or sign the consent form. 5. Treatment with any other investigational drug during the four (4) weeks prior to the initial dosing for this study. 6. Subjects who have donated blood within four (4) weeks prior to the initial dosing for this study. 7. Subjects who smoke or use tobacco products or are currently using nicotine products (patches, gums, etc.). Three (3) months abstinence is required.</criteria>
