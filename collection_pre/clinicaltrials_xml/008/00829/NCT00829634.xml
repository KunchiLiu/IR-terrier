	<detailed_description>Subjects will screen at St. Luke's Hospital in San Francisco to determine their eligibility. Once enrolled the study will take two weeks. During the first week subjects attend daily, hour-long outpatient visits at San Francisco General Hospital. At these visits subjects will receive an oral dose of l-methamphetamine, have their vitals read, answer questionnaires and receive a blood draw. During the second week of the study subjects are admitted to San Francisco General Hospital for a week long inpatient stay. During this stay the subject continues to receive l-methamphetamine but also receives three doses of d-methamphetamine on three separate days. In addition the subject receives blood draws, has their urine collected, and answers questionnaires.</detailed_description>
