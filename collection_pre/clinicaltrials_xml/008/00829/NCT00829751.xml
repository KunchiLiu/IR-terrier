	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to more objectively evaluate potential lens-material/care solution bio-incompatibilities. We will do this by measuring corneal staining and the amount of fluorescein dye diffusion into the eye.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>At least 18 years of age. Best correctable vision to 20/40 in each eye. Possess a functional spectacle prescription to allow adequate vision during the deadaptation and fluorometry measurement period. No known ocular or systemic allergies, which may interfere with contact lens wear. No known systemic disease, or need for medication that may interfere with contact les wear (i.e. antihistamines, betablockers, steroids, ect.). Subjects demonstrating any medical condition that may affect the results of this study SHOULD NOT be enrolled. The following are specific conditions that exclude subjects from enrollment in this study. Eye (ocular) or systemic allergies that may interfere with contact lens wear. Clinically significant corneal swelling (greater than 3 or 4 on a 04 scale), corneal blood vessel growth (vascularization), corneal staining, bulbar redness, tarsal redness, or any other abnormality of the cornea that may cause unsafe contact lens wear. Are taking part in any other study or have taken part in a study within the last 14 days. Are pregnant, or anticipating to become pregnant during the course of the study.</criteria>
