	<brief_title>Comparison of Tendon Repair and Physiotherapy in the Treatment of Small and Medium-sized Tears of the Rotator Cuff</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgical treatment by tendon repair or physiotherapy are accepted treatment options for small and medium-sized rotator cuff tears, but have never been compared in randomised, controlled studies. In this study, patients presenting clinical signs together with imaging findings (MRI and sonography) for a full-thickness rotator cuff tear will be randomly allocated to surgery (tendon repair) or physiotherapy. Outcome measuring will be performed by the Constant score, the self report section of the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score (ASES), the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) and subscores for shoulder motion, pain, strength and patient satisfaction. Scores will be taken at baseline and after 6 months,1, 2 and 5 years by a blinded assessor. All operated shoulders will be controlled by MRI after one year. Patients with no effect from physiotherapy after at least 15 treatment sessions will be offered secondary surgical treatment, and scoring results from last follow-up before surgery will be carried forward to analysis, according to an intention to treat principle.</detailed_description>
