	<brief_title>Effects of Pulsed-Dyed Laser on Scar Formation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulsed-dyed lasers have been used in the past to treat scars from minor surgery as well as burns. The laser has been used at different times, close to injury or late after injury. Success or failure of the laser has been judged by subjective observer scales. In this study we will treat the seams of 1/2 of a skin graft with a pulsed-dyed laser, beginning about one month after surgery. We will use objective measures of color (redness on digital pictures), scar volume(via laser scanning), and elasticity(measured by BTC-2000) as well as subjective assessment by an independent observer and the patient.</detailed_description>
