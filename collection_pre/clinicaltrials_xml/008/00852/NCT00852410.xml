	<brief_summary>Obtaining adequate hemostasis is crucial during endoscopic sinus surgery. Submucosal injection of local anaesthetic containing adrenaline has frequently been used to improve surgical milieu. However, injection of adrenaline has potential side effects including tachycardia, hypertension as well as inducing arrhythmia. The aim of this randomized clinical trial is to assess the hemodynamic and hemostatic effects of two different concentrations of adrenaline in local anaesthetic used during endoscopic sinus surgery.</brief_summary>
