	<brief_summary>Acute lung injury (ALI) is an early complication after allogeneic transplantation causing significant mortality and morbidity. Little is known on early markers and treatment of this complication. Recent data (Hilbert et al.) suggested a beneficial effect of Non-Invasive-Ventilation in ALI-patients immunosuppressed because a many different reasons including stem-cell transplantation. The investigators study is designed to evaluate early markers of ALI after allogeneic transplantation. In case ALI is documented patients are randomized to either conventional therapy (oxygen-support) or conventional therapy plus intermittent Non-Invasive Ventilation. The hypothesis is that Non-Invasive Ventilation improves outcome of ALI after allogeneic transplantation.</brief_summary>
