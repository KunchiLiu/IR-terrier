	<brief_title>Light Therapy for Bipolar Disorder. Efficacy of Light Therapy for Bipolar Depression: A Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bipolar Disorders (BD) are associated with chronic depression, disability, and increased suicide risk. Building on earlier findings, we conducted a 6-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of midday light therapy for bipolar depression. The aims were to examine the change in depression levels and the proportion of patients who responded and remitted. We assessed predictors of response with measures of side effects, sleep quality, suicidality, and psychosocial functioning. We included depressed adults with BD-Type I or II confirmed on the SCID interview and taking stable-dosed antimanic medication. We excluded patients with psychosis, rapid cycling, obsessive compulsive disorder, alcohol or substance use disorders, hypomania or mania, and severe suicidality. Patients were randomized to 7000 lux broad spectrum light therapy OR 50 lux dim red light for 45-60 minutes daily. Weekly, the blinded-clinician assessed symptoms with the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Scale with Atypical Depression Supplement (SIGH-ADS) and global functioning.</detailed_description>
