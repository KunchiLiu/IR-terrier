	<brief_title>Adherence to Stimulant Treatment in Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Patients (ASTA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is designed as a prospective, multi-centric, open-label, randomized, active-controlled trial. ADHD-children and adolescents of both sexes, 6-17 of age, effectively treated with stimulants are recruited in two centres. Over a naturalistic run-in phase of four weeks adherence to medication taken before randomisation is measured. In the subsequent controlled clinical trial 50% of the participants are randomized to extended release (ER) methylphenidate (Medikinet retard®) applied with breakfast, 50% are randomized to immediate release (IR) methylphenidate (Medikinet®) in the morning and 3-4 h later (clinical trial). To optimize ecological validity, no double-dummy technique is applied; the allocation to either study arm is non-blinded. According to the power calculation 106 patients will be randomized. The total duration of the study is 18 months. Starting with a run-in visit, each eligible patient is observed in the naturalistic run-in phase for four weeks. Subsequently, patients participate 100 days in the clinical trial starting with a baseline visit, an in between-visit and a final visit. Medical care is provided in the routine program of both study centres. To record the adherence, medication events are counted by Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS).</detailed_description>
