	<brief_summary>The modified Lanza scale (Lanza FL, 1984) has been widely utilized to grade the degree of gastritis and duodenitis. However, the inter-rater or intra-rater reproducibility of this scale has never been validated. As a quality improvement program, it is important to study the reproducibility of the scale between different operators and the operators himself. Method: During upper endoscopic examinations, one investigator performed the procedure and the second investigator look at the endoscopic image. The degree of gastritis and duodenitis is graded. The results of the grading are blinded to the other investigator. The endoscopic video is stored for reassessment to determine the intra-rater reliability. The patient identifier is stored in serial number. The investigator will not retrieve the report of the first assessment during the second assessment.</brief_summary>
