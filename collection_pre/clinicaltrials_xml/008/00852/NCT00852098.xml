	<brief_summary>Recently, total fundoplication followed by laparoscopic esophageal hiatoplasty has been the most common surgical treatment for gastro-esophageal reflux. Although this procedure is effective, some patients still develop complications. Indeed, dividing the short gastric vessels is claimed by many authors to confer benefit to patients even it could not be proved in other studies. In an attempt to evaluate the role of dividing the short gastric vessels and its long-term impact on the surgical treatment of the gastro-esophageal reflux, the investigators initiated a randomized clinical trial to clarify this important fact. Patients were recruited for this trial and short-term results had been already published in a national journal. The investigators are now registering this study which particularly focuses on the endoscopic outcome evaluated on long-term basis after gastro-esophageal reflux surgical treatment.</brief_summary>
