	<brief_title>Study of Stem Cell Transplant for Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndromes Using Clofarabine and Busulfan Regimen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The success of allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation in the treatment of myeloid malignancies is determined by two main factors: the limiting of regimen-related toxicity and the prevention of recurrent leukemia. Over the past 10 years, considerable clinical research has been devoted to the reduction of regimen-related toxicity through the use of reduced-intensity (nonmyeloablative) transplants. However, leukemic relapse has remained a difficult obstacle. Thus, the need for highly effective, yet non-toxic regimens persists, particularly for elderly patients for whom very little overall progress has been made. Clofarabine is a chemotherapeutic agent with novel myelotoxic properties and proven low toxicity in older patients. These qualities suggest clofarabine may be a useful component of conditioning regimens for stem cell transplantation.</detailed_description>
