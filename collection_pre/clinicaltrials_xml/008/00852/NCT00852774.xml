	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess changes of intra-ocular pressure (IOP) and examine preoperative facts affecting IOP in endometrial cancer patients undergoing robotic hysterectomy compared to laparotomy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Steep Trendelenburg Positioning on Intra-Ocular Pressure During Surgery for Endometrial Robotics Versus Laparotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients that are surgical candidates with endometrial cancer will be screened for this study. Two measurements from each eye will be taken in the following positions: awake at rest, supine before induction, after induction on anesthesia, after insufflation of abdomen with CO2 in supine position, in trendelenburg position, in deep trendelenburg position,at the end of procedure,prior to awakening in supine position and one last reading 45-60 min after awakening in supine position. The time, blood pressure, heart rate, peak airway pressure, plateau airway pressure, end tidal desflurane, end tidal CO2, total IV fluids administered, and blood loss.</detailed_description>
