	<brief_title>Low Fat Diet and Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research project has significance for its potential to develop a new therapeutic approach to MS. Current treatments in MS include disease modifying therapies such as human recombinant interferon beta, glatiramer acetate and natalizumab. However, these are only partially effective, cannot be taken orally, have side-effects and are very expensive. Developing treatment that can be combined with current disease modifying agent remains an important goal for improving the care of people with MS.</detailed_description>
