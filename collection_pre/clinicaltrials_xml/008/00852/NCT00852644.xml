	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Stereotactic radiosurgery can send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of stereotactic radiosurgery in treating patients with stage I or stage II non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Radiosurgery in Treating Patients With Stage I or Stage II Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To establish the maximum tolerated dose of CyberKnife® hypofractionated stereotactic radiosurgery in patients with medically inoperable, stage I or II non-small cell lung cancer. - To establish the relationship between PET response and local control and survival using fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET/CT imaging before treatment and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment. OUTLINE: Patients undergo placement of 3 gold fiducial markers by CT-guidance or bronchoscopy. Patients then undergo CyberKnife® hypofractionated stereotactic radiosurgery over 45-120 minutes twice weekly for 2 weeks. Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET/CT scan at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after completion of treatment. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 4 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed nonsmall cell lung cancer Stage I or II disease (T13, N0, M0) T2 or T3 tumor ≤ 5 cm No T3 tumors involving the central chest or mediastinum (only chest wall involvement allowed) Tumor deemed technically resectable, in the opinion of an experienced thoracic surgeon, AND patient deemed "medically inoperable" Patients with FDGavidity in mediastinal lymph nodes are eligible provided they are able to undergo mediastinoscopy to confirm N0 status PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: ECOG performance status 02 Not pregnant or nursing Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for ≥ 6 months after completion of study treatment No history of contrast allergy No psychological issues that would preclude the completion of study treatment PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: No prior radiotherapy or chemotherapy No suspected nodal metastasis that cannot be falsified by mediastinoscopy (i.e., hilar or mediastinal nodes that are either fludeoxyglucose F 18 [FDG]avid or measure &gt; 1 cm in short axis diameter on CT scan) No tumor within or touching the proximal bronchial tree, defined as a volume of 2 cm in all directions around the proximal bronchial tree (carina, right and left main stem bronchi, right and left upper lobe bronchi, bronchus intermedius, right middle lobe bronchus, lingular bronchus, right and left lower lobe bronchi)</criteria>
