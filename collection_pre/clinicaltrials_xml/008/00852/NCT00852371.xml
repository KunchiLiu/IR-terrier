	<brief_summary>This will be a randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of antimalarial regimens in healthy schoolchildren. The primary objective of the study is to compare the efficacy of different combination antimalarial regimens, including amodiaquine + sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AQ+SP), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP), and placebo, to SP for intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) in schoolchildren, as measured by risk of parasitaemia (unadjusted by genotyping) after 42 days of follow-up. This will assess both the efficacy for treatment of asymptomatic infections and the efficacy for prevention of new infections.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study will be carried out among children aged ≥ 8 to &lt; 14 years (boys) and ≥ 8 to &lt; 12 years (girls) attending primary schools in Tororo district. Schools will be selected using convenience sampling with the assistance of the district and the education sector. The target population includes children attending primary schools in Uganda. The accessible population includes the children attending the participating primary schools in classes 3-7 in Tororo district. Children who meet the selection criteria for participation in the study will be randomized to treatment with one of the four study regimens and will be followed for 42 days. Repeat evaluations will be performed on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 28, and 42 (and any unscheduled day that a student is ill) and will include assessment for the occurrence of adverse events. Treatment efficacy outcomes will be assessed using revised WHO outcome classification criteria. Acceptability of treatment regimens will be assessed using a questionnaire administered to participating students on day 7. The primary outcome measure is risk of parasitaemia (unadjusted by genotyping) after 42 days of follow-up.</detailed_description>
