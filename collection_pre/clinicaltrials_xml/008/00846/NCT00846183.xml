	<brief_title>Effect of Local Injury on Implantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low implantation rate is still a major concern in ART cycles. It has been reported that local injury to endometrium may improve endometrial receptivity and implantation rate. A total of 120 patients in first IVF cycles, who are stimulated with long protocol, are randomly divided into two groups. In one group, on the day of oocyte retrieval, local injury to endometrium with a Novak curet to anterior and posterior wall of endometrium are performed and in the other group no interventions are done. After fresh embryo transfers, implantation and clinical pregnancy rates are compared between two groups.</detailed_description>
