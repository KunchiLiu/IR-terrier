	<brief_summary>The purpose of this randomized trial is to test the effectiveness of screening and brief intervention for risk drinking by nonpregnant women with specific medical problems exacerbated by excessive alcohol consumption. The medical problems are female factor infertility, hypertension, diabetes, and osteoporosis, conditions that are costly to treat and difficult to manage. Just as pregnant women are thought to be highly motivated to modify their alcohol consumption, so women with specific medical problems worsened by alcohol intake are an appropriate group to receive a brief intervention.</brief_summary>
