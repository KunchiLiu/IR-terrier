	<brief_summary>Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) commonly develop non-cancerous tumors called plexiform neurofibromas. These tumors can be defined as "high-risk" when they result in severe pain, physical disability, organ dysfunction and/or become life-threatening. Presently, there is no effective medical therapy to offer patients with "high-risk" plexiform neurofibromas, and surgery does not provide lasting help. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two treatment combinations in patients with "high-risk" plexiform neurofibromas.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study's design involves treating eligible patients with a combination of celecoxib and pegylated interferon alpha-2b. If the patients have at least a partial response after six months, they may continue on the same treatment for up to two years. If the patient experiences less than a partial response, or has progressive disease after six months of therapy, then vincristine and temozolomide will be added to the celecoxib and interferon alpha-2b backbone. Response to treatment will be assessed after a minimum of six months, presuming the patient has not experienced progressive disease. Total duration of therapy on study is two years for any individual treatment plan.</detailed_description>
