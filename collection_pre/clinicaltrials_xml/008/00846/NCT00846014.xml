	<brief_summary>The goal of this research is to use Helium-3 MRI to see the changes in airflow of the lungs at different times of an attack. These three stages are immediately after the attack, 1 month later and 4-6 months later.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Asthma Exacerbation and Helium-3 MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma is a pulmonary disorder that affects millions of people each year. The exact method of exacerbation is still under some discussion. Currently there is no cure for the disorder but treatment is of a wide variety. This study is meant to image the asthmatic lung at various time points post exacerbation. Since pulmonary imaging is currently limited to radiation techniques, this method will allow exacerbated images without the unnecessary exposure to radiation.</detailed_description>
