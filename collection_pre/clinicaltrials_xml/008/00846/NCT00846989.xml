	<criteria>Females must be postmenopausal or surgically sterile, or must use concomitantly two acceptable forms of effective contraception Clinical diagnosis of POAG or OH For study eyes not previously treated with antiglaucoma medications IOP must be ≥ 22 mm Hg at least at two assessment timepoints at Screening, and IOP must be ≥ 22 mm Hg at least at two assessment timepoints at Baseline, and IOP must be ≥ 20 mm Hg and ≤ 36 mm Hg at all Screening and Baseline assessment timepoints. Or for study eyes previously treated with antiglaucoma medications IOP must be ≥ 14 mm Hg and ≤ 24 mm Hg at least at two assessment timepoints at Screening. IOP must be ≥ 22 mm Hg at least at two assessment timepoints at Baseline (after washout) IOP must be ≥ 20 mm Hg and ≤ 36 mm Hg at all Baseline assessment timepoints History of or current clinically significant ocular conditions in either eye that would contraindicate the use of an investigational drug or latanoprost (e.g. active intraocular inflammation), or that might affect interpretation of the results of the study. History or presence of clinically significant medical problems that contraindicate the use of an investigational drug or latanoprost, including but not limited to: Uncontrolled hypertension with systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mm Hg measured at more than one blood pressure reading at Screening or Baseline; myocardial infarction within the 3 months period prior to randomization; active severe viral infections such as active encephalitis, meningitis, hepatitis, herpes simplex, or herpes zoster (minor viral upper respiratory infections such as colds do not require exclusion.) Presence of moderate or severe (grade 2 or 3) conjunctival hyperemia in the study eye at Baseline Visit. Argon laser trabeculoplasty or any prior IOP lowering surgery in the study eye. Ocular surgery in the study eye within 3 months prior to the Screening Visit. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
