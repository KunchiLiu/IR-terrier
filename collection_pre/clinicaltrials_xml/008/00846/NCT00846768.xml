	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the trial is to determine the effect of BI 17444Cl on the lung function over a 24-hour period, when it is inhaled using the Respimat inhaler in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In the trial four treatments of each 3 weeks of duration are included: 2 dosages in a once daily administration and 2 dosages for administration twice daily.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. All patients must sign an informed consent consistent with ICHGCP guidelines prior to participation in the trial, which includes medication washout and restrictions 2. All patients must have a diagnosis of COPD and must meet the following spirometric criteria: Patients must have relatively stable airway obstruction with a postbronchodilator FEV1 &lt; 80% of predicted normal and a postbronchodilator FEV1 / FVC &lt; 70% at Visit 1 3. Male or female patients, 40 years of age or older 4. Patients must be current or exsmokers with a smoking history of more than 10 pack years 5. Patients must be able to perform technically acceptable pulmonary function tests 6. Patients must be able to inhale medication in a competent manner from the Respimat inhaler and from a metered dose inhaler (MDI). 1. Patients with a significant disease other than COPD. 2. Patients with clinically relevant abnormal baseline haematology, blood chemistry, or urinalysis; all patients with an SGOT &gt; x2 ULN, SGPT &gt; x2 ULN, bilirubin &gt; x2 ULN or creatinine &gt; x2 ULN will be excluded regardless of clinical condition. 3. Patients with a history of asthma. For patients with allergic rhinitis or atopy, source documentation is required to verify that the patient does not have asthma. If a patient has a total blood eosinophil count more than 600/mm3, source documentation is required to verify that the increased eosinophil count is related to a nonasthmatic condition. 4. Patients with any respiratory infection or COPD exacerbation in the 6 weeks prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1) or during the baseline period. 5. Patients with any of the following conditions: a diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis; a diagnosis of paroxysmal tachycardia (&gt;100 beats per minute) 6. Patients with any of the following conditions: a history of myocardial infarction within 1 year of screening visit (Visit 1); unstable or lifethreatening cardiac arrhythmia; have been hospitalized for heart failure within the past year; known active tuberculosis; a malignancy for which patient has undergone resection, radiation therapy or chemotherapy within last five years (patients with treated basal cell carcinoma are allowed); a history of lifethreatening pulmonary obstruction; a history of cystic fibrosis; clinically evident bronchiectasis; a history of significant alcohol or drug abuse 7. Patients who have undergone thoracotomy with pulmonary resection 8. Patients being treated with any of the following concomitant medications: oral beta2adrenergics; oral corticosteroid medication at unstable doses (i.e., less than six weeks on a stable dose) or at doses in excess of the equivalent of 10 mg of prednisone per day or 20 mg every other day. 9. Patients who regularly use daytime oxygen therapy for more than one hour per day. 10. Patients who have completed a pulmonary rehabilitation program in the six weeks prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1) or patients who are currently in a pulmonary rehabilitation program 11. Patients who have taken an investigational drug within one month or six half lives (whichever is greater) prior to Screening Visit 12. Patients with known hypersensitivity to betaadrenergics drugs, BAC, EDTA or any other component of the Respimat inhalation solution delivery system 13. Pregnant or nursing women 14. Women of childbearing potential not using two effective methods of birth control (one barrier, one nonbarrier). Female patients will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless surgically sterilised by hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation, or postmenopausal for at least two years 15. Patients who have previously been randomized in this study or are currently participating in another study 16. Patients who are unable to comply with pulmonary medication restrictions prior to randomization</criteria>
