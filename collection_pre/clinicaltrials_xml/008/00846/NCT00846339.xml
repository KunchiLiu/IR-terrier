	<brief_title>PET Imaging Study on Occupancy of Dopamine D2 Receptors and Genotypes After Bupropion Administration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Open, one arm, single sequence, 2-period, study stratified into 2 DRD2 genotype groups For subjects who volunteer to cease smoking, genotypes are investigated. Twelve subjects are enrolled (6 - DRD2 Taq1A1 allele, 6 - DRD2 Taq1A2 homozygotes). Subjects receive baseline raclopride PET (High Specific Activity, Low Specific Activity). - Period 1 Subjects receive 150 mg of bupropion SR every day. After 1 week of medication, pharmacokinetic and PET studies are performed. - Period 2 Subjects receive 150 mg of bupropion SR twice a day. After 1 week of medication, pharmacokinetic and PET studies are performed.</detailed_description>
