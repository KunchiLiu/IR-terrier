	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the usefulness of CCTA (Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography) in the emergency room setting to diagnose and predict the outcome of patients with chest pain who have a low to moderate risk of heart disease. And to also determine if the use of CCTA(Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography) is more cost effective (cost less) than the current standards of care treatments. To determine if patients who present to the emergency room w/low to moderate probability of having an ACS (Acute Coronary Syndrome) prefer CCTA (coronary computed tomography angiography)-based care compared to standard algorithm based care.</brief_summary>
