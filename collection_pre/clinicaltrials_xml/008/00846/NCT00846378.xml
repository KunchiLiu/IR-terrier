	<brief_title>Minimizing Reperfusion Injury in Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The intervention of "post conditioning" at the time of reperfusion, in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), will attenuate the degree of ischemia-reperfusion injury, as manifested by infarct size. This intervention is hypothesized to be safe in humans.</detailed_description>
