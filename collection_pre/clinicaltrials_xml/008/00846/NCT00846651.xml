	<brief_title>Spinal Anesthesia Induced Hypotension During Cesarean Section</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many women experience low blood pressure after spinal anesthesia for Cesarean section. This low blood pressure may result in nausea, vomiting dizziness and impairment of uterine blood flow.The purpose of this study is to compare two methods for preventing low blood pressure associated with spinal anesthesia during Cesarean sections. In both methods, we will attempt to prevent low blood pressure using phenylephrine infusion that has been shown to be effective in recent research. In addition to receiving phenylephrine one group of patients will receive standard salt solution (Ringer's lactate solution), while the other group will receive a different, intravenous fluid called hydroxyethylstarch.</detailed_description>
