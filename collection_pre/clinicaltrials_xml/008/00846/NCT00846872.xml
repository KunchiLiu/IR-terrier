	<brief_summary>The hypothesis is that GHRP-3 will exert beneficial effects on endothelial function and insulin resistance in older men and women via hormonal (GH, IGF-I, IGFBP-3,-1, insulin) and non-hormonal actions (anti-inflammatory).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Continuous GHRP-3 Infusion at on GH-IGF-I System, Blood Pressure, Glucose, and Insulin Resistance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At the lower dose of 0.1 µg/kg/h, GHRP-3 presumably will improve endothelial dysfunction, enhance insulin action and lower blood pressure via the anti-inflammatory effects of GHRP-3 while at the higher dose of 0.5 µg/kg/h GHRP-3 these anti-inflammatory effects will be further augmented by the hormonal action of increasing serum IGF-I and its primary serum binding protein insulin like growth hormone binding protein - 3 (IGFBP-3 as well as -1). Also, the more detailed inter-relationships between the actions of GHRP-3, GH and IGF-I on serum glucose, blood pressure, and lipid levels over 24h periods will be determined at the end of the 14 day placebo and two GHRP-3 infusion periods. The GHRP-3 will be administered in escalating doses. The Specific Aims of this study are as follows: 1. To determine the relative effects of 0.1µg/kg/h and 0.5µg/kg/h GHRP-3 as compared to placebo infusion in inducing physiological secretion of the GH-IGF-I system after continuous sc delivery for 14 days in healthy older men and women with insulin resistance. 2. To determine the relative interrelated effects of 0.1 and 0.5µg/kg/h GHRP-3 infusion and placebo on various hormonal and non hormonal aspects of insulin resistance such as blood pressure (BP), plasma glucose and FFA as well as GH, IGF-I, IGFBP-1, -3, insulin and endothelin-1 levels. 3. To determine the relative effects of placebo and the above 2 doses of GHRP-3 infusion on flow mediated dilation (FMD) and nitroglycerin-dependent dilation</detailed_description>
