	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the outcomes of bronchoscopy in Bome Marrow Transplant (BMT) patients who develop lung infiltrates suspicious for infections of the lungs. It will consist of two groups, one group will receive bronchoscopy within thirty six hours of enrollment, while the other group will receive bronchoscopy five days after enrollment. The purpose of this study is to determine the ideal time for bronchoscopy in this group of patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Versus Late Bronchoscopy in Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At this time there exist no studies that help Pulmonologists and Oncologists decide on the best time to perform diagnostic bronchoscopies in Bone Marrow Transplant patients with suspected pulmonary infections. Practice patterns vary from institution to institution and also vary widely within an institution based on the practice preferences of the attending physicians. This study is a prospective randomized trial comparing early ( within 24-36 hours of enrollment) to late ( day 5-6 after enrollment) bronchoscopy in Bone Marrow Transplant patients who develop pulmonary infiltrates or clinical evidence of respiratory infection. If patients in the late arm require earlier bronchoscopy or do not require bronchoscopy on day 5-6 then the care will be dictated by the attending physician. Only bronchoscopies that are clinically indicated will be performed. The aim is to determine the optimal timing for performing bronchoscopy in this group of patients. The primary outcomes will be change of therapy as determined by addition or removal of antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals or steroids etc. as well as the oncologist's opinion on the impact the bronchoscopic results had on care of the patient. Patients will be followed throughout their hospitalization as well as receive a phone call 3 months after hospital discharge. Written consent will be obtained from the patients or health care power of attorney in relevant cases. It is our hope that the results of this study will help better define the role of bronchoscopy in the management of Bone Marrow Transplant patients.</detailed_description>
