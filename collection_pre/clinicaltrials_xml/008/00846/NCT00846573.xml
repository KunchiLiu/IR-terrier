	<brief_title>Hyperpolarized Noble Gas MR Imaging for Pulmonary Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current pulmonary imaging techniques are clinically regulated to machines that produce radiation. MR which does not produce radiation was not possible due to the low concentration of fluids in the open spaces of the lungs. With hyperpolarized noble gases we can now use the safe techniques of MR imaging to view the airways of the lungs, thus limiting human exposure to radiation. This technique has already been proven to be possible in human subjects but there is insufficient data show its efficacy in a clinical setting. This study is designed to image a variety of pulmonary disorders to better find possible clinical uses for hyperpolarized gas MRI.</detailed_description>
