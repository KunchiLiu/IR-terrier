	<brief_title>Effects of H1-Antagonist on Cognition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The neurotransmitter histamine appears to be involved in human cognitive performance. However, the exact role is very unclear. The role it plays in memory performance is highly disputed, as animal studies show decreased performance when the H1-receptor is blocked in the central nervous system while such findings in humans is scarce. To clarify the role of histamine in human memory and different processes in cognition, the effects of an H1-antagonist (dexchlorpheniramine) on memory, alertness and sensory and motor processes are measured. The study will be conducted according to a within subject cross-over design using healthy volunteers.</detailed_description>
