	<brief_title>Effect of Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) Supplement After an Episode of Malaria Falciparum on Weight</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anorexia due to infection might lead to weight loss. In many settings total recovery is problematic what might result in a permanent lower weight. A short period high quality food supplementation could improve weight gain after an infection. Children aged 6-59 months presenting with malaria caused by P. falciparum who are provided with a RUTF supplement (Plumpynut®) of 500 kcal/day for 2 weeks will show significantly better catch up growth compared to a similar patient group not provided with RUTF (at 2 weeks and 4 weeks post-intervention).</detailed_description>
