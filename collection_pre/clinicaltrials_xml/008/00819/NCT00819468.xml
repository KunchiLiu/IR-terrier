	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics of 20 mg Teduglutide in Subjects With Moderately Impaired Hepatic Function Compared to Healthy Subjects With Normal Hepatic Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>24 subjects (equally divided between subjects with normal hepatic function and those with moderate hepatic impairment (defined by the protocol as a Child-Pugh classification of grade B score of 7-9)will be given a single injection of teduglutide (20mg) through subcutaneous injection into the abdomen. Blood samples would be taken within 30 minutes of dose through 24 hours post-dose. Subjects in both groups are matched up by sex, age, BMI, and renal function.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Adult male or female between 18 and 85 years of age BMI of 18 to 40, inclusive Creatinine clearance &gt; 50 mL/min Able to understand and willing to sign an informed consent form (ICF) Willing and able to be confined at the study site for approximately 2.5 days Female subjects who are postmenopausal, surgically sterilized, or women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) using an effective form of birth control during the study WOCBP must have a negative urine Î²hCG result at screening (Days 28 to 2) and checkin (Day 1) Negative urine test for selected drugs of abuse and alcohol at screening and checkin ( Inclusion for Subjects with Impaired Hepatic Function (in addition to above criteria): Documented moderately impaired hepatic function defined by a total score of 7 to 9 on the ChildPugh Classification at screening and checkin No clinically significant change in disease status within the 3 months prior to study entry Abnormal laboratory results that are related to the subject's underlying condition clinically stable as deemed by the investigator Abstained from alcohol use within 90 days prior to study entry when hepatic impairment is known to be secondary to alcohol abuse On medication and/or treatment regimen if, in the opinion of the investigator, the underlying disease is under control Subjects with normal hepatic function will be matched collectively as a group by gender, age, and BMI with the subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function. Subjects with normal hepatic function will also be matched on an individually with the subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function with regard to renal function In addition to inclusion criteria # 1 to 8, subjects with normal hepatic function must also meet the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for participation in this study: Similar level of renal function based on CockroftGault equation as the matched subject with moderately impaired hepatic function Medically healthy with normal or clinically insignificant clinical results at screening and checkin Donated 1 pint or more of blood or blood products within 7 days prior to the study, and/or had a blood or plasma donation within 7 days prior to the study Participated in any other investigational drug trial within 30 days prior to study entry Have a hemoglobin level &lt; 10.0 g/dL at screening (Days 28 to 2) Have any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator or sponsor, would make them unsuitable for the study Subjects with Impaired Hepatic Function (in addition to exclusion criteria 14): Acceptable ChildPugh score (Grade B, score of 7 to 9), which is associated with conditions such as metastatic cancer rather than impaired hepatic function Subjects with Normal Hepatic Function (in addition to exclusion criteria 14 History or presence of clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, neurologic, or psychiatric disease History or evidence of congenital nonhemolytic hyperbilirubinemia History or evidence of gallstone disease or stomach or intestinal surgery, with the exception of appendectomy History or evidence of colorectal cancer History or evidence of malabsorption, pancreatic disease or gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis Taking prescription or overthecounter medication (with the exception of daily low dose aspirin regimen and/or birth control)during the 7 days preceding confinement to the clinical research unit, and/or who anticipate a need to use prescription or overthecounter medication during the study</criteria>
