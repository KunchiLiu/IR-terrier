	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Asia. The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the blood sugar lowering effect of repaglinide plus metformin as initial treatment compared to repaglinide alone in Chinese subjects with type 2 diabetes having an HbA1c (glycosylated haemoglobin A1c) over 8.5 % and who never have taken oral sugar-lowering drugs before. The associated unfavourable events including low blood sugar episodes between the two treatments are also compared.</brief_summary>
