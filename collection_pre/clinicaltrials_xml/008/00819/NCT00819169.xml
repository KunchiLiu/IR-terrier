	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center, 2-part phase 1b/2 study of AMG 655 in combination with AMG 479 to be conducted in the United States and Spain. Part 1 is a dose escalation segment to identify a dose of AMG 655 in combination with AMG 479 that is safe and tolerable. Part 2 will evaluate the safety and estimate the efficacy of AMG 655 at the dose selected in Part 1 in combination with AMG 479 for the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC (non-squamous histology; squamous histology), CRC, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, and sarcoma.</brief_summary>
