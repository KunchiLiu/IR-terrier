	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate if intramuscular PEG-asparaginase administered either at six or two week intervals from day 92 until 8 months from diagnosis for patients with non-HR ALL will result in equal probability of Event Free Survival</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ALL2008 Protocol for Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Intermittent Versus Continuous PEG Asparaginase</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>20% of children with ALL still fails to be cured. The ALL-2008 protocol is a treatment and research protocol that aims to improve the overall outcome of Nordic children and adolescents with ALL in comparison with the ALL-2000 protocol and previous NOPHO protocols. The specific and primary objectives of the randomised study is: To test if intramuscular PEG-asparaginase administered either at six or two week intervals from day 92 until 8 months from diagnosis for patients with non-HR ALL will result in equal probability of EFS. As secondary endpoints asparaginase antibody production and toxicity including allergic reactions in the treatment-arms will be analysed</detailed_description>
