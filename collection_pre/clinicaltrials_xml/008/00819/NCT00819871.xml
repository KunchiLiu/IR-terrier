	<brief_summary>NFKB1 -94ins/del polymorphism has been reported to be associated with reduced promoter activity of NFKB1 and several clinical diseases, but the clinical results cannot always be replicated. Besides, mutate allele is associated with alleviated inflammation in ulcerative colitis and some tumors, but aggravated inflammation in ARDS. The clinical value of this polymorphism remains controversial. This study was performed to investigate the association of NFKB1 -94ins/delATTG polymorphism with lung and/or kidney injury after cardiac surgery with CPB.</brief_summary>
