	<brief_title>Pregabalin in the Prevention of Postoperative Delirium and Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Delirium is a common postoperative complication occurring in up to 73% of patients sometime during their hospital stay. Elderly patients undergoing major surgical procedures are at highest risk. While many risk factors for delirium are known, the specific pathophysiology of postoperative delirium remains unclear and is likely multifactorial. The most common inciting agents and events include metabolic causes, medications, blood loss, hypoxemia and pain. Pain and its management are intimately related to the likelihood of developing postoperative delirium. As a class, gabapentinoids, such as pregabalin, have proven to reduce postoperative pain and narcotic consumption and therefore may have a role to play in the prevention of postoperative delirium.</detailed_description>
