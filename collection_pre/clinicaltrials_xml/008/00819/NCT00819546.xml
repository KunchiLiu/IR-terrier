	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to determine the safety of the combination of RAD001 and PKC412 as a cancer treatment, and to establish the highest dose of RAD001 that can be given in conjunction with PKC412. These drugs have been used in other research trials for individuals with solid and hematology malignancies. Past research on PKC412 shows that it blocks the abnormal functioning of an enzyme called FLT3. FLT3 is found in your cells in either a normal (wild type) or genetically changed form and plays a role in the survival and growth of AML cells. RAD001 is an inhibitor of a central growth pathway that involves the protein MTOR. The MTOR pathway is overactive in cancer cells, causing the cells to grow abnormally. By inhibiting the abnormal growth activity of the MTOR pathway, RAD001 slows down and possibly stops the growth of cancer cells.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- This is a dose-escalation study in which 3 participants will be given a particular starting dose of RAD001 on a certain schedule. If the dose and schedule are well tolerated, then the next 3 participants enrolled will be assigned a new dosing schedule and/or a higher dose of RAD001. This will continue until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached for RAD001. - Each cycle of treatment consists of 28 days on an outpatient basis. Participants will receive RAD001 as the assigned schedule and dosage on day 1 and on days 8 through 28 for the first cycle. For all subsequent cycles RAD001 will be taken once daily. Additionally, all participants will take PKC412 twice a day on days 2 through 28 for the first cycle. For all subsequent cycles PKC412 will be taken twice daily. - During the course of the trial the following evaluations and procedures will be completed at various times: review of medical history; review of concomitant medications; physical exam; performance status; vital signs; EKG; chest x-ray; blood tests and bone marrow aspirate/biopsy.</detailed_description>
