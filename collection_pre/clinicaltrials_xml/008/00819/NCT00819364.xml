	<brief_summary>This is a randomized controlled study to determine whether the BCRI (Behavior－Cognition－Relationship Intervention) model is effective for the autistic children. BCRI model is a eclectic method using behavior modification, structure teaching, relationship-focus approaches according to the symptom severity and main problems at any stage of training for the autistic children. The BCRI Model emphasis the importance that parents understand the principle of training and education and can use them skillfully, appropriately and persistently.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Intervention Program for Children With Autism (BCRI Model)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent years, autism has been found that the outcomes can be much better after early training interventions. The training programs are often categorized as behavior analytic, cognitive or structured teaching, developmental or relationship-focused and so on. Although the approaches focus on different aspect of rehabilitation, they also overlap, playing complementation roles for one another. From our clinical experiences, we find that different children, in their different stages, with different problems, will need different approaches. For example, at early stage behavior modulation method is useful to regulate the child's behaviors. When the child is able to cooperate with adults, structure teaching helps him/her improve cognitive ability. Relationship-focused methods may help the child on social interaction. BCRI model, a comprehensive model, is based on the three kinds of approaches above. All the autistic children will receive examinations before assignment, including history and symptoms collection, diagnostic interview, evaluation(using PEP-3 for autistic children to evaluate intelligence level). DQ is calculated through PEP-3 assessment. (DQ, development quotient, equals to development age in month over chronological age in month). Children will be randomly assigned to one of two interventions arms: BCRI intervention program or standard community care. BCRI intervention program aims to teach the parents to master how to apply correct approaches and strategies and hold the training both at home and/or in training institutes. During the program, doctors deliver the knowledge and skills to the parents, set a complete schedule for the intervention, assess the progress and development for the children and communicate with the parents about any problems and frustration. Parents play an important and direct role in the training and educating procedure. The contrast group receives standard community intervention.</detailed_description>
