	<brief_summary>Triplets of irinotecan, oxaliplatin and infusional 5-fluorouracil(FU)/leucovorin (LV) are associated with high response rates and long survival as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The oral fluoropyrimidine, capecitabine, is better tolerated and shows better response rates than 5-FU/LV in metastatic colorectal cancer. A phase I dose-escalation study established dose limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II doses (RPIID) of irinotecan, oxaliplatin and capecitabine. This phase I /II study is to determine dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), phase II recommended dose (RD) of IXO and bevacizumab combination and safety at the RD in an expanded cohort.</brief_summary>
