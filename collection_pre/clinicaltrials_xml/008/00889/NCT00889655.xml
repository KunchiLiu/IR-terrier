	<brief_summary>Prior to colonoscopies, the colon is cleansed using a laxative. Golytely is approved by the FDA for this purpose. Another laxative, called MiraLax, is approved by the FDA to relieve constipation, but it is not approved specifically for preparation for a colonoscopy. Nonetheless, it is commonly used in clinical practice for this purpose, just as is Golytely. The purpose of this study is to compare Golytely and MiraLax in two ways: to see whether one is better tolerated by patients than the other and to see whether one more effectively cleanses the bowel than the other. The investigators' hypothesis is that these 2 bowel preparation methods are equally effective in bowel cleansing, but that patients prefer Miralax to Golytely.</brief_summary>
