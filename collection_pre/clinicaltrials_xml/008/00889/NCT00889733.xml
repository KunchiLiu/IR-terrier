	<criteria>Histologically proven epithelial ovarian cancer Previously received no more than 4 cycles of neoadjuvant platinum based chemotherapy, followed by debulking surgery ECOG PFS &lt;_ 2 Adequate haematological (absolute neutrophil count &gt;_ 1,500/mm3; platelets &gt;_ 100,000/mm3; hemoglobin &gt;_ 100g/L); renal (&lt;_ upper limit of normal) and hepatic function Age &gt;_ 18 years Written informed consent and the ability of the patient to cooperate with treatment and follow up Contraindication to platinum/Paclitaxel chemotherapy: prior anaphylaxis to Carboplatin/Paclitaxel, unresolved or excessive toxicity from neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients must not have suffered significant bone marrow suppression during prior treatment. The significance of previous treatment delay and/or dose modification is to be determined by the Principle Investigator on a patientbypatient basis. Serious concomitant medical condition, which in the investigators opinion would not make the patient a good candidate for the clinical trial. Patients with a past or concomitant malignancy other than skin cancer (excluding melanoma) Patients known to be serologically positive for Hepatitis B, C or HIV History of congestive heart failure or unstable angina or those who had a myocardial infarction within the past 6 months. Patients who were not expected to tolerate the hemodynamic effects of the fluid administered as part of the IP protocol. Patients who have not received chemotherapy prior to surgery Greater than 6 weeks from time of surgery to commencement of IP chemotherapy Residual disease greater than 1 cm at time of surgery. Patients whom in the surgeon's opinion are candidates for such surgery may be consented preoperatively to allow intraoperative IP catheter insertion. If however the surgeon is not able to reduce the bulk of disease to less than or equal to 1 cm, patients will be removed from the study and an IP catheter SHOULD NOT be placed.</criteria>
