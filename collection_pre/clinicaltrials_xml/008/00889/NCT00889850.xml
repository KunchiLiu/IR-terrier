	<brief_summary>The present study will be conducted in order to compare the bioavailability of 40 mg Esomeprazole Mepha (Mepha Ltd., Switzerland) and of INexium 40 mg MUPS tablets (AstraZeneca, France) under single dose fasted and fed conditions. The study will be conducted as a combined single dose study under fasted and fed conditions in a 2x2-period cross-over design with a wash out phase of at least 6 treatment-free days between administrations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Esomeprazole Bioavailability Study With 40 mg Oral Single Dose Fasted and Fed Administration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The primary objective of the single dose fasted part of the study is to compare the rate and extent of absorption of esomeprazole from 40 mg Esomeprazole Mepha capsules (Test) with 40 mg Esomeprazole INexium MUPS tablets (Reference) after single dose administration under fasted conditions, determined by use of AUC0-tlast and Cmax obtained from esomeprazole plasma concentrations. - The primary objective of the single dose fed in combination with the fasted part of the study is to compare the maximum concentration of esomeprazole determined after 40 mg Esomeprazole Mepha capsules (Test) single dose administration under fed conditions in comparison with 40 mg Esomeprazole INexium MUPS tablets (Reference) after single dose administration under fasted and fed conditions.</detailed_description>
