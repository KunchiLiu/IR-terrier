	<brief_title>Head-Mounted Vibrotactile Prosthesis for Patients With Chronic Postural Instability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This proposal addresses a National Institute on Deafness and Other communication Disorders (NIDCD) research topic that emphasizes the "development of assistive devices for balance disorders". The proposed work will evaluate the assistive efficacy of such a balance prosthesis in a population of chronic imbalance patients spanning a wide range of disease etiologies.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ambulatory patients who have had chronic imbalance for at least one year, and have reached a functional performance plateau with respect to their balance adaptation. Neurological disorders other than chronic balance disorders, as determined by medical history and neurological screening procedure. Any medical condition as determined by the health questionnaire that would interfere with performance on the postural stability evaluation tests. Peripheral neuropathies of the lower extremities. Subjects who are unwilling or unable to adhere to all study requirements, including completion of the training period, evaluation tests, and return to clinic for a followup visit.</criteria>
