	<brief_summary>Total hip arthroplasty is amongst the most painful procedures postoperatively, and pain management can be a challenge. Different measures have been introduced to manage severe postoperative pain in these patients. Previous studies have investigated gabapentin in acute postoperative pain and demonstrated reduced postoperative pain, postoperative morphine consumption, morphine related side effects, and postoperative pain scores. To date, this analgesia adjunct has yet to be investigated for total joint arthroplasty patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Morphine COnsumption in Joint Replacement Patients, With and Without GaBapentin Treatment, a RandomIzed ControlLEd Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was submitted to Health Canada and has received the letter of no objection. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will be conducted. The randomization scheme will be prepared and done by the pharmacy department at McMaster University. Ninety patients undergoing primary hip arthroplasty will be recruited from the preoperative clinic. Forty-five patients in each population will be allocated to a gabapentin group and the other forty-five patients will be allocated to a placebo group.</detailed_description>
