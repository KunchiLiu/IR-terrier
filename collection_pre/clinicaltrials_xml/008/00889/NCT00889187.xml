	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to determine if it is possible to deliver high dose radiation in one week while also giving the drug capecitabine for the treatment of pancreatic cancer prior to surgery, to determine if this treatment can be given safely for the treatment of pancreatic cancer prior to surgery and, to determine if this treatment can improve the local control pancreatic cancer prior to surgery compared to historical controls of standard treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Accelerated Short Course Radiation Therapy With Photons and Capecitabine for Resectable Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Since we are looking for the best schedule and dose of radiation that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants with pancreatic cancer, not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose of radiation therapy. The dose participants will get will depend upon the number of participants enrolled in the study and how well they have tolerated their doses. - Radiation treatment days will begin on a weekday and continue for a total of 7 to 12 days. Capecitabine pills will begin on the morning of the first day of radiation and be taken twice a day for 10 consecutive weekdays, while the participant is receiving radiation. - Blood tests, vital signs and a physical exam will be performed on day 1 and day 15 and either days 7, 8, or 9. - Surgery will be performed 1 to 3 weeks after completion of radiation and capecitabine.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Cytologic or histologic proof of pancreatic ductal carcinoma is required prior to treatment. No evidence of metastatic disease as determined by chest CT scan, abdominal CT scan (or MRI with gadolinium and/or manganese), and all patients must be staged with a physical exam, chest CT, and abdominal CT with intravenous contrast. Only potentially resectable patients are eligible. Potentially resectable is defined as: a)no extrapancreatic disease, b)no evidence (on CT) of involvement of the celiac axis or superior mesenteric artery, and c)no evidence (on CT or MRI) of occlusion of the superior mesenteric vein or superior mesentericportal venous confluence. 18 years of age or older ECOG Performance status of 0 or 1 Women of child bearing potential must practice adequate contraception and to refrain from breast feeding. Female patients must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days of treatment Lab values as specified in the protocol Patients cannot have hepatic or peritoneal metastases detected by imaging or laparoscopy prior to chemoradiation Serious concomitant systemic disorders incompatible with the study, such as significant cardiac or pulmonary morbidity, or ongoing infection as manifested by fever Pregnant or lactating women Life expectancy &lt; 3 months Serious, uncontrolled, concurrent infection(s) Any prior chemotherapy or radiation for treatment of the patient's pancreatic tumor Treatment for other cancers within the last five years, except cured nonmelanoma skin cancer and treated in situ cervical cancer Clinically significant cardiac disease or myocardial infarction within the last 12 months Other serious uncontrolled medical conditions that the investigator feels might compromise study participation Lack of physical integrity of the upper gastrointestinal tract or malabsorption syndrome Known, existing uncontrolled coagulopathy Unwillingness to participate or inability to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study Any prior fluoropyrimidine therapy (unless given in an adjuvant setting and completed at least 6 months earlier) Prior unanticipated severe reaction to fluoropyrimidine therapy, or known hypersensitivity to 5fluorouracil or known DPD deficiency Participation in any investigational drug study within 4 weeks preceding the start of study treatment History of uncontrolled seizures, central nervous system disorders or psychiatric disability judged by the investigator to be clinically significant, precluding informed consent, or interfering with compliance or oral drug intake Major surgery, excluding laparoscopy, within 4 weeks of the start of study treatment, without complete recovery Patients should not be on cimetidine as it can decrease the clearance of 5FU. Another H2blocker or proton pump inhibitor may be substituted before study entry</criteria>
