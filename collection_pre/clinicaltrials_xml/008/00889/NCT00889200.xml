	<brief_summary>This study was designed to use a sensitive neuroendocrine probe, the Dexamethasone/Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (DEX/CRH) test, in a sample of healthy adults with insomnia. The primary aim was to assess cortisol reactivity before and after long-term (6 weeks) administration of eszopiclone. It was hypothesized that treatment with eszopiclone would result in a significant reduction in plasma cortisol response to the DEX/CRH test following treatment of insomnia with standard dose of eszopiclone.</brief_summary>
