	<brief_title>The Role of High Resolution-Computed Tomography (CT) in Tuberculosis (TB) Outbreak Investigation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Outbreak investigation including tuberculin skin test (TST), QuantiFERONÂ® TB Gold In-Tube (QFT), and simple chest radiography (CXR) will be performed. For participants with any abnormal findings in these tests, HRCT will be carried out. Active pulmonary TB is diagnosed based on sputum studies or HRCT findings. In addition, participants with positive results both in TST and QTF will be treated as having a latent TB infection (LTBI). TST and QTF were repeated in participants with positive result in one of these tests. CXR will be repeated in all participants at 3 and 6 months of follow-up.</detailed_description>
