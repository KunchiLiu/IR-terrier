	<brief_summary>People who eat more dietary fiber have a lower body weight than people who eat less fiber. Potential mechanisms include greater feelings of satiety, reductions in food intake, changes in blood glucose, insulin, or gut hormones. The investigators hypothesize that increasing doses of mixed fiber will influence satiety response, food intake, glucose, insulin, ghrelin, GLP-1, and PYY 3-36, in a dose-dependent manner, when given to subjects in muffins for breakfast.</brief_summary>
