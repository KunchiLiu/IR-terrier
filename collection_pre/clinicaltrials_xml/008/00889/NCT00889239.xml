	<brief_summary>The objectives of this study are to characterize the clinical performance and wear mechanisms of all-ceramic posterior crowns. The wear rate of all-ceramic crowns and opposing enamel in selected patients will be quantified. The relationship of each subject's maximum clenching force and wear rate will also be analyzed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Performance and Wear Mechanism of Hot-Pressed Ceramic Crowns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High strength ceramics have been used in dentistry for constructing fixed partial denture. Their advantages are their acceptable fracture resistance, excellent biocompatibility, moderate opacity, etc. Because the increase in demand for more esthetic restoration, various ceramic materials have been used as a core material for several all-ceramic systems. Their properties have been investigated extensively in many in vitro studies. Currently, there are not much results regarding clinical performance and wear mechanism of ceramic-based prosthesis and more information are required for future research.</detailed_description>
