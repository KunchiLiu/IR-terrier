	<brief_summary>Shoulder dislocations are common and may result in functionally disabling instability. Disruption of the shoulder capsuloligamentous complex during shoulder dislocation is related to poor proprioceptive and stabilizing capabilities of the joint. It has been demonstrated that surgical restoration of the normal glenohumeral capsular tensioning improves the proprioceptive capability of the shoulder and plays an important roll in restoring shoulder stability. Several studies compared the proprioceptive capabilities of the shoulder between different surgical procedures, however only few have used the "dynamic unrestricted 3-dimensional arm movement model" that has been shown to be more appropriate for assessment of glenohumeral proprioception. To our knowledge, no previous study has compared proprioception measures of the glenohumeral joint following arthroscopic versus open repair for anterior shoulder instability, using the 3-dimensional unrestricted arm movement model.</brief_summary>
