	<brief_summary>This is a single center, open label forced dose titration study designed to determine the tolerability of curcumin in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study will provide initial tolerability and safety data in pediatric patients with IBD. Twenty patients with IBD in remission or with mild disease (score &lt;34 on PUCAI or score &lt;30 on the PCDAI) on sulfasalazine or mesalamine aged 8 to 18 years will be enrolled into this study. Each patient will participate in the study for nine weeks. From this study an appropriate dosage will be determined to proceed with a double blinded placebo controlled study.</brief_summary>
