	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to develop a new protocol using two different types of fertility drugs that is more similar to the way the hormones act in a normal menstrual cycle (period). We are recruiting women who are trying to get pregnant through In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) who either have a high prolactin level (a hormone normally found in your blood that is produced in the brain) or have a condition known as hypothalamic amenorrhea in which one does not get regular periods due to low hormone levels. The ovaries can be stimulated with Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) alone and with FSH and Luteinizing Hormone (LH). FSH causes eggs to be made while LH causes estrogen (hormone) production. The women in this study have low hormone levels and need both FSH and LH. LuverisÂ® (LH hormone) is a new drug approved for egg production and is used in IVF. There is no set amount of LH nor a set protocol for LH use. Therefore, we are testing this new regimen. One group of women will receive a fixed dose of LH throughout their cycle while the other will decrease the dose of FSH while at the same time increasing the LH dose which is what happens in the natural menstrual cycle.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. 30 women under 38 years old at time of signing Informed Consent Form. 2. Evidence of hypothalamic amenorrhea (irregular menses and FSH and LH &lt;5 mIU/mL), uncorrected hyperprolactinemia (prolactin levels 10% above the upper limit of normal) or iatrogenic hypothalamic hypogonadism secondary to GnRHa suppression. 3. In good general health off of current medications which may confound response to study medications except GnRHa (Lupron Depot). 4. Desire to seek pregnancy actively during the study period. 5. A normal uterine cavity must have been confirmed by either hysteroscopy or hydrosonogram within two years of entering the study. 6. A semen analysis on the male partner deemed adequate for IVF by the attending physician within the past year or donor sperm available for insemination. 7. Only one treatment cycle per patient will be studied. 1. uncorrected thyroid disease. 2. heart disease (New York Heart Association Class II or higher). 3. a history of, or suspected cervical, endometrial, or breast cancer. A normal Pap smear result within the last 24 months will be required. 4. enrolled into other studies that require medications, limit sex, or otherwise prevent compliance with the protocol at the same time. 5. to take other medications known to affect reproduction.</criteria>
