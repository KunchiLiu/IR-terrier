	<brief_summary>Multi-organ failure due to sepsis is a major cause of death in critically ill patients. But the mechanisms leading to this condition are not fully understood. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown in skeletal muscle of critically ill septic patients. Liver is very important in sepsis as it is responsible of the synthesis of several inflammatory proteins. Moreover hepatic failure is associated to a bad outcome. The aim of this study is to evaluate the hepatic mitochondrial function in sepsis.</brief_summary>
