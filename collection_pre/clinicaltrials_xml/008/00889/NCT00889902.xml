	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to: 1. make p16INK4A as a cervical cancer screening of tumor markers, cytology improve existing diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, repeatability and validity, so as to effectively prompted the early discovery and diagnosis of cervical cancer. 2. reduce screening costs, screening and benefits into quantitative evaluation, for our country to develop cervical cancer prevention and control strategy to provide a reliable theoretical basis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Molecular Markers in Cervical Cancer Screening in the Feasibility of the Mathematical Markov Model Analysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. To carry out large-scale prospective randomized controlled clinical study to evaluate the "cytological molecular markers Detect + P16INK4A" methods of screening accuracy and reliability, as well as the screening method of the biological effects. 2. Markov set up mathematical model of screening tests to quantify the inputs and the evaluation proceeds. With a view to optimize and perfect a simple, convenient, practical and efficient program of cervical cancer screening.</detailed_description>
