	<brief_summary>Diabetes is a leading cause of death in the Western World with medical costs increasing annually. There is no cure for diabetes, and blood glucose monitoring is a key component in diabetes treatment and management. Self-monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential to the self-management of diabetes and has become widespread over the past decade. Blood glucose determinations are currently done by invasive methods (finger tip pricking), followed by measuring the blood drop characteristics. The purpose of this trail is to demonstrate the performance and use of GlucoTrack device in measuring blood glucose levels. The rationale for development of the device is to improve the patient's quality of life by providing a device that is easily used and provides a painless measurement method, thereby leading to higher compliance, and to better managed diabetes</brief_summary>
