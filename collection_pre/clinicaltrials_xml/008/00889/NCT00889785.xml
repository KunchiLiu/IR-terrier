	<brief_summary>The proposed research will test a new comprehensive disease management intervention with adolescents who have type 2 diabetes using a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Adolescents subjects with a history of Type 2 Diabetes and a parent caregiver will be consented, enrolled, and randomly assigned to either an 6-month intervention (N=44) or a "usual care" comparison (N=44). Recruitment will take place within the Vanderbilt Eskind Pediatric Diabetes Clinic. The intervention will include participation in a comprehensive disease management program that includes: (1) application of treatment algorithms, (2) phone assessment from a diabetes nurse practitioner and dietician to assess barriers and promote problem solving, treatment adherence and management, and (3) a behavioral Internet-administered self-management problem solving component. Outcomes include self-reported self-management behaviors (exercise, diet, medication adherence, etc.), blood pressure, weight/BMI, and glycated hemoglobin (A1C).</brief_summary>
