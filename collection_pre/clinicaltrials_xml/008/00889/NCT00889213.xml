	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to determine whether the use of an autologous falciform ligament patch combined with fibrin glue will reduce the rate of pancreatic fistula in patients completing distal pancreatectomy. The hypothesis for the current trial is: Autologous falciform patch closure with fibrin glue will result in a 50% decrease in fistula formation postoperatively. The primary end point will be the development of pancreatic fistula using the ISGPF definition of pancreatic fistula1. (Drain output of any measurable volume of fluid on or after postop day #3 with an amylase content greater than three times serum amylase). Secondary end points will include length of postoperative hospital stay, percutaneous intervention rates, re-operation rates, morbidity to include delayed gastric emptying, wound infection, intraabdominal abscess, postoperative hemorrhage and 30-day mortality.(Bassi C, Dervenis C, Butturini G, et al. Postoperative pancreatic fistula: An international study group (ISGPF) definition. The Journal of Surgery, 2005;138:8-13).</brief_summary>
