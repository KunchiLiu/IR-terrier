	<brief_title>Effects of Propranolol on the Encoding and Retrieval of Emotional Material After Single Dose Administration in Healthy Young Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective of the present study is to combine two lines of research investigating the interaction between emotional processing and memory performance and its modulation by beta-blockade. As has been suggested by aforementioned lesion, pharmacological and neuroimaging evidence, emotional stimuli are better remembered because they are better encoded. In the ERP literature, there are a number of studies on emotion and memory, but few of them have investigated the modulatory effects of emotion on memory, focusing on either during stages of encoding (Palomba, Angrilli &amp; Mini, 1997; Dolcos &amp; Cabeza, 2002) or during memory retrieval of emotional and neutral material (Maratos &amp; Rugg, 2001; Windmann &amp; Kutas, 2001). It is assumed that emotionally arousing information gains privileged access to processing resources. This means that emotional arousing stimuli guide attention for more elaborated processing, leading to better memory formation. Concerning pharmacological manipulations with ß-blockers, there is no existing ERP study that shows the effect of ß-blockade on encoding processes and memory retrieval of emotional pictures. Therefore, the current investigation was designed to test whether recall and recognition of emotional pictures can be reduced by administration of propranolol and whether this reduction in memory performance is correlated with changes in event-related potentials or peripheral physiological parameters (heart rate variability, heart rate, blood pressure and electrodermal response). As a surrogate for sympathetic activity and/or activation by noradrenaline, a salivary sample to measure activity of the alpha-amylase will be employed (van Stegeren, Rohleder, Everaerd &amp; Wolf, 2006) In conclusion, we hypothesize (1) a memory advantage for emotionally arousing stimuli but not for emotionally neutral pictures. (2) ERP components associated with emotional effects and memory effects are pronounced for emotional stimuli. (3) Peripheral physiological parameters should also be pronounced for emotionally arousing stimuli. (4) Emotional processing and emotional memory will be impaired by the beta-blocker propranolol as indicated by behavioral data and psycho-physiological parameters.</detailed_description>
