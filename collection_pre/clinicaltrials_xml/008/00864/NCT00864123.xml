	<brief_summary>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has proven efficacy for treatment of pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Yet, CBT does not help all children and those who benefit often remain symptomatic upon treatment completion. Recent clinical trials in adults with other anxiety disorders (acrophobia and social phobia) provided support for using a medication called D-Cycloserine (DCS) to enahnce the outcome of exposure-based psychotherapy. Given this, DCS may augment CBT in youth with OCD, an anxiety disorder that is conceptually similar to acrophobia. With this in mind, the investigators are conducting a randomized, double-blind placebo controlled pilot study of DCS to determine whether it had any short-term clinical benefits on CBT in youth with OCD. Forty children and adolescents (ages 8-17) with a primary diagnosis of OCD will be screened and, should they meet relevant criteria, randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions: (1) CBT plus DCS, or (2) CBT plus placebo. All patients will receive 10 sessions of CBT A rater will assess participants at 3 separate time points.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>D-Cycloserine Augmentation of Therapy for Pediatric Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has proven efficacy for treatment of pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Yet, CBT does not help all children and those who benefit often remain symptomatic upon treatment completion. The behavioral theory that underlies CBT is based on two components, namely fear conditioning and extinction. On a neural level, CBT incorporates similar mechanisms to those involved in fear conditioning. Antagonists at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamatergic receptor, which is involved in learning and memory, block both fear learning and extinction. Evidence suggests that D-Cycloserine (DCS), a partial agonist at the NMDA glutamate receptor, augments associative learning and extinction as a form of learning in animals and humans. Recent clinical trials in adults with other anxiety disorders (acrophobia and social phobia) provided support for DCS dosing as facilitating associative learning that occurs during exposure-based psychotherapy. Given that CBT is based on the principles of extinction, DCS may augment CBT in youth with OCD, an anxiety disorder that is conceptually similar to acrophobia. With this in mind, I propose to undertake a randomized, double-blind placebo controlled pilot study of DCS to determine whether it had any short-term clinical benefits on CBT in youth with OCD. Forty children and adolescents (ages 8-17) with a primary diagnosis of OCD will be screened and, should they meet relevant criteria, randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions: (1) CBT plus DCS (25 or 50mg depending on weight), or (2) CBT plus placebo. All patients will receive 10 sessions of CBT based on the protocol used in POTS (2004). Participants will take DCS or placebo 1 hour prior to each therapy session. A blinded, independent evaluator will assess participants at 3 separate time points. Two of the assessments (Baseline, Post-treatment) will be comprehensive in nature (e.g., diagnostic interview, self-reports, CY-BOCS, laboratory tests), whereas one midpoint assessment will involve administration of CY-BOCS, CGI, CGI-S, and Adverse Symptom Checklist only. Results from this study may have powerful clinical implications by providing preliminary support for pharmalogical agents that enhance the effectiveness of standard E/RP. Such agents may have utility in improving outcome, reducing premature therapy termination, and targeting patients who have been treatment refractory.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The child must receive a principal diagnosis of OCD at Baseline, based on DSMIV criteria. This diagnosis will be derived from the Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule for DSMIVChild Interview Schedule Parent version (ADISIVP), and must reflect a clinical severity rating of 4 or above CYBOCS Total Score ≥ 16 Be between the ages of 8 and 17 years Score ≥ 80 on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test3rd Edition (Dunn &amp; Dunn, 1997) At least one parent available to accompany the child to all sessions; English speaking. Psychosis, pervasive developmental disorder, bipolar disorder, or current suicidal intent measured by the ADISIVP and all available clinical information Principal diagnosis other than OCD Youth with mental rituals, incompleteness, or hoarding symptoms as E/RP exercises would be more difficult to conduct/monitor than those with overt rituals Unavailability of at least one caregiver to participate in the treatment Refusal of parent to accept random assignment to treatment condition A positive diagnosis in the caregiver of mental retardation, psychosis, clinically significant tics, or other psychiatric disorders or conditions that would limit their ability to understand E/RP (based on clinical interview) Weight less than 25.0 kg or greater than 80.0kg Epilepsy, renal insufficiency, and current or past history of alcohol abuse (DCS is contraindicated for such conditions) Pregnant or having unprotected sex [in females] as the effects of DCS on pregnant youth are unknown General poor physical health as determined by medical physical and laboratory tests.</criteria>
