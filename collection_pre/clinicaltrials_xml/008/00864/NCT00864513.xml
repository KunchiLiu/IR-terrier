	<brief_summary>This study is for patients with pancreatic cancer that has grown and/or spread after having previously received the standard chemotherapy drug called gemcitabine. In this study a drug called pemetrexed is being tested. This drug is approved by the FDA for use in lung cancer and mesothelioma. The purpose of this study is to see if pemetrexed keeps pancreas cancer that has grown and/or spread after gemcitabine from growing. Subjects will receive pemetrexed IV once every 21 days until disease progression or unacceptable side effects occur.</brief_summary>
