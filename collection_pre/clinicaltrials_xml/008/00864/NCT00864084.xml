	<brief_title>Does Pulmonary Rehabilitation Improve Balance in People With Respiratory Disease?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Falls and chronic respiratory are two major health concerns affecting morbidity and mortality in older adults. Several factors that predispose falls, such as reduced balance, have been documented in people with respiratory disease. Pulmonary rehabilitation programs, which involve customized exercise prescription, are recommended to improve quality of life and disease management in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There are many documented benefits to participation in such programs; however, the impact on balance and other falls risk factors has not previously been investigated. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a pulmonary rehabilitation program on balance and falls risk factors in individuals with respiratory disease. This study will enhance the current management of respiratory disease by improving our understanding of the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation.</detailed_description>
