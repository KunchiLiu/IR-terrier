	<brief_summary>The present study is a retrospective cohort study on patients who suffered a nosocomial infection in major hospitals in Vietnam. Data relating to patient demography include age, gender; medical history; APACHE II score; background conditions, infection details and antimicrobial therapy; and all-caused mortality, time of hospitalization and intensive care. The investigators hypothesis is that antimicrobial treatment inappropriate is highly dependent on incidence of antibiotic resistant pathogens, nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli and ESBL-producing enterobacteriaceae spp. Variables are demographic characteristics, background conditions, immunosuppressive therapy, antimicrobial susceptibility and inappropriate treatment is explored as possible predictors of mortality.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient was diagnosed as nosocomial infection defined according to criteria established by the US CDC. The diagnosis criteria for ventilatorassociated pneumonia are modified from those established by the American College of Chest Physicians. Patient received empiric antimicrobial therapy within 24 hour from onset of infection and had antimicrobial susceptibility. A patient was in part of a controlled clinical trial for the current infection episode. Patients with suspected infections by virus or fungus or tuberculosis will be excluded.</criteria>
