	<brief_summary>Primary objectives of the study are: To assess the differences in survival of the two treatment options in both stage III (A and B) nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Study A) and Stage IIIB (wet) and stage IV NSCLC (Study B), respectively Secondary objectives are: To assess the differences in toxicity of two treatment options in both stage III (A and B) NSCLC (Study A) and Stage IIIB (wet) and stage IV NSCLC (Study B), and To assess the differences in Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) of two treatment options in both Study A and Study B</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To compare survival rates (median and 1-year), and toxicity of two treatment regimens in patients with locally advanced incurable NSCLC (study A), to compare survival rates (median and 1-year) of two treatment regimens in patients with locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC (study B) To compare HRQoL and cost effectiveness of two treatment regimens in patients with locally advanced incurable NSCLC (study A), and in patients with locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC (study B) and to evaluate the effect of HRQoL assessment on QoL dimensions</detailed_description>
