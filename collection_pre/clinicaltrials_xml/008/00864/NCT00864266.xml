	<brief_summary>The primary aim of the study is to identify a predictive molecular signature for response to chemotherapy, according to WHO criteria, in patients with non-small cell lung cancer by studying the transcriptome (miRNAs and mRNAs) and the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) by using high throughput techniques.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histological diagnosis of nonsmallcell lung cancer (NSCLC) Obtention of a biopsy of the tumour according to the procedure defined in the protocol NSCLC of any stage to be treated by standard conventional firstline chemotherapy, as defined in the ELCWP guidelines (www.elcwp.org) Presence of at least one assessable lesion Availability for participating in the detailed followup of the protocol Signed informed consent. Age above 18 years Patient who was previously treated with chemotherapy for NSCLC or who has any contraindication precluding the administration of conventional chemotherapy for NSCLC NSCLC treated by exclusive surgery or radiotherapy A history of prior malignant tumour, except nonmelanoma skin cancer or in situ carcinoma of the cervix or of the bladder or cured malignant tumour (more than 5year disease free interval)</criteria>
