	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study is to quantify eyelid position changes in tested and opposite eyes in ptosis patients submitted to 1, 2 or 4 drops of 10% phenylephrine in one eye. The secondary objective is to correlate the eye dominance, severity and laterality of ptosis with eyelid position changes in these 3 groups.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a prospective observational study conducted in involutional ptosis patients, which will be submitted to instillation of a single drop of 10% phenylephrine in one eye(Group 1), 2 drops (G2) or 4 drops ( G3). Video camera will record the images of both eyes before and after drug application at 3, 10, 15 and 30 minutes. The images will be edited to analyze upper and lower lid height.</detailed_description>
