	<brief_summary>The pathophysiology of central serous chorioretinopathy remains controversial. traditional treatment is laser photocoagulation or photodynamic therapy.Recently Bevacizumab (Avastin, Genetech),an antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),has known antipermeability properties and therefore may theoretically reverse the changes seen in central serous chorioretinopathy. The aim of this study is To investigate concentrations of growth factors and inflammatory cytokines and to report the effect of therapy with bevacizumab in eyes with central serous chorioretinopathy</brief_summary>
