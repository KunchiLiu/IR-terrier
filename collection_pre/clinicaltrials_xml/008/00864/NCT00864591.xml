	<brief_summary>This study is designed to determine the diagnostic value of adenosine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) when compared with SPECT. The investigators hypothesized that adenosine CMR could detect ischemia and is not inferior to SPECT imaging. In addition stress adenosine cardiac MRI offers a "one stop shop" enabling evaluation of cardiac function, rest and stress perfusion and viability.</brief_summary>
