	<brief_title>Allopurinol in Schizophrenia: A Randomized Trial Administering Allopurinol vs Placebo as add-on Antipsychotics in Patients With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An emerging body of evidence supports a purinergic hypothesis for schizophrenia. Adenosine agonists have been shown to have properties similar to those of dopamine antagonists and there is a well characterized antagonistic interaction between adenosine and dopamine receptors in the ventral striatum1. Increased adenosinergic transmission has been demonstrated to reduce the affinity of dopamine agonists for dopamine receptors. It has been theorized that adenosine may exert some of its antipsychotic effects through modulation of glutamatergic transmission. Three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials have showed statistically significant greater improvements in PANSS scores in the allopurinol groups vs. placebo groups. These empiric data, together with the theoretical and basic science background cited, provide the impetus for this proposed study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or female, 1865 years of age, inclusive 2. Because gout is relatively rare in women of childbearing age, there are few reports describing the use of allopurinol during pregnancy; in those there were no adverse fetal outcomes attributable to allopurinol. Therefore, only females who are abstinent or practicing an established method of birth control (oral contraceptive tablets, hormonal implant device, hormone patch, injectable contraceptive, intrauterine device [IUD]) can be included in the trial. 3. Willing and able to provide informed consent, after the nature of the study has been fully explained 4. Current DSMIVTR diagnosis of schizophrenia as confirmed by SCID 5. Symptoms: 4 (moderate) or above on CGIS AND &gt;= 4 (moderate) score on two of the following four PANSS items: delusions, hallucinatory behaviors, conceptual disorganization or suspiciousness/ persecution. 6. Must be on any antipsychotic drug for at least 2 weeks prior to the baseline visit, at doses within the PORT criteria. Patients receiving higher doses will have their records reviewed to insure that dose is required. Patients receiving two antipsychotics, or IM depot antipsychotics can also be included. 7. Inpatients or outpatients. 1. Unwilling or unable, in the opinion of the Investigator, to comply with study instructions 2. Pregnant or breastfeeding 3. Unstable medical disease (malignancy, poorly controlled diabetes, active ischemic cardiac disease, or cardiomyopathy, serious pulmonary disease, , kidney disease, impaired liver functioning 4. Likely allergy or sensitivity to allopurinol 5. At significant risk of committing suicide, or in the opinion of the Investigator, currently is at imminent risk of suicide or harming others. 6. Suffers from a significant Substance Dependence disorder based on DSMIV criteria within the 3 months prior to Screening, or is deemed by the Investigator to have a high risk of substance use during the study. Patients with a history of recreational use of cannabinoids or alcohol, and/or patients who smoke cigarettes can be included. 7. Concurrent delirium, mental retardation, druginduced psychosis, or history of brain trauma.</criteria>
