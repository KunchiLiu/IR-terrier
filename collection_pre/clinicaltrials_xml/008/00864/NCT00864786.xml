	<criteria>Healthy male subjects between the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive (Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed medical history, full physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse rate measurement, 12lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests). Body Mass Index (BMI) of approximately 18 to 30 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs). A BMI lower limit of 17.5 kg/m2 may be rounded up to 18.0 kg/m2; a BMI upper limit of 30.5 kg/m2 may be rounded down to 30.0 kg/m2 and will be acceptable for inclusion. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or allergic (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at time of dosing) disease or clinical findings at screening. Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy).</criteria>
