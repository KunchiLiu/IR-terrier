	<brief_summary>The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is generally well-accepted by patients, but a subgroup experiences increased anxiety and poor quality of life. A web-based behavioral intervention may comprise a novel approach to reduce anxiety and enhance well-being in ICD patients, which may be equally effective and have advantages over more traditional forms of therapy, due to its low-threshold accessibility via the internet. The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients receiving a behavioral intervention via the internet experience less anxiety and device concerns and improved quality of life compared to patients receiving usual care.</brief_summary>
