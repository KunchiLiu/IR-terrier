	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that the rate of perineal lacerations in nulliparous women will be reduced by a simple change in common obstetrical delivery practice, i.e., bed delivery versus conventional delivery in obstetrical stirrups.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial of Bed Versus Stirrups Delivery in Nulliparous Women for Prevention of Perineal Lacerations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized controlled trial of bed delivery in the supine position versus conventional delivery in obstetrical stirrups. It will include nulliparous women presenting in active labor to the L&amp;D East (low risk) Unit at Parkland Hospital, &gt; 370/7 weeks gestation, with singleton fetuses in cephalic presentation. The primary outcome variable is any perineal laceration. Secondary outcomes measures include (1) 3rd or 4th degree lacerations and (2) any lacerations in subgroup comparisons between study arms.</detailed_description>
