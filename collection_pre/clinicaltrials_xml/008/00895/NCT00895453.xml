	<brief_title>Monthly Itraconazole Versus Classic Homeopathy for Treatment of Recurrent Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (RVVC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: Antimycotics effectively treat sporadic and recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC). Classic homeopathy (CH) is also used to treat this condition. We compared the efficacy of CH and itraconazole in reducing the frequency of RVVC episodes. Design: Single-centre, prospective, randomized. Sample: One-hundred-and-fifty patients with a history of RVVC and an acute episode of VVC. Methods: Women were randomised into 3 groups: itraconazole with lactobacilli (group 1), itraconazole without lactobacilli (group 2) and CH (group 3). Itraconazole treatment of acute infection was followed by a 6-months maintenance regimen with monthly single-day itraconazole (200 mg bid). Thereafter, patients were followed without treatment for 6 months. Women in group 1 were given additional vaginal lactobacilli for six days per month. CH treatment was performed for 12 months.</detailed_description>
