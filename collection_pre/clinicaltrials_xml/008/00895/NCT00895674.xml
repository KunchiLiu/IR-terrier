	<brief_summary>Renal cell carcinoma accounts for roughly 3 % of all cancer. It is a rather aggressive cancer type, which means that patients who present with an advanced disease have a rather poor prognosis. When this study has been started the standard therapy for patients has been cytokines, which might be accompanied by significant toxicities or might fail the therapeutic goal. In these cases sorafenib can be a feasible therapeutic option. This non-interventional study has been created and is being conducted to collect clinical data on the patients' therapy with sorafenib in an everyday treatment schedule. The main goal of this study focuses on patient characteristics and tumor status in RCC treated with sorafenib as well as the treatment duration and safety of sorafenib under everyday treatment conditions.</brief_summary>
