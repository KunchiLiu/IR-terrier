	<brief_summary>This study examines the relationship between the SCOUT DM device and coronary artery calcification as determined by rapid computed tomography in patients at risk for coronary heart disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Skin Fluorescence to Coronary Artery Calcification</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a cross-sectional, single site, cohort screening trial. The correlation between the measured skin fluorescence and the CACS will be determined using a design that includes stratification by gender, subject age and subject CAC score. This design requires a single patient visit to the clinical site and a single measurement on the SCOUT device.</detailed_description>
