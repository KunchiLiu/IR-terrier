	<brief_summary>Patients with depression and pain have poorer outcomes in response to depression treatments than depressed patients without pain. While psychotherapy treatment studies have demonstrated improvement in pain and depression, no psychosocial interventions have been developed and tested prospectively specifically for patients with both conditions. Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), an effective treatment for depression, has been adapted successfully for physically ill patients and demonstrates good adherence, treatment satisfaction, and depression outcomes. The investigators propose to test a modified form of IPT-P for depressed patients with co-morbid pain.</brief_summary>
