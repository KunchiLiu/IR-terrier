	<brief_summary>Traditionally, the physiotherapy management of people with dysfunctional breathing or hyperventilation syndrome is breathing re-training. There is increasing clinical evidence that structural and functional changes develop in the muscles and connective tissues of the chest wall, abdomen and back when the upper chest accessory pattern of breathing is used over time. When treatment includes breathing techniques only it is difficult for a person with chronic hyperventilation, who has developed muscle and connective tissue changes, to revert to using the normal lower chest diaphragmatic breathing pattern. In clinical practice when the problems which have developed in the musculoskeletal system are addressed, the patient reverts more quickly to the lower chest pattern of breathing but there is as yet little evidence to support this clinical finding.</brief_summary>
