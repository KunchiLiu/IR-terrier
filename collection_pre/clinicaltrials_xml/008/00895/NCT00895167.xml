	<brief_summary>Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) serves as a protective gene. Induction of HO-1 has therapeutic potential for several indications. The inducibility of HO-1 by curcumin will be evaluated in this pilot study. Furthermore, the influence of a modulating factor of HO-1 gene activity on the dinucleotide guanosine thymine repeat (GT) length polymorphism in the promotor region will be investigated.</brief_summary>
