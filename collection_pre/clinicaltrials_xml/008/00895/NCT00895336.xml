	<brief_summary>Abstract: Current evidence suggests that the enteric flora is the primary trigger for chronic mucosal inflammation in the Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). Studies using probiotic administration to modify the flora for either induction or maintenance of remission in IBD have had mixed results. Whether probiotics may exert an anti-inflammatory effect in IBD is not known. The investigators hypothesize that daily administration of a probiotic, Lactobacillus GG, for four weeks will reduce objective markers of mucosal inflammation in pediatric UC patients. The investigators will enroll 20 UC patients in remission or with mild disease activity. These patients will have a one month period of observation without intervention. They will then receive Lactobacillus GG (Culturelle), 1010 CFU by mouth twice a day for four weeks (28 days). At baseline and Day 28, and at day 56 clinical disease activity will be measured using the Pediatric UC Activity Index (PUCAI), a blood sample for determination of circulating granulocyte pSTAT3+ activation will be obtained, and a stool sample for determination of fecal calprotectin will be obtained. In addition, =the investigators will sample subject saliva to determine salivary glycan phenotype as a surrogate marker of changes of mucosal glycan expression in response to probiotic administration. The investigators anticipate that both circulating granulocyte pSTAT3+ activation and fecal calprotectin, as established biomarkers of colonic inflammation, will be reduced in subjects who receive Lactobacillus GG. Completion of the proposed studies will determine whether Lactobacillus GG reduces mucosal inflammation in pediatric UC, and will provide information to design a larger randomized trial. The investigators' study design is novel in that it is the first probiotic study in children with UC and it will measure outcomes utilizing the biomarkers fecal calprotectin and pSTAT3+ circulating granulocytes.</brief_summary>
