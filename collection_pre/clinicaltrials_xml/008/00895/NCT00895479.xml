	<brief_summary>Patients in renal failure on hemodialysis depend on adequate and sustained vascular access. This can be achieved by surgical placement of a synthetic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft. These patients frequently experience graft complications arising from the development of smooth muscle cell (SMC) neointimal hyperplasia in the proximity of the graft-vein anastomosis. Such complications eventually lead to stenosis, access thrombosis and graft failure. Trinam速 is being developed to prolong graft survival. It is a combination product consisting of a replication deficient Adenovirus containing the human Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor D (Ad-VEGF-D) gene and a biodegradable local delivery device (collar) made of collagen. At the end of the surgical procedure to insert the PTFE graft the collagen collar is applied around the anastomosis and sealed with a collagen surgical sealant. This procedure creates a reservoir between the site of anastomosis and the collagen collar. The adenoviral vector is then injected into this reservoir, localizing the expression of the transgene to the site of the anastomosis. Expression of VEGF-D has been shown to have a vascular protective role and inhibit SMC neointimal proliferation, therefore expression of VEGF-D should prolong graft survival.</brief_summary>
