	<brief_summary>Robotic technology has been used for laparoscopic hysterectomies for over 10 years. Mayo Clinic Arizona has used robotics in Gynecology for the last 10 years with well over 500 procedures performed. Similar to the laparoscopic approach, small incisions are utilized with the robotic approach. Robotic instruments differ from laparoscopic instruments in that the tips of the instruments can rotate more like the human wrist. The instruments are attached to the robotic arms which are controlled by your surgeon. The surgeon is seated at the surgeon's console which is located 12 feet from the patient while the surgical assistant is at your bedside assisting in the procedure. This study is being done to compare the procedure times and results after laparoscopic hysterectomies to laparoscopic hysterectomies performed with robotic assistance.</brief_summary>
