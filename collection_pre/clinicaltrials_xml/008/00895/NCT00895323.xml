	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as radionuclide imaging using bispecific antibody, may help find colorectal cancer cells and learn the extent of disease. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying how well a bispecific antibody works in finding tumor cells in patients with colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Assess the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of anti-CEA x anti-HSG bispecific monoclonal antibody TF2 in patients with colorectal cancer. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive iodine I 131-labeled anti-CEA x anti-HSG bispecific monoclonal antibody TF2 (^131I-TF2) IV over 10-20 minutes on day 1. Patients also undergo whole-body external scintigraphy at various times during the study. Blood samples are collected at baseline and periodically after ^131I-TF2 infusion for pharmacokinetic studies and ^131I-TF2 biodistribution by ELISA and radioactivity measurements.</detailed_description>
