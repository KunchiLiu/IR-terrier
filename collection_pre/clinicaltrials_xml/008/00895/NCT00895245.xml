	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Fosaprepitant dimeglumine, palonosetron hydrochloride, and dexamethasone may help lessen or prevent nausea and vomiting caused by cisplatin in patients with head and neck cancer undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well fosaprepitant dimeglumine together with palonosetron hydrochloride and dexamethasone works in preventing nausea and vomiting caused by cisplatin in patients with stage III or stage IV head and neck cancer undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fosaprepitant Dimeglumine, Palonosetron Hydrochloride, and Dexamethasone in Preventing Nausea and Vomiting Caused by Cisplatin in Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Head and Neck Cancer Undergoing Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the complete response rate of anti-emetic therapy based on a single dose of intravenous fosaprepitant with multiple cycles of high dose cisplatin (complete response is defined as no emesis or rescue nausea medications needed in the 120 hours following cisplatin infusion). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the complete response rate of anti-emetic therapy based on a single dose of intravenous fosaprepitant with multiple cycles of high dose cisplatin in the delayed period (25-120 hours following cisplatin infusion). II. To determine efficacy of anti-emetic therapy based on a single-dose of intravenous fosaprepitant to achieve adequate control of nausea following multiple cycles of high-dose cisplatin as defined by a score on the visual analog scale of &lt; 25mm in the 120 hours following cisplatin infusion. III. To determine the functional impact of cisplatin induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) on daily life as measured by the Functional Living Index-Emesis (FLIE) Questionnaire total score. OUTLINE: Patients receive cisplatin IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 courses. Patients also undergo 3-D conformal radiotherapy or intensity-modulated radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for up to 7 weeks. Patients receive fosaprepitant dimeglumine IV, palonosetron hydrochloride IV, and dexamethasone IV on day 1 (prior to cisplatin infusion). Patients then receive oral dexamethasone on days 2-4. Patients with no emesis or requirement for rescue anti-emetics in the first 120 hours after cisplatin infusion continue to receive the anti-emetic regimen as above with the second and third courses of cisplatin. Patients complete an emesis diary (that includes a nausea visual analog scale) daily for 5 days after each cisplatin infusion. Patients also complete a Functional Living Index-Emesis Questionnaire on day 8 of each course of chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
