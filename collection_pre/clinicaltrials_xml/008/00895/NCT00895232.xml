	<brief_summary>Non-randomized open label Phase II clinical trial in which subjects meeting criteria for RLS were assigned to 1 of 3 treatment cohorts. The first cohort received one 500 mg IV iron sucrose infusion in 500 mL normal sterile saline (NSS) administered over four hours. The second cohort received two 500 mg IV iron sucrose infusions in 500mL of NSS administered over four to six hours on two separate dates, separated by two to seven days. The third cohort received two 500 mg IV iron sucrose infusions in at least 500 mL of NSS over six hours within 30 hours of the start of the first infusion. Cohorts were enrolled and treated subsequently.</brief_summary>
