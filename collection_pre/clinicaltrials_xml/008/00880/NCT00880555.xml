	<brief_summary>Alzheimer's disease (AD) often manifests as a memory disorder before dementia develops. Dementia is considered to be present when a person can no longer handle complex activities of daily living, such as managing finances. This study will investigate the relationship between changes in the ability to manage finances and brain perfusion, which will be measured using continuous arterial spin-labeling (an experimental MRI). Subjects will also undergo neuropsychological tests focusing on several types of memory and thought process, with special emphasis on semantic memory. An important question to be addressed is whether changes in function are better predicted by the neuropsychological tests or by the brain scan.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Alzheimer's disease (AD) often manifests as a memory disorder before dementia develops. Dementia is considered to be present when a person can no longer handle complex activities of daily living, such as managing finances. This study will investigate the relationship between changes in the ability to manage finances and brain perfusion, which will be measured using continuous arterial spin-labeling (an experimental MRI). Subjects will also undergo neuropsychological tests focusing on several types of memory and thought process, with special emphasis on semantic memory. An important question to be addressed is whether changes in function are better predicted by the neuropsychological tests or by the brain scan. Participants will undergo a single MRI scan, baseline financial capacity instrument (FCI) and cognitive evaluation, and then will be followed approximately annually to repeat the functional and cognitive assessments. Linear mixed effects models will be used to fit a model predicting financial capacity based on baseline cognitive tests. Measures from the MRI scan will be added to the model to determine whether imaging improves the predictions.</detailed_description>
