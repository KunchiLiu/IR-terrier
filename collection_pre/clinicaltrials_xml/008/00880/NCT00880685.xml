	<brief_title>Memantine in the Treatment of Kleptomania</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study will consist of 8 weeks of treatment with memantine in 10 subjects with kleptomania. The hypothesis to be tested is that memantine will be effective in reducing the urges to steal in patients with kleptomania. The proposed study will provide needed data on the treatment of a disabling disorder that currently lacks a clearly effective treatment.</detailed_description>
