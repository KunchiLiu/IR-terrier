	<brief_summary>PTSD is a common consequence of war, for soldiers and civilians. PTSD results in hyperarousal, avoidance, numbing, and re-experiencing, causing persistent decreased quality of life. Mindfulness involves the ability to bring attention to the present moment without judgment; this ability is correlated with measures of mental health. Within health care, mindfulness is taught as an 8-week course called Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). MBSR is unstudied for PTSD. We propose to assess the feasibility of MBSR as an intervention for PTSD, since it may affect hypervigilance, avoidance, and reactivity associated with this disorder. Specific Aims: Aim 1: Assess the feasibility of recruiting and retaining a sample of veterans with PTSD to complete a study protocol that involves randomization to usual care or usual care plus MBSR. Aim 2: Apply measures of PTSD symptom severity, depression and quality of life before and after randomization, to assess whether there is evidence of benefit and whether MBSR warrants further study for PTSD, and allow calculation of standardized effect sizes. Aim 3: Apply a validated measure of mindfulness before and after treatment. Aim 4: Explore the relationship between PTSD symptoms, mindfulness score, and frequency of meditation practice.</brief_summary>
