	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of the Scuba™ stent in subjects with symptomatic claudication or rest pain and angiographic confirmation of de novo or restenotic lesions in the common and/or external iliac artery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Iliac Artery Treatment With The Invatec Scuba™ Cobalt Chromium Stent (INTENSE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interventional revascularization strategies for peripheral arterial disease currently available include both surgical and endovascular approaches such as percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), either as a stand-alone procedure or with the placement of a stent. Cobalt-chromium (CoCr) is an alloy that has been used safely in the manufacture of surgical implants for use in contact with blood, soft tissue and bone for over 10 years. This study will evaluate the SCUBA™ peripheral balloon-expandable cobalt chromium tent system in iliac arteries.</detailed_description>
