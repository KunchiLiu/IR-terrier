	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether dutasteride may influence the expression of angiogenesis factors such as hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia (LUTS/BPH).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Dutasteride on HIF-1alpha and VEGF in the Prostate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 41 patients awaiting transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) will be divided into two groups (1:1); twenty patients will receive no medication and 21 will receive 0.5 mg dutasteride daily for 2 to 4 weeks until TURP. In both groups, the extent, intensity and intracellular location of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)will be evaluated. Microvessel density will be also compared in the two groups.</detailed_description>
