	<brief_title>Do Patients With Chronic Daily Headache Have Continuous Headache or Moments of Headache Relief?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a retrospective chart review of all patients over the age of 18 who are seen by the co-investigator during one initial, or routine follow up visit, with the diagnosis of chronic migraine, chronic tension type headache, new daily persistent headache, or chronic post traumatic headache(per International Headache Classification II guidelines6). Patients with the above diagnosis during their routine care are asked five standard questions about their headaches by the co-investigator, and the responses are recorded in the patient's medical record (see question sheet attached). These questions pertain to the patients' health care, and are asked of most patients at the Jefferson Headache center with chronic headache routinely during office visits.</detailed_description>
