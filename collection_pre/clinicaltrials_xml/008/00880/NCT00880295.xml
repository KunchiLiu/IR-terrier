	<brief_summary>Although some surgeons prefer one technique rather than the other, both endoscopic and open carpal tunnel release procedures are accepted as standard of care surgeries to relieve carpal tunnel syndrome. The investigator's research is designed to evaluate the significant difference in patient satisfaction between endoscopically-released wrists and open-released wrists. The goal of the study is to compare the two techniques using the following criteria: 1. Primary outcome: patient satisfaction via surveys used in prior publications 2. Secondary outcome: length of time to return to work 3. Secondary outcome: clinical data for recovery from carpal tunnel syndrome including a thorough physical exam and EMG's 4. Secondary outcome: complication rates</brief_summary>
