	<brief_summary>This study will assess the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of GSK Biological's DTPa-HBV-IPV/ Hib vaccine as compared to GSK's DTPa-IPV/Hib vaccine co-administered with HBV according to a three-dose immunisation course and as a booster dose in infants born to hepatitis B antigen seronegative mothers and previously primed with a birth dose of GSK's HBV vaccine.</brief_summary>
