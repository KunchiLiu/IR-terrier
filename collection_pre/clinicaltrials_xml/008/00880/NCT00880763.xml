	<brief_summary>The study evaluates safety and efficacy of vaniprevir (MK7009), when administered with Pegylated-Interferon (peg-IFN) and Ribavirin, in Japanese patients with Hepatitis C infection. The primary hypotheses are that 1.) the proportion of patients achieving rapid viral response (RVR) in one or more of the vaniprevir treatment groups is superior to that in the placebo group, when each is administered concomitantly with pegylated interferon (peg-IFN) α-2a and ribavirin; and 2.) vaniprevir at the studied doses is well tolerated compared with placebo, when each is administered concomitantly with peg-IFN α-2a and ribavirin for 28 days.</brief_summary>
