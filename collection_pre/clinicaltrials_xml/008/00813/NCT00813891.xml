	<brief_title>Efficacy of Ranibizumab in Combination With Photodynamic Therapy for Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main cause of severe vision loss in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the development of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). This debilitating form of AMD affects the macula lutea, the central part of the retina, which is responsible for high resolution visual acuity. Characteristic findings in neovascular AMD include the development of new, abnormal blood vessels in the choroid layer beneath the macula otherwise known as CNV. Current treatment options for this condition have included include laser therapy, photodynamic therapy (PDT), and intraocular injections (different types of anti-vascular endothelial growth factors) alone or in combination. While current treatments were demonstrated to slow the progression of vision loss, neither therapy was shown to significantly improve visual acuity. Given their different modes of action, it is believed that combination therapy of Ranibizumab with PDT may lead to better visual outcomes and may result in an improved effect in treating AMD and therefore may help decrease the need for monthly Ranibizumab injections. After the first injection, regardless of which group the patient has been assigned to, they will receive Ranibizumab injections at 4 week intervals if clinically indicated. The purpose of the this study is to evaluate the visual outcomes of intraocular Ranibizumab injections in combination with photodynamic therapy with verteporfin for the treatment of neovascular AMD.</detailed_description>
