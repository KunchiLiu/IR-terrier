	<brief_summary>Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) have been shown to have immunosuppressive and repairing properties. Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) have revascularization properties and complimentary effects to MSCs. The investigators will infuse expanded autologous MSCs and BMMNCs into patients with osteonecrosis of the femoral head. The study purpose is to examine whether this treatment will result in improvement in osteonecrosis of the femoral head.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) have been shown to have immunosuppressive and repairing properties. Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) have revascularization properties and complimentary effects to MSCs. Patients in this study will receive infusion of expanded autologous MSC and BMMNCs. The puncture of femoral artery will be conducted with digital subtraction angiography(DSA), and the tubes will be inserted into medial femoral circumflex artery,lateral femoral circumflex artery and obturatou artey. The study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of MSC infusion in patients with osteonecrosis of the femoral head. This study will last for 5 years. Patients will undergo infusions at Day 0. Afterward, patients will be evaluated for response, and undergo X-ray examination, CT and MR scanning at a 6-month interval.</detailed_description>
