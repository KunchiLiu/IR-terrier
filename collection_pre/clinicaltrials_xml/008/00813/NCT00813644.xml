	<brief_summary>The development of virtual reality (VR) simulators is changing surgical endoscopic education. The translation of VR skills into clinical endoscopic proficiency has been shown by M.PEARLE. The improvement in performing endoscopic tasks after VR training was evaluated on a cadaver. Our goal is to evaluate the performance of novice endoscopists at the operating room by a randomized controlled study comparing subjects randomized to train on a the "UroMentor" simulator to those without VR training.</brief_summary>
