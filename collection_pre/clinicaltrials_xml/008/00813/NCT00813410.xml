	<brief_title>Evaluation of a Novel Method for Integrating Insulin Delivery and Glucose Sensing in Adipose Tissue of Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glucose management in type 1 diabetic patients comprises the measurement of glucose in capillary blood obtained by fingersticking and administration of exogenous insulin in the form of a subcutaneous bolus injection or continuous subcutaneous infusion. The present study seeks to test an alternative treatment approach that combines glucose measurement and insulin delivery at a single subcutaneous tissue site, thereby circumventing the need for fingerstick blood glucose monitoring. Microperfusion and microdialysis probes are applied in type 1 diabetic subjects to perform insulin delivery and glucose sampling at the same adipose tissue site. The feasibility of estimating blood glucose concentrations from the glucose levels measured at the subcutaneous insulin delivery site is then assessed during an overnight fast and an oral glucose tolerance test.</detailed_description>
