	<brief_title>Immunogenicity and Safety Study of rThrombin in Surgical Hemostasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of rThrombin have been evaluated in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in the following surgical indications: spinal surgery, major hepatic resection, peripheral arterial bypass (PAB) surgery, arteriovenous (AV) graft formation for hemodialysis access, and skin graft surgery following burn injury. Limited data on rThrombin reexposure currently exist. This study will assess the immunogenicity and safety of rThrombin in participants who are undergoing a surgical procedure during which topical rThrombin application is planned and who previously received rThrombin in Phase 3 clinical trials or during prior spine, AV graft formation, or PAB surgical procedures.</detailed_description>
