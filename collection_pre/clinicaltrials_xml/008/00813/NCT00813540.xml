	<brief_summary>Recent studies have suggested that individuals diagnosed with colon cancer who are inactive and/or overweight, may have poorer survival outcomes. Exercise training has been shown to improve fitness and body composition in other cancer survivor groups. The investigators hypothesize that an exercise training program will be a safe, feasible, and effective intervention to improve the fitness and body composition of a group of colon cancer survivors.</brief_summary>
