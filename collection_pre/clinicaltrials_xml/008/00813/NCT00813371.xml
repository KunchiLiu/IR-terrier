	<criteria>Trauma patients age 16 or older Trauma patients requiring ventilatory support within 48 hours of injury Those with anticipated ventilatory support ≥ 24 hours Subject or authorized representative (AR) has signed an informed consent form (ICF) Subjects age 16 or 17 who have signed an assent document and/or AR has signed an ICF Significant chronic lung disease defined as lung pathology requiring home O2 use Chronic heart disease defined as NYHC III or higher Persistent bronchopulmonary air leak Contraindications to permissive hypercapnia (ex. Intracerebral bleeding, brain tumor, fulminant hepatic failure, and hemodynamic instability) Pulmonary artery occlusion pressures ≥ 18 mmHg Severe neurologic injury that may prevent the patient from having a reasonable opportunity for weaning as determined by the clinical study team Immunocompromised patients secondary to drugs or disease Neuromuscular disease that impairs ability to ventilate spontaneously (ex. Spinal injury at or above C5, ALS, GuillainBarre syndrome, Myasthenia Gravis) History of pneumonectomy Pregnancy Burns with TBSA ≥ 20% Acute MI as the cause of ALI/ARDS All other contraindications to APRV Patients who cannot be randomized within 12 hours of intubation</criteria>
