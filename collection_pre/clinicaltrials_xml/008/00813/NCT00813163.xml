	<brief_title>Study of PEP02 as a Second Line Therapy for Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gemcitabine monotherapy or a gemcitabine-based combination regimen is the standard first line therapy for advanced pancreatic cancer. After disease progression, there is no standard treatment available. In animal studies and a previous phase I trial, PEP02 has shown anti-tumor activity and preliminary efficacy in pancreatic cancer. In addition, a phase II study of free-form irinotecan single agent has already shown encouraging activity as second-line treatment for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer refractory to gemcitabine. The liposome formulation of PEP02 theoretically has therapeutic advantages over free-form irinotecan, such as site-specific delivery and extended release of drug. Hence PEP02 may be able to provide better efficacy than free-form irinotecan. The primary purpose of this phase II study is to evaluate the activity of PEP02 as a second-line therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer failed to gemcitabine treatment. The primary goal is to measure the 3-month survival rate. An optimal Simon's 2-stage design will be used for this exploratory phase II study.</detailed_description>
