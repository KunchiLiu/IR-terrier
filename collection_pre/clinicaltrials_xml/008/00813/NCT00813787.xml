	<brief_title>Investigation Into the Differentiation of Tumour and Healthy Brain Tissue Using Multi-exponential T2 Components</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Existing methods of contouring tumours for radiation therapy involve manual interpretations of qualitative diagnostic images. These methods, being qualitative, do not offer a consistent and reproducible platform for contouring, making it difficult to evaluate the effects of contouring choices on treatment outcome. T2 component analysis in MRI has the potential to offer a quantitive basis for identifying tumor tissue- this potential is investigated in this pilot study.</detailed_description>
