	<brief_summary>The investigators investigated the effects of a supervised maternal exercise training program (performed during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy) on maternal-newborn unit health outcomes in a group of previously sedentary healthy women. A matched control group was assessed over the same time period. Given the fact that most studies in the field have used aerobic exercises, here the investigators largely focused on very light resistance, toning exercises.</brief_summary>
