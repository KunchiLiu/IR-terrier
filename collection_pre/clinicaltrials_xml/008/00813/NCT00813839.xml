	<brief_summary>This study will compare Drager Smart Care (SC), a commercially available automated ventilator controlled weaning mode to the current daily spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) weaning protocol. The study is designed to determine if automated ventilator controlled weaning can reduce total duration of intubation following mechanical ventilation in ICU patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation (&gt;72 hours).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 years Intubated with endotracheal tube Requiring mechanical ventilation for &gt; 72 hours Meets weaning criteria: Improvement or resolution of the underlying process that precipitated need for mechanical ventilation, PaO2 ≥ 60 mm Hg on PEEP and FiO2 Requirements of ≤ 8 cm H2O and FiO2 ≤ 0.50, Stable oxygenation: PEEP and FiO2 requirements not increased in the past 24 hrs, Ability to initiate an inspiratory effort and trigger the ventilator, Subject enrollment approved by the primary service attending physician Pregnancy Patients with tracheostomy or planned tracheostomy prior to attempt to extubate Patients with known airway patency issues that are anticipated to delay extubation. Patients with neurological injury in whom care is likely to be withdrawn Patients with cervical spinal cord injury. Prospective subject or surrogate consenter does not fully understand the implications of the study because of a language barrier.</criteria>
