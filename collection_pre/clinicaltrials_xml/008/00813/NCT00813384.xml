Female subjects of child bearing potential must remain abstinent or use doublebarrier birth control method during the period of therapy and must be willing to use contraception 2 weeks following the last study drug administration and have a negative serum pregnancy test upon entry into this study Male subject is willing to use contraception upon enrollment, during the course of the study and for 12 weeks following the last study drug administration Willing to provide tumor samples and / or slides Competent to sign and date an Institutional Review Board approved informed consent form Hematological function, as follows: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL Prothrombin time (PT) or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) &lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN) Renal function, as follows: Serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL Hepatic function, as follows: AST/ALT &lt; 3x ULN and total bilirubin &lt; 1.5x ULN in all subjects Alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2.0 x ULN (if liver or bone metastases are present, ≤ 5 x ULN) Any disorder that compromises the ability of the subject to give written informed consent and/or to comply with the study procedures. Primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors or metastases History of bleeding diathesis Myocardial infarction within 6 months of study day 1, symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association &gt; class II), unstable angina, or unstable cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication, or uncontrolled hypertension in the opinion of the investigator A baseline ECG QTc &gt; 480 ms Active infection within 2 weeks of study enrollment (day 1) Significant gastrointestinal disorder(s), in the opinion of the investigator, (e.g. Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, extensive gastrointestinal resection) that may influence drug absorption Known positive test for HIV Known acute or chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection, determined by serologic tests Unresolved toxicities from prior antitumor therapy, defined as not having resolved to CTCAE grade 0 or 1, or to levels dictated in the eligibility criteria with the exception of alopecia Antitumor therapy (chemotherapy, antibody therapy, molecular targeted therapy, retinoid therapy, hormonal therapy, or investigational agent) within 28 days of study day 1 (six weeks for nitrosureas, mitomycin C, or antibody or molecular targeted agents with t1/2 &gt; 10 days); concurrent use of hormone deprivation therapy for hormonerefractory prostate cancer or breast cancer is permitted Treatment with immune modulators including, but not limited to, systemic corticosteroids, cyclosporine and tacrolimus within two weeks prior to enrollment Therapeutic or palliative radiation therapy within 2 weeks of study day 1 Concurrent or prior (within 7 days of study day 1) anticoagulation therapy (lowdose warfarin [≤ 2 mg/day] or low molecular weight heparins for prophylaxis against central venous catheter thrombosis or aspirin [81 mg/day] is allowed) Prior participation in an investigational study and/or procedure within 28 days of study day 1 Major surgery within 30 days of study day 1 Any comorbid medical disorder that may increase the risk of toxicity, in the opinion of the investigator or sponsor</criteria>
