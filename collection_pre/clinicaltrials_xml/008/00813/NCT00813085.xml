	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate whether the use of an electronic diabetes tracker by both patients and family physicians in Ontario improves diabetes outcomes, satisfaction with care and with technology and health data privacy issues. As part of the study, the investigators will be able to test whether practices that use computers perform any better than practices using paper. The investigators also will be developing the first Canadian computerized chart summary for each patient that can be communicated securely in emergencies (the Emergency Health Record) and read by all current electronic systems.</brief_summary>
