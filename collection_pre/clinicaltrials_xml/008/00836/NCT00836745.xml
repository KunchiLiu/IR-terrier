	<brief_title>Non-Interventional Study Of Indian Patients With Advanced Renal Cell Cancer Receiving Therapy With Sutent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The assignment of the patient to Sutent® treatment is not decided in advance by this noninterventional study protocol, but falls within current practice. The decision to prescribe Sutent® is clearly not driven by the decision to include the patient in this study.The sample size for this study is not based on statistical considerations. It is expected that a minimum of 100 patients will be enrolled in the study by the end of the first year and the data collected would be adequate to fulfill the observational objectives of the study.The study will be initiated at 10 sites across India during the 1st year. The study may be expanded with the addition of new sites during the 2nd year.</detailed_description>
