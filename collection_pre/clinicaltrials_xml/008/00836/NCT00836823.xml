	<brief_summary>Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) consists of a constellation of symptoms (including voiding, storage, and post-micturition). The impact of the LUTS on patients' health-related quality of life is substantial and multifaceted. Thus, the therapies aimed at treating BPH are concerned primarily with improving patients' symptoms, thereby improving quality of life. When multiple symptoms are present, the level of bother associated with individual symptoms varies and patients prioritize their treatment goals for symptom relief. A measure that addresses patients' most bothersome symptoms (MBS) and evaluation of symptom-specific goal achievements may lead to improved outcomes and patient satisfaction to the treatment. The objectives of this study were (1) to assess patient-reported MBS and symptom-specific goal achievements (PGA) with medical treatment in BPH patients, and (2) to identify factors that influence or have relation to the PGA.</brief_summary>
