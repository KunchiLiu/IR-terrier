	<brief_summary>Research Hypothesis: Ipilimumab (an antibody that blocks negative signals to T cells) administered alone or in combination with a pancreatic cancer vaccine (allogeneic pancreatic tumor cells transfected with a GM-CSF gene), has an acceptable safety profile in subjects with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Primary Objective: To determine the safety profile of ipilimumab alone or in combination with a pancreatic cancer vaccine in subjects with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Secondary Objectives: - To estimate overall survival (OS) which will serve as the primary efficacy signal. - To explore an association of T cell responses and immunological responses with OS in patients receiving treatment. - To estimate overall response rate (ORR), immune related best overall response rate (irBOR), progression free survival (PFS), and duration of response in patients receiving treatment. - To explore an association between immune-related adverse events (IRAEs) and ORR. - To measure tumor marker kinetics (CA 19-9) in patients receiving treatment.</brief_summary>
