	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to confirm the long-term safety and reliability of the Linox Lead System as used with BIOTRONIK ICDs. The GALAXY registry will provide data to fully characterize ICD lead failures, from implant through 5 years, including those failures contributing to patients losing pacing or defibrillation therapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study is a multi-center, prospective, non-randomized, 5-year data collection registry. Eligible patients must have been successfully implanted with a Linox Lead System connected to a BIOTRONIK ICD and consented and enrolled between 1-45 days following implant. This study is designed to be a post-implant (office-based) registry, and patients are meant to be seen according to each institution's standard of care, but not to exceed a follow-up time frame of every 6 months. At least 2000 patients will be enrolled in this registry, and each patient will be followed for five years post-implant. Safety will be evaluated based on the analysis of the overall incidence of lead-related adverse events that require additional invasive intervention to resolve. In addition, each individual adverse event will be separately investigated. Lead parameters for sensing, pacing thresholds, and impedance will also be evaluated. An independent Clinical Events Committee will review and adjudicate all adverse events that occur during the study according to the protocol definitions.</detailed_description>
