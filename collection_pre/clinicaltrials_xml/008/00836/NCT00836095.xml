	<brief_summary>Laryngeal mask airway is a widely used device in routine anesthesia for airway management during surgery. It consists of a tube with an inflatable cuff that is inserted into the mouth after induction of general anesthesia. The Proseal Laryngeal mask airway and the Laryngeal mask airway Supreme are two variants of the Laryngeal mask airway. The laryngeal mask airway Supreme is a newer version of the laryngeal mask airway. The research is being done to compare two variants of the laryngeal mask airway: the Proseal laryngeal mask airway and the Laryngeal mask airway Supreme. This study will determine if the newer model, the Laryngeal mask airway Supreme, is easier to insert and is better positioned than the older model, the Proseal laryngeal mask airway. Both models are approved for use by the FDA, and are routinely used to assure the airway during general anesthesia.</brief_summary>
