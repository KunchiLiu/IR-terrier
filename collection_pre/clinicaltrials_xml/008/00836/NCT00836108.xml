	<brief_summary>Controlling the way people with lung problems breathe during arm exercises may reduce their breathlessness during activities of daily living that require them to lift their arms (i.e. brushing their hair, putting groceries away on high shelves). The main aim of this study is to determine the effects of specific breathing strategies during arm exercise on dyspnoea in patients with chronic lung disease. Coordinating inspiration with the action of arm elevation will reduce dyspnoea during a rhythmic overhead arm activity</brief_summary>
