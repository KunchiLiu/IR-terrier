	<brief_summary>Objective: To investigate the role of maternal serum YKL-40 and uterine artery doppler, at gestational age 12, 20, 25 and 32 weeks, and the relation to preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. The serum marker YKL-40 is related to conditions involving inflammation, infection, tissue remodeling, fibrosis and cancer. IUGR and preeclampsia are known to be related to inflammation and tissue remodeling. Methods: women attending screening for downs syndrome is scanned with uterine artery doppler and delivered blood samples at GA 12, 20, 25 and 32 respectively. When pregnancy outcome is registered by medical records blood samples are retrieved and analyzed for serum YKL-40. Serum YKL-40 are correlated to the presence of bilateral notching, preeclampsia and different degrees of intrauterine growth restriction.</brief_summary>
