	<brief_title>Bioavailability and Metabolism of Anthocyanins Following Acute Cranberry Consumption</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Little is known about the acute or chronic pharmacokinetics and metabolism of anthocyanins consumed in amounts relevant to usual dietary intakes. Thus, we hypothesize that anthocyanins from a single oral dose of cranberry juice will be absorbed quickly and can be measured in the circulation and urine within 2-4 h. Further, these anthocyanins will undergo a degree of metabolism but will circulate as well as be removed from blood as both parent compounds and metabolic products. This research proposal is submitted as an independent sub-study of an existing project, "Effects of Cranberry Juice on Endothelial Function in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease", conducted by Joseph A. Vita, MD at the Boston University School of Medicine and sponsored by Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc. This study includes 15 subjects aged 21-80 y and with demonstrated endothelial dysfunction and angiographically proven coronary artery disease who will receive a single dose of 480 mL cranberry juice. To test the hypotheses of the study to be conducted at HNRCA Tufts, we will utilize blood and urine samples that are already collected and stored. We will separate and analyze anthocyanins in these samples by HPLC and determine the pharmacokinetics of relevant anthocyanins.</detailed_description>
