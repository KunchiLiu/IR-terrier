	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: RAD001(Everolimus) may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for their growth and by blocking blood flow to the cancer. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well RAD001(everolimus) works in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RAD001(Everolimus) in Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the clinical activity (improvement in erythroid response and/or improvement in other cytopenias, bone marrow morphology/cytogenetics) of RAD001(everolimus) in patients with low or intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndromes. - Assess the toxicity of this drug in these patients. Secondary - Examine laboratory correlates (S6K1 levels, angiogenesis pre- and post-treatment) and determine how these correlates correspond to dosing and clinical activity of RAD001(everolimus). - Evaluate the presence of HLA-DR15 and cytotoxic T-cell populations in patients pre- and post-treatment and correlate this with response to treatment. - Examine the incidence of the null GSTT-1 phenotype in myelodysplastic syndromes patients and correlate this with response to RAD001(everolimus). OUTLINE: Patients receive oral RAD001(everolimus) once daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or relapse. Blood samples are collected periodically during study. Samples are analyzed for S6K1 activity, effector T cells by flow cytometry, GSTT-1 by PCR, and HLA-DR15 levels.</detailed_description>
