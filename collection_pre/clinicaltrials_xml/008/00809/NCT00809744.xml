	<brief_summary>In this study the investigators want to compare glucose handling (insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity) in 100 persons with low and 50 persons with normal-high levels of vitamin D, using a hyperglycemic clamp technique, were sugar is given intravenously for 3 hours in order to keep the blood sugar level at 10 mmol/L. Those with low vitamin D levels will be randomized to treatment with vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 40 000 IU/week or placebo for 6 months before a new clamp is performed. The study hypothesis is that persons with low vitamin D levels have impaired glucose handling which might be improved by vitamin D supplementation.</brief_summary>
