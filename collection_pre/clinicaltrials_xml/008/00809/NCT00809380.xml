	<brief_summary>Though much attention has been given to the practice of parental presence during invasive procedures in children in the ED, few studies have examined the patient's perspective. The only study to have addressed this issue used a single visual analog scale, which is not a well validated tool to assess children's distress level. Furthermore, no studies have assessed parental presence during fracture reduction; only a few incidental cases were reported in the literature. Finally, most studies evaluating parental presence had methodological limitations because of the absence of a control group. The investigators seek to assess whether parental presence during fracture reduction under sedation, in children 8 to 18 years of age, decreases anxiety levels in both parents and children.</brief_summary>
