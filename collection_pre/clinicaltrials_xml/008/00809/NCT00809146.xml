	<brief_title>Paramedic Treatment of Prolonged Seizures by Intramuscular Versus Intravenous Anticonvulsant Medications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Seizures are a common medical problem. Although they can be frightening to watch, most seizures are brief and stop by themselves. Seizures that don't stop in seconds or minutes are a dangerous life-threatening medical emergency. Paramedics often have medications that can stop seizures, but the best way to give the medicines is not known. Paramedics often give medicine directly into a vein, which is called intravenous (IV) administration. This works well, but can be hard to do in a person who is seizing. It can also take some time and delay treatment. Another way to give the medicine is as a shot given into a muscle, which is called intramuscular (IM) administration. Giving the medicine this way is faster, but it may not stop the seizure as quickly. This clinical trial, the Rapid Anti-convulsant Medication Prior to ARrival Trial (RAMPART), is designed to figure out whether giving anti-seizure medicine works similarly well and more quickly when given through an IV or when given as a shot in the muscle. Two similar medicines will be used. Both are already used by paramedics in the field and by doctors in the hospital to stop seizures. One is commonly given by IV, and the other is commonly given as a shot in the muscle. In this study, the shot will be given using a device similar to an EpiPenâ€”which is an autoinjector used by people with severe allergies. Approximately 1,024 persons whose seizures are continuing after emergency medical service (EMS) arrival and who meet all eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the trial. Every participant will be treated with anti-seizure medicine by the paramedics. At random, half the participants will be in one group and half in another. Half the participants will receive the study medicine through an IV and will be given a shot in the muscle without medicine (placebo). The other half will receive the medicine as a shot in the muscle plus an IV without medicine (placebo). In September 2010, more rapid than expected enrollment made it feasible to increase the sample size of the study from 800 to 1,024 with the already available funding. The goals of the expansion were to enroll more pediatric subjects (since the trial was enrolling slightly fewer than anticipated) and to improve the power of the study to 90%, which was initially desired. It is important to understand that the extended enrollment was not a sample size re-estimation in any way. The opportunity to extend the trial is pragmatic, based solely on the early enrollment success of the trial. It is not informed by the planned interim analyses that have been performed, the results of which remain sequestered, and there have been no unscheduled interim analyses. The firewall that prevents the blinded leadership from any knowledge of the outcome data has been diligently maintained throughout the process of proposing and implementing this extension.</detailed_description>
