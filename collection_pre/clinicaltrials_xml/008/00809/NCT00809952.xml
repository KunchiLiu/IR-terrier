	<brief_title>Ultrasound Guided Artificial Insemination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>The woman's inclusion criteria in our IUI program were at least one patent tube, normal cavity, basal FSH &lt; 10 mU/mL and age under 40 years. IUI with husband's sperm (IUIH) was indicated when, after sperm preparation, at least 5 million motile spermatozoa were recovered; this was performed in 58 cases (79.45%). In the remaining 15 cases (20.55%), IUI was performed with donor sperm (IUID) either because of azoospermia (n=6) failure to recover spermatozoa during testicular biopsy (n=5) or in women without a male partner (n=4). Previous infertility treatments had been carried out.</criteria>
