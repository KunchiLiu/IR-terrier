	<brief_summary>Preterm deliveries play a significant role in neonatal morbidity and mortality. Previous studies showed that administration of progesterone to pregnant women at high risk, decrease spontaneous preterm deliveries. The purpose of this study is to compare between two different modes of treatment with progesterone for the prevention of preterm delivery: weekly injection of 17 alfa hydroxyprogesterone caproate versus daily vaginal administration of progesterone in terms of efficacy, comfort and compliance, safety and cost of treatments.</brief_summary>
