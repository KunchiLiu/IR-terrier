	<brief_summary>The objective is to assess the effectiveness of a prevention campaign promoting active management in shifting beliefs in 6 to 8 year old schoolchildren. Subjects will be taken from a random sample of schools in Majorca, Spain: private, public and concerted. A 10 item questionnaire will be given to all children in that age group, to be answered in class on days 1, 14 and 97. Schools will be randomly assigned to the study and control groups. In the study group the students will get a Back Comic-Book (promotes active management) after the first assessment. The control group will have no other intervention than the questionnaire.</brief_summary>
