Signs and symptoms of clinically significant cardiac disease with 6 months prior to screening. Diagnosis of TIA within 6 months prior to screening or diagnosis of stroke with residual deficits that would preclude completion of required study activities. History, diagnosis, signs or symptoms of clinically significant neurological and/or psychiatric disease/disorder. At Screening: uncontrolled hypertension, hemoglobin A1c greater than or equal to 10%, ALT or AST greater than or equal to 3X upper limit of normal, creatinine exceeding 1.7 mg/dL (men) or 1.5 mg/dL (women).
