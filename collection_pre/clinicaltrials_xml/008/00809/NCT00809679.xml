	<brief_title>Analgesic Efficacy and Safety Study of T-62 in Subjects With Postherpetic Neuralgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study K862-08-2002 is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessing the analgesic efficacy and safety of T-62 in subjects with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and its associated pain. Up to 20 centers in the United States will participate in the trial. Two doses of T-62 and placebo will be evaluated in parallel design. Approximately 130 subjects will be enrolled to complete approximately 100 subjects. Each subject will complete a 7-day Screening Period , a 28-day Treatment Period, and a 14-day Post-Treatment Period. Each subject will complete 8 clinic visits over the course of the study during which procedures and assessments of safety, efficacy, and protocol compliance will be performed.</detailed_description>

Subject has a current acute disease or unstable chronic disease other than post herpetic neuralgia. 2. Subject has a clinically important history of a medical disorder (particularly cardiovascular, neurological [e.g., diabetic neuropathy], respiratory, or hepatobiliary systems [e.g., Gilbert Syndrome]) that would confound and/or interfere with the safety and efficacy evaluations defined in the protocol. 3. Subject is being treated for a medical condition that affects cardiac conduction. 4. Subject's plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase (AP) values are not within the normal reference ranges. 5. Subject has a history of asthma requiring management for reactive airway disease in the last year. 6. Subject uses and is unwilling/unable to discontinue use of (A) Lyrica® (pregabalin), Cymbalta® (duloxetine), Neurontin® (gabapentin), topical lidocaine, topical capsaicin, or other medication specifically indicated (i.e., labeled) for the treatment of neuropathic pain, or (B) anticonvulsant medications to control post herpetic neuralgia. 7. Subject currently requires anticonvulsant medications to control seizures.</criteria>
