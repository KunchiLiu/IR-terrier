	<brief_summary>This Phase IIB proof-of-concept study would examine the effects of an investigational product called N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on the basic processes that cause inflammation in CF lung disease. We hope to learn more about the causes of lung disease in cystic fibrosis by studying the characteristics of the inflammation in the lungs of patients who have CF.</brief_summary>
