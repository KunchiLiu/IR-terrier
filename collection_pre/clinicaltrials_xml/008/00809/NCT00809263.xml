	<brief_summary>In a homeopathic drug proving a homeopathically prepared substance is administered to healthy volunteers in order to produce the symptoms specific to that substance and thereby reveal its inherent curative powers. During a homeopathic drug proving the goal is to provoke temporary symptoms (or "artificial illness") associated with the homeopathic medication. These symptoms are then arranged to form a symptom pattern or 'remedy picture' which is specific to that particular homeopathic substance and provides the basis for a better understanding of the possible effects of that homeopathic remedy in patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The duration of these homeopathic drug provings are six week per subject (42 days). The central investigational tool of the homeopathic drug proving is the journal kept by each subject from DAY 1-35. The subject describes the symptoms they experience in their own words in the journal daily. During the 7 day run-in phase, the subject notes in their journal their current state of health, the daily rhythm of their life, and any other signs or symptoms that occur on a daily basis. This will also enhance familiarity with self-observation and the recording of signs and symptoms. After completion of this run-in phase an evaluation including journal check will occur on DAY 7. During the following 4 weeks (observation periods DAY 8-14, 22-28; wash-out period DAY 15-21 and 29 - 35) the subject documents all signs or symptoms that occur in his/her journal on a daily basis. During this period, subject interviews will take place on DAY 15, DAY 21. DAY 29 and DAY 36. During the 7 day follow up (post observation period, DAY 36-42) the subject will be contacted to check if any additional symptoms and/or adverse events occurred.</detailed_description>
