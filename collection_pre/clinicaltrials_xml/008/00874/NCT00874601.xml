	<brief_summary>The manipulation of blood pressure in acute cerebral ischemia has been a matter of debate until now. The investigators are clearly in need of more detailed data on how antihypertensive treatment affects outcome in acute phase of stroke. This study will assess the effects of modest blood pressure (BP) lowering manipulation in acute period of ischemic stroke on death or dependency at 90-day.</brief_summary>
