	<brief_summary>Sublingual immunotherapy is developing in the treatment of aeroallergens allergy. The hypothesis is that such process may be applied to food allergy, more precisely to milk. A previous series of 8 patients indicates the likely effectiveness of this technique (Allergy, 2006).</brief_summary>
