	<brief_summary>Current evidence indicates that fruit and vegetable intake and dietary patterns rich in fruit and vegetables may be associated with reduced insulin resistance and may reduce the risk of the metabolic syndrome. If proven, this relationship may partly explain the inverse association between fruit and vegetable intake and cardiovascular disease risk. There are currently no published dietary interventions that have examined in detail the relationship between fruit and vegetable intake and insulin resistance. There is, however, some preliminary evidence from whole diet interventions that a diet rich in fruit and vegetables may have a beneficial effect on insulin resistance. Evidence to date indicates that an investigation of the direct association between fruit and vegetable intakes and insulin resistance in a carefully controlled intervention study is warranted. This study will investigate the dose−response effect of fruit and vegetable intake on insulin resistance in people who are overweight and at high−risk of CVD using state−of−the−art techniques.</brief_summary>
