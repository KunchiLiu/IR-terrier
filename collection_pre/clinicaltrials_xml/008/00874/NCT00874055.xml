	<brief_summary>Participants will be matched with either their friend or an unfamiliar peer who is the same gender and about the same age. Participants will have 45 minutes of free-play in an experimental room where they will have free access to energy-dense and nutrient-dense foods and an assortment of games and puzzles. The investigators predict that participants eating with a friend will eat significantly more than participants eating with an unfamiliar peer. The investigators also predict that overweight participants eating with an overweight partner will eat significantly more than participants eating with a non overweight participant.</brief_summary>
