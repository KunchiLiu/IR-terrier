	<brief_summary>This is a pilot vaccine study in adults with recurrent WHO Grade II gliomas. The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of an experimental tumor vaccine made from peptides in combination with the study drug Poly-ICLC. Poly-ICLC, manufactured by Oncovir, Inc., has already been received and is generally well tolerated by subjects in earlier studies and has been shown to decrease the size of brain tumors in some cases. The immunological and safety data will be used to decide whether a larger study of clinical efficacy is warranted.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HLA-A2-Restricted Glioma Antigen-Peptides Vaccinations With Poly-ICLC for Recurrent WHO Grade II Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a pilot study of a vaccination regime that is designed to efficiently induce anti-tumor T-cell responses in patients with recurrent WHO grade II glioma. The proposed regime combines subcutaneous injections of glioma-associated antigen (GAA)-derived cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitope-peptides with simultaneous intramuscular (i.m.) administration of poly-ICLC. The overall objective of this pilot study is to collect immunological and safety data that will be used to decide whether a larger study of clinical efficacy is warranted in these patients. All patients on the study will be followed for a minimum of 2 years, so that the actual 2-year overall survival (OS), 6-month and 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates can be determined in an exploratory manner.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Participants must have recurrent supratentorial WHO grade II astrocytoma, oligoastrocytoma or oligodendroglioma that is histologically confirmed either by the previous biopsy or resection, or at the time of reoperation (reoperation before entry to the current study is allowed; however postsurgery Decadron must be off for at least 4 weeks before administration of the first vaccine). Patients may have received prior external beam radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. With regard to the prior therapy, patients may have had treatment for no more than 2 prior relapses. Relapse is defined as progression following initial therapy (i.e. radiation +/ chemo if that was used as initial therapy). The intent therefore is that patients may have had 3 prior therapies (initial therapy and treatment for 2 relapses). If the patient had a surgical resection for relapsed disease, and no anticancer therapy was instituted for up to 12 weeks, and the patient undergoes another surgical resection, this is considered as 1 relapse. 2. HLAA2 positive based on flow cytometry. 3. Tumor recurrence is defined by the increase of maximum tumor diameter, based on the axial and/or coronal T2 or FLAIR MR images. Increase of tumor size can be based on comparison with previous scans performed up to prior 3 years to allow assessment of slowgrowth of the tumor. 4. Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy: 4 weeks from any investigational agent, 4 weeks from prior cytotoxic therapy and/or at least two weeks from vincristine, 4 weeks from nitrosoureas, 3 weeks from procarbazine administration, and 1 week for noncytotoxic agents, e.g., interferon, tamoxifen, thalidomide, cisretinoic acid, etc. (radiosensitizer does not count). Any questions related to the definition of noncytotoxic agents should be directed to the Principal Investigator. With regard to previous RT, there must be at least 6 months from the completion of RT (or radiosurgery). 5. Participants must be at least 18 years old. For patients under 18 years old, we have a separate, but similar vaccine study through the Children's Hospital in Pittsburgh. 6. All participants must sign an informed consent document. 7. Participants must have a Karnofsky performance status of &gt; 60 (Appendix I). 8. Documented negative serum HCG for female participants of childbearing age. Males and females must agree, in the consent form, to use effective birth control methods during the course of vaccination. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with the peptidebased vaccine and polyICLC, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated in this study. 9. Participants must be free of systemic infection. 10. Participants with adequate organ function as measured by white blood count ≥ 2500/mm3; lymphocytes ≥ 800/mm3; platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3, hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dL, AST, ALT, GGT, LDH, alkaline phosphatase within 2.5 x upper normal limit, and total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL, and serum creatinine within 1.5 X upper limit of normal limit. Coagulation tests PT and PTT have to be within normal limits. 1. Presence of gliomatosis cerebri, cranial or spinal leptomeningeal metastatic disease. 2. Even if the initial diagnosis was WHO grade II glioma, if the pathological diagnosis for the recurrent disease demonstrate transformation to higher grade (i.e. WHO grade III or IV) gliomas, patients will be excluded from the eligibility. 3. Concurrent treatment or medications including: Radiation therapy Chemotherapy Interferon Allergy desensitization injections Growth factors Interleukins Any investigational therapeutic medication 4. Participants must not have had prior autoimmune disorders requiring cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy, or autoimmune disorders with visceral involvement. Participants with an active autoimmune disorder requiring these therapies are also excluded. Mild arthritis requiring NSAID medications will not be exclusionary. 5. Use of immunosuppressives within 4 weeks prior to study entry or anticipated use of immunosuppressive agents. Dexamethasone, or other corticosteroid medications, if used perioperative period and/or during radiotherapy, must be tapered and discontinued at least 4 weeks before administration of the first vaccine. Topical corticosteroids and Inhaled steroids are acceptable. 6. Participants who have another cancer diagnosis, except that the following diagnoses will be allowed: squamous cell cancer of the skin without known metastasis basal cell cancer of the skin without known metastasis carcinoma in situ of the breast (DCIS or LCIS) carcinoma in situ of the cervix any cancer without distant metastasis that has been treated successfully, without evidence of recurrence or metastasis for over 5 years 7. Participants with known addiction to alcohol or illicit drugs. 8. Because patients with immune deficiency are not expected to respond to this therapy, HIVpositive patients are excluded from the study. 9. Patients who previously participated in UPCI 07057 are excluded.</criteria>
