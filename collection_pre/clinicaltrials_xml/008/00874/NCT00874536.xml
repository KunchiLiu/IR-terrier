	<brief_summary>It is assumed that only 1/5 of children diagnosed with attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are treated. New treatment modalities are urgently needed. Omega-3 fatty acids have been used in this setting, yet results are conflicting. The parent omega-3 fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) has only been used in one trial. 40 children diagnosed with ADHD will be randomized to consume either ALA or placebo for two months. Baseline and end assessments will include ADHD-related questionnaires and a computerized test. The investigators hypothesize that ALA supplementation will prove beneficial for children with ADHD.</brief_summary>
