	<brief_summary>This study will consist of a randomized controlled trial in which the investigators test the feasibility and effectiveness of mandatory nap programs for physicians in training. One site will be the general medical service of the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The other will be the oncology service of the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. The primary outcome will be the amount slept while on call. The first year will test the efficacy of a 5 hour mandatory nap schedule, the second year will test the efficacy of a 3 hour mandatory nap schedule.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Controlled Trial of Mandatory Naps for Physicians in Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: The release of the Institute of Medicine report on resident work hours and patient safety highlighted the risks to patient and resident safety of extended duty on-call shifts. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility and effectiveness of mandatory naps during extended duty overnight shifts for residents. Methods: For each site (PVAMC and HUP), every other month residents will be randomized to either work the standard schedule (which involves interns being on duty for 30 continuous hours) vs. the mandatory nap schedule, which involves interns signing out their beepers for 5 hours in the middle of the night to covering night floats and for 3 hours in Year 2. The primary outcome will be the amount slept as measured by actigraphs, with secondary outcomes of cognitive alertness measured by 3-minute psychomotor vigilance testing (PVT), Stanford sleepiness Scale, and other measures of resident and patient well-being. Status: Recruitment complete, analyses phase only</detailed_description>
