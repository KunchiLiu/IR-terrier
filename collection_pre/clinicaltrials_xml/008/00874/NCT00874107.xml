	<brief_summary>The Phase 2 study described in this protocol will serve to evaluate the antitumor activity, safety and pharmacokinetic profile of Imprime PGG when combined with bevacizumab and concomitant paclitaxel and carboplatin therapy in patients with previously untreated advanced NSCLC. Additionally, this study will provide guidance for the design of more definitive efficacy studies of Imprime PGG in NSCLC patients.</brief_summary>
