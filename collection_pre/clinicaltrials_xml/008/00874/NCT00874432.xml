	<brief_summary>The goal of this proposal is to investigate the potential for ACE-inhibitors (ACE-I)(drugs primarily used to treat hypertension or congestive heart failure) to prevent or delay cardiovascular disease (CVD) in older adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) by examining their impact on aortic stiffness in people with stage 3 CKD in a randomized, controlled study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of ACE-inhibitors on Aortic Stiffness in Elderly Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our study will be the first to examine whether aortic stiffness is increased in elderly patients with CKD compared to their age-matched healthy controls and further examine whether ACE-I may delay the progression of aortic stiffness in elderly CKD patients. If ACE-I therapy appears beneficial in preventing or delaying arterial stiffening in elderly patients with CKD, our work has important implications for improving the overall health of this population.</detailed_description>
