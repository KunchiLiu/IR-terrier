	<brief_summary>To assess the safety and efficacy of the GORE Conformable TAG® Thoracic Endoprosthesis in the primary treatment of aneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta (DTA) &gt; Primary Hypothesis: The proportion of subjects free from a major device event through 1 month post-treatment will not be significantly less than 0.95, which represents the proportion observed in previous clinical studies with the GORE TAG® Thoracic Endoprosthesis</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Aneurysm</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. Presence of DTA aneurysm deemed to warrant surgical repair &gt; Fusiform (≥50 mm), or &gt; Saccular (no diameter criteria) 2. Subject is &gt; 21 years of age &gt; 3. Proximal and distal landing zone length ≥ 2.0 cm Landing zones must be in native aorta Landing zone may include left subclavian artery, if necessary 4. All proximal and distal landing zone inner diameters are between 1642 mm &gt; • Diameter assessed by flow lumen and thrombus, if present; calcium excluded &gt; 5. Life expectancy &gt; 2 years &gt; 6. Able to tolerate thoracotomy &gt; 7. Male or infertile female &gt; 8. Able to comply with protocol requirements including followingup &gt; 9. Signed informed consent &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Differing proximal and distal neck diameters (aortic taper) outside the intended aortic diameter requirements (sizing guide) for a single endoprosthesis diameter and the inability to use devices of different diameters (in adherence to the sizing guide) to compensate for the taper &gt; 2. Tortuous or stenotic iliac and/or femoral arteries and inability to use a conduit for vascular access &gt; 3. Aneurysmal, dissected, heavily calcified, or heavily thrombosed landing zone(s) &gt; 4. Mycotic aneurysm &gt; 5. Hemodynamically unstable aneurysm rupture &gt; 6. Aortic dissection &gt; 7. Planned coverage of left carotid or celiac arteries with the CTAG Device &gt; 8. Planned concomitant surgical procedure (other than left subclavian transposition and wireless sac pressure monitoring), or major surgery within 30 days of treatment date &gt; 9. Known degenerative connective tissue disease, e.g. Marfan or EhlerDanlos Syndrome &gt; 10. Known history of drug abuse &gt; 11. ASA risk classification = V (moribund patient not expected to live 24 hours with or without operation) &gt; 12. NYHA class IV &gt; 13. Participating in another investigational device or drug study within 1 year of treatment &gt; 14. Subject has known sensitivities or allergies to the device materials &gt; 15. Subject has a systemic infection and may be at increased risk of endovascular graft infection &gt;</criteria>
