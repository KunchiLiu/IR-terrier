	<brief_summary>To establish the relationship between human MAAI haplotype and DCA and tyrosine metabolism. This aim test the postulates that MAAI haplotype determines, and thus can predict,1) dose-dependent DCA kinetics and biotransformation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The arms of the study involves determining the haplotype of individuals enrolled. Then participants were divided into two groups based on their genotype. The groups include a genotype with an EGT alle and a group of genotype without an EGT alle. All subjects first took a low dose of DCA 2.5ug/kg for 5 days then wait 30 days and take a therapeutic dose of DCA 25mg/kg for 5 days On the first day and on the 5th day of taking DCA kinetics were be done. A total of 16 blood samples were obtained through an intravenous catheter. Urine collection will also occur. Population pharmacogenetic analysis of MAI allelic frequencies and the GC or LC-MS/MS techniques for blood or urinary metabolites were used in this investigation. Pharmacokinetic data was used to determine metabolism rate of DCA for each allele</detailed_description>
