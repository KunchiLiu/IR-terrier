	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well sorafenib works in treating patients with angiosarcoma that is locally advanced, metastatic, or unable to be removed by surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib in Treating Patients With Angiosarcoma That is Locally Advanced, Metastatic, or Unable to Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the rate of non-progression at 9 months in patients with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic angiosarcoma treated with sorafenib tosylate. Secondary - Determine the rate of non-progression at 60, 120, and 180 days. - Determine the median time to progression. - Determine overall survival. - Determine the best response rate. - Determine the clinical and biological factors that predict clinical benefit. - Evaluate tolerability by NCI CTCAE v3.0. - Correlate efficacy with plasma expression of genes implicated in controlling angiogenesis. - Explore the tumor expression of these genes in tissue from a tumor bank. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease type (cutaneous angiosarcoma [scalp, breast, or soft tissue] vs visceral angiosarcoma). All patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily for 9 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
