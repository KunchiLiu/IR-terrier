	<brief_summary>This is a research study designed to look at the biological effects of two drugs on leukemia cells. In this study, we are comparing the effects of drugs called corticosteroids when used alone or with another drug called rapamycin. Rapamycin is a drug that prevents the body's immune system from working normally. It has been used for many years after kidney transplants to prevent rejection of the organ. Recent work suggests that rapamycin may also help treat leukemia and other cancers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rapamycin in Relapsed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Participants will be randomized into two groups; one group will receive corticosteroid alone, and the other group will receive rapamycin and corticosteroid. - The length of treatment will be 5 days, during which time we will collect blood samples to measure the biologic effects of these drugs. Because these drugs will be given for a short period of time only, this study is not designed to treat or cure the participants leukemia. After the 5-day period, participants may resume other cancer-directed therapies.</detailed_description>
