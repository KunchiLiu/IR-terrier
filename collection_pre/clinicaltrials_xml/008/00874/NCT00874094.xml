This study proposes to evaluate the clinical response of laugh lines treated with a concentrated preparation of the subject's own platelets injected into or under the skin by taking serial photographs of the subject's face over a 12 week period. Also, the same preparation will be injected into or under the skin of the arm near the elbows, and serial biopsies will be taken over a 12 week period.</brief_summary>
