	<detailed_description>Subjects with documented symptomatic uterine fibroids will be enrolled in the study. Following screening, subjects will receive daily oral study medication and will be assessed monthly for a 4 month treatment cycle. This first cycle will be followed by an off-drug interval until there is a return of significant symptomatology. Subjects will be followed for up to six (6) months post-treatment. If their lack of symptoms does not qualify them for a second cycle of treatment, they will be discharged from the study. If they experience symptoms of a certain severity, the subject will enter a second 4 month treatment cycle and then a follow-up period.</detailed_description>
