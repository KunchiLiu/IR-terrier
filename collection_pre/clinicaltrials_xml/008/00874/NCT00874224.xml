	<brief_summary>The ORANGE II trial is a double blinded randomised controlled trial that will provide evidence on the merits of laparoscopic surgery in patients undergoing a left lateral hepatic sectionectomy in terms of time to functional recovery, hospital length of stay, quality of life, readmission percentage, morbidity and mortality, hospital costs, body image and cosmesis, and long term incidence of incisional hernias.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgical Recovery After Left Lateral Hepatic Sectionectomy: Laparoscopic Versus Open Surgery.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent developments in liver surgery include the introduction of laparoscopic surgery and enhanced recovery programmes. Laparoscopic surgery and enhanced recovery programmes both focus on faster recovery and consequently shorter hospital length of stay. The ORANGE-II trial is a prospective randomised controlled parallel group superiority trial with a double-blinded experimental and a prospective registry design to determine whether laparoscopic surgery is to be preferred over open surgery in patients undergoing a left lateral hepatic sectionectomy within an enhanced recovery programme. The experimental design produces two randomised arms; (a) open LLS and (b) laparoscopic LLS. An additional registry arm will be based on surgeons/patients that do not want to be randomised because they have an explicit preference for either the laparoscopic LLS or for the open LLS (c). The primary endpoint of the ORANGE II trial is time to functional recovery. The functional recovery criteria consist of adequate pain control with oral analgetics only, mobility restored to an independent level, absence of intravenous fluid administration, ability to eat solid foods and finally a normal or decreasing serum bilirubin level. A patient is fully functionally recovered when all of the five criteria are satisfied. Secondary endpoints of this trial are postoperative length of hospital stay, readmission percentage, (liver specific) morbidity, quality of life, body image and cosmetic result, hospital and societal costs during one year and long-term incidence of incisional hernias. The ORANGE-II trial is a randomised controlled multicentre trial that will provide evidence on the merits of laparoscopic surgery in patients undergoing a left lateral hepatic sectionectomy and participating in an enhanced recovery programme.</detailed_description>
