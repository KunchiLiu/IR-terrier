	<brief_summary>To assess the potential for ridaforolimus to prolong the QTc interval (an effect on the electrical activity of the heart) in participants with advanced cancer. This study will be done in 2 parts. Part 1 will evaluate the effect of a single 100 mg dose of ridaforolimus on QT interval in participants with advanced cancer. Fridericias's correction (QTcF) will be used. In Part 2 participants will receive ridaforolimus at the current therapeutic dose (40 mg x 5 days).</brief_summary>
