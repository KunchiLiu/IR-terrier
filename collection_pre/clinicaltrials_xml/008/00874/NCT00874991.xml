	<brief_summary>The aim of this research is to apply cardiac tissue characterization in order to assess left ventricular function in cardiac surgical patients pre and post cardiopulmonary bypass. The procedures to be used include a retrospective review of transesophageal images obtained during conventional intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for cardiac surgery, as well as a secondary analysis with Tissue Doppler. The results will be compared with hemodynamic data obtained from a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients included in this study are between the ages of 18 to 99 years of age, who presented to the operating room for cardiac surgery, and received both a pulmonary artery catheter and a routine intra-operative TEE. We will only be looking at patients whose TEE images were of good quality. Subjects underwent cardiac surgery and received both a PAC and a routine TEE exam. We will review the data from the PAC, the images from the conventional TEE exam, and a secondary analysis with Tissue Doppler. A potential benefit to society is a novel means for assessing left ventricular function. Our research will not benefit our subjects directly. There is no additional risk to our subjects beyond the insertion of the PAC and the TEE probe, which are routinely placed in our patients under-going cardiac surgery.</detailed_description>
