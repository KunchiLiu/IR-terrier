	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as MRI, may help find ductal carcinoma in situ and find out how far the disease has spread. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well MRI works in assessing tumor size in women with ductal carcinoma in situ.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI in Assessing Tumor Size in Women With Ductal Carcinoma In Situ</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Assess the contribution of MRI in accurately determining tumor size in women with ductal breast carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Secondary - Evaluate the sensitivity of MRI in detecting DCIS. - Evaluate the contribution of mammography in accurately determining tumor size. - Compare the contribution of MRI vs mammography in assessing tumor extension. - Compare the contribution of MRI vs mammography in assessing dense breasts. - Evaluate the morphology of DCIS by MRI. - Evaluate the curve of dynamic MRI in assessing DCIS. - Evaluate the impact of nuclear grade of DCIS by MRI. - Evaluate the rate of revision surgery. OUTLINE: Patients undergo clinical examination, mammography, ultrasound imaging, unilateral breast MRI, and tissue sampling.</detailed_description>
