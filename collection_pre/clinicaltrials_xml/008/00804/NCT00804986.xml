	<brief_summary>A multicenter, multinational, randomized,double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Patients with inadequate glycemic control using diet and exercise alone, or in combination with metformin, will be enrolled. The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that LY2428757 given to patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with diet and exercise alone, or metformin monotherapy, produces a significant decrease in the mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline to endpoint at 12 weeks as compared to placebo. Trial consists of 12 weeks of double-blind treatment and 4-week safety follow-up.</brief_summary>
