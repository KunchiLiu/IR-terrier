	<brief_summary>Ultrasonography has become a critical ancillary test in the clinical practice of ophthalmology. It is commonly used as a standardized method for assessing intraocular biometry. The PalmScan ultrasonography (PsU) is a portable A-scan device that uses the same principles as the standard A-scan. The aim of the study is to compare the reliability of their measurements, in order to use them indistinctively.</brief_summary>
