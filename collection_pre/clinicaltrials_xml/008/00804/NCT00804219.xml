	<brief_summary>The phenomenon of no- and low-responsiveness has been described after applications of different vaccines (e.g. hepatitis B, TBE) and is concerning about 2-10% of the vaccinees. The aim of this project is to investigate the humoral and cellular immune responses of low-responders after TBE vaccination in order to find parameters regarding immunoregulation against TBE. It is of interest if non-responsiveness is a general immunological deficit of a distinct patient group or if it is a antigen-specific phenomenon.</brief_summary>
