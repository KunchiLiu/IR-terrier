	<brief_title>Autologous Stem Cell Transplant (ASCT) With Intravenous Busulfan and Melphalan as Conditioning Regimen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Efficacy and safety of the procedure in terms of number of remissions, survival, event-free survival, relapse risk, and early transplant-related mortality (up to day +100). Secondary Graft kinetics (time to neutrophil and platelet recovery after ASCT) 2.Analyze the presence of transplant-related complications (infections, sinusoidal occlusive syndrome and others) 3.Analyze prognostic factors for engraftment, remission rate, relapse risk, disease-free and overall survival after ASCT</detailed_description>
