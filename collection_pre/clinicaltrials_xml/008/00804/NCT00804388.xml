	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to compare polyethylene wear in an uncemented total hip prosthesis with 3rd. generation highly cross-linked polyethylene with a 32 mm ceramic femoral head compared to a 36 mm ceramic head. Using X-ray, RSA and DEXA. The polyethylene to be used is E-Poly (Biomet). The H0 hypothesis is that there is no difference with regard to polyethylene wear and bone loss between the two groups.</brief_summary>
