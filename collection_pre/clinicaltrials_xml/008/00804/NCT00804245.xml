	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: New diagnostic procedures, such as C-11 choline PET-CT scan, may be effective in finding cancer that has spread to the bone and lymph nodes in patients with prostate cancer. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well C-11 choline PET-CT scan works in finding metastases in patients with newly diagnosed high-risk prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>C-11 Choline PET-CT Scan in Finding Metastases in Patients With Newly Diagnosed High-Risk Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the sensitivity and specificity of PET-CT scan using C-11 choline in detecting bone and lymph node metastases in patients with newly diagnosed high-risk adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Secondary - To perform semi-quantitative analysis of tracer uptake using standard uptake values and qualitative analysis using pure visual analysis. - To develop an algorithm that includes the routine use of C-11 choline PET-CT scan for the staging of patients with prostate cancer at high risk of metastatic disease. - To determine whether the presence of C-11 choline PET-CT scan positivity in these patients is predictive of outcomes, including biochemical relapse-free survival, time to development of clinically apparent metastases, time to local failure, and overall survival. - To obtain tissue specimens from these patients for correlative studies and further evaluation. - To obtain information regarding the feasibility and characteristics of C-11 choline PET-CT scan after androgen suppression. OUTLINE: Patients undergo CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast and a bone scan. Patients also undergo a C-11 choline PET-CT scan*. In the case of any positive scan, patients undergo a needle biopsy. If the biopsy is negative for metastatic disease or if the biopsy is positive for metastatic disease in a draining lymph node region, patients receive radiotherapy and hormonal (antiandrogen) therapy. If the biopsy is positive for metastatic disease at any other site, patients receive hormonal therapy alone. NOTE: *The first 10 patients enrolled on the study who have a positive PET-CT scan and positive biopsy undergo a second PET-CT scan at 6 months after the initial PET-CT scan. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 1 year.</detailed_description>
