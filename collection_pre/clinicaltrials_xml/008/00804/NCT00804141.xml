	<brief_summary>This is a one-year study to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of the subcutaneous (just under the skin) injection form of MOA-728 for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in subjects with nonmalignant pain. The study consists of a 2 week screening period, a 48 week open-label treatment period and a 2 week follow-up period. Subjects will need to agree to self-administer subcutaneous injections, complete daily diaries, and check-in via a daily telephone call during that year-long period.</brief_summary>
