	<brief_summary>Argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) with 100 ms pulses is an effective therapy for lowering intraocular pressure (IOP). Similar reductions in IOP have been achieved using ns (SLT) and microsecond (MLT) pulses, which produce less thermal damage to trabecular meshwork (TM). Lack of clinically visible changes may make the accurate alignment of subsequent pulses difficult. We describe a novel technique - Patterned Laser Trabeculoplasty (PLT) using the PASCAL Photocoagulator system, and its preliminary evaluation in patients with open angle glaucoma.</brief_summary>
