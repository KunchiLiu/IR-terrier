	<brief_summary>The trial will be performed in two parts, a phase I part and a phase IIa part. In the phase I part of the trial, BI 6727 will be investigated as monotherapy and in combination with low dose cytarabine (LD-Ara-C) in patients with relapsed/refractory AML that are not eligible for intensive treatment. The dose of BI 6727 will be escalated to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BI 6727 monotherapy and BI 6727 in combination with LD-Ara-C in AML patients. In the phase IIa part, the combination of BI 6727 at MTD with LD-Ara-C and LD-Ara-C monotherapy will be investigated to explore the efficacy of the combination schedule in comparison to LD-Ara-C monotherapy in previously untreated AML patients that are not eligible for intensive treatment.</brief_summary>
