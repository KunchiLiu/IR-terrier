	<brief_title>Palliative Care During Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy in Patients With Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Describe symptoms/concerns before, during, and after intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy and the impact of these symptoms/concerns on the quality of life (QOL) of patients with ovarian cancer undergoing IP chemotherapy. (Part I) - Analyze care received and resource utilization of these patients, including length of hospitalization, ICU admission rates, clinic visits, phone calls, urgent care visits, and other heath system encounters. (Part I) - Develop palliative care assessment measures and interventions that apply to IP chemotherapy. (Part II) - Implement a palliative care intervention in a pilot of 6 patients. (Part II) - Describe the impact of implementing palliative care interventions on resource utilization, improved QOL and symptoms, and number of chemotherapy courses completed. (Part II) OUTLINE: This is a two-part study. - Part I (retrospective portion): Patients who have undergone intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy within the past 6-12 months undergo a retrospective interview and chart audit to identify their needs and experiences. - Part I (prospective portion): Patients are followed monthly for up to 6 months during IP chemotherapy to provide information about usual care and to identify needs and palliative care concerns. Patients also complete a quality-of-life (QOL) questionnaire (COH QOL Ovarian tool) and undergo a prospective interview. - Part II (intervention): Patients undergo comprehensive palliative care assessment, a patient teaching session prior to the initiation of IP chemotherapy, and a palliative care intervention during IP chemotherapy. Patients also complete a QOL questionnaire and undergo an interview. Patients are followed monthly for up to 6 months during IP chemotherapy.</detailed_description>
