	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of aerobic interval training on left- and right ventricular diastolic- and systolic function on healthy, sedate people over 70 years. The old sedate cohort will be compared to young, sedate subjects also performing aerobic interval training and old master athletes without intervention.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Exercise on Heart Function in Healthy Elderly People</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aging is associated with a reduced diastolic and systolic function of the heart. Earlier studies have shown that physical exercise can improve both systolic and diastolic function. However the impact on age-related cardiac function is to some extent conflicting. The use of different training intensities will impact on the cardiac result. We have in earlier studies shown aerobic interval training at 90 % of maximal heart rate (4x4 minutes) to have more impact on cardiac function, endothelial function and maximal oxygen uptake compared to moderate intensity. To our knowledge the effect of aerobic interval training on cardiac function has not been studied in an old, sedate group before.</detailed_description>
