	<brief_summary>To assess the efficacy on pain level at 1 month and 12 months of a steroid injection in the inter-vertebral disc for patients with chronic back pain and inflammatory discopathy on magnetic resonance imaging. Hypothesis: delivering anti-inflammatory drugs in situ may decrease back pain in patients with inflammatory discopathy</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective: to assess the efficacy on pain level of a steroid injection in the inter-vertebral disc for patients with chronic back pain and MODIC I discopathy on MRI Methods: a multicenter double blind randomized control trial Setting: 3 tertiary care hospitals in France Patients: 134 patients with disabling chronic low back pain not relieved by usual recommended treatments and MODIC I (inflammatory) discopathy on MRI Intervention: Injection of 25 mg of methylprednisolone in the inter-vertebral disc during a discography (intervention group, 67 patients) or discography alone (control group, 67 patients) Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure is pain level assessed on a 11-point numeric scale (0-100) at 1 month. Success is defined as less than 40 on pain numeric scale at 1 month. Secondary outcome measures are pain level at 12 months, Disability (Quebec questionnaire), quality of life (SF-12) at 1 and 12 months, anxiety and depression (HAD), analgesics and anti-inflammatories during the last week, return to work, assessment of the disabilities at 1 and 12 months and disc inflammation (on MRI) at 12 months. Tolerance and adverse effects will be recorded. Trial duration: 36 months(24 months for inclusion and 12 months follow-up) Follow-up visits: at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months Statistical analysis: intention to treat</detailed_description>
