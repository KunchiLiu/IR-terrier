	<criteria>1. Availability of subject for the entire study period and willingness to adhere to protocol requirements as evidenced by the informed consent form duly signed by the subject. 2. Males aged from 18 to 50 years with a body mass index (8MI) within 1930; demographic data (sex, age, ethnic group, body weight, height and smoking habits) will be recorded and reported in the final report. 3. Clinical laboratory values within the laboratory's stated normal range; if not within this range, they must be without any clinical significance and must be recorded as such in the CRF. 4. Healthy according to the laboratory results and physical examination 5. Normal cardiovascular function according to ECG. 6. Subjects should be non or exsmokers. 1. Significant history of hypersensitivity to citalopram or any related products as well as severe hypersensitivity reactions (like angioedema) to any drugs. 2. Presence or history of significant gastrointestinal, liver or kidney disease, or any other conditions known to interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs or known to potentiate or predispose to undesired effects. 3. Presence or history of significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, neurologic, psychiatric, endocrine, immunologic or dermatologic disease. 4. Use of MAO inhibitors within 14 days of day 1 of the study 5. Maintenance therapy with any drug, or significant history of drug dependency, alcohol abuse (&gt; 3 units of alcohol per day, intake of excessive alcohol, acute or chronic), or serious Psychological disease. 6. Any clinically significant illness in the previous 28 days before day 1 of this study. 7. Use of enzymemodifying drugs in the previous 28 days before day 1 of this study (all barbiturates, corticosteroids, phenylhydantoins, etc.). 8. Participation in another clinical trial in the previous 28 days before day 1 of this study. 9. Donation of 500 mL or more of blood (Canadian Blood Services, HemaQuebec, clinical studies, etc.) in the previous 56 days before day 1 of this study. 10.
