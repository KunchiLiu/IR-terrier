	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the role of time of dosing on the lipid-lowering effects of lapaquistat acetate, once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID), in subjects with hypercholesterolemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Lapaquistat Acetate in Subjects With Hypercholesterolemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dyslipidemias are a group of metabolic disorders produced by raised concentrations of lipoproteins, especially low-density lipoprotein cholesterol the lipoprotein that transports endogenous cholesterol from the liver to the peripheral tissues. Increased cholesterol and triglyceride levels lead to an increased risk of arteriosclerosis, the underlying cause of heart attack, strokes and peripheral vascular disease. Despite changes in lifestyle and the availability of potent lipid-lowering agents, cardiovascular disease continues to be the major cause of death in Western Europe and North America. Lapaquistat acetate is being developed by Takeda for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.</detailed_description>
