	<brief_summary>Aldosterone is a significant mediator of cardiovascular injury associated with heart failure and the cardiovascular benefits of mineralocorticoid receptor blockade are additive to those of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers. This study will test the hypothesis that MR antagonists exert beneficial cardiovascular effects, specifically by decreasing vascular injury and improving vascular function.A randomized, double-blind study will be conducted, in which subjects with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus will undergo a series of assessments to test heart, blood vessel, and kidney function at baseline, and after 2 and 6 months of treatment with one of the following drugs: 1. spironolactone 2. hydrochlorothiazide plus potassium 3. placebo. In the event of insufficient funds, randomization to the placebo arm will be stopped and primary assessment of outcomes will occur at baseline and after 6 months of treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>age 1870 years type 2 diabetes mellitus with or without hypertension ischemic changes on resting electrocardiogram, clinical evidence of heart disease (angina, heart failure, unstable angina),cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular disease, significant cardiac arrhythmias, aortic stenosis, 2nd or 3rd degree atrioventricular block, sinus node disease, or symptomatic bradycardia, bronchospastic lung disease with active wheezing, known hypersensitivity to adenosine, hemoglobin A1C &gt; 8.5%, * gout (If not already taking HCTZ), the use of Rosiglitazone,** eGFR &lt; 60 ml/min, serum potassium &gt; 5.0 mmol/L, use of potassiumsparing diuretics,** current smoker,* pregnancy, renal disease not related to diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled hypertension, systolic BP &gt;160 mm Hg and diastolic BP &gt;100 mm Hg,* use of cyclic hormone replacement therapy past intolerance of ACE inhibitor therapy other major medical illnesses. Subjects with evidence of a previous myocardial infarction on the first adenosinestimulated PET study will be withdrawn from the study. Screening systolic blood pressure &lt; 105 mm Hg off of antihypertensive medications Subjects can enroll in study and proceed with inpatient evaluations if during the runin period adjustments of medications, diet and habits lead to improved glucose control (equivalent to HbA1c &lt;8.5%), controlled hypertension and cessation of smoking. Subjects who are currently taking these medications will not qualify for a screening visit. If medications were recently stopped by the subject's physician, he or she may be screened but the baseline assessment protocol must occur 3 months after stopping.</criteria>
