	<brief_summary>The Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone-system is important in the development of cardiovascular organ damage caused by arterial hypertension. This study aims at evaluating the importance of aldosterone with regard to hypertension induced damage to the heart. In order to do this the investigators will perform a comparative cross-sectional study in hypertensives and normotensives. In addition as interventional part the hypertensives will be treated with a mineralocorticoid-receptor blocker (spironolactone).</brief_summary>
