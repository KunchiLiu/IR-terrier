	<brief_summary>Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in North America. These deaths are preventable with proper screening. Fecal occult blood testing, virtual colonoscopy, and standard (optical) colonoscopy are all options for colon cancer screening, but it is not known which is the best at preventing death from colon cancer. A large study comparing these three tests is desperately needed. In this pilot study, the investigators want to find out what percentage of patients will show up for their screening test once enrolled. This will provide crucial information for the successful execution of the larger study.</brief_summary>
