	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to compare the effect of preoperative use of anti-inflammatory topical prednisolone acetate 1%, nepafenac 0.1% and ketorolac tromethamine 0.4% of, plus a placebo, in maintaining the intra-operative mydriasis in extraction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Anti-inflammatory Topical Prednisolone, Nepafenac and Ketorolac in Intra-operative Mydriasis in Facetectomies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Will be conducted with a randomized clinical trial volunteers with indication of extraction in Recife, Brazil. The surgical technique is employed phacoemulsification with implantation of intraocular lens. Digital photos are taken of the eye at the beginning and end of surgery and with them will be digitally determined the relationship between the corneal area and pupillary area. Each volunteer will be drawn to one of four groups of study (group 1, prednisolone acetate 1%, group 2, of ketorolac tromethamine 0.4%, 0.1% nepafenac group 3 and group 4, placebo). For the volunteers randomly selected for each group will be prescribed medication in its presentation as eye drops (Prednisolone acetate 1%, Pred Fort ®, Allergan ®; of ketorolac tromethamine 0.4%, incite l ®, Allergan ®; Nepafenac 0.1%, Nevanac ® Alcon ® and 0.5% methylcellulose, Fresh Tears ®, Allergan ®), 01 drop every 8 hours for 48 hours before surgery. For all volunteers will also be prescribed gatifloxacin (Zymar ®), 01 drop every 8 hours starting 48 hours before surgery. Was scheduled a minimum sample of 60 volunteers (15 per group).</detailed_description>
