	<brief_summary>Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a major neurodegenerative disorder in which there is a progressive loss of dopamine-containing neurons. The understanding that PD is a syndrome of dopamine (DA) deficiency led to the introduction in the clinical practice of L-dopa, a precursor of DA that crosses the blood brain barrier, and also to the use of selective inhibitors of MAO-B, the major DA metabolising enzyme in humans. Safinamide is an inhibitor of MAO-B. This study is to evaluate the long term safety and tolerability of safinamide in PD patients, that have already completed a previous clinical study with Safinamide. The physical and neurological conditions as well as other safety parameters will get compared from baseline to subsequent visits.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. the subject has completed a previous clinical study with Safinamide in PD 2. the subject successfully completed all trial requirements of the antecedent trial 3. if female, they must be either postmenopausal for at least 2 years, surgically sterilized or have undergone hysterectomy or, if of child bearing potential, they must be willing to avoid pregnancy by using an adequate method of contraception for four weeks prior to, during and four weeks after the last dose of study medication. For the purpose of this trial women of child bearing potential are defined of all female subjects after puberty unless they are postmenopausal for at least two years, are surgically sterile or are sexually inactive 4. subjects must be willing and able to participate in the trial and provide written informed consent 1. the subject experienced a clinically significant adverse effect to attributable to Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) during a previous trial that could put the subject at risk for further treatment with Safinamide 2. if female, the subject is pregnant or lactating 3. any medical issues, which have emerged since the initial clinical trial, that in the opinion of the investigator precludes a subject's ability to participate in this openlabel trial</criteria>
