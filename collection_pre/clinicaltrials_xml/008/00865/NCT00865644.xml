	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if imiquimod cream can reverse the growth of neurofibromas. Imiquimod is a skin cream that works by stimulating the body's immune system to respond to tumors. Imiquimod cream is approved for use in patients with various skin lesions, including actinic keratosis, superficial basal cell carcinoma, and external genital warts. Information from these studies, as well as previous laboratory studies, suggest that imiquimod cream may help shrink neurofibromas or keep them from growing.</brief_summary>
