	<brief_summary>Post-operative delirium is a common and deleterious complication in elderly patients. The investigators have previously found lower levels of serum tryptophan in post-operative elderly patients who developed delirium in comparison to post-operative elderly patients who did not develop delirium. The investigators hypothesize that post-operative supplementation of L-tryptophan will reduce the duration and incidence of post-operative delirium. This study is a double-blinded placebo controlled trial of L-tryptophan supplementation in post-operative ICU patients 60 years and older. The primary outcome measure is the comparison of duration of post-operative delirium in subjects who receive L-tryptophan supplementation versus a similar appearing control.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Included subjects will be 60 years and older undergoing an operation with a planned ICU admission postoperatively. Medications that, when combined with tryptophan, increase the risk of serotonin syndrome. The classes of medications include: monoamine oxidase inhibitors selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors triptans opioids central nervous system stimulants bupropion St. John's Wort Patients who undergo an operation on their brain. Factors which prevent delirium assessment with the CAMICU: vision impairment or nonfluent English speakers. A lowered seizure threshold including: history of seizure disorder alcohol abuse defined by a high AUDIT score (&gt;8 females and &gt;13 males) benzodiazepine or barbiturate abuse within three months of the study OR a positive urine toxicology screen for alcohol, benzodiazepines or barbiturates. Significant liver disease (Child's class B or greater) or significant renal disease (Creatinine â‰¥2.0). History of Huntington's or Addison's disease. (As requested by the FDA) History of bipolar disorder or a psychotic disorder (such as a psychotic major depression, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or psychosis in Alzheimer's disease or other dementia).
