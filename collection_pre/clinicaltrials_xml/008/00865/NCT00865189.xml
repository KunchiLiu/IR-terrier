	<brief_summary>This study will assess the efficacy and safety of two different neoadjuvant treatment approaches including Avastin in newly diagnosed patients with high risk locally advanced rectal cancer. Patients will be randomized into one of two treatment arms. Arm A will undergo an induction phase, consisting of 6 cycles of Avastin (5mg/kg iv) plus FOLFOX 4, followed by a 7 week chemoradiation phase, consisting of Avastin (5mg/kg iv) plus 5-FU plus radiotherapy, followed by surgery. Arm B will omit the induction phase, but will undergo the chemoradiation phase followed by surgery. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is &lt;100 individuals.</brief_summary>
