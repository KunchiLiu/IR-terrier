	<brief_summary>This study is conducted in Japanese newly diagnosed locally advanced SCCHN patients in order to assess tolerability and feasibility of Cetuximab plus concomitant boost radiotherapy (RT) regimen (the study treatment) and its safety profile (i.e. AEs: adverse events). In addition, efficacy (i.e. anti-tumor effect) of the study treatment is also evaluated.</brief_summary>

Serum calcium concentration: within normality 16. The patient is eligible if disease free from a previously treated malignancy for greater than three years. 17. The patient agrees to use effective contraception if procreative potential exists. 18. The patient has given signed informed consent 19. The patient who is a Japanese with Japanese citizenship 1. The patient has evidence of distant metastatic disease. The patient who has any metastatic disease documented by Magnetic Resonance Imaging for the head and neck, and Computed Tomography for the chest and abdomen should be excluded. 2. The patient has squamous cell carcinoma arising in the nasopharynx or oral cavity. 3. The patient has received prior systemic chemotherapy within the last three years. 4. The patient has undergone previous surgery for the tumor under study other than biopsy. 5. The patient has received prior radiation therapy to the head and neck. 6. The patient's radiation therapy is considered to be a part of a postoperative regimen following primary surgical resection. 7. The patient is pregnant or breast feeding. 8. The patient has received prior Cetuximab or murine monoclonal antibody (including chimeric antibody) therapy or a history of severe hypersensitivity to any component of Cetuximab solution for Injection. 9. The patient has a medical or psychological condition that would not permit the patient to complete the study or sign informed consent (including drug abuse). 10. The patient has uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, malignant hypertension, or liver failure. 11. The patient has or has suffered from a pulmonary fibrosis, acute pulmonary disorder, or interstitial pneumonia. 12. The patient has an active infection (infection requiring intravenous antibacterial, antifungus, or antiviral agent), or known and declared Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection. 13. The patient has a clinically relevant coronary artery disease or history of myocardial infarction in the last 12 months or high risk of uncontrolled arrhythmia or uncontrolled cardiac insufficiency 14. The patient has a dental disease which requires incision and drainage. 15. The patient has active multiple cancers (excluding skin cancer except for melanoma, and carcinoma in situ of the cervix or the digestive tract) in the last 3 years. 16. The patient has been received some investigational medication within 30 days before study entry.</criteria>
