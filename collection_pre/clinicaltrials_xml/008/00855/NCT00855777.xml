	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of etoricoxib compared with a well known and widely used non-steroid antinflammatory drug, ibuprofen, in third molar extraction pain. At this time, there are no data about the efficacy of etoricoxib for reducing pain following dental extraction. This will be a single center, randomized, double-blind study, in which patients with moderate to severe pain following third molar extraction will be randomized to receive etoricoxib (120 mg in a single dose + 2 dose of placebo pro day for 3 days) or ibuprofen (1800 mg in 3 doses pro day for 3 days). Paracetamol plus codeine will be used as rescue medication. Pain assessment will be performed using a 11-point pain intensity scale (0 = no pain and 10 = worster pain) during the first 3 days after dental extraction. Patients will be enrolled 15 days before the dental extraction. During enrollment visit a complete clinical evaluation with particular attention for potential exclusion criteria (e.g. hypertension and cardiovascular risk factors) as well as blood analyses will be performed. A follow-up visit will be performed 15 days after the dental extraction. Tolerability will be assessed through recording of adverse events.</brief_summary>
