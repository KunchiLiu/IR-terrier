	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Acyclovir may be effective in preventing herpes simplex virus infection in patients with neutropenia. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying the side effects of acyclovir and is comparing two doses of acyclovir in preventing herpes simplex virus infection in patients with neutropenia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To determine the difference in nephrotoxicity between low-dose and weight-based intravenous acyclovir sodium as herpes simplex virus infection prophylaxis in patients with neutropenia. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive weight-based IV acyclovir sodium every 8 or 12 hours. - Arm II: Patients receive low-dose IV acyclovir sodium every 8 or 12 hours. Treatment continues for approximately 2 weeks unless clinical herpes simplex virus infection is confirmed or the patient is no longer neutropenic.</detailed_description>
