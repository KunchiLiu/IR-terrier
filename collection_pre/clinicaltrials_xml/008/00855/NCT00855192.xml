	<brief_summary>Approximately 20% of pregnant women experience depression. Untreated depression during pregnancy is linked to decreased prenatal care, difficulties in the pregnancy, poorer outcomes for the baby, and developmental, language, and behaviour problems in the older child. While medication can often offer relief, pregnant women suffering with depression are often reluctant to take medications that may affect the unborn baby. There is little research about the effectiveness of other treatments such as support groups. The investigators project will provide relaxation groups for pregnant women with anxiety and depression. The group will provide a chance to get support from other pregnant women. Two health care specialists will provide information about anxiety and depression. They will also teach the skills for women to manage their symptoms. Women will be asked to complete a few questionnaires to evaluate their symptoms before, during, and after they join the group. They will also be asked to evaluate how the group met their needs.</brief_summary>
