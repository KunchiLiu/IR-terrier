	<brief_summary>The goal of the study is to develop and organize an effort to identify genes that determine an individual's risk for developing Parkinson's disease (PD). 1. To ascertain, study and establish a repository of DNA samples that will allow for the identification of known and yet-to-be-identified genetic markers associated with the development of PD. 2. To create a database with clinical, genetic (HLA, genome screen) and medical history information that will facilitate the search for PD susceptibility genes. 3. To provide a centralized DNA repository to allow for targeted studies of genetic factors contributing to the onset, heterogeneity and progression of PD. 4. To evaluate opportunities to extend the results of research to develop methods of risk prediction, prevention and therapy for PD.</brief_summary>
