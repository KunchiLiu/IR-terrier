	<brief_summary>This was a Phase II, open-label, single-arm, single-stage, multicenter trial in patients with relapsed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with the objective of assessing the activity of the combination of erlotinib and pertuzumab on the basis of the endpoint of FDG-PET response rate.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0, 1, or 2. Recurrent or progressive disease after receiving at least 1, but no more than two, chemotherapy regimens for advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Recovery from reversible acute effects of prior anticancer therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or investigational treatment) to National Cancer InstituteCommon Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCICTCAE) Grade ≤ 1 (excluding alopecia). Ability to comply with the study and followup procedures, including all specified imaging studies. Ability to take oral medication. Life expectancy ≥ 3 months. Measurable disease on computed tomography (CT). At least 1 extracerebral lesion on 2deoxy2[18F]fluoroDglucosepositron emission tomography (FDGPET) scan that is suitable for response assessment, that is measurable, and ≥ 15 mm on CT. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50%, as determined by echocardiogram or MUltiple Gated Acquisition (MUGA) scan. For women of childbearing potential and men with partners of childbearing potential, agreement to use a highly effective nonhormonal form of contraception or two effective forms of nonhormonal contraception by the patient and/or partner. Availability and willingness to provide sufficient tumor tissue for testing for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, and other human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) pathway and NSCLCrelated biomarkers. Prior treatment with an investigational or marketed agent for the purpose of inhibiting HER family members (including HER1, HER2, HER3, and HER4). This includes, but is not limited to erlotinib, gefitinib, pertuzumab, cetuximab, and panitumumab. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or investigational treatment within 28 days of start of study (ie, prior to Day 0) or from which patients have not yet recovered. Inability to take oral medications, disease affecting gastrointestinal absorption, or prior surgical procedure affecting gastrointestinal absorption. Uncontrolled diabetes. Clinical or radiographic evidence of new or progression of preexisting central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Current severe, uncontrolled systemic disease (eg, clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, or metabolic disease; woundhealing disorders; ulcers; or bone fractures). Current uncontrolled hypertension or unstable angina. History of congestive heart failure (CHF) of any New York Heart Association (NYHA) criteria, or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment (exceptions: atrial fibrillation, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia). History of myocardial infarction within 6 months of enrollment or history of unstable angina. Any evidence of an unstable infection as suggested by an infectious process, coupled with hypotension and/or tachycardia and/or fever and/or positive blood culture. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Uncontrolled hypercalcemia. Pregnancy or lactation. History of another malignancy in the past 2 years, unless the malignancy has been adequately treated, is currently not detectable, and is associated with a 5year survival &gt; 90%. Claustrophobia. Any other disease, condition, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding that, in the opinion of the investigator, makes the patient inappropriate for the study.</criteria>
