	<brief_title>Correlation of Cerebral State Index With the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale in Mechanically Ventilated ICU Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently there are no objective methods to measure levels of sedation in all ICU patient populations. This generally does not become problematic in most patients. However, certain populations cannot be assessed by standard means. These populations would include patients who are quadriplegic and those who are being treated with neuromuscular blocking agents. The current norm is to use a sedation scale such as the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale to assess the patient's level of sedation. An alternative to this would be to use an EEG based method that monitors brain activity. New methods of monitoring brain activity, using cerebral state monitors may provide an effective means of monitoring sedation. The cerebral state monitor, however, and the parameters it provides, the cerebral state index, has not been tested in an ICU setting. Correlating the measurements gained from the cerebral state monitor with the RASS assessment from sedated ICU patients may allow us to develop a method of monitoring sedation in populations that were impossible to monitor previously. Accurately monitoring the level of sedation in these patients may help decrease the incidence of over-sedation and under-sedation.</detailed_description>
