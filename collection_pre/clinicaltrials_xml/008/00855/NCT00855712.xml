	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to compare survival of both patients and newly transplanted hearts following heart transplantation among patients who were transplanted with donated hearts preserved on ice and those who were transplanted with donated hearts using the Organ Care System (OCS). The Organ care system preserves the hearts in a warm blood perfused beating state. The study also compares the number of rejection episodes, heart related adverse events, ICU time, and ventilation time between the two groups. The study is considered a success if survival in the OCS group was not inferior to the ice group.</brief_summary>
