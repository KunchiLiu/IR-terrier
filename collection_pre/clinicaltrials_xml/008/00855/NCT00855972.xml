	<brief_title>Low Dose Naltrexone for the Treatment of Juvenile Primary Fibromyalgia Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this pilot dosage-finding and efficacy study, we will experimentally test whether LDN reduces the symptoms of JPFS. We will recruit 40 children with JPFS. Participants will be screened via the JPFS criteria of Yunus and Masi. The study will be an open-label test of various doses of LDN to determine whether LDN reduces JPFS symptoms, and the appropriate dose at which it does so. Primary endpoints will be daily pain, fatigue, and sleep. The protocol is designed to take 18 weeks. There are a total of 10 study visits, taking place approximately every 2 weeks.</detailed_description>
