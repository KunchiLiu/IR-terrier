	<brief_title>Study Examining the Effect of Exercise in People With Rheumatoid Arthritis Taking Anti-TNFalpha Medication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Substantial progress has been made in the medical management of RA over the past decade but at present no drug therapy leads to long-term remission for all patients with RA. People may still continue to experience physical, psychological and functional consequences which could benefit from rehabilitation.little research exists on the effects of exercise for people with RA taking anti-TNFalpha therapy medication. It is proposed to conduct a randomized controlled trial to examine the effects of group exercise therapy in a gym setting or in a hydrotherapy pool compared to a control group.</detailed_description>
