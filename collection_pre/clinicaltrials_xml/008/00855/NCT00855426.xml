	<brief_summary>Nondisplaced hip fractures may be radiographically occult and require MRI or single photon emission CT bone scintigraphy for accurate diagnosis. Both examinations are expensive and are not readily available in many hospitals. Ultrasound (US) examination is relatively inexpensive and preliminary data had demonstrated its efficacy in detecting occult fractures in other sites. Our objective is to evaluate US examination as a screening tool for occult hip fractures in posttraumatic painful hips in the elderly.</brief_summary>
