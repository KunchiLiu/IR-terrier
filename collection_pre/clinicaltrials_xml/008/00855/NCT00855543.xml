	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to better understand (1) if phospholipase A2 producing microorganisms and cytokines (IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-13) are associated with premature labor (2) if pregnant teens are more likely to have phospholipase A2 producing bacteria than a pregnant adults and (3) if there is a difference in the cytokines between pregnant teens and adults.We hypothesize that phospholipase producing microorganisms may trigger the onset of premature labor. The following are hypothesized: (a) The microorganism cultured should show high activities of phospholipase A2 (b) The cervical length measurement predictive value should correspond to the gestation age at term (c) Vaginal flora of teen will be more susceptible to colonization with higher phospholipase A2 producing bacteria than that of an adult (d) The maternal genotype contribution to the concentration of IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, and TNF-alpha during the first trimester of pregnancy in teens is different in the production of inflammatory cytokines and modulators(e) The maternal genotype of teens therefore influences the production of phospholipase A2 and causes an increase in preterm delivery.</brief_summary>
