	<brief_summary>This study will look at whether our drug (sorafenib) in combination with chemotherapy delivered directly into your tumor using beads (DC Bead) will slow the progression of the disease. The beads used with the chemotherapy will slowly release the chemotherapy reducing the adverse effects that normally occur with chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study of Sorafenib or Placebo in Combination With Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) Performed With DC Bead and Doxorubicin for Intermediate Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC).</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Safety issues will be reported in Adverse Event section. In addition to the secondary outcome measures, Biomarkers and Patient Report Outcome will also be analyzed as other variables.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Unresectable, multinodular asymptomatic tumor without vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread Confirmed Diagnosis of HCC: Cirrhotic subjects: Clinical diagnosis by American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) criteria HCC can be defined in cirrhotic subjects by one imaging technique (Computed tomography [CT] scan, Magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], or second generation contrast ultrasound) showing a nodule larger than 2 cm with contrast uptake in the arterial phase and washout in venous or late phases or two imaging techniques showing this radiological behavior for nodules of 12 cm in diameter. Cytohistological confirmation is required for subjects who do not fulfill these eligibility criteria. Noncirrhotic subjects: For subjects without cirrhosis, histological or cytological confirmation is mandatory Documentation of original biopsy for diagnosis is acceptable Child Pugh class A without ascites Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function as assessed by central lab by means of the following laboratory requirements from samples within 7 days prior to randomization: Patients on a liver transplantation list or with advanced liver disease as defined below: Child Pugh B and C Active gastrointestinal bleeding Encephalopathy Ascites Lesions having previously been treated with local therapy such as resection of HCC, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) or cryoablation can not be selected as the target lesions.</criteria>
