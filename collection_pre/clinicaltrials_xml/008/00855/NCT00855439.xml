	<detailed_description>This study will look at the effects of the medication exenatide on peripheral neuropathy in people with type 2 diabetes. Exenatide (trade name, BYETTA®) is an injectable medication used by people with type 2 diabetes to control blood sugar. Peripheral neuropathy is a complication of diabetes that can cause symptoms such as numbness, tingling or burning sensations in the feet and hands. Controlling blood sugars levels in type 2 diabetes is thought to prevent, delay or improve the damage to the nerve fibers that causes peripheral neuropathy. There is also some evidence that exenatide may have additional beneficial effects on the peripheral nerves, beyond the benefits of blood sugar control alone. In this study, about half of the participants will take exenatide by injection twice daily and the other half will take insulin glargine (Lantus®) by injection once daily. Both groups are expected to have similar improvement in blood sugar control. This study will show whether exenatide has beneficial effects on neuropathy beyond the benefits of better blood sugar control alone.</detailed_description>
