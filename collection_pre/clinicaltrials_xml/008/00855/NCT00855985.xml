	<brief_summary>There are two principal ways of draining the remnant of the pancreas back into the intestine after removal of the head of the pancreas for cancer. This can be performed either to the jejunum or to the stomach. The aim of this study is to randomly allocate consenting patients to one of the two arms to study whether the leak rates from the anastomosis and the outcomes after the surgery are affected. Previous papers have shown similar results in both groups although non randomized data suggested that the Pancreaticogastrostomy (drainage into the stomach) may be superior</brief_summary>
