	<brief_summary>The rationale underlying the study is that donor site bleeding is common and often problematic when presenting to the burn surgeon or staff. Frequently, gauze wound dressings are not sufficiently hemostatic to control a donor site bleed thereby leading to administration of vasoconstrictive agents and repeated application of wound dressing/pressure. The hemostatic textile Stasilonâ„¢ has proven superior to gauze in reducing bleeding from anesthetized pigs undergoing standardized surgically-induced trauma. Also, observational case reports have noted cessation of bleeding in a limited number of human patients with difficult to control bleeds.</brief_summary>
