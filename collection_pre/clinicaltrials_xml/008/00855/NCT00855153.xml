	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pilot study is to begin the examination of the feasibility of using Gradual Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy and D-Cycloserine (DCS) in the management of posttraumatic psychological symptoms in burned OIF/OEF military combatants. The purpose of a feasibility study is to determine if there is clinical utility in this proposed treatment and to establish effective and safe treatment procedures. Given current literature, the following hypotheses are generated: Hypothesis 1: Virtual Reality Exposure and D-Cycloserine medication (VRE + DCS learning pill) will result in clinically meaningful PTSD symptom reduction. 1. SMs will attain scores that are lower than initial measures for symptoms of PTSD 2. By the completion of VRE, Ss will attain scores in the sub-clinical range for measures of clinical depression Hypothesis 2: SMs will report greater life satisfaction following completion of VR+DCS treatment, as measured by scores on the Quality of Life Inventory (QOLI) when compared to pre-treatment scores</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to establish systematic observations about the feasibility of using gradual exposure virtual reality treatment and D-Cycloserine (VRE + DCS) with service members receiving medical care for burns attained during combat. The rational for this study comes from the need to establish with this population, when and how VRE + DCS might be delivered in a safe and systematic fashion. This would be done in preparation for the potential of a future controlled study to address the efficacy of VRE + DCS in comparison to each component and control group. This study seeks to establish methods of applying VRE + DCS in relation to medical viability as an attempt to clarify at what stage of medical care a service member is able to give informed consent, follow the proscribed instructions, and participate in VRE+ DCS process to include reasonable attention and capacity for immersion. Other areas that will be examined include medication suitability, expected course of medical treatment that would allow for reasonable completion of twelve sessions within twenty weeks, and assessed stability in social support.</detailed_description>
