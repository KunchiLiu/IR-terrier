	<brief_summary>Purpose: Hemodialysis-dependent patients with an end-stage renal disease (ESRD) suffer from a number of distressing symptoms, such as pain, poor mental health, fatigue, sleep disturbance and pruritus. These negatively influence health-related quality of life in ESRD patients, and some of them result in increased mortality and hospitalization. Acupuncture is a widely employed treatment on several chronic disease or condition. Adjunctive use of acupuncture with conventional treatment could be a possible therapeutic option to establish an optimal care for ESRD patients who experiences co-morbid conditions or complications of hemodialysis. Due to its non-pharmacologic feature, the effects of acupuncture without involving altered pharmacokinetics and drug-interactions in hemodialysis patients, might be another strong point compared to other pharmacological interventions. However, little information is available for the effects and the safety of acupuncture for symptomatic care of hemodialysis patients. Thus, the investigators propose whether acupuncture could be a effective and safe therapeutic modality for a number of patient-reported symptoms in hemodialysis-dependent patients with ESRD.</brief_summary>
