	<criteria>Patients age 18 years or more. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of nonsmallcell lung carcinoma.(and indifferentiated and BAC histology). Only patients with advanced disease, defined as stage IV or IIIB with/without pleural effusion, will be included. Tumor sample available. A measurable lesion, as defined by RECIST criteria. Karnofsky score 60% or more (ECOG &lt; 2). Patients should not have received previous treatment with chemotherapy or other agents for disseminated disease. Chemotherapy is allowed if the initial diagnosis of the patient is limited disease and the patient has received adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment. Patients with cerebral disease are permitted, without any time limitations after holocranial irradiation or complementary antiedema treatment. Patients with hepatical, renal and hematology normality values. Patients should sign an informed consent form before inclusion in the study that specifies that the clinical trial treatment entails consent for the analysis of biological samples of tumor and blood. Patients of childbearing age of either sex must use effective contraceptive methods (barrier methods or other birth control methods) before entering the study and while participating in the study. Patients must be available for clinical followup.. Patients who have received an investigational medicinal product in the 21 days before inclusion in the study or antiEGFR receptor agent.
