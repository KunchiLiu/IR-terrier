	<brief_summary>This study examines patients with chronic kidney disease-related anemia and measures changes in the metabolism of the heart using FDG/PET scanning, before and 6 months after their health-care provider has initiated anemia management therapy with the FDA-approved drug darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp), which is approved for chronic kidney disease-related anemia. The investigators hypothesize that the heart has abnormal metabolism with the anemia of chronic kidney disease but this improves after correction of this anemia with darbepoetin alfa.</brief_summary>
