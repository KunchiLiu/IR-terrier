Patients will be randomized to receive gemcitabine (1250mg/m2 iv) on days 1 and 8, and cisplatin (75mg/m2) or carboplatin (5xAUC)on day 1, followed by Tarceva 150mg/day or placebo from day 15 to day 28 of each 4 week cycle for a total of 6 cycles,then followed by Tarceva or placebo monotherapy.The anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.</brief_summary>
