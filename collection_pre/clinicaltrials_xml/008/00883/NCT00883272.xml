	<brief_title>Effect of DT56a (Femarelle) on the Coagulation System in the Treatment of Postmenopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women using hormone therapy (HT) are at an increased relative risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). The frequency of inherited Factor V Leiden and other risk factors for VTE in the general population is estimated at 5-10%. This population has a 5-21 fold greater risk to develop VTE. Therefore, given the high thrombotic risk for the combination of hormone use and hereditary prothrombotic abnormalities these women's symptoms frequently go untreated for lack of alternative therapies. DT56a (Femarelle) is a soy derived compound that has been shown to act as a novel selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) in the alleviation of menopausal symptoms and prevention of postmenopausal bone loss without effecting the endometrium or the sex hormone blood profile. The research question of the current study is to assess the effect of femeralle on the coagulation system and determine if it is a reasonable and safe alternative for the treatment of menopausal symptoms in thrombophilic women.</detailed_description>
