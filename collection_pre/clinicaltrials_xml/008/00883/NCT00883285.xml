	<brief_title>Incidence and Severity of Silent and Apparent Cerebral Embolism After Conventional and Minimal-invasive Transfemoral Aortic Valve Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergoing aortic valve repair (AVR) are included prospectively into the study. AVR techniques include the conventional technique, the transfemoral and the transapical approach. Before the intervention CT of the chest is performed preoperatively to assess the degree of aortic and aortic valve calcification. Patients undergo MRI of the brain, including diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and neurological assessment (NIHSS score) within 48 h before and after the procedure to assess occurrence of cerebral embolism.</detailed_description>
