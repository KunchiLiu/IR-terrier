The population occidental becomes fat each time, and this symptom is associated the biggest risk for the OSAS. Snore presence is extremely associated with OSAS. Snoring is present in about 90 - 95% of the patients with OSAS. Objectives: Evaluate the influence in the Stanford classification as predictor factor of gravity of the OSAS. Materials and Methods: They evaluated and classified 107 patients, Classification of Mallampati, Friedman, Classification of Stanford and how much the gravity of the OSAS for the AIH.</brief_summary>
