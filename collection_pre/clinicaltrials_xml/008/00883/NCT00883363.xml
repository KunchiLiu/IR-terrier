	<brief_summary>Preconditioning in patients treated for elective abdominal aneurysm showed that the rate of perioperative myocardial infarction could be reduced by 80 %(ARR from 27% to 5%). Precondition where performed by 10 minutes of clamping of each iliac arteries before clamping the abdominal aorta. Human studies in cardiac patients have shown promising results with precondition. Instead of clamping arteries they have all performed the procedure by inflating a blood pressure cuff above arterial pressure on a arm. The investigators want to investigate if preconditioning induced by a blood pressure cuff on a arm can reduce the perioperative rate of myocardial infarction in patients open operated for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.</brief_summary>
