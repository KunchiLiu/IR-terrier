	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn what effect rapid atrial pacing (in patients with dual chamber pacemakers) will have on the electrocardiogram including the QT Interval. The investigators are also interested in the differences caused by genes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Rapid Atrial Pacing Has on the Electrocardiogram (ECG) in Patients With Dual Chamber Pacemakers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study requires a total of two study days as well as two follow up visits. During study day one, baseline blood will be drawn, a baseline electrocardiogram will be performed, and continuous QT Interval monitoring will be performed. The pacemaker rate will be increased to 90bpm at different time intervals and additional blood will be drawn to measure the effects of these rates changes. On study day two, baseline blood will be drawn, a urine specimen will be obtained, an electrocardiogram will be performed, and continuous QT Interval monitoring will be performed. Following the acquisition of this information, the pacemaker rate will be decreased to 80bpm. We will obtain blood specimens, a urine specimen and an electrocardiogram at 30 minutes post rate change and again at 60 minutes post rate change. Two days following the rate decrease to 80bpm, the patient will return to clinic to have their rate decreased to 70bpm. In two more days, the patient will return for a final rate change to 60bpm.</detailed_description>
