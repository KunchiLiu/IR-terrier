	<brief_title>Study of Adherence to Colonoscopy in Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer death in women. Although there are a variety of options for colon cancer screening, colonoscopy is thought to be the best modality for women. Despite recommendations by multiple societies, adherence to CRC screening among women is suboptimal. One possible barrier to adherence may be the gender of the endoscopist. Recent studies have shown that a large proportion of surveyed women would prefer a woman endoscopist. These studies suggest that having the option of a woman endoscopist would increase adherence to colonoscopy; however, there is no published literature that addresses this question. Hypothesis Women who are offered screening colonoscopy will be more likely to schedule and complete this procedure if they are given the option of a woman endoscopist. Specific Aims Primary - Determine whether the option of a woman endoscopist is associated with increased woman patient adherence to screening colonoscopy. - Assess the proportion of women who request a woman endoscopist when this option is made available to them. Secondary * Identify socio-demographic predictors of (a) completing a screening colonoscopy and (b) requesting a woman endoscopist (e.g. race/ethnicity, age, health insurance, marital status).</detailed_description>
