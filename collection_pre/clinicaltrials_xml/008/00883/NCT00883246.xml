	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Has a Rutherford Clinical Category Score of 1 6. Has evidence of ≥ 50% stenosis or occlusion in the superficial femoral, popliteal, anterior tibial, posterior tibial and/or peroneal arteries, confirmed by angiography. Has identifiable distal target vessel which upon completion of the intervention, is anticipated to provide reconstitution of blood flow to the foot. Exchangeable guidewire must cross lesion(s), with ability of catheter to cross lesion. Each discrete target lesion's length is ≤ 20 cm. Reference vessel diameter is ≥ 1.5 mm and ≤ 7 mm. Exclusion Criteria Has surgical or endovascular procedure of the target vessel within 14 days prior to the index procedure. Has any planned surgical intervention or endovascular procedure within 30 days after the index procedure. Has had a previous peripheral bypass affecting the target limb. Has endstage renal disease defined as undergoing hemodialysis for kidney failure. Has presence of severe calcification in target lesion(s). Has instent restenosis of the target lesion. Has an aneurysmal target vessel. Has significant stenosis or occlusion of inflow tract that has not been revascularized prior to treatment of the target vessel. Has perforation, dissection or other injury of the access or target vessel requiring additional stenting or surgical intervention prior to enrollment. Has disease that precludes safe advancement of the SilverHawk/TurboHawk device to the target lesion(s). Has had a previous amputation above the metatarsal line on the target limb. Has endstage renal disease defined as undergoing hemodialysis for kidney failure.</criteria>
