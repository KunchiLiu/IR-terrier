It is important for correlation with chronic cardiovascular disease that leaves an increase in morbimortality and socioeconomic disability to patients with apnea. Objectives: Determinate the correlation between Friedman Classification and the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) gravity through AHI (Apnea Hypopnea Index) in patients with OSAS for surgical indication and evaluation. Materials and Methods: The investigators evaluated and classified 84 patients, in the scale of Epworth, Friedman and how much the gravity of the SAHOS for the AHI.</brief_summary>
