	<brief_title>Dose-ranging Study of Oral COL-144 in Acute Migraine Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Migraine is a common chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent disabling episodes of moderate to severe headache accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. Acute pharmacologic therapy for migraine aims to terminate the attack or reduce its severity., Analgesics are commonly used or, if these are ineffective, triptans. Since triptans are contraindicated in patients with coronary artery disease, uncontrolled hypertension, and cerebrovascular disease alternative medications are required for patients where simple analgesics do not work. COL-144 has no vasoconstrictor activity at clinically relevant concentrations and might meet this need. COL-144 was effective when given intravenously in a placebo-controlled dose-ranging study. This study investigates which dose of oral COL-144 is effective in the in acute treatment of migraine headache.</detailed_description>
