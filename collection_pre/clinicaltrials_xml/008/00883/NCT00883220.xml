	<brief_title>Self Management in Urinary Catheter Users</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Urinary catheter users commonly experience adverse health effects, such as urinary tract infection (UTI), blockage, dislodgement, and leakage, leading to poor quality of life indicators. Catheter-related problems often require health care utilization resulting in increased health care costs. Self-management of urine flow is an essential part of self-care for people with long-term urinary catheters and may lead to prevention or reduction of catheter-related problems and improved quality of life.This study tests the effectiveness of a urinary catheter self-management intervention in a randomized trial of 220 patients, with 12 months of follow-up. The experimental intervention is designed to enhance self-management of urine flow in individuals with long-term urinary catheters, with the goal of decreasing catheter related complications and enhancing quality of life.</detailed_description>
