	<brief_title>A Study of Neutropenia and Anemia Management in Patients With Solid Tumors Receiving Myelotoxic Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center international observational study of patients receiving myelotoxic regimens, with an investigator assessed risk of febrile neutropenia ≥ 20%, for the treatment of solid tumors (breast, ovarian and lung). This is an observational study in which patient risk factors were qualitatively (but not quantitatively) assessed, and adherence to G-CSF primary prophylaxis was at the discretion of physicians and not mandated by the protocol.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects greater than or equal to 18 years old with breast, ovarian or lung cancer receiving chemotherapy in any schedule, e.g. dose dense or standard chemotherapy. These subjects must have an Investigator assessed risk of febrile neutropenia (FN) ≥20% (based on 2006 European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) GCSF Guidelines Subjects with concurrent administration of radiotherapy are not eligible (previous radiotherapy is permitted if terminated at least 2 weeks prior to commencing applicable chemotherapy in this study).</criteria>
