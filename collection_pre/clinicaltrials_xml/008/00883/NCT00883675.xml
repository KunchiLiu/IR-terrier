	<brief_title>Safety Study of Adjuvant Docetaxel-Carboplatin Treatment for Resected Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with stage Ib - IIIa NSCLC participated in an open-label, single arm study to assess the safety and tolerability of docetaxel (75 mg/kg) and carboplatin (AUC 5.5) administered for 3 cycles after resection for curative intent. The primary endpoint of the study was safety, as reflected by a febrile neutropenia rate of &lt;10%. Other endpoints assessed protocol compliance and the impact of minimally invasive surgical technique.</detailed_description>
