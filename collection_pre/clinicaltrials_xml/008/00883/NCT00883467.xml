	<brief_summary>Ischemia reperfusion injury may be reduced by ischemic preconditioning. This projects aims to show the effects of short and long time ischemic preconditioning (both sequences 3 x 5 minutes) during and after an ischemic period of 20 minutes in healthy subjects by functional MRI. Ischemia is produces by cuff inflation to a suprasystolic pressure on one tight. Signal is acquired from calf muscles. A cross-over design of 4 to 8 study periods is used, 4 different study days with 2 different MR measurement methods (BOLD imaging and high energy phosphates) are planned.</brief_summary>
