	<brief_summary>Inflammatory arthritis is a major cause of permanent joint damage. Joint damage causes functional disability and physical deformity. Many inflammatory arthritis patients develop permanent joint damage within the first two years of disease. Early, aggressive treatment with drugs called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is known to reduce how quickly this damage occurs. Sometimes, however, even when patients' symptoms are under control, the disease continues to cause joint damage. This study will determine if magnetic resonance imaging (also known as 'MRI') conducted every six months provides arthritis specialists with information to help them better treat peripheral inflammatory arthritis patients over the first two years of care. The effect of MRI will be compared to 1) the use of x-ray every six months; and, 2) the frequency at which these tests are usually used. The study will also determine if differences in treatment between the three groups result in differences in the well-being of patients. A total of 186 patients with early signs of inflammatory arthritis will be studied. All participants will have an MRI and x-ray conducted every six months. One-third of participants (62 in total) will only have MRI information sent to their arthritis specialist (MRI group); 62 will have x-ray information sent (X-ray group); and, the remaining 62 will have x-ray information sent only when ordered by the arthritis specialist (Usual Care group). Negative disease progression reports will be sent to the arthritis specialist unless intervention allocation-specific disease progression is detected. In which case, a report blinded to imaging modality will be sent indicating the detection of disease progression relative to the last timepoint of progression, or baseline, as applicable. At any point in the study, the arthritis specialist can request a clinical MRI or x-ray for any participant. Neither the participants nor their doctors will know to which group they are assigned. A computer program will randomly assign participants to one of the three groups using a technique called minimization. This technique accounts for differences between participants that are known to effect disease progression and treatment decisions. Using this technique, participants with similar disease will be evenly distributed between the three groups. The results of this study will have a direct impact on care for new inflammatory arthritis patients. It will determine the benefits, if any, of regular monitoring of disease progression with MRI or x-ray. Using tests proven to help treatment decision-making, arthritis specialists will improve the care provided to new inflammatory arthritis patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Biannual Monitoring With Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), X-ray, or Usual Care on Treatment for Inflammatory Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed project is a double-blinded randomized-controlled trial to determine if biannual monitoring of inflammatory arthritis disease progression with 1.0T peripheral magnetic resonance imaging (pMRI) of the 2nd to 5th metacarpophalangeal joints of the worst-effected or dominant hand at baseline compared to conventional radiography of both hands and wrists, or standard of care, alters the frequency of pharmacological treatment escalation at two years. A sample size of 186 (62 per group) is required to determine mean differences in the rate of pharmacological treatment escalation between the three groups with 90% power at a 5% level of significance, assuming a 5% spontaneous remission rate, 15% missing data, and 5% annual attrition.</detailed_description>
