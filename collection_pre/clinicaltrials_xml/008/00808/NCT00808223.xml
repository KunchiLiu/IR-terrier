	<brief_title>Safety and Pharmacokinetics (PK) of Alefacept in Adolescent Subjects With Moderate to Severe Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A planned interim analysis will be conducted to evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics following the Week 4 evaluation of approximately the first 12 subjects. A dose adjustment may be implemented based on these results. A preliminary review of the Week 4 pharmacokinetics of the first 6 subjects will occur to monitor exposure. If a dose adjustment is required, pharmacokinetics will be repeated for the first 12 subjects enrolled at the new dose (subjects 13-24).</detailed_description>
