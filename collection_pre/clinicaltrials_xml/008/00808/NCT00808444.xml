	<brief_summary>The purpose of the present study is to demonstrate that the changes in the manufacturing process for the commercial lot of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine GSK1024850A have no clinical impact and that the immune responses are non-inferior to the immune responses induced by the clinical lot. The study will be conducted in Singapore and Malaysia.</brief_summary>
