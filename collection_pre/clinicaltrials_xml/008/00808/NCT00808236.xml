	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study was to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of early intranasal cooling prior to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in the emergency medical services (EMS) environment. It was hypothesized that cooling during the resuscitation attempt would increase ROSC and subsequent survival. The study was not powered to demonstrate statistically-significant differences in any outcome parameter, but was intended as an exploratory study only.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Out of hospital cardiac arrest remains a significant cause of death. Mild hypothermia induced after resuscitation from cardiac arrest has been shown to improve neurologically intact survival. Studies in dogs and rodents have demonstrated improved outcomes when cooling is initiated intra-arrest. The RhinoChill is a non-invasive cooling device through which rapid cooling is achieved via the intranasal delivery of an evaporative coolant into the nasopharynx. Due to its non-invasive and portable nature, the RhinoChill can be used to begin cooling earlier than other cooling devices. Studies performed using the RhinoChill in a porcine model of cardiac arrest suggest that cooling with the RhinoChill prior to the first defibrillation attempt facilitates resuscitation and improves resuscitation rate and neurologically intact survival. This study is being performed to assess the feasibility of using the RhinoChill device in the pre-hospital setting to improve resuscitation from cardiac arrest.</detailed_description>
