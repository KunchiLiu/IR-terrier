	<brief_summary>The aim of this protocol is to investigate a novel form of immune therapy for patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) who are in remission (CR) but who are at high risk for relapse.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial of Cytotoxic T Cells Augmenting Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell (AHSC) Transplantation for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Aim: To conduct a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of autologous CTL-mediated immunotherapy in a homogeneous group of patients with AML who have recently received an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Specifically: Phase 1: To determine the MTD of autologous AML-reactive cultured CTL in patients with AML who have recently received an AHSCT. Phase 2: To determine 1 year progression-free survival of the study group vs institutional historical control group composed of a sequential series of recent patients who have received an AHSCT for AML.</detailed_description>
