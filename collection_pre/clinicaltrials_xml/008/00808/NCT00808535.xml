	<brief_summary>The goal of this research study is to demonstrate that Cardiac Perfusion MRI with Vasomotor Stress may serve as a non-invasive and less risky imaging technique for detecting non-obstructive perfusion deficits and/or abnormalities in myocardial blood flow (MBF) in patients with endothelial dysfunction. This is a controlled study, which will enroll approximately 60 subjects (30 diabetics and 30 non-diabetics to serve as healthy controls), and will include male and non-pregnant females, between the ages 18-50 years. All eligible participants will sign an informed consent and will complete a Lifestyle Questionnaire. They will undergo blood work which includes: - 2-hour Oral Glucose Tolerance Test and Fasting Labs for Glucose, Insulin, C-Peptide, HbA1c, Creatinine, and Lipid Panel. - Urine Albumin to Creatinine ratio for microalbuminuria. - Serum inflammatory markers: E-selectin, homocysteine, ADMA, VCAM, IL-6, TNFalpha, hs-CRP and PAI-1. After blood work, all participants will undergo cardiac MR perfusion imaging procedure with Cold Pressor Test and Adenosine Stress Test.</brief_summary>
