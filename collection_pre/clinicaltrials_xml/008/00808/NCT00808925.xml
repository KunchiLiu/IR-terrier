	<brief_summary>There is growing evidence to conclude that part of the cascade leading to heatstroke is related to an inflammatory reaction triggered by the heat stress. The reduced ability to sustain heat stress - "heat intolerance" is also attributed to over-expression of inflammatory cytokines. Acclimation to heat improves human sustainability to heat and is a leading protective factor against heat stroke. The investigators hypothesize that the lower stress encountered during the process of acclimation to heat will be reflected by an over-ride in the expression of anti-inflammatory over the pro-inflammatory cytokines. This, in turn will attenuate the pathological cascade leading to heat stroke.</brief_summary>
