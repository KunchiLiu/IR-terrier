	<brief_summary>Although statin prior to PCI has favorable effects in stable angina and ACS except ST elevation MI (STEMI), there have been few studies for STEMI. Celik T et al. reported in patients with STEMI that prior statin use may improve coronary blood flow after PCI in patients with AMI, possibly by its beneficial effects on microvascular function. But this study was retrospective, non-randomized study and evaluated the effects for chronic statin therapy not acute high dose effect. Therefore, the investigators investigated whether acute high-dose statin prior to primary PCI in ST segment elevation myocardial infarction can have beneficial effect or not for periprocedural period and 30 days-cardiac events.</brief_summary>
