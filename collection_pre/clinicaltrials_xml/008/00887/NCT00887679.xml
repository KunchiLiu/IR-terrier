	<brief_title>Treatment Effects of Escitalopram (LexaproÂ®) on Generalized Anxiety Disorder in Patients With HIV and AIDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anxiety disorders are twice as prevalent among HIV-infected patients as they are in the general population. Approximately 25%-40% of HIV-infected patients have anxiety disorders; Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic disorder and post-traumatic Stress Disorder being the most frequent. Non-adherence to anti-retroviral medications is commonly seen in patients with HIV with GAD.The role of specific selective serotonin reuptake (SSRIs) in the treatment of HIV-patients with GAD is unclear. Escitalopram has been used in the treatment of GAD in the general population. It has been shown to be safe in HIV-patients with a tolerable side-effect profile. However, whether it can improve GAD in HIV-infected patients has not yet been investigated.</detailed_description>
