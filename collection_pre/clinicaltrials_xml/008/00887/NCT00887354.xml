	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate whether teriparatide is superior to the active comparator in the change from baseline of lumbar spine BMD (bone mineral density) in men and postmenopausal women with low bone mass and a recent pertrochanteric hip fracture.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study That Will Compare the Effect of Two Drugs on Participants With Low Bone Mass and a Recent Hip Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study has 3 periods: a screening phase, a double-blind, double-dummy treatment phase from the time of randomization to the 26 weeks visit, and an open-label treatment phase of approximately 12 month duration, where participants will continue treatment with the same study drug that they were randomized to.</detailed_description>
