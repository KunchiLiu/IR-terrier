	<brief_title>Comparison of Sleep Study Results After Partial Intracapsular Tonsillectomy Versus Total Tonsillectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives: To demonstrate similar improvement in sleep-disordered breathing as determined by polysomnography (PSG) with microdebrider-assisted partial intracapsular tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy (PITA) versus Bovie electrocautery complete tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy (T&amp;A). Methods: In a retrospective cohort study children found to have Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) by PSG who have undergone either PITA or T&amp;A as treatment will be evaluated with repeat PSG. The groups will be matched by age, sex, and severity of pre-operative Apnea-Hypopnea Indices (AHI). The investigators performing and evaluating the PSG will be blinded to type of procedure and preoperative AHI. Change scores will be computed for each participant and the change scores of the groups compared.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The medical records of 149 children who underwent partial intracapsular tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy at the State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate Medical Center or the Long Island College Hospital will be reviewed to identify children with positive preoperative polysomnography. 18 of those with positive preoperative studies will be randomly selected and offered participation in the study. Once enrolled, the participants will be matched by age, sex, time since procedure and polysomnography results (Apnea Hypopnea Index Index within 5) to 18 children who underwent traditional tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy (out of a total of 455 patients).
