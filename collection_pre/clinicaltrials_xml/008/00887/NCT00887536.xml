	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to learn if adding bevacizumab to standard treatment with chemotherapy (docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide) for early stage HER2-negative breast cancer will prevent breast cancer from returning. A second purpose of this study is to learn if adding bevacizumab to treatment with chemotherapy will help women with HER2-negative breast cancer live longer. The researchers also want to learn about the side effects of the combination of drugs used in this study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Comparing the Combination of TC Plus Bevacizumab to TC Alone and to TAC for Women With Node-Positive or High-Risk Node-Negative, HER2-Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The B-46-I/07132 study, a multicenter, open-label, randomized Phase III, adjuvant therapy trial, will compare the value of adding bevacizumab to a non-anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen relative to the same chemotherapy without bevacizumab and relative to an anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen in women with resected node-positive or high-risk node-negative, HER2-negative breast cancer. This trial will determine whether the addition of bevacizumab to a regimen of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide (TCB) improves invasive disease-free survival relative to docetaxel and cyclophosphamide alone (TC). A secondary aim will be to determine whether the addition of bevacizumab to TC improves invasive disease-free survival compared to a regimen of docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC). Other secondary aims include whether TCB improves disease-free survival, overall survival, and recurrence-free interval relative to TC alone and to TAC. The toxicities of the three regimens will also be compared. Patients in the B-46-I/07132 study will be randomized to one of three treatment regimens: Group 1 patients will receive 6 cycles of TAC administered every 21 days (docetaxel 75 mg/m2, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2); Group 2 patients will receive 6 cycles of TC administered every 21 days (docetaxel 75 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2); and Group 3 patients will receive 6 cycles of TCB every 21 days with bevacizumab therapy continuing every 21 days after completion of chemotherapy until 1 year following the first dose (docetaxel 75 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2, and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg). Primary prophylaxis with pegfilgrastim or filgrastim is required for Group 1 patients (optional for patients in Groups 2 and 3). Patients will also receive adjuvant radiation therapy as clinically indicated and endocrine therapy for hormone receptor-positive tumors. Tumor samples will be submitted for correlative science studies to evaluate predictors of study therapy benefit. Submission of a tumor sample is a study requirement for all patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must be female. The patient must be greater than or equal to 18 years of age and less than or equal to 70 years of age. The patient must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. The tumor must be unilateral invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast on histologic examination. The breast cancer must be HER2negative based on current American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) Guideline Recommendations for Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Testing in Breast Cancer. If the result of the in situ hybridization testing (FISH, chromagen in situ hybridization (CISH), or other) is equivocal, the patient is eligible if there is no plan to administer HER2targeted therapy. All of the following staging criteria (according to the 6th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual) must be met: By pathologic evaluation, primary tumor must be pT13; By pathologic evaluation, ipsilateral nodes must be pN0, pN1 (pN1mi, pN1a, pN1b, pN1c), pN2a, pN3a, or pN3b. If pN0, at least one of the following criteria must be met: ER negative and PgR negative; or Pathologic tumor size greater than 2.0 cm; or T1c (pathologic tumor size greater than 1.0 cm but less than or equal to 2.0 cm) and ER positive (PgR status may be positive or negative) and either Oncotype DXÂ® Recurrence Score of greater than or equal to 25 or grade 3 histology. Patients must have undergone either a total mastectomy or breastconserving surgery (lumpectomy). For patients who undergo lumpectomy, the margins of the resected specimen must be histologically free of invasive tumor and DCIS as determined by the local pathologist. If pathologic examination demonstrates tumor at the line of resection, additional operative procedures must be performed to obtain clear margins. If tumor is still present at the resected margin after reexcision(s), the patient must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. (Patients with margins positive for lobular carcinoma in situ [LCIS] are eligible without additional resection.) For patients who undergo mastectomy, margins must be histologically free of invasive tumor and DCIS. Patients must have completed one of the following procedures for evaluation of pathologic nodal status: Sentinel lymphadenectomy alone if pathologic nodal staging based on sentinel lymphadenectomy is pN0, pN1mi, or pN1b; Sentinel lymphadenectomy followed by removal of additional nonsentinel lymph nodes if the sentinel node (SN) is positive; or Axillary lymphadenectomy without SN isolation procedure. The interval between the last surgery for breast cancer (treatment or staging) and randomization must be at least 28 days but no more than 84 days. Patients must have ER analysis performed on the primary tumor prior to randomization. If ER analysis is negative, then PgR analysis must also be performed. (Either a core biopsy or surgical resection specimen can be used for ER/PgR testing.) The most recent postoperative blood counts must meet the following criteria: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be greater than or equal to 1200/mm3; platelet count must be greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3; and hemoglobin must be greater than or equal to 10 g/dL. The following criteria for evidence of adequate hepatic function must be met based on the results of the most recent postoperative tests: total bilirubin must be less than or equal to upper limits of normal (ULN)for the lab unless the patient has a bilirubin elevation less than ULN to 1.5 x ULN due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of bilirubin; and alkaline phosphatase must be less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and AST must be less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab. Alkaline phosphatase and aspartate transaminase (AST) may not both be greater than the ULN. For example, if the alkaline phosphatase is greater than the ULN but less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN, then the AST must be less than or equal to the ULN. If the AST is greater than the ULN but less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN, then the alkaline phosphatase must be less than or equal to ULN. Patients with AST or alkaline phosphatase greater than ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if liver imaging (CT, MRI, PETCT, or PET scan) does not demonstrate metastatic disease and the requirements for adequate hepatic function are met. Patients with alkaline phosphatase that is greater than ULN but less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if a bone scan, PETCT, or PET scan does not demonstrate metastatic disease. The most recent postoperative serum creatinine must be less than or equal to ULN for the lab. A urine sample must be tested for proteinuria by the dipstick method. Eligibility must be based on the most recent postoperative test result(s) performed within 6 weeks prior to randomization. Urine dipstick must indicate 01+ protein. If dipstick reading is greater than or equal to 2+, a 24hour urine specimen must be collected and must demonstrate less than 1 gram of protein. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessment by 2D echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan must be performed within 90 days prior to randomization. The LVEF must be greater than or equal to 50% regardless of the facility's lower limits of normal (LLN). T4 tumors including inflammatory breast cancer. Definitive clinical or radiologic evidence of metastatic disease. Synchronous or metachronous contralateral invasive breast cancer. (Patients with synchronous and/or metachronous contralateral DCIS are eligible.) Any history of ipsilateral invasive breast cancer or ipsilateral DCIS.

Previous therapy with anthracyclines, taxanes, or bevacizumab for any malignancy. Chemotherapy administered for the currently diagnosed breast cancer prior to randomization. Continued therapy with any hormonal agent such as raloxifene or tamoxifen (or other SERM) or an aromatase inhibitor. (Patients are eligible if these medications are discontinued prior to randomization.) Any sex hormonal therapy, e.g., birth control pills, ovarian hormone replacement therapy. Patients are eligible if these medications are discontinued prior to randomization. Active hepatitis B or hepatitis C with abnormal liver function tests. Cardiac disease (history of and/or active disease) that would preclude the use of the drugs included in the treatment regimens. This includes but is not confined to 1) Active cardiac disease: angina pectoris that requires the use of antianginal medication; ventricular arrhythmias except for benign premature ventricular contractions; supraventricular and nodal arrhythmias requiring a pacemaker or not controlled with medication; conduction abnormality requiring a pacemaker; valvular disease with documented compromise in cardiac function; and symptomatic pericarditis, 2) History of cardiac disease: myocardial infarction documented by elevated cardiac enzymes or persistent regional wall abnormalities on assessment of left ventricular (LV) function; history of documented congestive heart failure (CHF); and documented cardiomyopathy.
