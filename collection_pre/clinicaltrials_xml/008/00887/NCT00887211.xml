	<detailed_description>A single blind, multi-center, randomized study is preformed to compare ProStent drug-eluting stents with Firebird drug-eluting stents from MicroPort Medical (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ProStent drug-eluting stent in treating coronary artery lesions. Appropriate patients judged by inclusion and exclusion standards will be preformed stent implantation, and after that all patients will be clinically followed up at 30, 90, 180, 270 and 365 days. Especially, standard quantity coronary angiography (QCA) will be conducted at 270 days(±30days) through which the main therapeutic indicator of late luminal loss (LLL) is obtained so as to evaluate the efficacy of tested stents. Major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) found in following-up period as key indicators to evaluate the safety of stents. The arrangement, conclusion and statistical analysis of trial data including clinography and angiography will be fulfilled by independent Data Management Center(DMC) and radiography core laboratory.</detailed_description>
