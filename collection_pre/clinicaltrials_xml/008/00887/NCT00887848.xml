	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Robotic Assisted Gait Training in Children With Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Within a randomized controlled design the effects of robotic-assisted locomotor training (15 sessions within 5 weeks) will be examined in a sample of 34 children with cerebral palsy. Children will be randomly assigned to an intervention or waiting list group. Assessments will be performed at baseline, in week 6 as well as in week 12. The intervention is provided to the waiting list group after the assessment in week 6.</detailed_description>
