	<brief_title>Validation/Dissemination Of A Temporal Bone Dissection Simulator</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research is designed to test the efficacy of a computer based virtual simulation for teaching ear surgery. Subjects will be randomized to training in the usual fashion and training in the simulation environment. Subjects performance will be tested in a standard fashion by dissecting cadaveric temporal bones (human ears) before and after training. The subjects will also perform a dissection in the virtual environment before and after training. The results will be tabulated to compare the different training arms. There is minimal risk associated with the projects and is limited to exposure to cadaveric material. Current training techniques utilize cadaveric material so exposure to this type of material is already a part of the standard training process and this study should not constitute an increased risk beyond what is encountered during their regular training. Demographic information will be obtained for each of the study subject on age, sex, information regarding previous otologic training, year of training and prior experience using computers. The anticipated benefits to society will be that future otologic surgeons can obtain operative experience in a controlled and non threatening environment. They will have access to a greater number of variations in pathology. This will allow each novice surgeon to obtain significantly more experience outside the operating room prior to working with live patients. This will result in less risk to the patient and better trained ear surgeons.</detailed_description>
