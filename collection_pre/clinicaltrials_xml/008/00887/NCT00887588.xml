	<criteria>Patients with documented stable chronic heart failure (NYHA IIIV): LVEF ≥ 45% (local measurement, assessed by echocardiography, MUGA, CT scan, MRI or ventricular angiography) the ejection fraction must have been obtained within 6 months prior to randomization or after any MI or other event that would affect ejection fraction. Plasma NTproBNP &gt; 500 pg/ml at Visit 1. Patients with documented stable chronic heart failure (NYHA IIIV). Patients receiving ACE inhibitors (ACEi), an angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and/or a beta blockers must be on a stable dose of these medications stable for the 1 month period prior to Visit 1. Patients must be on diuretic therapy prior to Visit 1 (flexible dosing is permitted). Patients with a controlled systolic BP, defined as a target systolic BP less than 140 mm Hg; participants with BP up to and including 160 mm Hg are eligible for enrollment if they are on three or more medications to control BP at randomization (Visit 2). Patients with at least one of the following symptoms at the time of screening (Visit 1): Dyspnea on exertion Orthopnea Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea Peripheral edema Patients must have an eGFR ≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 at Visit 1 (calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula). Patients with a potassium ≤5.2 mmol/l at Visit 1. Patients with a prior LVEF reading &lt;45%, at any time. Patients who require treatment with both an ACE inhibitor and an ARB. Isolated right heart failure due to pulmonary disease. Dyspnea and/or edema from noncardiac causes, such as lung disease, anemia, or severe obesity. Presence of hemodynamically significant mitral and /or aortic valve disease. Presence of hemodynamically significant obstructive lesions of left ventricular outflow tract, including aortic stenosis. Presence of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
