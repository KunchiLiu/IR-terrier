	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test whether an experimental drug called bevacizumab given together with gemcitabine and docetaxel, a standard chemotherapy regimen for sarcoma, can help sarcoma patients. This trial will examine what effects, good and/or bad the combination of gemcitabine, docetaxel and bevacizumab has on sarcoma.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed unresectable metastatic or locally recurrent leiomyosarcoma, Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma (MFH, also known as high grade Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma) pleomorphic liposarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma or angiosarcoma. Zero to one prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease. Prior adjuvant therapy will not count provided it was more than one year previously. Measurable disease as defined by RECIST Adequate performance status ECOG 0 or 1 Patients must be recovered from the toxic effects of prior chemotherapy or radiation. Therapy may not start until at least 3 weeks since prior cytotoxic chemotherapy, two weeks from completion of radiation therapy, and one week for patients on tyrosine kinase inhibitors or other targeted therapy. Age 18 To 75. As it is quite difficult to administer high dose docetaxel with gemcitabine, to the elderly, in order to protect patient safety, we will restrict eligibility to patients between the ages of 18 and 75. Adequate hematologic, hepatic and renal function as defined below Hemoglobin &gt; or = to 8.0 g/dl Absolute neutrophil count &gt; or = to 1,500/mm3 Platelet count &gt; or = to 100,000/mm3 Total Bilirubin &lt; or = to1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN). ALT (SGOT) or AST (SGPT) &lt; or = to 5 x ULN. Alkaline Phosphatase &lt; or = to 2.5 x ULN or ≤ 5 x ULN in presence of liver metastases. Serum creatinine 2.0 mg/dL Ability to understand informed consent and comply with treatment protocol Normal cardiac ejection fraction Urine protein:creatinine (UPC) ratio &lt; than or = to 1.0 at screening Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including infection or congestive heart failure within 6 months. Prior therapy with gemcitabine, docetaxel or bevacizumab Patients receiving other investigational agents Patients with known brain metastases Pregnancy or unwillingness to use effective birth control Patients with HIV disease will be permitted, only if they are on effective antiretroviral therapy, have a CD4 count greater than 400, and have had no opportunistic infections within the past 6 months. Patients on anticoagulation will be permitted if they are on a stable dose of warfarin or lowmolecular weight heparin, and have had no major bleeds within the past 6 months. Inability to comply with study and/or followup procedures. Life expectancy of less than 12 weeks.

Use of effective means of contraception (men and women) in subjects of childbearing potential History of hemoptysis (bright red blood of 1/2 teaspoon or more per episode) within 3 months prior to study enrollment.
