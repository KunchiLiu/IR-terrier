	<brief_title>Sorafenib as Adjuvant to Radioiodine Therapy in Non-Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background of the study: Therapy with radioiodine (RaI) is the only curative therapy in non-medullary thyroid carcinoma. RaI uptake is frequently lost in this disease. Therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors may restore the susceptibility to RaI. Objective of the study: To investigate whether therapy with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Sorafenib will increase the accumulation of radioiodine (RaI) and decrease tumor progression in patients with recurrences or metastases of non-medullary thyroid carcinoma with absent or insufficient accumulation of RaI. Study design: Prospective, open study with patients with recurrences or metastases of differentiated thyroid carcinoma who will undergo 6 months therapy with Sorafenib 800 mg/day. Patients in whom RaI uptake will be restored will be offered high dose (6000 MBq) RaI together with an additional 6 months treatment with Sorafenib. Patients in whom RaI is not be restored but in whom Sorafenib had a favorable effect on tumor growth will be offered continued treatment with Sorafenib. Study population: Thirty patients will be included with recurrences or metastases of differentiated thyroid carcinoma that are unresponsive to RaI therapy. Intervention (if applicable): After inclusion, patients will undergo 131I scintigraphy as well as a CT scan. Thereafter, therapy with Sorafenib 800 mg/day will be initiated, and continued during 6 months. After 6 months, 131I scintigraphy and CT scans will be repeated. Serum levels of thyroglobulin will be used as tumormarker. Primary study parameters/outcome of the study: The endpoint of the study is the proportion of patients with a favorable response to Sorafenib defined as ONE OR MORE of the following criteria: 1. Reinduction of RaI uptake by RaI scintigraphy: The appearance of one or more RaI accumulating lesions at RaI scintigraphy, planar images and/or SPECT (see below) 2. Serum thyroglobulin levels: The absence of progression: no statistically significant positive slope at linear regression of the log-transformed serum Tg levels, measured at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 and 28 weeks after start of Sorafenib: - Stable disease: The slope at linear regression of the log-transformed serum Tg levels, measured at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 and 28 weeks after start of Sorafenib is not significantly different from 0 ln ug/L*time OR - Response: The slope at linear regression of the log-transformed serum Tg levels is negative (statistically significantly below 0 ln ug/L*time). 3. CT Imaging: The absence of progression according to RECIST criteria: - Stable disease—neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter since the treatment started. - Partial response—at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter; - Complete response: the disappearance of all target lesions</detailed_description>
