	<brief_summary>This study is being performed to investigate the potential for AZD5672 to affect the electrical conduction pathways in the heart. AZD5672 will be compared against a drug (moxifloxacin - a licensed antibiotic) known to have a detectable but safe change on the electrical conduction of the heart.</brief_summary>
