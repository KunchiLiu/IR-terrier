	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to characterize the morphology (shape) of the intracardiac electrograms(EGM) from patients with a resynchronization therapy device.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>OPTIMA Bi-ventricular Capture Verification Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>morphology of EGM during loss of capture in either right ventricle (RV) or left ventricle (LV) at different AV delays and LV offsets and during exercise. These EGM signals will be used to design and develop improved automatic threshold and automatic capture algorithms for CRT defibrillators (CRT-D). As well, the data collected from the study will be used to to develop other automatic algorithms for CRT-D, such as pacing parameter optimization.</detailed_description>
