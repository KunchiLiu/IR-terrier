	<brief_summary>The aim of this multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of an alternative treatment for deep caries lesions in Public Health Services. The alternative treatment consists of partial removal of carious dentine followed by restoration. The subjects were assigned to test or control groups: test - carious dentine partial removal and restoration in one session, and control - stepwise excavation. The stepwise excavation consists of partial removal of carious tissue from the cavity floor, indirect pulp capping with calcium hydroxide cement; temporary filling; cavity re-opening after 60 days, removal of the remaining soft carious tissue and filling. Each group was divided according to the filling material: amalgam or resin. The radiological exams are being performed before and after the treatment and then annually. Clinical evaluation of the restorations is performed right after the treatment and then annually (modified USPHS System). All evaluations are performed by calibrated and trained dentists.</brief_summary>
