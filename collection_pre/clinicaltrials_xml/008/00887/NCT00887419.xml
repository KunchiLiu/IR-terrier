	<brief_title>Spinal Cord Stimulator Implant Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study tests the hypotheses that a pain coping skills program in combination with an SCS implant can improve short- and long-term outcomes in self-efficacy for coping with chronic pain, physical disability, psychological distress, and pain intensity. Participants are patients who have been approved by their doctors and insurance companies to receive the spinal cord stimulator trial. After patients have been approved, they can be enrolled in this study. After completing a baseline evaluation, patients are randomized into (1)six individual pain coping skills training sessions(relaxations techniques, communication skills, goal setting), (2) six individual chronic pain education sessions (discussion approach to etiology and treatment of chronic pain and information on spinal cord stimulator implants, or (3) treatment as usual (no study intervention). Participants are evaluated prior to or shortly after their surgery, at post treatment, at 6 month follow-up and at 12 month follow-up. All participants continue their routine medical care throughout the study.</detailed_description>
