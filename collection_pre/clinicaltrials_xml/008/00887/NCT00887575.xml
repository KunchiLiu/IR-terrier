	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Sunitinib With Paclitaxel/Carboplatin in Patients With Triple-Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label, Phase I/II trial is designed to evaluate the combination of sunitinib plus paclitaxel and carboplatin as neoadjuvant treatment for locally advanced breast cancer. The Phase I portion of this study will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of paclitaxel, sunitinib and carboplatin that can be used together as neoadjuvant treatment in patients with locally advanced breast cancer. The MTD identified in the Phase I portion of the study will be used in the Phase II portion which will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of neoadjuvant sunitinib/paclitaxel/carboplatin given for 6 cycles in patients with locally advanced breast cancer.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Female patients, age ≥18 years 2. Histologically confirmed invasive ER, PR, and HER2negative (triplenegative) adenocarcinoma of the breast 3. Triplenegative tumors are defined as: For HER2negative: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)negative (defined by ratio &lt;2.2) OR Immunohistochemical (IHC) 0, IHC 1+, OR IHC 2+ or IHC 3+ and FISHnegative (defined by ratio &lt;2.2) For ER and PRnegative: &lt;10% tumor staining by immunohistochemistry (IHC) 4. Primary palpable disease confined to a breast and axilla on physical examination. For patients without clinically suspicious axillary adenopathy, the primary tumor must be larger than 2 cm in diameter by physical exam or imaging studies (clinical T2T3, N0N1, M0). For patients with clinically suspicious axillary adenopathy, the primary breast tumor can be any size (clinical T13, N12, M0). T1N0M0 lesions are excluded. Patients with metastatic disease are excluded. 5. Patients without clearly defined palpable breast mass or axillary lymph nodes but radiographically measurable tumor masses are eligible. Accepted procedures for measuring breast disease are mammography, MRI, and breast ultrasound. Patients with lesions measurable only by imaging will require repeat imaging after 3 cycles and prior to surgery 6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) 02 7. Neuropathy grade &lt;1 by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (CTCAE v 3.0) 8. Resolution of all acute effects of surgical procedures to grade ≤1. For patients who had, or will have sentinel lymph node and/or axillary dissection prior to initiation of study treatment, completion at least 4 weeks prior to starting study treatment and wellhealed wound is required 9. Adequate hematologic function with: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;1500/μL Platelets ≥100,000/μL Hemoglobin ≥10 g/dL 10. Adequate hepatic and renal function with: Serum bilirubin ≤ the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤2.5 x institutional ULN Alkaline phosphatase ≤2.5 x institutional ULN Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN or calculated creatinine clearance ≥40 mL/min 11. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥50% by multigated acquisition (MUGA) or echocardiogram (ECHO) 12. Bilateral, synchronous breast cancer is allowed if one primary tumor meets the inclusion criteria 13. Knowledge of the investigational nature of the study and ability to provide consent for study participation 14. Ability and willingness to comply with study visits, treatment, testing, and other study procedures 1. Previous treatment for this breast cancer 2. Previous treatment with paclitaxel or carboplatin 3. Previous treatment with sunitinib or other angiogenic inhibitors (including, but not limited to bevacizumab, sorafenib, thalidomide) 4. Any of the following within the 12 months prior to starting study treatment: myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident including transient ischemic attack, or pulmonary embolus 5. Uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure &gt;150/100 mmHg despite optimal medical therapy) 6. Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias grade ≥2, atrial fibrillation of any grade, or prolongation of the QTc interval to &gt;470 msec 7. Major surgery, significant traumatic injury, or radiation therapy within 4 weeks of starting study treatment. An interval of at least 1week is required following minor surgical procedures, with the exception of placement of a vascular access device 8. Grade 3 hemorrhage within 4 weeks of starting study treatment 9. Preexisting thyroid abnormality with thyroid function that cannot be maintained in the normal range with medication 10. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or other serious infection 11. Concomitant treatment with drugs having proarrhythmic potential including terfenadine, quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, sotalol, probucol, bepridil, haloperidol, risperidone, indapamide, and flecainide 12. Concurrent use of the potent CYP3A4 inhibitors ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, nefazodone, saquinavir, telithromycin, ritonavir, amprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, delavirdine and voriconazole and CYP3A4 inducers rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, St. John's Wort, and dexamethasone. Use of dexamethasone for study premedication is allowed. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice is prohibited. Alternative therapies should be used when available. If use of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer is necessary, this must be approved by the Study Chair 13. Known or suspected hypersensitivity to drugs containing Cremophor®EL (polyoxyethylated castor oil) such as cyclosporine or teniposide 14. Pregnancy or breastfeeding. Negative serum pregnancy test is required within 7 days prior to first study treatment (Day 1, Cycle ) for all women of childbearing potential. Patients of childbearing potential must agree to use a birth control method that is approved by their study physician while receiving study treatment and for three months after the last dose of study treatment. Patients must agree to not breastfeed while receiving study treatment 15. Concurrent treatment with an ovarian hormonal replacement therapy or with hormonal agents such as raloxifene, tamoxifen or other selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Patients must have discontinued use of such agents prior to beginning study treatment 16. History of malignancy treated with curative intent within the previous 5 years with the exception of skin cancer, cervical carcinoma in situ, or follicular thyroid cancer. Patients with previous invasive cancers (including breast cancer) are eligible if the treatment was completed more than 5 years prior to initiating current study treatment, and there is no evidence of recurrent disease 17. Use of any investigational agent within 30 days of administration of the first dose of study drug or concurrent treatment on another clinical study 18. Requirement for radiation therapy concurrent with study anticancer treatment. Patients who require breast or chest wall radiation therapy after surgery are eligible, but will have maintenance sunitinib interrupted while receiving radiation 19. Any other disease(s), psychiatric condition, metabolic dysfunction, or findings from a physical examination or clinical laboratory test result that would cause reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition, that contraindicates the use of study drugs, that may increase the risk associated with study participation, that may affect the interpretation of the results, or that would make the patient inappropriate for this study</criteria>
