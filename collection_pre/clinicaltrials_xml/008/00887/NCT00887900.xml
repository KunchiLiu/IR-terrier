	<brief_title>Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty (DALK)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose: To report outcomes of deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) using the big-bubble technique. Methods: Thirty four unselected consecutive patients were submitted to DALK big-bubble technique. Intraoperative and postoperative complications, postoperative uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA), spherical equivalent (SE), corneal topography, and endothelial cell density were evaluated. All patients were followed for at least 6 months.</detailed_description>
