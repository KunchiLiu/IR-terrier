	<brief_summary>Ageing is associated with vulnerability against infections leading to increased morbidity with risk of death. Innate and adaptive immunities are altered with ageing responsible of deficits in immune response against pathogens and after vaccination, and favouring the elderly vulnerability against a new pathogen with increased bacterial, viral, and fungal infections. If immunity has been widely studied in immunosenescence, there are few prospective, comparative studies with elderly ill patients. Moreover among these studies, pathologies are not well defined. The main objective of our project is to compare the immune state of elderly hospitalised subjects in an acute geriatric unit to the immune state of elderly healthy subjects selected with strict criteria, in order to precise the impact of polypathology and of various pathologies on immunity state.</brief_summary>
