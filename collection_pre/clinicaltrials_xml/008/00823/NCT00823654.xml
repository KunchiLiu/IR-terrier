	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see how the cancer treatment affects the ovaries. Cancer treatment can make it hard for a person to conceive a child in the future. It may also bring on early menopause. We will check blood levels of hormones that the ovaries produce. We will do this before, during, and after the cancer treatment. We will also ask the patient to fill out questionnaires about their menstrual cycle (periods) and information about your health and pregnancies. This may help us learn which women will be more likely to have early menopause.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>For Premenopausal Women with Early Stage Breast Cancer Premenopausal female patients age 1844 with breast cancer as defined as: a. AJCC Stage 0III breast cancer, regardless of hormonereceptor status or HER2overexpression, before the start of planned adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy. If chemotherapy is planned, the regimen must be either CMF, anthracycline containing, or taxane containing. If hormonal therapy is planned, the regimen must be limited to tamoxifen. All biologics (e.g. bevacizumab, trastuzumab, lapatinib, etc.) are allowed in addition to the above therapies. ECOG performance status 01 Have regular menstrual cycles; patients can have no more than 1 irregular cycle (too early or too late) within the past year and/or at least 10 spontaneous cycles within the past year. Subject Inclusion: For Unaffected High Risk Premenopausal Women with BRCA mutations Premenopausal Women ages 3045 with known BRCA mutations ECOG performance status 01 Have regular menstrual (2135 days); patients can have no more than 1 irregular cycle (too early or too late) within the past year and/or at least 10 spontaneous cycles within the past year. No history of breast or ovary cancer. For Cohort of Premenopausal Women with Early Stage Breast Cancer Prior therapy for breast cancer or any other cancer, such as chemotherapy, hormonal therapy or immunotherapy. Ovarian resection, unilateral or bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy or radiation to pelvic region. Plans for riskreducing bilateral oophorectomy within one year of completion of chemotherapy. Prior known infertility; infertility is defined as one year of inability to conceive despite unprotected intercourse and/or the need to use medication (e.g clomiphene) or assisted reproductive technology (e.g. intrauterine insemination or in vitro fertilization) to attempt pregnancy. Family history of a firstdegree relative with nonsurgical menopause &lt; age 40 Current pregnancy. Subject For Unaffected High Risk Premenopausal Women with BRCA mutation Prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy for breast cancer or any other cancer Ovarian resection, unilateral or bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy or radiation to pelvic region or ovarian disease (e.g. polycystic ovarian syndrome). Plans for riskreducing bilateral oophorectomy within one year Prior known infertility; (except women who have undergone voluntary tubal ligation); infertility is defined as one year of inability to conceive despite unprotected intercourse and/or the need to use medication (e.g clomiphene) or assisted reproductive technology (e.g. intrauterine insemination or in vitro fertilization) to attempt pregnancy. Family history of a firstdegree relative with nonsurgical menopause &lt; age 40 Current pregnancy</criteria>
