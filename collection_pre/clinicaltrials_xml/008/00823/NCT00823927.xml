	<brief_summary>This study is being done to examine lung function changes in individuals with HIV infection and to understand why individuals with HIV have increased risk of lung damage from cigarette smoking.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alveolar Macrophage Proteomics in HIV-associated Emphysema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To delineate the natural history of HIV associated emphysema in the HAART era. To compare the alveolar macrophage proteomes from HIV-seropositive smokers with emphysema to the alveolar macrophages proteomes of both HIV+ smokers without emphysema and HIV- smokers. To establish whether coinfection with HIV and Hepatitis C results in accelerated lung disease manifested by decrements in forced expiratory volume and carbon monoxide diffusing capacity.</detailed_description>
