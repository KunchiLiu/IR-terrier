	<brief_summary>Randomized, control, open label, multicentre clinical study. The patient who are in accordance with subject inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized to A group: Routine treatment B group: Routine treatment+ Cilostazol; C group : Routine treatment + Probucol; D group: Routine treatment+ Cilostazol+ Probucol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Cilostazol and Probucol Alone and in Combination on Atherosclerosis Related Biomarker---atherosclerosis Cerebral Infarction Patient as Study Subject</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Efficacy index: After 12 weeks of treatment, the change difference of arteriosclerosis related biomarker between 4 modality groups. Pharmacokinetics: After 12 weeks of treatment, the study medication plasma concentration including of Probucol ,Cilostazol , Cilostazol metabolism OPC-13015 and OPC-13213 will be measured. Safety evaluation: Analysis the abnormality of Adverse Event, Vital Sign, Physical Examination, 12-lead ECG, and Laboratory Tests (including blood routine examination, routine urine analysis, blood biochemistry examination, glycosylated hemoglobin) in 4 modality groups.</detailed_description>
