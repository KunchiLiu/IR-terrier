	<brief_summary>This is a 96 week study to determine if UK- 453,061 in combination with Darunavir /ritonavir and a Nucleos(t)ide Reverse Transcriptase inhibitor is as efficacious, safe and tolerable as etravirine in combination with Darunavir /ritonavir and a Nucleos(t)ide Reverse Transcriptase inhibitor in HIV-1 infected patients who have been previously treated with antiretroviral drugs and have NNRTI resistance mutations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2B Multicenter, Randomized, Comparative Trial Of UK-453,061 Versus Etravirine In Combination With Darunavir/Ritonavir And A Nucleos(t)Ide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor For The Treatment Of Antiretroviral Experienced HIV-1 Infected Subjects With Evidence Of NNRTI Resistant HIV-1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial was terminated on 12 April, 2012 due to lack of efficacy at the Week 24 analysis. The decision to terminate the trial was not based on any safety concerns.</detailed_description>
