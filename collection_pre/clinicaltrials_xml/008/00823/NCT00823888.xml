	<brief_summary>The overall objective of this project is to determine whether the provision of a pneumatic knee brace in patients with medial knee osteoarthritis (OA) improves knee mechanics. Secondary objectives will be to assess if the brace relieves knee pain and improves function. We will test the hypothesis that compared to the control treatment (see below for the definition) the use of a pneumatic knee brace is effective in medial knee OA.</brief_summary>
