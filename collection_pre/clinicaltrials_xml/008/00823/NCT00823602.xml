	<brief_summary>Literature suggests that GnRH antagonists are comparatively more often used in cycles which have an unfavorable prior prognosis, and this protocol is an ideal one for poor responder patients. Up to now, however not enough prospectives have been published to prove any beneficial effect of antagonists on the first cycle assisted reproductive technique. This prospective study will do to evaluate the efficacy of gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonist in comparison with the standard long protocol in the first cycle of ART. The investigators will randomize 160 patients undergoing ART for the first time . Group 1 (n=80) was stimulate with a standard long protocol and group 2 (n=80) stimulated with GnRH antagonist and then result of ART compare in two group .</brief_summary>
