	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if a glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) solution can be safely administered to patients with septic shock. GIK has been used in thousands of critically ill patients in research studies with very few safety concerns. However, there is a lack of data in regards to patients with septic shock. There are many reasons to believe that GIK would be beneficial in sepsis, including improving heart function and decreasing inflammation. This study will administer intravenous GIK for 12 hours continuously and monitor 10 subjects for 24 hours. A control arm will be used and 10 patients will receive the same monitoring but will not receive GIK.</brief_summary>
