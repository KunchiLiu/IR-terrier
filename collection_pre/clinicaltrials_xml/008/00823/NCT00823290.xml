	<brief_summary>Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) like LBH589 have recently been established as novel potent anti-cancer agents for solid and hematologic malignancies. Several pre-clinical reports have shown a good anti-tumoral activity of different HDACi on human or murine HCC models. These compounds, e.g. Trichostatin A, SAHA, MS-275 and others, have been shown to induce apoptosis in HCC cells and to inhibit growth of HCC by inhibiting proliferation and tumor-related angiogenesis in vivo. Furthermore, HDACi sensitize HCC in a synergistic manner to other forms of cytotoxic stimulation, e.g. by conventional chemotherapeutic drugs or TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. It has also been shown that the combination of HDACi with various kinase inhibitors like sorafenib, erlotinib or others, promotes the anti-tumor efficacy of single agents. Based on the investigators' own previous experiences with different HDACi and LBH589 in preclinical HCC models, a strong anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic as well as an anti-angiogenic effect will be expected by combining LBH589 with an existing sorafenib treatment. It is assumed that this combination will prolong overall survival and time-to-progression with lowered adverse effects in HCC patients.</brief_summary>
