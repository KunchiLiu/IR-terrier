	<brief_title>Feasibility Study to Evaluate the Safety of Topically Applied Revera in Subjects With Venous Leg Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to perform a preliminary evaluation of the safety of Revera Wound Care when topically applied to venous leg ulcers for 8 weeks of treatment. This evaluation will be done through tabulations of adverse events (AE), review of complete blood counts (CBC) with differential and platelet, and measuring wound healing rate. The secondary purpose of the study is a preliminary evaluation of an increase in the healing rate of venous leg ulcers treated with Revera Wound Care. This evaluation will be done through measuring wound healing rate (which is also being used to evaluate safety) and complete wound healing.</detailed_description>
