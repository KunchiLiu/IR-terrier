	<brief_summary>To determine the effects of topically applied ViaNOx-H for 8 hours daily for 2 weeks on the reduction of the bio-burden in biofilms on chronic non-healing wounds as recorded by measurements of wound size and wound culture.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topical Nitric Oxide Trial in Chronic Non-Healing Wounds</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary goal of this study is to determine the effects of topically applied gaseous nitric oxide on the bio-burden of chronic non-healing wounds of the lower extremities. Reports will include: - Comparisons of the demographics and diagnoses of those patients treated with ViaNOx-H. - Tabulation as to the organisms found and the bio-burden as measured by counts (0 to +4). - Tabulation of the number and types of adverse events during ViaNOx-H treatment. - Comparisons of the response of different organisms to ViaNOx-H treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Have a chronic (&gt; 8 weeks duration) colonized cutaneous ulcer (defined as a wound containing a local margin of erythema, edema or tenderness; presence of exudates; and/or presence of a malodorous smell)in their lower extremity (below the knee) resulting from either diabetes or venous stasis disease. Are 18 years of age or older. Have had a change in their topical treatment during the last 4 weeks Have evidence of Clinical Infection Have a transcutaneous oxygen tension &lt;30mmHg Have evidence of the ulcer or infection extending to the underlying muscle or bone. Are pregnant. Are less than 18 years of age.</criteria>
