	<brief_title>Study of Cilostazol and Probucol to Assess Their Effects on Atherosclerosis Related Biomarker</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Efficacy evaluation: Primary efficacy index: After 12 weeks of treatment, the change of arteriosclerosis related biomarker in 4 modality groups, comparing with the base line information Secondary efficacy index: After 8 weeks of treatment, the change of arteriosclerosis related biomarker in 4 modality groups, comparing with the base line information Safety evaluation: 1. Adverse Event 2. Vital Sign and Physical Examination 3. 12-lead ECG 4. Laboratory Tests (including blood routine examination, routine urine analysis, blood biochemistry examination, glycosylated hemoglobin)</detailed_description>

	<criteria>40~75yearold male or female Clarified diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus Arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO) is diagnosed (ASO diagnoses should meet at least one of the conditions as below: ABI&lt;1.0; The pulse of popliteal artery or dorsalis pedis artery is weeken significantly or is different between left and right sides Intermittent claudication, diagnosed as ASO by doctor Ultrasonogram showed that there was atherosclerotic plaque in lower limb within 1 year Informed Consent Form Signature Has an allergic history to study drugs Use one of the following drugs: other antiplatelet or anticoagulation agents except Aspirin, other hypolipidemic agents except Statins Type 1 diabetes mellitus, specific diabetes mellitus, or gestational diabetes mellitus Has severe ASO above Fontaine IIb, Hemorrhagic tendency or hemorrhagic disease (such as gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage, etc.) Had a myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, or cerebral infarction within the last 3 months Congestive heart failure Is pregnant, or potentially pregnant, or breastfeeding Severe hepatic insufficient or severe renal insufficiency (AST or ALT is 2.5 times higher than the upper limit of the normal value range, or serum creatinine is 1.2 times higher than the upper limit of the normal value range) Persistent or hardly controlled hypertension (such as malignant hypertension, BP&gt; 160/100 mmHg) Severe ventricular arrhythmia (such as multiple and multifocal premature ventricular contractions) Has a medical history that includes a cardiac syncope or a primary syncope Has conditions that may prolong QT interval (such as congenital long QT syndrome, taking drugs which prolong QT interval, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, etc.) Has severe complications (such as diabetes mellitus ketoacidosis, nonketotic hyperosmolar diabetic coma, malignant tumor, severe anaemia, severe hematologic diseases, etc.) Other conditions that would exclude the subject from this study by doctor's judgement</criteria>
