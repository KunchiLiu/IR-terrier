	<brief_title>Antiviral Therapy in Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)-Related Advanced Liver Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently, treatment guidelines for the management of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) recommend that patients with serum HBV DNA &gt; 105 copies/ml and elevated ALT levels greater than two times the upper limit of normal (ULN) are obvious candidates for antiviral therapy. Guidelines also suggest that antiviral therapy be considered in CHB patients with high viral load, if a biopsy shows significant liver disease despite ALT ≤ 2× ULN. Data from recent trials in hepatitis B patients who present with normal to minimally elevated ALT (≤ 2× ULN) indicate that significant hepatic pathology could still be found. Serum ALT level may not accurately predict activity of liver damage. ALT is a poor predictor of outcome and therefore is not a suitable criterion for antiviral therapy in chronic hepatitis B infection. Also, a recent large randomized controlled clinical trial comparing lamivudine maintenance and placebo in advanced fibrosis (Ishak fibrosis score ≥ 4) suggests that sustained viral suppression with antiviral therapy is linked to reduced risk for disease progression.
