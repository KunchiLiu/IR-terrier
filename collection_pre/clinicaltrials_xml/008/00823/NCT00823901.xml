	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Clindamycin Phosphate 1.2% and Tretinoin 0.025% Gel to Treat Rosacea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently, there is no known cure for rosacea. The most effective treatment is systemic antibiotics, particularly of the tetracycline family. Topical treatments include metronidazole, antibacterials such as erythromycin and clindamycin, sulfacetamide and benzoyl peroxide. Isotretinoin (Accutane) is also used.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subjects 18 years of age and older. 2. Clinical diagnosis of papulopustular facial rosacea. 3. A minimum of 4 but not more than 50 facial inflammatory lesions (papules plus pustules). 4. Willing and able to understand and sign informed consent. 5. Able to complete study and comply with study procedures. 1. Acne conglobata, acne fulminans, secondary acne (chloracne, druginduced acne, etc.), or severe acne requiring systemic treatment. 2. History or presence of regional enteritis or inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., ulcerative colitis, pseudomembranous colitis, chronic diarrhea, or a history of antibioticassociated colitis, bloody diarrhea) or similar symptoms. 3. Use of topical rosacea treatments in the past 2 weeks. 4. Use of systemic antibiotics in the past 4 weeks. 5. Use of systemic retinoids within the past 3 months. 6. Use of laser or light based rosacea treatments within the past 2 months. 7. Concomitant use of medications that are reported to exacerbate rosacea, such as topical and systemic steroids as these may impact assessments. 8. Current drug or alcohol abuse. 9. Other dermatologic conditions that require the use of interfering topical or systemic therapy or that might interfere with study assessments such as, but not limited to, atopic dermatitis, perioral dermatitis or acne vulgaris. 10. Clinically significant abnormal findings or conditions (other than rosacea), which might, in the opinion of the Investigator, interfere with study evaluations or pose a risk to subject safety during the study. 11. Subjects who are pregnant or planning a pregnancy. 12. Use of any investigational therapy within the past 4 weeks. 13. Known hypersensitivity or previous allergic reaction to clindamycin or retinoids</criteria>
