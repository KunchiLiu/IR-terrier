	<brief_summary>Induced pluripotent stem cells potentially may be useful in the future as an unlimited source of cells for transplantation. The major goal of the project is to develop human iPS cells from various types of cell cultures or lines from existing collections. The IPS cells will be developed for modeling diseases, for developing the technology that may eventually allow the use of IPS cells for transplantation therapy, and for basic research.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The potential to reprogram somatic cells into an embryonic state raises multiple basic research questions related both to the process of reprogramming and the properties of iPS cells. We will use various approaches to study the molecular mechanisms and processes that occur during reprogramming. We will use various experimental systems to characterize and study the properties of the iPS cells, their biology, developmental potential, capability to give rise to functional differentiated progeny etc. We will induce the differentiation of the iPS cells towards specific cell lineages and the progeny can be used to study the pathogenesis of diseases. They will be used for developing new therapeutic approaches and for high throughput screening of factors for potential toxic or therapeutic effects. All samples will be non-identified.</detailed_description>
