	<brief_summary>Randomized, double-blind, comparative study versus placebo performed in patients from studies CB-01-02/01 (NCT00679432), CB-01-02/02 (NCT00679380), or CB-01-02/06 (NCT01100112) who achieved ulcerative colitis disease activity index (UCDAI) remission after 8 weeks of treatment. Patients in remission at the End of Study visit will be given the opportunity to enter the 12-month Maintenance Phase study outlined in this protocol (CB-01-02/04). The End of Study visit in studies 01, 02, and 06 will be set as the Visit 1 (Day 0) of this study. There will be no interruption of study treatment between the parent studies and this study. It is planned that approximately 150 patients will be enrolled in the study. Patients will be randomly assigned to two groups to receive either budesonide MMX 6 mg or placebo irrespective of the treatment assigned in studies 01, 02, or 06. Treatments will be administered once a day after breakfast for a maximum of 12 months or up to the occurrence of the first clinical relapse, where clinical relapse is defined as combined recurrence of rectal bleeding and stool frequency ≥ 1-2 stools/day above normal for the patient (score ≥ 1 in both UCDAI items). During the study, patients will be assessed for safety and efficacy at Visit 1 and after 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of treatment. Patients will be contacted by telephone on a monthly basis for safety assessment. In case of occurrence of symptoms suggestive of clinical relapse, patients will attend an unscheduled visit at any time during the study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients fulfilling the following criteria are eligible for participation in the study: Male and female patients, 1875 years old, who are able to understand and voluntarily provide written informed consent. Patients in UCDAI remission defined as a UCDAI score ≤ 1 point with a score of 0 for rectal bleeding and stool frequency, and a ≥ 1 point reduction from baseline in the endoscopy score without any sign of mucosal friability (score 0 for mucosal appearance). Patients who have completed all End of Study assessments for the CB0102/01, CB0102/02 and CB0102/06 studies. Females of childbearing potential must have had a serum pregnancy test performed at the End of Study visit of the parent studies and must use an acceptable contraceptive method throughout the study treatment period. Patients who meet any of the following criteria at screening visit are to be excluded from study participation: Subjects who have withdrawn from studies CB0102/01, CB 01 02/02 or CB0102/06. Subjects who did not achieve induction of remission according to the primary endpoint definition in studies CB0102/01, CB 01 02/02 or CB0102/06 (i.e. clinical remission defined as a UCDAI score ≤ 1 point with a score of 0 for rectal bleeding and stool frequency, and ≥ 1 point reduction from baseline in the endoscopy score without any sign of mucosal friability [score 0 for mucosal appearance]). Subjects with bone density lower than normal by age and sex (Tscore lower than 1) as assessed via dual energy Xray absorptiometry (DXA) scans.</criteria>
