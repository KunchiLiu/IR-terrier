	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to look at certain areas of the brain that are related to addictive behaviors, such as overeating. These areas are called 'dopamine type 2 receptors' (DRD2/3) and other studies have shown that obese people have less of these. We propose that low DRD2/3 availability seen in morbidly obese subjects will change with weight loss associated with bariatric surgery.</brief_summary>
