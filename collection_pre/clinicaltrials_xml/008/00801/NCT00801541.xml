	<detailed_description>The primary statistical objective of this study is to identify the sequence of alterations occurring in the chorioretinal interface during progression of AMD from risk "dry" AMD to sight-threatening chorioretinal neovascularization (CNV) (wet AMD). Different imaging methods will be used simultaneously and at regular intervals in order to characterize markers or predictors of conversion to sight-threatening CNV will be: CNV (classic or occult) or position of CNV within 2500 µm (~1.7 disc diameters) of the foveal center, as evidenced by fluorescein angiography. This is an institutional, prospective, observation study to be performed in fellow eyes of patients with evidence of "wet" AMD in other eye. Therefore, patients will have evidence of exudative ("wet") AMD in one eye ( the non-study eye) and non-exudative ("dry") AMD in the fellow eye (the study eye) that is at risk for progressive to exudation "wet" CNV. Patients will exit the study at the time of developing sight-threatening CNV in the study eye and will be treated at the discretion of the physician.</detailed_description>
