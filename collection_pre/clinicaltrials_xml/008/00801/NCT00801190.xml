	<brief_summary>The overall aim of this study is to determine if there is a bleeding risk associated with the use of starch-containing fluids during cardiac surgery. The specific purpose of this study will be to examine, in a prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled fashion, the effects of colloid (HES 130/0.4) vs. crystalloid (Ringer's Lactate) on bleeding in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass for cardiac surgery. The primary end point of this trial will be chest tube output at 24 hours. In addition, a range of secondary end points focusing on transfusion parameters, as well as other important end-organ outcomes, will be determined.</brief_summary>
