	<brief_summary>This study aims to gather additional information to support the theory that bipolar disorder is due to cellular (mitochondrial) dysfunction. To test this theory adults with bipolar disorder who are not currently symptomatic will receive a one-time brain scan (magnetic resonance spectroscopy [MRS] scan) with light stimulation. To test whether any MRS findings are specific to bipolar disorder, healthy controls and adults with schizophrenia will also be included in this study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study will include males and females between the ages of 18 and 55 years. Participants will include adults with stable bipolar disorder or schizophrenia as well as healthy controls. The study involves a one-time visit that includes a clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and a magnetic resonance scan that will last approximately 90 minutes. The procedures can also be separated into two study visits, if necessary.</detailed_description>
