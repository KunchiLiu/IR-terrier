	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine the effect of an investigational oral rinse in reducing uropathogens and treating uncomplicated urinary tract infections.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment and/or Prevention of Urinary Tract Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A 7-day treatment with a 28-day follow up has been designed as a "before and after" assessment of the clinical signs and symptoms of an uncomplicated urinary tract infection and the reduction/eradication of urinary pathogens. Enrollment is targeted to achieving 20 evaluable subjects by the end of the study. After enrolling in the trial at Day 0 (first day of dosing), participants will report back to the study site at Days 3, 7, and 28. At Day 3 or any time thereafter, worsening of symptoms and/or increases in quantitative bacteria counts will result in removal from the trial and prescription of a rescue medication, which will be selected based on microbial susceptibility testing.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Nonpregnant adult females; 2. 18 years of age or older; 3. Clinical signs with one or more symptoms of a UTI (e.g., dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain) with onset of symptoms &lt; 72 hours prior to study entry; 4. One positive dipstick urine test positive either for leukocyte esterase or nitrates or have a urinalysis with &gt; 5 wbc/hpf. 5. A pretreatment cleancatch midstream urine culture with ≥ 104 CFU/mL of a bacterial organism 1. Males; 2. Women who are pregnant, nursing, or not using a medically accepted, effective method of birth control; 3. Three or more episodes of acute uncomplicated UTI in the past 12 months; 4. Known structural abnormality that would predispose the participant to reflux or urinary retention; 5. Patients with evidence of factors predisposing to the development of urinary tract infections, including calculi, stricture, primary renal disease (e.g., polycystic renal disease), or neurogenic bladder; 6. Patients with significant impaired immunity secondary to chemotherapy, oral corticosteroids, or HIV; 7. Patients with onset of symptoms &gt; 72 hours prior to entry; 8. Patients with a temperature ≥ 100°F, flank pain, chills, or any other manifestations suggestive of upper urinary tract infection; 9. Patients with purported hypersensitivity to iodine; 10. Patients with history of thyroid disease; 11. Patients who received treatment with other antimicrobials within 48 hours prior to entry; 12. Any significant medical or psychiatric condition that would render examination difficult or invalid or prevent the subject from active study participation; inability to use an oral rinse; 13. Use of concomitant medication that, in the opinion of the Study Directors, might interfere with the outcome of the study.</criteria>
