	<brief_title>Comparison Amongst Scleral, Corneal and Amniotic Membrane Grafts to Restore Scleral Thinning</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Scleral thinning may occur secondary to different ocular surface conditions, especially in rheumatologic diseases and after surgeries as in pterygium. There are different methods to treat this condition, as to use scleral, corneal and more recently amniotic membrane graft.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients with corneal scleral defects that have persisted for 1 years or longer, regardless of their cause. These patients will have received cornealscleral or amniotic membrane transplant in order to correct scleral thinning Patients with history of pterygium surgery associated with beta therapy followed by scleral thinning Ocular infection Acute ocular inflammatory condition Previous ocular surgery in the eye study Noncontrolled systemic disease such as rheumatoid arthritis</criteria>
