	<brief_title>Effects of Coffee on Hepatic Steatosis Induced by a High Fructose Diet</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidemiological studies suggest that coffee consumption improves glucose homeostasis in insulin resistant subjects. An increase in intrahepatic lipids (hepatic steatosis) is highly prevalent in patients with the metabolic syndrome and may be used as a marker of altered hepatic lipid metabolism. Such an increased hepatic lipids content can be experimentally produced in healthy humans by a 6-day high fructose diet. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether coffee prevents hepatic lipid deposition in healthy male subjects fed a fructose-rich hypercaloric diet. Both caffeine and antioxidants (yet unspecified) may be involved.. To sort out the role of caffeine and antioxidants, we will test 3 different soluble coffee, ie fully torrefied decaffeinated coffee , partially torrefied decaffeinated coffee, and partially torrefied caffeinated coffee.</detailed_description>
