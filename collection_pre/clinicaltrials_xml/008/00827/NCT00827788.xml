	<brief_title>Comparison Between Iso-Osmolar and Ipo-Osmolar Contrast Agents in Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) Undergoing Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicentric randomized comparison between iso-osmolar and ipo-osmolar contrast agents in patients treated with primary PCI with the evaluation of contrast-induced nephropathy incidence and myocardial tissue reperfusion. The study was designed as a non-inferiority trial.</detailed_description>
