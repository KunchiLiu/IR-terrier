	<brief_title>Parietex Progrip Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Patients in ProGrip group will be treated with self-gripping lightweight Polyester and Polylactic acid meshes providing a sutureless fixation. - Patients in Lichtenstein group will be treated with lightweight Polypropylene meshes requiring fixation by sutures. - Study participation will start at signature of informed consent and each patient will be assessed before surgery. A close follow-up will be performed: 7 days (questionnaires and phone call), 1 month (clinical visit), 3 months (questionnaires and phone call), and final evaluation at 12 months (clinical visit) after surgery, which will end the participation to the study. - 600 adult males divided in 2 groups requiring primary uncomplicated elective inguinal hernia mesh repair will be included in the study.
