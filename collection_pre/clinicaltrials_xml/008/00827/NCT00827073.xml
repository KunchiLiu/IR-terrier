	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a difference on the penetration of betadine 5% when using lidocaine 2% jelly versus topical tetracaine 0.5% in topical cataract surgery. This will be assessed comparing bacterial colony count and species by taking swabs from the eye surface before and after the topical anesthesia has been administered.</brief_summary>
