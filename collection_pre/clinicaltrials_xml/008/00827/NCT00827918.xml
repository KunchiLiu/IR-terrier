	<brief_summary>A study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment with MK-8998 as compared to placebo and olanzapine for acutely psychotic patients with schizophrenia. The primary hypothesis is that in participants undergoing an acute psychotic episode of schizophrenia, MK-8998 6 to 8 mg twice daily is superior to placebo in the treatment of symptoms of schizophrenia as measured by the mean change from baseline in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score at Week 4.</brief_summary>
