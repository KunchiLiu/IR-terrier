	<brief_title>The Effect of Intravenous Erythromycin on Gastric Emptying in Non-fasted Patients Before Emergency Total Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Urgent or emergency surgery requires that fasting rules observed in elective settings are not respected. Patients who are anesthetized in such conditions are at risk for regurgitation and subsequent broncho-aspiration during induction of anaesthesia due to a full stomach; they often have ingested food or liquids before the injury, or they may have swallowed blood from oral or nasal injuries. Also, gastric emptying is delayed in these patients due to the stress of trauma.1 Already in 1946, Mendelson described the consequences of bronchoaspiration.2 Since, anaesthetists and emergency physicians have tried to avoid broncho-aspiration in emergency patients using premedication with pro-kinetic drugs (for instance, metoclopramide) or its complications with antacid substances, and through the use of a rapid sequence intubation procedure with cricoid pressure. The incidence of aspiration is low, about 1.4 to 6 in 10'000 anaesthetics.3 About 6 in 100'000 anaesthetics will lead to a pulmonary complication due to broncho-aspiration and about 1 in 100'000 patients is likely to die due to aspiration.4 Thus, although episodes of broncho-aspiration are rare, efficacious prevention of this potentially lethal complication is important. One method to reduce the risk of broncho-aspiration during induction of anaesthesia is the pharmacological reduction of the gastric content (i.e. pre-treatment). The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effect of a short intravenous infusion of erythromycin 3 mg/kg, administered 20 min before intubation on gastric emptying, in adults scheduled for rapid sequence intubation for full stomach. After intubation a gastroscopy will be done to see if there is any content in the stomac. The secondary objective is the assessment of tolerability and safety of a single intravenous dose of preoperative erythromycin in surgical patients. This study is a single centre, stratified (according to emergency setting), randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study.</detailed_description>
