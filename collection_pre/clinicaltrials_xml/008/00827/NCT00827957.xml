	<brief_title>Comparing Therapeutic Hypothermia Using External and Internal Cooling for Post-Cardiac Arrest Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Three randomized clinical studies have been reported showing improved neurological outcome and reduced mortality in post-resuscitation patients treated with hypothermia compared to controls. Of the various methods of inducing hypothermia, internal cooling using an endovascular catheter and external cooling using gel pads with a water based circulating system have shown the most promise. There have not been any studies looking at outcomes between the two methods of cooling.</detailed_description>
