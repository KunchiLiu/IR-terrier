	<brief_title>Study of Combination of Cetuximab and Radiotherapy Added to the Standard Treatment for Oesophageal Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims at developing a novel strategy to optimize the treatment of oesophageal adenocarcinoma and gastro-oesophageal junctional tumors with curative intent. Surgery in combination with peri-operative chemotherapy, using the combination epirubicin, cisplatin and 5-FU, as defined by the recent MAGIC trial, results in 13% increase in 5-yr survival. To improve the outcome of patients with this disease we hypothesize that the addition of pre-operative combined cetuximab-radiotherapy (cetux-RT) treatment could improve the outcome of this patient category through better local control.</detailed_description>
