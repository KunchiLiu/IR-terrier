	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Test the effects of a family caregiver palliative care intervention (FCPCI) for informal caregivers of patients with early and late stage lung cancer on caregiver burden and caregiver skills preparedness as compared to a group of family caregivers (FC) in a usual care situation. II. Test the effects of a FCPCI for informal caregivers of patients with early and late stage lung cancer on FC in a usual care situation. III. Describe early and late stage FC self care behavior, comparing the usual care and FCPCI groups. IV. Describe resource use by early and late stage FC comparing the usual care and FCPCI groups. V. Identify subgroups of FC who benefit most from the FCPCI in relation to sociodemographic characteristics, clinical/functional factors. V. Identify subgroups of FC who benefit most from the FCPCI in relation to sociodemographic characteristics, clinical/functional factors. OUTLINE: Family caregivers (FC) are assigned to 1 of 2 groups. GROUP I: FC complete questionnaires at baseline and at 7, 12, 18, and 24 weeks to assess caregiver burden, caregiver skills preparedness, quality of life, distress, self care, and resource use. GROUP II: FC undergo 4 individualized teaching sessions in weeks 7, 8, 10, and 12 that focus on caregiver burden; caregiver skills preparedness; management of patient psychological symptoms; management of FC distress; social and spiritual needs of the patient and FC; the continuing role of the FC in caring for the patient; and development of a personalized wellness plan. FC then receive 3 follow-up phone calls in weeks 16, 20, and 24 to review any questions regarding care; to assess symptom management, community resources, and support; and to review and support the wellness plan. FC also complete questionnaires as in group I. After completion of the educational intervention, a sample of FC undergo 1-hour educational interviews exploring their perspective and insights on their experience as a caregiver.</detailed_description>
