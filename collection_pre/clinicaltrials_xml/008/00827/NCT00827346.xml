	<brief_summary>Platelets are a major component of clot formation which can lead to clotting events such as heart attack. During treatment for a heart attack, doctors try to remove this blockage as quickly as possible so that the heart can recover and start to work properly again. The standard of care at the Heart Institute for patients having a heart attack is a procedure called a Percutaneous Coronary Angioplasty. A drug called Clopidogrel (Plavix) is routinely used prior to the angioplasty to prevent blood clots. Patients usually remain on Clopidogrel for at least one year following the angioplasty. Clopidogrel works by preventing the blood from forming sticky substances called platelets, which clump together to form clots. Despite the routine use of Clopidogrel, some patients still return to the hospital with another heart attack, or with more chest pain. There is a growing body of evidence that recurrence of these complications may be attributed to some patients having a poor response to Clopidogrel. This pilot study will examine how platelets react to different doses of Clopidogrel given to patients having a heart attack.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Platelet Function Monitoring in Patients Treated With Clopidogrel at the Time of Primary Percutaneous Coronary Angioplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Platelets are a major component of clot formation which can lead to thrombotic events. Antiplatelet agents have been found to reduce cardiovascular events in different clinical settings. The commonest agent that has been used is aspirin which works by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase pathway within the platelet and consequently preventing the release of tromboxane A2. A second group of agents called thienopyridines can inhibit platelets by blocking the P2Y12 receptor. Clopidogrel (Plavix) is currently a widely used thienopyridine that has been used for the treatment of patients presenting with the acute coronary syndrome and patients undergoing percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PCI). Antiplatelet therapy has reduced the occurrence of thrombotic events following PCI, including myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis. However, despite dual therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel, a significant number of patients continue to experience cardiovascular events. There is a now growing body of evidence that recurrence of ischemic complications may be attributed to poor response to clopidogrel and that persistence of enhanced platelet reactivity despite the use of clopidogrel is believed to be clinically relevant.1 The mechanisms leading to poor clopidogrel effects are not fully explained. Our pilot study will use the VerifyNow device as an ex vivo method to measure platelet inhibition in patients treated with clopidogrel in the setting of STEMI. Since July 2004, the standard of care at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute for the treatment of STEMI has been primary PCI in which all patients receive aspirin 160 mg po either in the field or on arrival in the emergency department and clopidogrel 600 mg po given on arrival to the hospital. Little is known of the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel in the setting of STEMI. Clopidogrel must be absorbed and activated by the liver to be effective. The physiological mechanisms for these steps may be greatly disturbed in patients presenting with STEMI. Therefore, the purpose of this study will be to examine the degree of platelet inhibition at various time points in this select patient population using the current 600 mg dose of clopidogrel and comparing this dose to other doses of clopidogrel to determine the optimal loading dose in the context of STEMI.</detailed_description>
