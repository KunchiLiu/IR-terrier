	<brief_summary>A pilot study of eniluracil containing ointment for prevention of hand foot syndrome (HRS) following capecitabine (Xeloda).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Eniluracil Hand Foot Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives 1. To estimate the frequency of HFS following treatment with capecitabine as modulated by the unilateral local application of eniluracil containing ointment. 2. To assess any eniluracil dose response relationship in prevention of HFS. 3. To evaluate any potential toxicity of eniluracil ointment.</detailed_description>

Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of breast or colon cancer. 4. Radiologically documented measurable disease 5. Planned to receive capecitabine at 10001250 mg/m2 PO twice daily and has experienced grade 1 or greater HFS on a previous cycle of capecitabine. 6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1 or 2 at study entry. 7. Adequate liver function with SGOT and SGPT &lt; 2.5 times upper limits of normal. 8.

Recovery from relevant toxicity before study entry. 11. Negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days before study entry for women of childbearing potential. Effective contraception throughout the course of the study for both male and female subjects if the risk of conception exists.
