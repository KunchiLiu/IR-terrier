	<brief_summary>1. To determine in a cross sectional case-controlled cohort study of 50 hemodialysis patients if blood pressure elevations with hemodialysis are associated with decreased endothelial cell function (measured by brachial artery flow mediated dilation and endothelial progenitor cell number), both of which are novel mechanistic markers in the causal pathway for detrimental cardiovascular outcomes; and 2. To determine if lowering blood pressure with carvedilol in 25 ESRD subjects with blood pressure elevations with hemodialysis can improve endothelial cell dysfunction as a surrogate mechanistic marker for improving cardiovascular outcomes.</brief_summary>
