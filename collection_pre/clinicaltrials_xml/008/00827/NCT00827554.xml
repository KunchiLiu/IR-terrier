	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major tumor type worldwide, especially in China as the sequence of hepatitis B and liver cirrhosis. Activation of the coagulation system occurs commonly in patients with malignancy. Several studies have suggested that anticoagulant therapy may improve survival in patients with malignancy. The low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) lend themselves to such studies because of their effects in experimental models of malignancy and the relative ease of administration compared with unfractionated heparin. The purpose of the present RCT was to determine whether addition of LMWH to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) would improve HCC patient outcome compared with TACE alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role of Low Molecular Weight Heparins in Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>100 patients will be randomly assigned to receive either TACE alone or TACE plus LMWH. A block of every 4 participants and a stratified randomization according to portal vein cancer emboli will be used to restrict randomization. LMWH consisted of nadroparin Ca will be given at a dose of 4100 U twice daily during 6 weeks after TACE. The time to progression(TTP) and overall survival within two years will be used to evaluate the effect of LMWH on HCC.</detailed_description>
