	<brief_summary>Total hemihepatic vascular exclusion(THHVE),completely isolates the right or left hemiliver ipsilateral to the lesion that requires resection from the systemic circulation,has the advantage of preventing backflow hemorrhage or air embolism without having to resort to caval blood flow interruption of THVE.This study is to evaluate if THHVE can raduce bleeding,reduce the incidence of complications and improve the patient's free survival and overall survival compared with hemihepatic vascular clamping and Pringle maneuver.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Total Hemihepatic Vascular Exclusion in Hepatectomy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The amount of blood loss and blood transfusion in Hepatectomy have a detrimental effect on the prognosis for Hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC).Intraoperative bleeding remains a major concern during liver resection. The most often used hepatic vascular control methods at present are hepatic pedicle occlusion(Pringle maneuver), hemihepatic vascular clamping,segmental vascular clamping and total hepatic vascular exclusion (THVE).However,all these methods have shortcomings. Pringle maneuver cannot prevent bleeding from hepatic veins and leads to ischemia-reperfusion injury of the liver; Hemihepatic vascular clamping cannot prevent bleeding from hepatic veins as well, and from the remnant (nonoccluded) liver. THVE is a technically demanding technique that requires surgical and anesthetic expertise and may lead to hemodynamic intolerance as well as increased morbidity and hospital stay. Total hemihepatic vascular exclusion(THHVE),completely isolates the right or left hemiliver ipsilateral to the lesion that requires resection from the systemic circulation,has the advantage of preventing backflow hemorrhage or air embolism without having to resort to caval blood flow interruption of THVE. The purpose of this study is to evaluate if THHVE can raduce bleeding,reduce the incidence of complications and improve the patient's free survival and overall survival compared with other occlusion methods.</detailed_description>
