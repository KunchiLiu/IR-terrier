	<brief_summary>The adolescent and young adult years are a critical window in time for bone mineral accrual. More than 90% of peak bone mass is achieved by 18 years, and data indicate that insults sustained during adolescence and young adulthood may result in permanent deficits in bone accrual. Adult athletes with amenorrhea (AA) have low bone mineral density (BMD) secondary to hypogonadism, associated with increased fracture risk and associated co-morbidities. We will examine whether estrogen replacement will increase BMD and improve measures of bone microarchitecture in adolescents and young women with AA, thus optimizing peak bone mass.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Young female athletes 18-21 years old will be randomized to estrogen (and progesterone) with lifestyle modification versus lifestyle modification alone for a 12 month period. Bone density and structure will be assessed over this period. Hormonal evaluations will also be performed.</detailed_description>

Family history of myocardial infarction or strokes occurring at less than 50 years 2. Family history of clotting disorders: normal coagulation profile will be necessary for enrollment History of smoking &gt;10 cigarettes a day (history of smoking &gt;14 cigarettes a day is a contraindication for estrogen, but we will be more conservative in our exclusion criteria) Personal history of blood clots</criteria>
