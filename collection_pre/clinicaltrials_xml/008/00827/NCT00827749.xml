	<brief_title>Swallowing Disorders in Geriatrics Studied With Respiratory Plethysmography by Inductance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interest: swallowing disorders exist at any age. More common among the elderly, their prevalence is estimated at between 15 and 50% of more than 60 years. Recognized today as a health problem of particular concern within this population, their pathological consequences are multiple and severe: inhalation pneumonia, often a complication of "the wrong track", was recognized in the USA in 1989, as 5th cause of death among patients aged 65, and the 3rd leading cause of death of patients over 85 years. Malnutrition facilitates infections by depression of the immune system and promotes the development of bedsores. The swallowing disorders resulting in an increase in the prevalence of dehydration, social isolation, but also an increase in mortality. Faced with such consequences, it is therefore necessary to have a reliable, non-invasive approach adapted to the fragility of the elderly to detect these disorders in order to promote preventive strategies and / or curative justified. Originality: This work, which is part of a clinical approach uses a new method of swallowing study, described in A. Moreau-Gaudry's Medicine thesis : "Assets of the respiratory inductance plethysmography to the study of swallowing in geriatrics." The originality of this lies in the combination of Respiratory Plethysmography by inductance (RPI) to the informatic tool. The PRI allows continuous recording, thanks to a vest connected to a laptop, the patient's breathing rate. Readily available at the patient's bedside, it is non-invasive and perfectly suited to the fragility of the study population. The tool, by its automatic guarantees objectivity and reproducibility of the analysis of deglutitions from respiratory signal provided by the RPI.</detailed_description>
