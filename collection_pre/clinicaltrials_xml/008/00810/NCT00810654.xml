	<brief_summary>Oral supplementation with enzymes that can cut gluten has been suggested as a potential treatment modality for coeliac disease. In the present study the investigators wish to determine if co-administration of such an enzyme, a prolyl endoprotease derived from the food grade organism Aspergillis niger (AN-PEP), is capable of detoxifying 8 grams of gluten in a commercial food product.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Aspergillus Niger Prolyl Endoprotease (AN-PEP) Enzyme on the Effects of Gluten Ingestion in Patients With Coeliac Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of the study is to determine whether AN-PEP enzyme is effective in mitigating the effects of 8 g wheat protein ingestion in patients with celiac disease. Fourteen patients with coeliac disease, 18-70 years old are recruited. During the first period, patients consume once daily a gluten-containing food product with the AN-PEP enzyme for 2 weeks. After a 2-week washout period (second period), patients enter the third period of this study, and are randomized to one of two groups and consume the same gluten-containing food product with AN-PEP or placebo. Period 1: Patients are given a food product containing 8 g of wheat protein, to which AN-PEP is added, once daily for 14 d. Period 2: Wash-out period of 14 d. During this period, patients will consume a gluten-free diet. Period 3: Patients who are negative for coeliac disease symptoms during the 1st period will be randomized across two groups. Both groups receive a food product containing 8 g of wheat protein once daily for 14 d. One group receives additional AN-PEP with the gluten meal whereas the other group receives the placebo. Patients will visit the outpatient clinic five times; one visit before the start of the study, a visit during and at the end of the first period, and a visit during and at the end of the third period. During three of the visits, spike-biopsies are taken from the duodenum by oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy. Blood samples are taken during all of the five visits. Patients will also fill in a quality of life questionnaire at the start and the end of the first and third period.</detailed_description>
