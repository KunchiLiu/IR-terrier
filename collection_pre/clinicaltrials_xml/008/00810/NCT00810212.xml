	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of NeoFuse in Subjects Requiring Posterolateral Lumbar Fusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label controlled Phase 1b/2a study designed to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of MPCs combined with MasterGraft Granules when compared to use of autologous bone graft in the posterolateral fusion site in subjects requiring interbody fusion in combination with instrumented 1 or 2 level PLF procedure. All subjects in this study will undergo a 1 or 2-level (2 or 3 vertebrae) interbody fusion without the use of the investigational product. In addition to the interbody fusion procedure, subjects will undergo an instrumented posterolateral fusion. NeoFuse plus MasterGraft Granules at one of three doses or autograft will be implanted in the posterolateral lumbar fusion site(s) only. After the screening and surgical visits, each subject will be evaluated clinically and radiographically within 3 days and 30 days after surgery, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after surgery. Subjects will be evaluated at 24 and 36 months after surgery for safety.</detailed_description>
