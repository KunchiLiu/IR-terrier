	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of sorafenib and to see how well it works in treating patients with advanced malignant solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib in Treating Patients With Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To evaluate the feasibility of re-escalating the dose of sorafenib tosylate in patients with advanced malignant solid tumors who initially required a dose reduction for toxicity, and dose escalation in those patients who are able to tolerate the initial dose. Secondary - To evaluate the efficacy of this drug in these patients who are able to tolerate a dose escalation initially or after a dose reduction compared to those who are unable to tolerate a dose escalation. Tertiary - To evaluate the percentage and demographic characteristics of patients who are able to tolerate 2 dose escalations without a dose reduction. OUTLINE: This is a dose-finding study. - Course 1: Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily at dose level 0 on weeks 1-4. - Course 2: Patients experiencing no dose-limiting or intolerable toxicities receive oral sorafenib tosylate at dose level +1 twice daily on weeks 5-8; while patients experiencing dose-limiting or intolerable toxicities receive oral sorafenib tosylate at dose level -1 once daily on weeks 5-8. - Course 3: Depending on whether or not patients are experiencing dose-limiting or intolerable toxicities, they are escalated to dose level 0 or dose level +2 (patients in both dose levels receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily) in weeks 9-12, or de-escalated to dose level 0 or dose level -2 (patients in dose level -2 receives oral sorafenib tosylate once every other day) in weeks 9-12. - Maintenance therapy: Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate at the dose level* attained at the end of course 3. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. NOTE: *Dose level de-escalation for toxicity or dose re-escalation after a toxicity-related dose reduction allowed to a maximum level of the initial dose level of the maintenance therapy. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for up to 1 year.</detailed_description>
