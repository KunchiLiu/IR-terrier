	<brief_summary>Glaucoma, one of the most common causes of blindness, is associated with increased intraocular pressure (IOP) and optic nerve head ischemia. Nitrovasodilators are discussed in the treatment of glaucoma. Nitrates relax smooth muscle cells in the vasculature by liberating the vasodilator nitric oxide. The IOP lowering potential and the vasodilator action in retinal and choroidal vessels of nitrates is still a matter of controversy. Previous studies on the ocular hemodynamic effects of nitrates showed partially contradicting results. In addition the IOP lowering effect of nitrates is still unclear. However, recent studies show that long acting nitrates may preserve optic nerve deterioration and visual field loss. Therefore, the role of nitrovasodilators in control of ocular blood flow and intraocular pressure has to be elucidated. For this purpose the investigators plan to test the hypothesis that nitrovasodilators improve ocular blood supply to the optic nerve head at doses which do not affect systemic hemodynamics.</brief_summary>
