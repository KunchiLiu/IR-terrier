	<detailed_description>A randomized prospective study of patients with HC-BPPV. Patients with apogeotropic type of HC-BPPV were randomized to one of each three treatment groups at their first clinic visit. These groups included the Gufoni maneuver, head-shaking maneuver, and sham group in apogeotropic HC-BPPV. Responsiveness of treatment maneuver was determined by positioning maneuver immediately after each treatment method based on resolves of vertigo and positional nystagmus.</detailed_description>
