	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to measure the effect that the scraping and scoring of vertebral cancellous bone using the KyphonÂ® Curette has on vertebral body anatomy height restoration and angular deformity correction during a balloon kyphoplasty procedure.</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Fractures, Compression</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Age &gt;= 50 years One painful VCF meeting all of the following criteria: Fracture due to diagnosed or suspected underlying primary or secondary osteoporosis VCF is between T5 and L5 VCF shows hyperintense signal on STIR or T2 weighted MRI VCF has at least 15% height loss as visualized on plain radiograph Identified painful VCF has at least superior and one normal vertebrae within 2 levels inferior. Either the immediate superior OR the immediate inferior vertebral body (but not both) may have a chronic fracture that does not need treatment. Patient states availability for all study visits Patient is able to understand the risks and benefits of participating in the study and is willing to provide written informed consent Patient is unable to undergo MRI Patient shows evidence of edema in vertebral bodies other than index level on MRI Patient is unable to stand for preoperative and postoperative xrays Patient body mass index (BMI) is greater than 35 kg/m2 Patient is pregnant, or of childbearing potential and not using contraception Vertebral body (VB) morphology or configuration is such that balloon kyphoplasty is not technically feasible or clinically appropriate for the index VCF Index fracture is result of highenergy trauma Suspected or proven cancer inside any VB Disabling back pain due to causes other than acute fracture Spine stabilization beyond balloon kyphoplasty required for index VCF Preexisting conditions contrary to balloon kyphoplasty, such as: Irreversible coagulopathy or bleeding disorder. Note that patients on Coumadin or other anticoagulants may participate. Investigators should follow routine practices for perioperative discontinuation and reinitiation of anticoagulants. Allergy to any device materials (e.g., bone cement) for balloon kyphoplasty. Note that in patients with allergy to iodinebased contrast, other marketed approved noniodine contrast solutions may be used. Any evidence of VB or systemic infection</criteria>
