	<brief_summary>Coronary artery disease has a high death toll in the Western world. Changes in lifestyle, particularly in nutrition and physical activity may significantly reduce a severe coronary atherosclerosis within one year without the use of medication. Several dietary studies have shown that not only the progress of coronary artery disease can be slowed down, but it may also increase significantly the survival of these patients. Up until now there is little known about therapeutic effects by complementary medicine.
