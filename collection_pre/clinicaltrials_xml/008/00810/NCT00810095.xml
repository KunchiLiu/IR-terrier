	<brief_title>Percutaneous Recanalization in Ischemic Stroke Management (PRIISM): A Feasibility Clinical Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of PRIISM is to assess the feasibility of using the MindFrame System to safely and effectively restore blood flow in a thrombotic neurovascular occlusion in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Safety will be assessed by the device-related serious event rate as it compares to other similar therapies. The events include but are not limited to symptomatic hemorrhage, vessel dissection, embolization and overall morbidity and mortality. Target vessels include the basilar, internal carotid and middle cerebral (M1 and M2 segments) arteries.</detailed_description>
