	<brief_summary>Primary objective: To demonstrate the non-inferiority of Bi-Profenid 100 mg x 2 day versus Bi-Profenid 150 mg x 2 day in patients presenting with pain related to closed, benign, acute post-traumatic conditions of the motor system or acute, non-infectious rheumatologic conditions, by comparing, on the one hand, changes in resting pain intensity over the entire day, measured at the end of the day using a numeric scale (NS), over 5 days and, on the other hand, total intake over 5 days of concomitant analgesics. Secondary Objectives: - To describe concomitant analgesic treatments - To describe the time between baseline and use of a step I, II or III analgesic - To evaluate patients pain relief using a Likert 4-class scale (complete or substantial relief, moderate relief slight relief and absence of relief) at D5 - To evaluate changes in intensity of pain when moving, over the entire day, measured at the end of the day using a numeric scale, over 5 days - To evaluate the patients overall satisfaction at the end of treatment using a 4-point Simple Verbal Scale (SVS) (very satisfied, somewhat satisfied, somewhat unsatisfied, very unsatisfied) - To evaluate the patients overall satisfaction at the end of the study using a 4-point Simple Verbal Scale (EVS) (very satisfied, somewhat satisfied, somewhat unsatisfied, very unsatisfied) - To compare the safety of the two treatments</brief_summary>
