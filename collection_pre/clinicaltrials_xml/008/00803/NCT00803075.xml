	<criteria>1. Patient has one of the following: Aneurysm &gt;4 cm in diameter, or an aneurysm that has increased in size by 0.5 cm in the last 6months Aneurysm is 1.5 times larger than the diameter of the normal infrarenal aorta or symptomatic Aneurysm is saccular Penetrating ulcer 2. Patient's vascular dimensions must be in the range that can be safely treated with the stent graft available to the physician at the time of the procedure. 3. Patient has endovascular access to the aneurysmal site with the Introducer Sheath or Delivery Catheter of the appropriate ize device chosen for treatment. 4. Patient has anatomic characteristics suitable for endovascular repair. 5. Patient has an immediate lifethreatening disease of the abdominal aorta in which there is a reasonable likelihood that death will occur within a matter of months or in which premature death is likely without early treatment. 6. Patient is American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) grade 1 through 4. 7. Patient is able and willing to comply with 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and every year thereafter post treatment followup requirements. 8. Patient or patient's legal representative understands and has signed an Informed Consent.&amp;#xA; 1. Patient is pregnant or nursing. 2. Patient is morbidly obese or has other clinical conditions that severely inhibit Xray visualization of the aorta. 3. Patient has connective disease. 4. Patient is hypercoagulable. 5. Patient has active systemic infection. 6. Patient is less than 18 years old. 7. Patient has less than a oneyear life expectancy. 8. Patient is unwilling or unable to return for followup visits.</criteria>
