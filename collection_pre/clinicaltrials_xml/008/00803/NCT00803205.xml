	<brief_summary>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the gene that makes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. A specific type of mutation called a nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation is the cause of CF in approximately 10% of subjects with the disease. Ataluren (PTC124) is an orally delivered investigational drug that has the potential to overcome the effects of the nonsense mutation. This study is a Phase 3 trial that will evaluate the clinical benefit of ataluren (PTC124) in adult and pediatric patients with CF due to a nonsense mutation. The main goals of the study are to understand whether ataluren (PTC124) can improve pulmonary function and whether the drug can safely be given for a long period of time. The study will also assess the effects of ataluren on CF pulmonary exacerbation frequency, cough frequency, health-related quality of life, antibiotic use for CF-related infections, CF-related disruptions to daily living, body weight, and CF pathophysiology.

	<brief_title>Study of Ataluren (PTC124™) in Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, efficacy and safety study, designed to document the clinical benefit of ataluren (PTC124) when administered as therapy of patients with CF due to a nonsense mutation (premature stop codon) in the CFTR gene. It is planned that ~208 subjects who are ≥6 years of age and have an FEV1 ≥40% and ≤90% of predicted will be enrolled. Study subjects will be enrolled at sites in North America, Europe, and Israel. They will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either ataluren (PTC124) or placebo. Subjects will receive study drug 3 times per day (at morning, midday, and evening) for 48 weeks. Subjects will be evaluated at clinic visits every 8 weeks. Additional safety laboratory testing, which may be performed at the investigational site or at an accredited local laboratory or clinic, is required every 4 weeks for the first 6 months of study participation. At the completion of blinded treatment, all compliant participants will be eligible to receive open-label ataluren (PTC124) in a separate extension study.</detailed_description>
