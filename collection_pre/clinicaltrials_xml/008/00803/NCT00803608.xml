	<criteria>1. Men and women, 18 years of age or older at the time of consent; 2. Clinical diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus ; 3. At least one recently healed plantar MTHrelated foot ulcer (&gt;1 week but 4 months since heeling), based on medical records or if these cannot be obtained to the subject's best recollection OR current or recurring hemorrhage into callus under at least one MTH in a patient with a prior MTH related plantar ulcer that has been documented in the medical record; 4. Barefoot plantar pressure in the area of the previous MTHrelated ulcer or at the area of current hemorrhagic callus &gt;450 kPa; 5. Loss of Protective Sensation (refer to Section 7.2.6); 6. Community ambulator defined as having the ability or potential for ambulation outside in the community including the ability to traverse lowlevel environmental barriers such as curbs, stairs, or uneven surfaces, or better by subject report; 7. Ability to give consent; 8. In the opinion of the site PI the subject is willing and able to comply with the scheduled visits, treatment plan, and other trial procedures for the duration of the study. 1. Presence of a current ulcer (see Section 7.1.1) below the malleoli, in the opinion of the site PI; 2. Partial foot amputation greater than of two metatarsal heads or rays per foot; toe amputations with the metatarsal heads left in place are permissible; complete foot amputation on one side (i.e. ambulation with a prosthesis) is permissible; 3. Charcot process that is active in the opinion of the site PI (requires immobilization beyond use of footwear that would be available through the study); 4. A prior ulcer on the plantar aspect of the heel within the last year, to the subject's best recollection that in the opinion of the site PI has high probability of recurring in the study footwear; 5. A prior ulcer on the weightbearing aspect of any toe within the last year, to the subject's best recollection that in the opinion of the site PI has high probability of recurring in the study footwear; 6. A prior ulcer on the plantar aspect of the foot associated with a midfoot prominence at any time in the past, to the subject's best recollection that in the opinion of the site PI has high probability of recurring in the study footwear; 7. A prior ulcer on the plantar aspect of the foot associated with a midfoot prominence at any time in the past, if the associated plantar pressure is &gt;450kPa 8. Barefoot plantar pressure in the midfoot that exceeds forefoot peak plantar pressure; 9. Need for an anklefoot orthoses in the opinion of the site PI or another provider; 10. Need for more complex intervention, i.e. the site PI's decision is that the study footwear would not be adequate for the subject's needs, e.g. a rigid outsole or custom molded shoes are deemed necessary.</criteria>
