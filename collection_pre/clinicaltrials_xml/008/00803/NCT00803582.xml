	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of acupuncture for the treatment of phonotraumatic lesions of the vocal folds, using the International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health (World Health Organization, 2001) as the conceptual framework to guide the selection of outcome measures.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Acupuncture for Phonotraumatic Injuries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The experimental hypothesis for this study is that needling at the designated treatment acupoints will bring about greater improvement in structural and functional impairment in the vocal folds and its sequelae, as compared to placebo treatment. However, it is further hypothesized that treatment benefits from acupuncture will be outweighed by continued phonotrauma following termination of treatment, and thus will not be maintained at long-term follow-up. Further, it is expected that voice-related quality-of-life improvements may be equal for genuine acupuncture as compared to placebo. Finally, it is hypothesized that the acupuncture protocol should have comparable effects for male and female subjects.</detailed_description>
