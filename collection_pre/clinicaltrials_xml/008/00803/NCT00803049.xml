	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study was to document the long-term safety and tolerability of teriflunomide in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) participants with relapse. The secondary objective was to document the long-term efficacy on disability progression, relapse rate and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) parameters.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long Term Safety and Efficacy Study of Teriflunomide 7 mg or 14 mg in Patients With Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants completing the EFC6049 (HMR1726D/3001) study were given the opportunity to continue in the extension study; - participants receiving teriflunomide 7 mg or 14 mg were blindly maintained on the same dose of teriflunomide. - participants receiving placebo were randomized at a 1:1 ratio to teriflunomide 7 mg or 14 mg. The study period per participant was broken down as follows: - Double-blind treatment: up to a maximum of 288 weeks or until teriflunomide was commercially available in the country where participant lived, - Post-washout follow-up: 4 weeks after last treatment intake. No post-washout follow up if participant continued on teriflunomide treatment by obtaining its commercial form after end of the study. The total duration of the extension was 292 weeks (about 6 years) from the first participant enrolled or until teriflunomide is commercially available in the country where participant lived.</detailed_description>
