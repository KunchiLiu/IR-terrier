	<brief_summary>Patients undergoing total knee arthroscopy (knee replacement) surgery usually receive a femoral nerve block as part of their anesthetic care. Some centers administer the block with a single shot of local anesthetic, which wears off several hours after surgery. Other centers administer the block with a single shot followed by continuous infusion of local anesthetic, typically for 2 to 5 days after surgery. The latter method, though good for pain control, may result in decreased mobility (while the anesthetic is still active), longer hospital stays, and greater risk of falls. This study will see if using a lower concentration of local anesthetic for the continuous femoral nerve block or only the initial single-shot dose will result in increased mobility and shorter hospital stays.</brief_summary>
