	<brief_summary>Although no reliable and specific figures are available for the total expenditure on UDS, UDS is commonly performed for patients with urinary incontinence (UI) regardless of gender and age. UDS is typically performed prior to incontinence surgery. Urodynamic studies are expensive, time-consuming, and uncomfortable diagnostic investigations. The 3rd ICI reported insufficient evidence with which to answer the following key research questions related to UDS: 1) Do physicians alter clinical decision-making based on results of UDS?, and 2) Do alterations in clinical decisions made in response to UDS results improve the clinical outcomes?</brief_summary>
