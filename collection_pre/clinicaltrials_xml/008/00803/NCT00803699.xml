	<brief_title>Predicting Dietary Selenium Needs to Achieve Target Blood Selenium Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Results of studies with animal tumor models and human clinical trials suggest that the essential nutrient selenium can be anti-tumorigenic if consumed at levels greater than nutritional requirements. If it is possible to increase plasma selenium concentrations above 120 nanograms per milliliter with less than 200 micrograms of selenium daily, then it is possible that supplementation can be accomplished through the use of selenium-containing foods.</detailed_description>
