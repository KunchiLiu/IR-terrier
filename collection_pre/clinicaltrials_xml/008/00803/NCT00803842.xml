	<brief_summary>A side effect occurring in a majority of patients taking erlotinib (Tarceva®) consists of a skin rash. Sometimes, symptoms associated with the rash necessitate erlotinib dose reduction or discontinuation. Some physicians have successfully treated the erlotinib-induced rash with doxycycline. At the same time, it has been observed that in patients who develop the erlotinib rash, the cancers respond better to erlotinib treatment. This research study is designed to determine how well doxycycline treats the erlotinib rash and whether doxycycline affects the blood levels of erlotinib.</brief_summary>
