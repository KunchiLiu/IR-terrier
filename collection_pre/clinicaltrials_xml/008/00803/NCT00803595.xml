	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to confirm the efficacy of CS-8958 administered as a single inhaled low dose or single inhaled high dose by showing non-inferiority to oseltamivir phosphate using the time to alleviation of influenza illness. For safety evaluation, between-group comparisons will be made with regard to incidence of adverse events and other safety measures. In a secondary objective, the optimum dosage of CS-8958 for this indication will be evaluated based on the efficacy and safety of single inhaled low or high dose.</brief_summary>
