	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) clevidipine as compared with standard of care IV antihypertensive agents for blood pressure (BP) lowering in patients with acute heart failure and elevated BP.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clevidipine in the Treatment of Blood Pressure in Patients With Acute Heart Failure (PRONTO)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was an open-label randomized efficacy and safety pilot trial in patients with acute heart failure (AHF) and hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] ≥160 mm Hg) requiring parenteral antihypertensive therapy. Eligible patients were randomized to receive clevidipine or standard of care (SOC) intravenous antihypertensive treatment in an open-label manner in a ratio of 1:1. At the time of randomization, a patient-specific, prespecified SBP target range was determined and be recorded, prior to study drug treatment. Information on the dosing regimen, use of additional or alternative agents and transition to oral therapy if needed is detailed in the study 'ARM' and 'INTERVENTION' sections. A Data Safety Monitoring Board was utilized periodically throughout the study to monitor the safety of patients. Adverse events were assessed for 7 days post-study randomization or hospital discharge, whichever occured first. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were assessed for 30 days following study randomization. Subjects were contacted by telephone or in person up to 5 days after their 30-day time point to determine if any SAEs occurred following study drug treatment and to follow up on the Heath Economic assessments.</detailed_description>
