	<brief_summary>The incretin effect is markedly reduced in patients with type 2 diabetes. Data support the notion that this deficiency is a consequence of the diabetic state. However, the impact of insulin resistance on the incretin effect in obese individuals who uphold a normal glucose tolerance (NGT) despite their insulin resistant state remains to be elucidated. The primary aim of the present study is to evaluate the separate impact of one of the cornerstones of type 2 diabetic pathophysiology, namely insulin resistance, on the incretin effect in lean and obese patients with type 2 diabetes and in two matched normal-glucose tolerant groups of healthy control subjects.</brief_summary>
