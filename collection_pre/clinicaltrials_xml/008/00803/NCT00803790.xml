	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the bioequivalence of alendronate in combination with vitamin D compared to alendronate alone and the bioequivalence of vitamin D in combination with alendronate compared to vitamin D alone. This was an open-label, randomized, 2-part, crossover study. Each participant participated in one part of the study only (i.e., each participant participated only in Part I or only in Part II). Participants entered the study sequentially within each part of the study. A washout of at least 12 days separated each treatment period within each part of the study.</brief_summary>
