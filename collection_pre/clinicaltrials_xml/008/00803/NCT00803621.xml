	<brief_summary>With a HIV incidence much higher in the DFA than in European French territory, this disease is a major public health problem in these areas, especially in French Guiana. Cerebral toxoplasmosis is a priority among the opportunistic infections in AIDS patients from the DFA because of its frequency (French West Indies) and of its lethality (French Guiana). The diagnosis of cerebral toxoplasmosis may be difficult because based only on presumptive clinical and radiological features. The response to specific antitoxoplasmic therapy confirms a posteriori the diagnosis. In reference to the data collected by the Biological Resource Centre Toxoplasma, in particular in French Guiana, we think that T. gondii strains reactivating in AIDS patients from DFA are genetically different from those reactivating in AIDS patients from Europe, with an increased capacity for dissemination via peripheral blood in the first ones. This more frequent or more prolonged parasitemia could facilitate the diagnosis of cerebral toxoplasmosis by PCR test from peripheral blood samples in AIDS patients from the French departments of America.</brief_summary>
