	<brief_title>Comparison of Multifocal Electroretinogram Assessment in Chronic Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSC) Between Laser Treatment Group and Photodynamic Therapy Group in Chronic Central Serous Chorioretinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. Laser Group: extrafoveal focal leakage on FAG 2. PDT Group: no definite focal leak on FAG subfoveal or juxtafoveal focal leakage on FAG, or serous retinal pigmentary epithelial detachment involving foveal center Inclusion criteria 1. Chronic serous chorioretinopathy (over 3 months) when subretinal fluid persisted in the subfoveal region demonstrated by clinical examination and OCT 2. Ability to maintain steady fixation for mfERG 3. Presence of abnormal dilated choroidal vasculature in ICGA 4. Symptom duration over 3 months Exclusion criteria 1. previous PDT or laser treatment history 2. evidence of Choriinal neovascularization in FAG 3. other chorioretinal disorders that can cause macular exudation such as age-related macular degeneration, pathologic myopia, angioid streaks, trauma, inflammatory diseases, retinal vasculopathies, and hereditary dystrophies follow-up Visit 1)baseline 2)1month 3)3months 4)6 months each visit: multifocal electroretinogram, visual acuity, optical coference timography should be measured.</detailed_description>
