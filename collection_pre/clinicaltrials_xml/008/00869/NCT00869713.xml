Clinically significant abnormal lab results, including evidence of Hepatitis C, Hepatitis B carrier state, or elevated (2 times normal) liver function tests. 3. Personal history of immunodeficiency or current treatment with immunosuppressive medication. 4. Confirmed positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) titer. 5. Any medical condition that, at the discretion of the physician, may jeopardize the safety of the subject. 6. Any serious or lifethreatening allergies to any component of the vaccine: formalin human serum albumin neomycin streptomycin fetal rhesus lung cells RVF virus inactivated 7. Administration of any Investigational New Drug (IND) product or any vaccine within the 28 days before RVF vaccination. 8. Any unresolved adverse event resulting from a previous immunization.</criteria>
