	<brief_summary>Dasatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It may also make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. This randomized phase I/II trial is studying the best dose of dasatinib and to see how well it works compared with a placebo when given together with radiation therapy and temozolomide in treating patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dasatinib or Placebo, Radiation Therapy, and Temozolomide in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial includes a phase I dose-escalation study and a double-blind randomized phase II trial for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Phase I will be a cohort of 3 dose-escalation trial of dasatinib in combination with radiation and concomitant temozolomide. Patients receive concomitant chemotherapy and radiation therapy for cycle one. Patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy 28-42 days post cycle one treatment. Patients receive only dasatinib post cycle 8 treatment until progressive disease, unacceptable adverse events or refusal. Phase II will be a randomized trial with two treatment arms. Patients will be randomized at the time of registration at a ratio of 1:2 respectively to either standard therapy arm (continuous daily placebo prior, during and after standard radiotherapy/temozolomide followed by temozolomide. For more information please see the Arms section. The primary objectives are listed below. Primary Objectives: 1. To establish a maximum tolerated dose of dasatinib combined with radiation and temozolomide in this patient population (Phase I) 2. To determine the efficacy of dasatinib in combination with radiotherapy and concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, and compare it with the standard of care approach in the treatment of these patients consisting of radiotherapy and temozolomide, followed by adjuvant temozolomide (Phase II) Patients are followed for 5 years post treatment. The study permanently closed to accrual on January 31, 2014.</detailed_description>

Sites submitting GBM with oligodendroglial features will be asked to provide results of 1p/19q codeletion status. 3.

Required Laboratory Values: The following laboratory values obtained ≤ 14 days prior to registration. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500/mm3 Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) SGOT (AST) ≤ 2.5 x ULN Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN 6. Required INR Value: The following INR value obtained ≤ 28 days prior to registration INR ≤ 1.5 7. Urine or Serum Pregnancy Test Negative urine or serum pregnancy test done ≤ 7 days prior to registration, for women of childbearing potential only. 8. Written Informed Consent Patient must provide written informed consent. 9. Return to Enrolling Institution Patient must be willing to return to Alliance enrolling institution for followup. 10. Tissue Samples Patient must be willing to provide tissue samples for research purposes. 11. Patient must be willing to provide tissue samples for research purposes. 12. Required Antibiotic Prophylaxis Patient must be willing to comply with antibiotic prophylaxis with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, pentamidine or dapsone. 13. Grapefruit and Grapefruit Juice Patient must be willing to abstain from eating grapefruit or drinking grapefruit juice for the duration of the study treatment. 14. Ability to Swallow Patient must have the ability to take oral medication (dasatinib must be swallowed whole). 15. Quality of Life (QOL) Questionnaires Phase II patients only: Patients must be willing and able to complete QOL questionnaires independently or with the help of a caregiver. 16. Other AntiTumor Drug Therapies Patient must be willing to forego other cytotoxic and noncytotoxic drug therapy against the tumor while being treated with dasatinib and temozolomide. Registration 1. Pregnancy, Nursing and Required Contraception Any of the following because this study involves an investigational agent whose genotoxic, mutagenic and teratogenic effects on the developing fetus and newborn are unknown: Pregnant women Nursing women Men or women of childbearing potential who are unwilling to employ adequate contraception throughout study treatment and for at least 12 weeks after study drug is stopped. 2. Prior Radiotherapy or Chemotherapy for Any CNS Neoplasm Received any prior radiotherapy or chemotherapy for any CNS neoplasm (hormones, vitamins and growth factors are not considered chemotherapy for the purposes of this study. 3. Prior Surgery for Any CNS Neoplasm Prior surgeries for any CNS neoplasms, other than surgery related to the current GBM diagnosis. Note: If Gliadel wafers are placed at time of primary resection, this would be considered prior therapy and patient would be ineligible. 4. Concurrent Illness or Disease Comorbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the prescribed regimens.
