	<brief_title>The Effectiveness of Biofeedback Treatment in Constipated Patients With Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The medical treatment of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) alleviates constipation symptoms due to the restoration of autonomic dysfunction. However, additional laxatives are usually needed in these patients. Other suppository treatments included stool softeners, dopamine-receptor agonists, botulinum toxins, and prokinetic medications such as tegaserod. Biofeedback therapy (BFT) has been the gold standard for functional constipation with dyssynergic defecation or rectal hyposensitivity. However, researchers have not tried to evaluate its usefulness in constipated IPD patients up to now. The aims of our study are to characterize the nature of constipation in IPD and to evaluate the usefulness of BFT in constipated IPD patients.</detailed_description>
