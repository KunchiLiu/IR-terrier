	<criteria>Documented history of SPMS Absence of relapse in the 3mos prior to baseline EDSS of 3.5 6.5 Pyramidal or Cerebellar FSS greater than or equal to 3 A cohort of 100 HLA DR2/4 negative patients is required. Once enrollment to this cohort is complete, all further patients are required to be HLA DR2/4 positive. Informed consent Subject reliability and compliance Diagnosis of Primary Progressive MS Subjects have previously received MBP8298 Recent history of malignancy, with the exclusion on basal cell carcinoma. Steroid therapy within 30 days prior to first study specific procedure or any other treatment known to be used for putative or experimental MS treatment Therapy with betainterferon, glatiramer acetate within 3 mos or mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, azathioprine, or any other immunomodulating or immunosuppressive drugs including recombinant or nonrecombinant cytokines or plasma exchange within 6 mos prior to performance of the first studyspecific test, with the exception of corticosteroids or ACTH for relapse treatment. Initiation or discontinuation of therapy with 4AP or 3,4DAP at any time during the study period. History of anaphylactic/anaphlactoid reactions to glatiramer acetate Abnormal lab values at the Screening Visit deemed by the Investigator to be clinically significant Known allergy to GadoliniumDTPA Treatment at any time with Cladribine, total lymphoid irradiation, monoclonal antibody treatment Treatment at any time wtih an altered peptide ligand Any conditions that could interfere with the performance of study specific procedures e.g.MRI Previous randomization to this study Known positivity for HIV, Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C Participation in any other nonMS clinical trial within 30 days prior to performance of the first study specific test or any investigational therapy in the past 6 mos. Females who are breast feeding, pregnant or not using a medically approved method of contraception regularly Known or suspected current or past alcohol or drug abuse (within the last year) Any medical, psychiatric or other condition that could result in a subject not being able to give fully informed consent, or to comply with the protocol requirements Any other condition that, in the investigator's opinion, makes the subject unsuitable for participation in the study</criteria>
