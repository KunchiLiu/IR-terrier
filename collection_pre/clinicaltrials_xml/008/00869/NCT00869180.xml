	<brief_title>Diclofenac Patch for Treatment of Acute Pain Due to Mild to Moderate Ankle Sprain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study will be conducted in patients with mild or moderate ankle sprains. Eligible patients will be randomized (in a 1:1 ratio) to receive double-blind treatment with either the diclofenac topical patch or a matching placebo patch to be applied once daily for 7 days. Patients will return to the clinic for assessments on Day 3 and Day 7; a follow-up assessment will be conducted on Day 14. Patients will complete an electronic diary in which assessments including pain intensity, pain relief and functional disability will be recorded twice daily. Ratings of the quality of sleep will be recorded in the diary each morning, and the use of study treatment and rescue medication will be recorded in the diary each day.</detailed_description>
