	<detailed_description>Objective: To study the effect of the 'wholegrain concept', i.e. high intake of wheat wholegrain (WW) vs. refined wheat (RW) grain products on body weight and composition. Design: In this open-labeled randomized trial, 72 postmenopausal women with metabolic syndrome features were prescribed a mild calorie-restricted diet with a deficit of ~1,250kJ/d. Following 2 weeks run-in period on RW products, they were randomized to 12 weeks intervention with RW or WW products providing 2,000kJ/d.</detailed_description>
