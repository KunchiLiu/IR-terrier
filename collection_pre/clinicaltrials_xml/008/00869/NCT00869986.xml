	<criteria>1. Male or female subjects, 1850 years of age 2. Relapsingremitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) according to "Diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis: 2005 revisions to the McDonald Criteria" (Annals of Neurology 58: 840846) 3. At least 2 years history of MS before trial entry 4. Documented history of 2 or more exacerbations in the 2 years prior to trial entry 5. Stable neurological status for at least 30 days before first study drug administration 6. Have an EDSS from 05.5 7. If female, she must either be postmenopausal or surgically sterilized; or use a hormonal contraceptive, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, or condom with spermicide, for the duration of the study; and be neither pregnant nor breastfeeding 8. Willingness and ability to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study 9. In the Investigator's opinion, subjects must be reliable, compliant, and agree to cooperate with all trial evaluations 10. Subject must be able and willing to give meaningful, written informed consent prior to participation in the trial, in accordance with regulatory requirements 1. Have Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS), Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS), Primary Progressive MS (PPMS) 2. Any known malignancy, or history of malignancy, with the exclusion of basal cell carcinoma 3. Have active, clinically significant liver, renal or bone marrow disease accompanied with significant laboratory abnormalities in the range of grade I or more as defined by Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC), 4. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities at screening 5. Have the presence of systemic disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with subject safety, compliance or evaluation of the condition under study (e.g. insulin dependent diabetes, lyme disease, clinically significant cardiac, hepatic, or renal disease, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or Human TCell Lymphotrophic Virus Type1) 6. Have current autoimmune disease, compromised immune function or infection 7. History of allergic reactions to glatiramer acetate 8. Steroid therapy within 30 days prior to first study specific procedure, or any other treatment known to be used for putative or experimental MS treatment 9. Therapy with ÃŸinterferon, glatiramer acetate, statins, copaxone or nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitors within 3 months prior to first studyspecific test 10. Therapy with mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, azathioprine, or any other immunomodulating (e.g. IVIG) or immunosuppressive drugs including recombinant or nonrecombinant cytokines or plasma exchange within 6 months prior to performance of the first studyspecific test, with the exception of corticosteroids or ACTH for relapse treatment 11. Treatment at any time with an altered peptide ligand, cladribine, total lymphoid irradiation, monoclonal antibody treatment e.g. antiCD4, antiCD52, antiVLA4, AntiCD20, 12. Any contraindications for MRI, e.g. pacemaker or known allergy to Gadolinium DTPA 13. Participation in any other trial of an investigational agent within 90 days prior to screening 14. History of alcohol or drug abuse as specified by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSMIV) within the year before screening 15. Any medical, psychiatric or other condition that could result in a subject not being able to give fully informed consent, or to comply with the protocol requirements 16. Any other condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, makes the subject unsuitable for participation in the study</criteria>
