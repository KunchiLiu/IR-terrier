	<brief_summary>The recovery from knee replacement surgery often involves a significant amount of pain. The best way to prevent/treat this pain is unknown. This study will compare two accepted methods of pain control in order to determine which is superior. The first method involves the injection of a solution containing multiple medications into the knee joint at the time of surgery. The second method involves the placement of a catheter adjacent to the femoral nerve which senses pain from the knee. This catheter is used to deliver local anesthetic which serves to block the transmission of pain signals from the nerve. The catheter will be left in place until 2 days after surgery. This method is combined with injection of local anesthetic in a particular area of the knee joint at the time of surgery. Patients will be followed until 2 days after surgery in order to determine which method is superior. We believe the second method will be deemed superior.</brief_summary>
