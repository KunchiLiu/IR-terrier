	<brief_summary>The objective of this double-blinded, multicenter, randomized, active-controlled study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Stribild, a single-tablet regimen (STR) containing fixed doses of elvitegravir (EVG)/GS-9350 (cobicistat; COBI)/emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) versus efavirenz (EFV)/FTC/TDF (Atripla) in HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral treatment-naive adult participants. Stribild offers an alternative STR for patients who are not candidates for non-nucleoside reverse transcriptor (NNRTI)-based STRs. Participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive Stribild or Atripla. Randomization will be stratified by HIV-1 RNA level (≤ 100,000 copies/mL or &gt; 100,000 copies/mL) at screening. After Week 48, participants will continue to take their blinded study drug and attend visits every 12 weeks until treatment assignments are unblinded (Week 60), at which point all participants will attend an Unblinding Visit and be given the option to participate in an open-label rollover extension (the extension is scheduled to be open until Stribild becomes commercially available, or until Gilead Sciences elects to terminate the study).</brief_summary>
