Additional inclusion criteria include: a subjective TST &lt;6.5 h and a subjective SL &gt; 45 min per night; a mean LPS &gt;20 min over 2 consecutive nights by polysomnography (neither night could have been &lt;15 min); a habitual bedtime between 10 PM and 1 AM; and ISI score &gt; 10 (based on 04 scale). LPS is defined as amount of time to the first 10 minutes of continuous sleep. Asthma will be diagnosed based on suggestive clinical history and either airway hyperresponsiveness indicated by a 20% or greater decrease in FEV1 in response to inhalation of methacholine at 8 mg/mL or less bronchodilatorresponsive expiratory airflow limitation (if FEV1 &lt; 70% of predicted value or &lt; 1.5 L, improving ≥200 mL and 12% in response to 180 µg of albuterol aerosol). In addition to the above criteria, patients should have wellcontrolled asthma as evidenced by ACQ score &lt; 1.5. Primary sleep pathology, other than insomnia as assessed by sleep history and confirmed by polysomnography to exclude significant sleep apnea (RDI &gt; 15), periodic leg movements (movement arousal index &gt; 15), REM behavior disorder; or circadian sleepwake disorders History of cognitive or other neurological disorders; History of DSMIV criteria for any major psychiatric disorder, including mania or alcohol or substance abuse; Depressive symptoms as assessed by the CESD.
