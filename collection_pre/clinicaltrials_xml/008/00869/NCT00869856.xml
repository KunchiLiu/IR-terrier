	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, single-arm, baseline-controlled, multicenter efficacy and safety switch study involving 500 CKD subjects suffering from anemia and treated previously with a stable dose of ESA s.c. Correction of anemia will be maintained by s.c. administration of HX575 in two frequencies (i.e. qw and q2w), in order to maintain an Hb target range of 10.0-12.0 g/dL.</brief_summary>
