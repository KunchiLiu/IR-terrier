	<brief_summary>The role of gut hormone (GLP-1, GIP, PYY...) in glucose homeostasis has been widely demonstrated. Furthermore modifications in their pattern of secretion seem to be involved in the improvement of glucose control in obese patients after bariatric surgery. The purpose of this study is to assess the respective role of carbohydrate, fat and protein from a complete meal in gut hormones secretion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gut Hormone Secretion and Macronutrients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is designed to asses the role of each individual macronutrient of a compete meal in gut hormones secretion in healthy volunteers. 8 healthy young male subjects will be studied on 5 different occasions. To asses the role of each macronutient the subjects will recieve one of the following test meal: a complete sandwich, the proteic part of this complete meal, the glucidic part and the lipidic part. The fifth test will be a fasting test. To assess the entero-insular axis, a 5.5 hours hyperglycaemic clamp will be performed.</detailed_description>
