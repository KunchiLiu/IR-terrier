	<brief_summary>In patients with unresectable perihilar cholangiocarcinoma, photodynamic therapy with biliary stent has been known for palliation of jaundice and improving survival. But most of therapeutic effects were expected to delay bile duct obstruction rather than to decrease the tumor. Recently orally available chemotherapeutic agent, S-1 was reported as effective in patients with bile duct adenocarcinoma. The investigators' aims of study evaluate the combined effect of photodynamic therapy and S-1.</brief_summary>
