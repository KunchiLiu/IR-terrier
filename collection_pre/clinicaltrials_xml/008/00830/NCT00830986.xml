	<brief_summary>A significant number of patients experience postoperative cognitive changes following total joint arthroplasty. Among other causes, the mental status change may be the result of fat and bone marrow debris embolization. We hypothesized that the use of computer assisted total knee arthroplasty, which does not utilize intramedullary alignment rods, would produce less fat and bone marrow debris embolization and, hence, fewer mental status changes.</brief_summary>
