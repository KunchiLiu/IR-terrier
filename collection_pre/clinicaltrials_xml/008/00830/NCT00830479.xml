	<brief_summary>This study seeks to compare outcomes after anti-reflux surgery (ARS) for correction of low-grade vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). It is a randomized controlled open-label trial of conventional open anti-reflux technique versus endoscopic anti-reflux technique with injection of dextranomer/hyaluronic acid copolymer (Deflux). Primary endpoint will be resolution of VUR at initial cystogram after ARS. Secondary outcomes will include incidence of postoperative UTI, resolution of VUR at 1-year cystogram after ARS, surgical complications, and quality of life measures after ARS.</brief_summary>
