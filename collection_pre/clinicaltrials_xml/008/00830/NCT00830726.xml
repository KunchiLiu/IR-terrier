	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine whether the excretion of renal water- and salt-channels in the urine reflects the handling of water and salt in the kidneys, and whether the excretion can be used to monitor and/or predict the effects of treatment of certain heart or lung diseases.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of the study is to determine whether the excretion of renal water- and salt-channels (Aquaporin-2 and Epithelial Sodium Channels) in the urine accurately reflects the handling of water and salt in the distal tubules af the kidneys, and whether quantification of these channels in the urine is useful to monitor and/or predict the effects of pharmacologic or surgical treatment of Heart Failure and heart failure-related diseases (Aortic stenosis, acute and chronic ischemic heart disease or pulmonary hypertension)</detailed_description>
