	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Gathering medical information and collecting and storing samples of blood and tissue to test in the laboratory may help doctors develop better ways to screen people at risk for pancreatic cancer or other pancreatic disorders in the future. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is collecting medical information and tissue samples from patients with pancreatic cancer or other pancreatic disorders.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collecting Medical Information and Tissue Samples From Patients With Pancreatic Cancer or Other Pancreatic Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To collect clinical data and family histories and blood and/or tissue samples from patients diagnosed with pancreatic diseases, including pancreatic cancer, for use in future studies. - To collect information regarding food preparation and intake in these patients. Secondary - To make available to researchers medical data and biospecimens to enable them to develop better ways to screen people at risk for pancreatic conditions, including pancreatic cancer. - To investigate genes or substances that increase susceptibility of developing pancreatic conditions. - To find agents that may help prevent, treat, or cure these conditions. - To learn whether inherited factors increase the risk of pancreatic diseases, pancreatic cancer, or other cancers. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients complete two 1-hour surveys assessing health, clinical and family history of pancreatic conditions including cancer, and food preparation and intake. Patients also complete a 15- to 30-minute follow up survey at 6 months and 1 year to assess health, health practices, and family history. A review of the patient's medical information is obtained from the medical record. Blood samples are collected for future research studies. Oral cells and stool samples may also be collected for future studies.</detailed_description>
