	<brief_summary>This study is being conducted to learn more about the role of diet and exercise in regulating plasma triglyceride (fat) metabolism. The investigators will examine the effect of acute (24 hour) changes in energy intake and expenditure on fat metabolism the following day.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fat Metabolism in Response to Acute Diet- and Exercise-induced Changes in Energy Balance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Excess body fat and a sedentary lifestyle are associated with increased plasma triglyceride (TG) and apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) concentrations, which are important risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease. Weight loss and endurance exercise improve plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations. However, the mechanisms responsible for this effect are largely unknown, and much uncertainty remains regarding the independent roles of dietary energy intake, exercise energy expenditure, and net energy balance in controlling plasma TG concentrations. The main goal of this project, therefore, is to investigate the mechanisms by which acute alterations in energy balance, induced by diet and/or physical activity (endurance exercise), regulate very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL) metabolism. Subjects will be asked to perform 3 separate trials. One of these will always be an "energy balance" trial that will act as the control trial for the other 2 trials they perform. Subjects will therefore be randomized to 2 different study arms.</detailed_description>
