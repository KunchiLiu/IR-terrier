	<brief_title>Effect of Cyclic Loading (Vibration) on Orthodontic Tooth Movement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, blinded study that will follow 32 patients for up to six months. Patients will have a minimum of 3 mm of extraction space that needs to be closed by moving the anterior teeth or canine distally. Patients will have standard orthodontic treatment and temporary anchorage devices for tooth movement and space closure. Half the patients will receive a functioning device and half the patients will receive a sham-device. Patients will use the device for 20 minutes daily; the device has a mouthpiece for the patient to lightly bite into plus a connected enclosure that stays outside the mouth. The enclosure provides a light vibration.</detailed_description>
