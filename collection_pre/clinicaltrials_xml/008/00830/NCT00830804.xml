	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of an antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen consisting of raltegravir (RAL) and darunavir (DRV)/ritonavir (RTV) as first-line therapy in treatment-na√Øve participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Effectiveness of Raltegravir Plus Darunavir/Ritonavir in Treatment-Naive HIV-Infected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite the remarkable strides made in the treatment of HIV-1-infected persons over the last decade, current first-line ART regimens are imperfect. The ideal combination, unlike some current first-line options, would have uncompromised efficacy in the presence of transmitted drug-resistant variants. The primary purpose of this study is to estimate the cumulative proportion of ART-naive participants experiencing virologic failure at or prior to week 24 after initiating raltegravir (RAL) plus darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/RTV). The study will last 52 weeks. All participants will follow the same treatment schedule and take RAL plus DRV/RTV orally daily for the duration of the trial. After entry, all participants will have scheduled visits at weeks 1, 4, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 52. Medical/medication history, blood and urine collection, and liver function tests will occur at screening. A targeted physical exam and concomitant medications history will occur at all study visits. Blood and urine collection and liver function tests will occur at most study visits. For females, a pregnancy test will occur at screening and study entry. RAL and DRV were provided by the study. RTV was not provided by the study.</detailed_description>
