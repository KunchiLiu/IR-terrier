	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for the management of painful diabetic neuropathy. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions: CBT plus standard medical care or standard medical care alone. CBT will be offered in ten, ninety-minute group sessions and will be provided by a psychologist with experience in the management of both diabetes and chronic pain. CBT will involve teaching and encouraging practice of adaptive pain coping skills such as relaxation skills, activity pacing, and positive self-statements, among others. This study will allow us to determine which treatment is superior in terms of improvements in pain management, functioning and overall quality of life.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research Design: A randomized mixed factorial controlled design will be employed in which CBT plus standard pharmaceutical care (CBT/SC) is compared to a standard pharmaceutical care (SC) treatment condition. Participants will be randomized in equal numbers to the two conditions. Repeated assessments of key outcome domains will occur at pretreatment/baseline and at 12, 24 and 36 weeks following baseline. Methodology: Study participants will be evaluated pre-treatment (baseline), 12 weeks post-baseline (post-treatment) and at 24 and 36 weeks post-baseline (follow-up). Baseline assessment will include a neurological examination with a nerve conduction study to confirm the diagnosis of diabetic neuropathy. The primary outcome measure will be pain intensity. Secondary outcome measures will be pain quality, pain-related disability, physical and emotional functioning. Measures of treatment feasibility will also be examined. Participants receiving CBT will attend 10 weekly, group treatment sessions of 90 minutes. A target sample size of approximately 120 participants will be recruited.</detailed_description>
