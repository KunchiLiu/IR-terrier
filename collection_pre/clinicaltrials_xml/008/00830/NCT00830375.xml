	<brief_title>Memantine Treatment of Compulsive Buying</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the efficacy of memantine in the treatment of compulsive buying. Sixteen subjects meeting criteria for compulsive buying will receive 8 weeks of open-label memantine. The hypothesis to be tested is that memantine will be effective and well tolerated in patients with compulsive buying. The proposed study will provide needed data on the treatment of a disabling disorder that currently lacks a clearly effective treatment.</detailed_description>
