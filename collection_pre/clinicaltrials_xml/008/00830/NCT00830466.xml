	<brief_summary>The researchers want to collect data on safety and efficacy of combined pulsed dye laser and rapamycin to improve fading/blanching of port wine stain birthmarks as compared to pulsed dye laser alone, which is the current standard of care. This single center pilot and feasibility study will have a target enrollment of 40 port wine stain subjects at the Beckman Laser Institute and Medical Clinic, University of California, Irvine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial to Study Combined Pulsed Dye Laser and Rapamycin Treatment of Port Wine Stain Birthmarks.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will offer two different approaches to the treatment of port wine stain birthmarks. Study Group Number 1: Port wine stain treated by the pulsed dye laser alone, which is the current standard of care: 20 subjects. Study Group Number 2: Port wine stain treated by combined pulsed dye laser and rapamycin: 20 subjects. The researchers want to collect data on safety and efficacy of combined pulsed dye laser and rapamycin to improve fading/blanching of port wine stain birthmarks as compared to pulsed dye laser alone, which is the current standard of care. Twenty subjects will have their entire port wine stain birthmark treated by pulsed dye laser alone. Twenty subjects will have their entire port wine stain birthmark treated by combined pulsed dye laser and rapamycin, which is a drug that prevents the formation of blood vessels in the skin. Safety will be evaluated by searching for any local effects such as injury to the skin or systemic effects such as abnormal blood and/or urine studies. Efficacy will be determined by objectively measuring and comparing the port wine stain fading/blanching responses for the two study groups.</detailed_description>
