	<brief_summary>In vitiligo, the melanocytes are lost from the skin in certain areas. One treatment for vitiligo takes the melanocytes from areas of normal skin and places them on areas of that same person's body which have lost their color. This is called the melanocyte-keratinocyte transplantation procedure (MKTP). This procedure has been used successfully in over 3000 cases in India and Saudi Arabia. The purpose of this study is to see if it is effective when performed at the investigators' institution.</brief_summary>
