	<brief_summary>Probands with MCI are at high risk to develop Alzheimer´s dementia (AD). Simvastatin may lower the production of Amyloid, a hallmark of AD in the brain. The primary hypothesis of the study is that 60 mg Simvastatin significantly reduces the Clinical Dementia Rating -Sum of boxes (CDR-SOB) in individuals with MCI as compared to MCI receiving placebo or 20 mg Simvastatin</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Simvastatin in Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a national multicenter, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial allowing for a minimum follow-up time of 24 months in conversion-free patients. Randomization will be stratified by prior use of statins. The two strata are: 1. "no-statins": patients without treatment with a statins and no indication for treatment (according to the guidelines of the German Society of Cardiology for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease); patients will be randomly assigned to one of 2 treatment (1) Simvastatin (60 mg) one tablet/day (2) Placebo one tablet/day. 2. "low-statins": patients treated with low doses of Statins; patients will be randomly assigned to one of 2 treatment (1) Simvastatin (60 mg) one tablet/day (2) 20 mg Simvastatin one tablet/day.</detailed_description>

No participation in other clinical trials 2 months before and after participation in this study 12. Probands should only recruited for the clinical trial, when they are able to perform the informed consent; due to worsening of "memory function" in the course of the clinical trial, probands should not longer participate the clinical trial, when they is evidence, that participants were not longer able to give full informed consent. 1. Hypersensitivity against Simvastatin, active liver disease or lasting increase of serum transaminases for unclear reason 2. Unstable medical, neurological or psychiatric disease 3. Lack of a spouse or a close relative 4. Use of a registered antidementia drug or a nootropic 5. Chronic use of antiinflammatory drugs 6. History of stroke or myocardial infarction 7. LDLcholesterol 130160 mg/dl and &gt; 3 risk factors or 160190 mg/dl and &gt; 2 risk factors including age. 8. LDLcholesterol &gt;190 mg/dl 9.

Comedication of other statins in high doses; low doses equivalent to 20 mg Simvastatin are allowed if taken for max. 2 years before randomization</criteria>
