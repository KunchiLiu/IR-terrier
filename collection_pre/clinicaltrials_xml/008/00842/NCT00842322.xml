	<brief_summary>Patients with renal impairment are usually advised to increase their fluid intake. There is currently, however, no evidence supporting this recommendation. In contrast,high fluid intake could be dangerous if urine excretion is reduced. In this study the researchers investigate whether increasing fluid intake from 2 to 4 litres per day has any influence on long-term renal outcome.</brief_summary>
