	<brief_summary>The aim is to document viral etiologies of isolated fevers and inlfuenza-like syndromes during summertime in South of France in order to better understand the role of known vector-borne viruses such as Toscana virus, West Nile virus during seasonal activity of the arthropod vector. In each of the four cities, a network of general practitioners will be associated in the project to recruit patients who are not hospitalized. The combined involvement of infectious disease specialists and general practitioner will augment the range of patients (mild disease and sever cases) in the study.</brief_summary>
