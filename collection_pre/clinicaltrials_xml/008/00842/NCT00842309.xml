	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to conduct a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of D-cycloserine (DCS) augmentation of behavior therapy in individuals with Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD). Specifically, we intend to randomize 50 individuals with BDD to receive either DCS (n = 25) or placebo (n = 25) one hour prior to 8 of 10 behavior therapy sessions.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This treatment study also provides us with the opportunity to further explore the molecular genetics of BDD, as well as the genetic predictors of response to an extinction-based treatment. We will take a hypothesis-driven approach by focusing on genes and systems previously shown to mediate fear acquisition and NMDA-dependent extinction learning including NMDA-related glutamatergic loci (GRIN1, GRIN2A, GRIN2B, DAAO, DAOA) and three other genes strongly implicated in fear extinction (BDNF, NTRK2, CNR1). Other loci of interest in the molecular genetics of BDD include: the serotonin transporter gene, dopamine, GABA-A, and cytochrome P450 genes.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>18 years of age or older Primary diagnosis of Body Dysmorphic Disorder as determined by DSMIV criteria BDD YaleBrown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score greater than or equal to 24 Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urinary betaHCG test Subjects currently taking psychotropic medication must be on a stable does for at least two months prior to initiating study procedures Pregnant or breastfeeding women will be excluded People taking medications that may interfere with DCS History of seizure disorder or other serious medical illnesses such as cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, respiratory, endocrine, neurologic or hematologic disease Comorbid psychiatric diagnoses (alcohol dependence, bipolar disorder, psychosis, borderline personality disorder, organic mental disorder, or development disorder). If subjects have any other comorbid disorder, the BDD symptoms have to be the primary concern. Persons taking medications that may lower seizure threshold, including clozapine, pethidine, and the following antibiotics in high dosage: penicillins, cephalosporins, amphotericin, and imipenem Those deemed to pose a serious suicidal or homicidal threat will be excluded Current psychotherapy or failure to benefit from ten or more sessions of previous ERP treatment is a ruleout</criteria>
