	<brief_summary>This retrospective nested non-matched case control study compared patients directly admitted to the General Medicine Wards, not transferred from ICU with - hyperglycemia on admission but no previous diagnosis of diabetes - diabetic hyperglycemic patients - non hyperglycemic non diabetic patients from the same nested population. The investigators' hypothesis is that the clinical characteristics and endpoints of the non diabetic hyperglycemics should be similar to the diabetic population and different from the non diabetic non hyperglycemic population.</brief_summary>
