	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to learn whether panitumumab helps treat colorectal cancer in participants who have not responded to treatment with cetuximab. Panitumumab is a human monoclonal antibody. Antibodies are proteins that recognize a foreign substance in the body and then attach themselves to it making it exposed to destruction. Panitumumab attaches itself to a protein on cancer cells called "epidermal growth factor receptor" or EGFR. EGFR helps cancer cells to grow, and blocking EGFR helps prevent cancer cells from growing.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Panitumumab will be given to the participants through a central line. A central line is a long, thin tube (catheter) that is inserted through the skin into a large vein in the chest. This is placed by a radiologist or surgeon. - Panitumumab will be given in 4-week cycles. Panitumumab infusions will be given on days 1 and 15 of each cycle (every 2 weeks). - The following procedures will be performed on days 1 and 15 of each cycle, before each infusion: physical exam; questions about any symptoms or side effects; performance status; routine blood tests and CT or MRI (every 2 cycles). - Participants can continue to receive panitumumab until their disease gets worse or they experience unacceptable side effects.</detailed_description>
