	<brief_title>Study of Endostar With Cisplatin and Capecitabine as 1st Line Treatment in the Advanced Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endostar, a recombinant human endostatin, has shown its antitumor ability in combination in NSCLC and breast cancer. But to gastric cancer, few clinical data has been reported. However, bevacizumab, an angiogenesis inhibitor was shown effective in combination with chemotherapy in advanced gastric cancer in some phase II study. So in this study, we want to explore whether endostar is also effective and safe in advanced gastric cancer. Response predictive factor is expected to be identified.</detailed_description>
