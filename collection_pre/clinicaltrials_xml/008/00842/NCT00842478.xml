	<brief_summary>Poor oral hygiene is associated with respiratory pathogen colonization and secondary lung infection.The possible association between oral care and incidence of VAP, and the role of dental plaque, mouth and tracheal colonization have not been firmly established. The investigators' hypothesis was that improving oral care with electrical toothbrushing might be effective in reducing the incidence of VAP.</brief_summary>
