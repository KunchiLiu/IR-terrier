	<brief_summary>Our study aims to evaluate if the consumption of a Fruit and Vegetable Juice Concentrate (FVJC) vs. placebo can exert changes in the serum levels of Retinol Binding Protein 4 (RBP4), carotenoids, tocopherol, antioxidant capacity, pro-inflammatory markers, insulin sensitivity in conjunction with weight management in a cohort of lean as compared to overweight healthy six to ten year-old boys. The boys will undergo a detailed medical and family history and a complete physical examination during the screening visit. Careful anthropometric measures and body composition by DEXA will be performed. Nutritional and exercise counseling will be given at the start of the study. The outcome measures will include differences in serum RBP4, antioxidant levels, inflammatory markers and insulin sensitivity at baseline and six months after consumption of FVJC in a randomized double blind placebo control manner.</brief_summary>
