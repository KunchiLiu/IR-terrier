	<brief_title>Groin Complications Post Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Using Either Manual Compression or PERCLOSE Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is commonly accepted that that there exists a learning curve in performing successful groin closure with Vascular Closure Devices (VCD). Manual compression continues to be 'standard of care' at most institutions for closure of 5 - 8 French femoral arteriotomies, as previous studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of vascular closure devices have failed to show a statistically significant decrease in groin complication rates when compared to manual compression. Importantly, no studies to date have been performed to specifically assess the potential decrease in vascular complication rates by highly experienced VCD operators, when their safety results are compared to manual compression. This retrospective, multi-center study will demonstrate a lower vascular complication rate in PCI patients post deployment of a 6 Fr Perclose VCD by a single, experienced operator, when compared to manual compression in two comparable, high volume, hospital cardiac catheterization laboratories.</detailed_description>
