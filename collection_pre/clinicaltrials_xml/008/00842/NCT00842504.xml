	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the pharmacokinetics of micafungin when it is given on an every other day schedule. The study will determine if every other day micafungin will provide drug exposure equivalent to daily dosing while reducing administration costs and improving patient convenience. Fifteen patients will be enrolled on this study. Blood samples for PK measurements will be obtained for 48 hours following a single dose of micafungin (3 mg/kg).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alternate Day Micafungin: A PK Study in Pediatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Disseminated fungal infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised children. Many of the drugs used for fungal prophylaxis have been associated with kidney and liver toxicity. Also, breakthrough infections have been reported with the use of some of the oral agents due to poor oral absorption. An alternative approach is the use of intravenous micafungin for fungal prophylaxis. Micafungin has a distinct advantage due to its better safety profile, specifically in terms of liver and kidney toxicity. Currently, children who receive micafungin are given daily dosing. This study will examine the pharmacokinetics of micafungin when it is given on an every other day schedule. It will examine whether every other day micafungin will provide drug exposure equivalent to daily dosing while reducing administration costs and improving patient convenience. Both animal and adult human data support the use of this approach. Fifteen patients will be enrolled on this study and will be given a single dose of micafungin (3 mg/kg). Blood samples will be drawn for pharmacokinetic measurements after administration of micafungin.</detailed_description>
