	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this extension study was to assess the long term safety of patients with nonfunctioning enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumour (NET), who were treated with open label lanreotide Autogel (120 mg every 28 days) and who participated in a previous study, 2-55-52030-726 (NCT00353496).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Lanreotide Autogel 120 mg in Patients With Non-functioning Entero- Pancreatic Endocrine Tumour</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While somatostatin analogue treatment is the primary medical therapy for patients with hormone related symptoms and is indicated for the treatment of hormone related symptoms in many international countries, there is no reference standard medical therapy for asymptomatic patients. A 96-week study (Study 2-55-52030-726 (726), NCT00353496) was conducted to investigate the effect of lanreotide Autogel on progression free survival (PFS) in patients with well or moderately differentiated nonfunctioning enteropancreatic NET. While Study 726 was ongoing, the sponsor considered that therapy with lanreotide Autogel should continue to be an option to patients with stable disease at the end of the 96-week treatment period. This extension study was therefore initiated (Study 2-55-52030-729 (729)) which investigated the long term safety of treatment with lanreotide Autogel and enabled investigators to continue to treat their patients who had stable disease, as well as to treat placebo patients who experienced disease progression during the initial 96-week study (Study 726).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Had provided written informed consent prior to any studyrelated procedures. 2. Had been enrolled and treated in Study 25552030726 and either: Was stable at 96 weeks of treatment (whatever the treatment received during the 2 years of participation, i.e. no code break at Week 96); or, Had received at least one injection in Study 25552030726 and had disease progression, confirmed by central assessment, during the course of the study and code break showed placebo. 3. Had a World Health Organisation (WHO) performance score lower than or equal to 2. 1. Had been enrolled and treated in the frame of the protocol and had disease progression during the study and the code break showed a treatment with lanreotide Autogel 120 mg. 2. Had received any new treatment for the enteropancreatic NET since the end of participation in the study. 3. Were likely to require any additional concomitant treatment to lanreotide Autogel 120 mg for the enteropancreatic NET. 4. Had been treated with radionuclide at any time prior to study entry. 5. Had a history of hypersensitivity to drugs with a similar chemical structure to lanreotide Autogel 120 mg. 6. Were likely to require treatment during the study with drugs that were not permitted by the study protocol. 7. Were at risk of pregnancy or lactation. Females of childbearing potential had to provide a negative pregnancy test at the start of study and had to be using oral, double barrier or injectable contraception. Nonchildbearing potential was defined as postmenopause for at least 1 year, or surgical sterilisation or hysterectomy at least 3 months before the start of the study. 8. Had any mental condition rendering the patient unable to understand the nature, scope and possible consequences of the study, and/or evidence of an uncooperative attitude. 9. Had abnormal findings at Visit 1, any other medical condition(s) or laboratory findings that, in the opinion of the investigator, might have jeopardised the patient's safety or decreased the chance of obtaining satisfactory data needed to achieve the objective(s) of the study. 10. Previous enrolment in this study.</criteria>
