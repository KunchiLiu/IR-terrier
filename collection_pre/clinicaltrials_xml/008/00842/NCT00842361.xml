	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Japan. The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the safety (with emphasis on hypoglycaemia) after switching from long-acting insulin analogue/intermediate-acting insulin or pre-mixed insulin/pre-mixed insulin analogue on a twice daily regimen to NN5401 (SIAC, insulin degludec/insulin aspart) on a twice daily regimen in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</brief_summary>
