	<criteria>Healthy as determined by a responsible physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring.

This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until 84 days after the dose of study medication.

Available to complete the study (minimum of 6 and a maximum of 11 nights confinement in the clinical research unit). A history of regular bowel movements (averaging one or more bowel movements per day). AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin ≤ 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%). A single repeat is allowed for eligibility determination. The subject has a positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen. A minimum list of drugs that will be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates, cannabinoids and benzodiazepines. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current study: 30 days, 5 halflives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer). History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof, or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs, including antacids, vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety. If heparin is used during PK sampling, subjects with a history of sensitivity to heparin or heparininduced thrombocytopenia should not be enrolled. History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as an average weekly intake of &gt;14 drinks/week. One drink is equivalent to (12 g alcohol) = 5 ounces (150 ml) of wine or 12 ounces (360 ml) of beer or 1.5 ounces (45 ml) of 80 proof distilled spirits. Has a history or regular use of tobacco or nicotinecontaining products within 3 months prior to screening. Consumption of red wine, seville oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit juice from 7 days prior to the first dose of study medication. Subjects who have received a total body radiation dose of greater than 5.0 mSv (upper limit of WHO category II) or exposure to significant radiation (e.g. serial xray or CT scans, barium meal etc) in the 12 months prior to this study. Any condition that could interfere with the accurate assessment and recovery of radiocarbon [14C]. Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol. Subjects with a preexisting condition interfering with normal gastrointestinal anatomy or motility, hepatic and/or renal function, that could interfere with the absorption, metabolism, and/or excretion of the study drugs. Subjects with a history of cholecystectomy should be excluded. A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 months of screening. A positive test for HIV antibody. Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period. The subject's systolic blood pressure is outside the range of 90140mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure is outside the range of 4590mmHg or heart rate is outside the range of 45100 bpm. A single repeat is allowed to determine eligibility ECG within protocol criteria</criteria>
