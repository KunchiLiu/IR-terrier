	<brief_summary>This study is a prospective, randomized controlled, single blind, two-arm, multi center clinical evaluation. A total of 1500 patients will be enrolled in the study. Patient randomization will be to one of the two treatment arms: Everolimus arm or Non drug eluting stent arm. The objective of this study is to assess the safety and performance of the Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System versus a modified cobalt chromium balloon expandable stent in the setting of primary percutaneous coronary intervention for treatment of patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Evaluation of Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stents in the Treatment of Patients With ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction: EXAMINATION Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary PCI, with or without stenting, has been shown to result in superior long-term outcome when compared to thrombolytic therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI). Recently, several studies showed that both sirolimus- and paclitaxel-eluting stents are more effective in reducing restenosis and the frequency of repeat interventions than bare metal stents, which rapidly resulted in an unrestricted use of drug-eluting stents, also in patients with ST segment elevation MI (STEMI). , , , Shortly after the introduction of the sirolimus-eluting stent in April 2002 the first studies appeared, hypothesizing that the therapeutic range of sirolimus-eluting stents could be extended to patients presenting with MI. When compared to bare metal stents, sirolimus-eluting stents were associated with less restenosis and target vessel revascularization (TVR) up until one year of follow-up. , At present, it is unclear whether this also holds for paclitaxel-eluting stents.4, Everolimus is a sirolimus analogue, an effective anti-proliferative agent that inhibits growth factor-stimulated cell proliferation by causing cell cycle arrest in the late G1 stage in the cell cycle. The objective of this study is to assess the safety and performance of the Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System versus a modified cobalt chromium balloon expandable stent in the setting of primary percutaneous coronary intervention for treatment of patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. This study is a prospective, randomized controlled, single blind, two-arm, multi center clinical evaluation. A total of 1500 patients will be enrolled in the study. The primary endpoint is the combined endpoint of Composite endpoint of all-cause death, any myocardial infarction and any revascularization at 1 year (patient oriented endpoint suggested by the ARC definitions). The following secondary endpoints will be examined: - All cause and cardiac mortality at 1 year and yearly up to 5 years. - Recurrent myocardial infarction at 1 year and yearly up to 5 years. - Target lesion revascularization at 1 year and yearly up to 5 years. - Target vessel revascularization at 1 year and yearly up to 5 years. - Stent thrombosis (according to the new definitions proposed by the Academic Research Consortium) at 1 year and yearly up to 5 years. - Clinical device success - Clinical procedure success. - Major and minor bleeding at 1 year and yearly up to 5 years.</detailed_description>
