	<brief_summary>Previous studies have analyzed serological responses following pneumococcal vaccination using 23-valent vaccination (Pneumovax) in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients that were on different therapeutic modalities including TNF-blockers and methotrexate. The results have shown that serological response was significantly reduced in RA patients receiving methotrexate compared to those receiving TNF-blockers. In contrast when using polypeptide immunisation (influenza vaccine) we found that anti-TNF significantly impaired the serological response compared to the methotrexate treated RA patients. The aim of this study is to analyze serological responses after Prevenar vaccination in patients with chronic arthritis and to study the impact of different treatment modalities on serological responses. It will be of interest to see if the result is different compared to the one seen after immunizing with 23-valent nonconjugated pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Different Anti-rheumatic Treatments of Arthritis on Antibody Response Following Pneumococcal Vaccination Using PrevenarÂ®</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Previous studies have analyzed serological responses following pneumococcal vaccination using 23-valent vaccination (Pneumovax) in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients that were on different therapeutic modalities including TNF-blockers and methotrexate. The results have shown that serological response was significantly reduced in RA patients receiving methotrexate compared to those receiving TNF-blockers (Rheumatology (Oxford) 2006 Jan; 45(1):106-11). In contrast when using polypeptide immunisation (influenza vaccine) we found that anti-TNF significantly impaired the serological response compared to the methotrexate treated RA patients. The aim of this study is to analyze serological responses after PREVENAR vaccination in patients with RA or spondylarthropathy and to study the impact of different treatment modalities on serological responses. It will be of interest to see if the result is different compared to the one seen after immunizing with 23-valent nonconjugated pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. Study design: Unblinded study in RA patients and patients with spondylarthropathies. All subjects will be vaccinated once with Prevenar and the serological response will be followed by blood draws. Patient Population to be Included: RA patients on methotrexate and/or other DMARDS RA patients on anti-TNF drugs as monotherapy RA patients on anti-TNF +MTX and/or other DMARDSs Spondylarthropathy patients on anti-TNF drugs as monotherapy Spondylarthropathy patients on anti-TNF drugs +MTX Spondylarthropathy patients on NSAIDs (There is a possibility to stratify for steroid use). Primary and Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: Serological responses to at least 2 pneumococcal serotypes included in Prevenar vaccine between different treatment groups. An ethical approval from the Ethical Review Board at Lund University is mandatory for this study as well as an approval from the Swedish MPA.</detailed_description>
