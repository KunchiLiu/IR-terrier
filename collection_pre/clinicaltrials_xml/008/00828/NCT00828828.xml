	<brief_title>Antibody Response to Influenza Vaccine in Patients With Sarcoidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease with unclear etiology characterized by the presence of noncaseating granuloma[1]. T helper cells response is exaggerated at the site of disease and cellular immunity depressed in peripheral blood[2]. Cutaneous anergy, lymphopenia and inversion of CD4/CD8 ratio in peripheral blood suggest T helper cells involvement[3]. The action of humeral immune system in sarcoidosis is a matter of controversy. Standard hepatitis B virus vaccination did not provoke protective antibody titer in patients with sarcoidosis[3]. Although antibody response against influenza vaccine in patients with sarcoidosis is not well described, this vaccine is highly recommended in patients with chronic pulmonary diseases such as asthma, COPD and fibrosis [4, 5, 6]. In this study we aim to evaluate the humeral response to the influenza vaccine in sarcoidosis patients and assess vaccine safety.</detailed_description>
