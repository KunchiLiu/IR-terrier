	<brief_title>Evaluate the Safe and Effective Use of the Avonex® Single-Use Autoinjector in Multiple Sclerosis Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Main Study was a 4-week treatment period which consisted of 1 Avonex manual injection using a prefilled syringe, followed by 3 Avonex injections using the single-use autoinjector. The Extension Study was designed to provide continuation of treatment with the Avonex single-use autoinjector to eligible participants who completed the Main Study for up to an additional 12 weeks, and to obtain additional safety and preference data for the Avonex single-use autoinjector. Participants were enrolled under the initial study protocol (Initial Subject Subset); the study was subsequently suspended. Changes were made to the protocol (including modifications to the autoinjector needle), and additional participants were enrolled (Main Subject Subset).</detailed_description>
