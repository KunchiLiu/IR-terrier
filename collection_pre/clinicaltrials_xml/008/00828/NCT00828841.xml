	<brief_summary>This study is testing the investigational drug, cetuximab, in combination with different chemotherapy drugs for lung cancer. The aim of the study is to determine which of the drug combinations looks most promising and should be tested further. The study will also look at what side effects may occur.</brief_summary>
