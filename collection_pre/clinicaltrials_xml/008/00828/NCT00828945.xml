	<brief_summary>It is a prospective observational study. Patients will be high risk patients (for developing cardiovascular events) that are treated with a statin. Patients will be enrolled at a normal clinic visit and provided with a small box containing info about the disease, a LDL self-test and two questionnaires. They will test themselves for LDL at home between normal clinic visits (normally 12 months interval) and note their value. In the end of the study all patients will fill out a questionnaire with questions if the tests and info have raised their awareness of the disease as well if their motivation to be compliant has increased. We want to look at the possibility to put more responsibility for treatment and for reaching treatment goals on the patients since there's a big problem with compliance in this group of patients.</brief_summary>
