	<brief_summary>This comparison study is performed to show equivalence of CEUS with CECT or CEMR to diagnose noninvasively focal liver masses. This is a multi-center prospective cohort study of 250 subjects, which will be performed at four institutions in Canada. Subjects with a focal liver mass, measuring at least 2.5 centimeters in maximal diameter, will undergo a conventional baseline sonogram followed by a contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). CEUS will be performed on standard ultrasound scanners with contrast specific imaging capability. The contrast agent used is Definity (Lantheus Medical Imaging, Billerica,MA) All subjects will have either a dedicated hepatic contrast enhanced CT or MR scan within 60 days of the CEUS as per the standard of care in the institution. Anonymized image files from all imaging will be shown independently to two readers, blinded to all clinical and demographic data, who will predict malignancy and diagnosis.</brief_summary>
