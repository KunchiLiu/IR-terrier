	<brief_title>Efficacy of Fish Oil in Lupus Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with SLE have a fifty-fold increased risk of myocardial infarction. This risk is not totally explained by traditional cardiovascular risk factors. In a previous double-blind study of atorvastatin in SLE, there was no reduction in surrogate measures of coronary artery disease (coronary calcium, coronary IMT, carotid plaque) and no effect on inflammatory markers such as ICAM, VCAM, IL-6 and CRP. We need to find novel approaches to reduce coronary artery disease in SLE. In a preliminary study, omega-3 was shown to improve flow mediated dilation of the brachial artery, oxidative stress and disease activity in lupus patients. In this study we will determine if omega-3 improves brachial artery flow dilation, disease activity and other vascular inflammatory markers (IL-6, s-VCAM-1, s-ICAM-1) in SLE, in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial.</detailed_description>
