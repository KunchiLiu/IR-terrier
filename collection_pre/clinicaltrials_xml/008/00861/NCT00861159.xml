	<brief_summary>It is the investigators aim to determine the feasibility of directly detecting anti-RLIP76 auto-antibodies in human serum using prepared RLIP76 antigen peptides in persons with rheumatologic disease and persons without rheumatologic diesease ("healthy subjects").</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RLIP76 in Human Serum in Adults With Rheumatologic Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an exploratory study conducted to see the feasibility of measuring the anti-RLIP76 antibody and to standardize the methods for its measurement. We will perform these studies on blood samples obtained from human subjects after informed concent for blood draw for research purposes is obtained by the Clinical Research Co-ordinator (CRC).</detailed_description>
