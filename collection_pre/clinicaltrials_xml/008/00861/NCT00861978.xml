	<detailed_description>The general picture of depression is still that of the traditionally called endogenous type, which is also the form that was characterized extensively in clinical trials. Atypical depression with reversed vegetative signs, such as hyperphagia or hypersomnia, is traditionalla neglected, demonstrated by the fact that in the most widely used depression scales, such as the Hamilton Depression Scale, melancholic symptoms have a specific weight, while, by contrast, reversed vegetative signs are not included. This etablishes a tendency to underestimate the severity of atypical depression.</detailed_description>
