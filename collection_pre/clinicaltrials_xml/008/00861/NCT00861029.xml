	<brief_summary>This is a Phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study to estimate the effects of daily oral dosing of 800 mg pazopanib on electrocardiographic parameters (QTc interval duration) as compared with placebo in subjects with solid tumors. Moxifloxacin, will serve as a positive control.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VEG111485: A QTc Study of Pazopanib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study designed to estimate the effects of repeated, once daily oral dosing of pazopanib on electrocardiographic parameters with a particular focus on its effect on cardiac repolarization (QTc interval duration) as compared with placebo in subjects with solid tumors. Moxifloxacin, a drug known to cause mild QTc interval prolongation, is included as a positive control to validate the ability of the study to detect a small prolongation in the QTc interval. Digital 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be extracted from continuous ECG recordings obtained via a Holter monitor. The effects of pazopanib and moxifloxacin on cardiac repolarization will be compared with placebo. This study will also assess the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship between plasma concentrations of pazopanib and its metabolites and their effects, if any, on cardiac repolarization, specifically on the QT interval.</detailed_description>

Serum potassium level &gt;4 mEq/L, magnesium level &gt;1.7 mg/dL and total serum calcium level within normal limits (if albumin is &lt;4.5 g/dL, albumincorrected total serum calcium level should be within normal limits [see Appendix 7]). NOTE: Supplementation is permitted in order to meet this criterion. Subject should be retested following supplementation. Subject is a woman of nonchildbearing potential or willing to use acceptable contraception. Subject is a man with a female partner of childbearing potential agrees to use contraception. Subject, if sexually active, agrees to continue the recommended contraception method for the duration of treatment and for 28 days following discontinuation of treatment. Capable of giving written informed consent. The subject is able to understand and comply with protocol requirements, instructions and protocolstated restrictions.

History of any one of the following cardiovascular conditions within the past 6 months: Class III or IV congestive heart failure as defined by the New York Heart Association (NYHA), cardiac angioplasty or stenting, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, symptomatic peripheral vascular disease or other clinically significant cardiac disease. For subjects with a history of myocardial infarction (&gt;6 months ago), congestive heart failure (&gt;6 months ago) or prior anthracycline exposure, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) must be assessed within 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug by one of the following methods: multiple gated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (ECHO). Subjects with a measurement of LVEF &lt;50% are excluded from participation in the study. Personal or family history of longQT syndrome. History or clinical evidence of CNS metastases or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, except for individuals who have previously treated CNS metastases, are asymptomatic, and have had no requirement for steroids or antiseizure medication for 2 months prior to beginning study treatment. Clinically significant gastrointestinal (GI) abnormalities that may affect the absorption of study drug including, but not limited to: malabsorption syndrome, major resection of the stomach or small bowel. Clinically significant GI abnormalities that may increase the risk for GI bleeding including, but not limited to: active peptic ulcer disease, known intraluminal metastatic lesion(s) with suspected bleeding, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis or other GI conditions with increased risk of perforation, history of abdominal fistula, GI perforation or intraabdominal abscess within 28 days prior to beginning study treatment. Presence of uncontrolled infection. Unable or unwilling to discontinue use of prohibited medications listed in Section 9.2 for at least 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug (see Section 9.2). Poorly controlled hypertension [systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt;140 mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &gt;90 mmHg]. History of cerebrovascular accident, pulmonary embolism or untreated deep venous thrombosis (DVT) within the past 6 months. Evidence of active bleeding or bleeding diathesis. Hemoptysis within 6 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. Known endobronchial lesion(s) or involvement of large pulmonary vessel(s) by tumor. History of sensitivity or allergic reaction to moxifloxacin or any member of the quinolone class of antimicrobial agents. Treatment with anticancer therapy (including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, investigational therapy, hormonal therapy, surgery or tumor embolization) within 14 days prior to the first dose of pazopanib. History or presence of hepatic or renal disease or any other condition known to interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs. Prior major surgery or trauma within the past 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug and/or presence of any nonhealing wound, fracture or ulcer. Any serious and/or unstable preexisting medical, psychiatric, or other conditions that could interfere with subject's safety, obtaining informed consent or compliance to the study.</criteria>
