The study objectives are: (1) to evaluate the impact of a brief CBT intervention aimed at decreasing emotional distress and improving quality of life; (2) to evaluate the sustainability of CBT therapeutic gains over time; (3) to conduct sub group analyses in order to better determine why some patients may improve post CBT, while others may not.</detailed_description>
