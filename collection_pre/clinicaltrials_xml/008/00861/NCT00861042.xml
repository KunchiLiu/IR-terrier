	<criteria>Subject has successfully completed a previous trial with SPM 927 in diabetic neuropathy and, in the investigator's opinion, would benefit from longterm administration of SPM 927. Subject has stable, good or fair diabetic control (HbA1c ≤10% ). Subject has other conditions that cause neuropathic pain at least as severe as the diabetic pain, i.e. peripheral arteriovascular disease. Subject receives treatment for seizures. Subject has had an amputation related to diabetes, other than toe amputation. Subject has major skin ulcers. Subject has clinically significant ECG abnormalities. Subject expects to take during the study: TCAs, mexiletine hydrochloride, lidoderm patch, tramadol, AEDs, dextromethorphan, opioids, capsaicin, skeletal muscle relaxants, benzodiazepines or overthecounter medications with centrally acting properties. Subject has laboratory values which are outside the normal range and judged by the investigator to be clinically significant. Subject has liver function tests (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, or GGT) ≥ 2x ULN at Visit 1. At Visit 1, subject has impaired renal function, i.e., creatinine clearance (ClCr) is lower than 60 mL/min.</criteria>
