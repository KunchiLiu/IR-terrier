	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to utilize high-resolution CMR carotid imaging for the characterization of carotid wall volumes and plaque content in patients with clinical significant carotid atherosclerosis. Patients who are scheduled to undergo an imaging procedure will be recruited from the cath lab. Upon enrollment, blood samples conventional and genetic profiling will be collected. For patients undergoing a carotid endarterectomy, tissue from the carotid vessel will be collected during their procedure. Comparison of the MR images with tissue and/or blood samples will be made. Length of time in the study will be approximately 1 day. There will be no study-related patient follow-up.</brief_summary>
