	<brief_summary>Endoscopy has become a vital part of the gastroenterologist's evaluation and treatment of disorders involving the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The small bowel is an area of the GI tract, which can prove difficult to visualize during an endoscopy specifically designed to evaluate it, termed enteroscopy. Thus, the FDA has approved overtubes, such as the Endo-Ease® spiral overtube (Spirus Medical, Inc.) or EnteroPro® balloon overtube (Olympus Medical, Inc.), to facilitate passage of the endoscope through the GI tract. The aims of the study are to evaluate the efficiency of an overtube system for visualization of small bowel. The hypothesis is that this will permit more complete and efficient evaluation of the small intestine.</brief_summary>
