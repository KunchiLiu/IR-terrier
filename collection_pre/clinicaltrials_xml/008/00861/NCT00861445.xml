	<criteria>Subject has clinically diagnosed pain attributed to diabetic distal sensory motor polyneuropathy for 15 years and a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (Type I or Type II). Subjects must have at least moderate pain (mean pain intensity ≥ 4 out of 10 during the baseline week on Likert scale). subjects must have good or fair diabetic control (Hgb A1c &lt; 10%) Subject has other conditions that cause neuropathic pain at least as severe as the diabetic pain i.e. peripheral arteriovascular disease. Subject receives treatment for seizures. Subject has had any amputations other than diabeticallyrelated toe amputations. Subject has major skin ulcers. Subject has clinically significant ECG abnormalities. Subject is expected to take within 7 days prior to randomization and during the study: TCAs, mexiletine hydrochloride, lidoderm patch, tramadol, AEDs, dextromethorphan, opioids, capsaicin, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, acetaminophen / paracetamol, skeletal muscle relaxants, benzodiazepines, alpha2agonists (e.g. clonidine), drugs indicated for sleep disturbance (e. g. zolpidem tartrate, zaleplon) and overthecounter medications with centrally acting properties. Subject has laboratory values which are outside the normal range and judged by the investigator to be clinically significant. At study entry, subject has liver function tests values (AST, ALT,alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin and GGT) 2 times upper limit of normal. subject has impaired renal function, i.e., creatinine clearance is lower than 60 mL/min.</criteria>
