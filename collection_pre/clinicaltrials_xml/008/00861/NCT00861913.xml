	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying the side effects of pazopanib hydrochloride and to see how well it works in treating patients with metastatic melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery. Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pazopanib Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma That Cannot be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the anti-tumor activity and safety profile of single agent Pazopanib (pazopanib hydrochloride). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the impact of Pazopanib on circulating levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). II. To examine the association between tumor response and B-Raf and N-Ras mutations. III. To examine pre/post-treatment expression levels of VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, and Ki67. IV. To correlate baseline and changes in p-ERK levels in the tumor with response. V. To determine pazopanib steady-state trough plasma concentrations (Css,min) and the relationships between Css,min and the PD effects and toxicities of pazopanib. VI. To examine the associations of common polymorphisms in CYP1A2, CYP2C8, UGT1A1, ABCB1, and ABCG2 with the PK and PD of pazopanib. VII. To Assess Progression Free Survival. VIII. To Assess Overall Survival. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral pazopanib hydrochloride once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo tumor tissue biopsy at baseline and blood sample collection at baseline and on days 14, 28, and 42 for research studies. Tumor tissue samples are analyzed by DNA sequencing, ELISA, western blotting, and immunoperoxidase staining. Blood samples are analyzed for pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacogenetics by high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.</detailed_description>
