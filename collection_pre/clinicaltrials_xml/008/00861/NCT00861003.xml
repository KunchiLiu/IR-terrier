	<brief_summary>This prospective study examines the differences among several measures of adherence to antipsychotic medications in outpatients with schizophrenia. Adherence is assessed by using self-report, physician report, pill count and electronic monitoring. The rates of adherence/non-adherence with various tools will be manifested. The association between antipsychotic adherence/non-adherence and various clinical status, including psychotic symptoms, depressive symptoms, side effects, neurocognitive function and insight are analyzed. Participants are assessed at baseline during a visit to their outpatient clinic and followed up for 8 weeks.</brief_summary>
