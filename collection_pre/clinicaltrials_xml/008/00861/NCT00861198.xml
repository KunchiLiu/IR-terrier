	<brief_summary>At the time of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) examination of the pancreaticobiliary system is done indirectly by radiologic means. Contrast is injected into the bile and/or pancreatic duct and outline of the duct is then viewed by fluoroscopic imaging. Frequently this is followed by diagnostic maneuvers (tissue acquisition) or therapeutic interventions (stone removal, stent insertion). Direct visualization of the bile and pancreatic ducts (cholangioscopy/pancreatoscopy) was developed 15 years ago and was shown to be superior to the indirect radiological view. The procedure did not become widely used secondary to high procedure related costs and equipment prone to failure. Recently a much improved (more affordable and more durable) cholangioscope was developed and approved by the FDA. The goal of this study is to prospectively record our experience with cholangioscopy and pancreatoscopy performed as medically indicated as part of standard medical care.</brief_summary>
