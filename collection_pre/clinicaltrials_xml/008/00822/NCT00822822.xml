Participation in this study will take approximately 30 minutes to 1 hour.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>The breakdown of patients recruited by stratified dimensional sampling. Overall, we will attempt to equally recruit patients from the unique strata for each domain evaluation in this study. Patients health status will be determined by the ECOG Performance status . We assume that all patients being seen at the Lifetime Cancer Screening and Prevention center will be of good to fair health, while patients seen at the Cancer hospital will range from good to fair to poor health status. Gender is also used as a sampling factor because there are modules within this webbased health history forms that are specific for each gender. Respondents who refuse to participate or who become too ill at any point in the assessment, will be excluded. NonEnglish speaking patients will be excluded. Names and other identifying information will not be collected and all data will be reported in aggregate form. Due to the nature of our stratified samples strategy, some patients will be excluded if they meet the criteria for a recruitment stata, but that stata is full.</criteria>
