	<brief_summary>A concise diabetes self-management education (DSME) program on the "ABCs of Diabetes" will be placed in an urban public library to assess the feasibility of using this community setting for the delivery of health care education in an urban African American population. Impact on knowledge of, prescriptions for, and control of blood sugar (A1C), blood pressure (BP) and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C)before and after participation in the program will be assessed. We will also examine the frequency of emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations for uncontrolled diabetes at 6 months post-DSME intervention.</brief_summary>
