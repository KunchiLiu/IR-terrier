	<brief_title>Effects of Oral GLP-1 on Glucose Homeostasis and Appetite Profile in Healthy Male Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) promotes satiety and reduces food intake. GLP-1 is secreted from intestinal L-cells into the splanchnic circulation, it is (i) subject to rapid breakdown and (ii) submitted to a high liver extraction. Highest concentrations of GLP-1 are therefore found in the splanchnic blood rather than in the systemic circulation. An oral delivery system would mimick the physiological path of endogenous secretion. Objective: We aimed to investigate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of a single dose (2 mg) of oral GLP-1 administered prior to an oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT) in 16 healthy males.</detailed_description>
