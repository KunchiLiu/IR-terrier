	<brief_summary>During this proposed clinical trial, the investigators intend to evaluate the pharmacodynamic anti-inflammatory properties and safety of TPI ASM8, by investigating the effect on sputum eosinophils and the airway responses during an allergen challenge at different dose levels.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Four Escalating Dose Regimens of TPI ASM8 in Patients With Allergic Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The early and late asthmatic response were both significantly attenuated by the highest dose of ASM8. The methacholine challenge and other parameters (ECP, mRNA knockdown on CCR3 and B-Chain of IL-3-Il-5 and GMCSF were attenuated by ASM8.</detailed_description>
