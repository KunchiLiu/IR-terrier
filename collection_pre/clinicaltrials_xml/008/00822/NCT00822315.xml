	<brief_summary>Raltegravir is a potent antiretroviral agent that could be used as an alternative to efavirenz in HIV-1 infected patients with tuberculosis. However due to pharmacokinetic interactions, the optimal dose of raltegravir to be used in combination with rifampin is currently unknown. This phase II open-label randomized multicenter trial is designed to estimate the antiviral efficacy of two doses of raltegravir and one dose of efavirenz at week 24, in HIV-1 naive patients co-infected with active tuberculosis (TB) treated with rifampin.</brief_summary>
