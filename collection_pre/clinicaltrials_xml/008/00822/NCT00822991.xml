	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to prove usefulness of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CE-US) using Sonazoid (TM) in the early detection of HCC as compared with conventional B-mode ultrasound (B-mode US) for hepatitis virus related cirrhosis, who are defined as super high-risk patients for hepatocarcinogenesis,Furthermore, to analyze whether early detection of HCC by CE-US has a survival benefit than that by B-mode US.</brief_summary>
