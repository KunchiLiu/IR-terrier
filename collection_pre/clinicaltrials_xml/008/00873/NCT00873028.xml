	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a 6-day postoperative in hospital cardiopulmonary rehabilitation program on inspiratory muscle strength and its potential association with improved functional capacity after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Inspiratory Muscle Strength Early After Coronary Artery Bypass</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible patients were randomized to a cardiopulmonary rehabilitation program (Rehab; n = 10) or to usual care (Control; n = 10). The randomization was done by the Graphpad StatMate computerized program. Those patients assigned to Control were followed by their own physicians, received routine nursing assistance, were visited daily by the one of the investigators (CPM), but were not exposed to any specific respiratory or motor physical intervention. Those randomized to Rehab received the same medical and nursing care, but followed a structured physical therapy program twice a day.</detailed_description>
