	<brief_title>Reliability of the Angle Measurement of the Software for Photogrammetry Postural Assessment (SAPO)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The body posture in the orthostatic position has been widely utilized as in the clinical practice as in the research, for the diagnosis and physiotherapy treatment planning. The photogrammetry has been used as a valuable resource for the physiotherapist's diagnosis and verification of measuring postural changes, but the lack of standardization of anatomic references, the used angles between them and their meaning embarrasses comparison among studies.</detailed_description>
