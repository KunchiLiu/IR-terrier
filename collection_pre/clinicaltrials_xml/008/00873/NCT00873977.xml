	<brief_title>Treatment Adherence and Outcomes in Three Modalities of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Treatment for Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder that is associated with substantial morbidity, including excessive daytime sleepiness, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Although Continuous Pressure Airway Pressure (CPAP) is effective treatment of objective and subjective complaints, adherence to CPAP therapy is suboptimal. Recently, pressure-relief CPAP (C-flex,A-flex; Respironics; Murrysville, PA) is available. The present study is single-blind,prospective, randomised, crossover study to compare the adherence and effects of therapy with C-flex, A-flex, and autoadjusting CPAP after 3 months of CPAP treatment. Additionally, after 3 months of CPAP treatment, the patients who treated with C-flex and A-flex will crossovered, we will acess to change of adherence and effects of CPAP treatment.</detailed_description>
