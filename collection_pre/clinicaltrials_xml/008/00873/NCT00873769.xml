	<brief_title>Staccato Loxapine PK in Smokers and Nonsmokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pharmacokinetics and sedation pharmacodynamics were studied using a visual analog scale were studied in male and female adult subjects (nonsmokers and smokers) following a single dose of 10 mg of inhaled loxapine. Blood samples were drawn at predose, 30 seconds, 1, 2, 3, 10, 30, and 60 minutes, and 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours after dosing. Loxapine and 8-OH-loxapine were analyzed using reverse-phase liquid chromatography coupled with a tandem mass spectrometer.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Normal spirometry at screening and in good general health as determined by a complete medical history, physical examination, 12lead ECG, blood chemistry profile, hematology, and urinalysis, Smokers must have a history of smoking &gt; 15 cigarettes/day currently and for at least the last 2 years, Nonsmokers must have never smoked &gt; 5 cigarettes/day and not smoking at all for at least the last 2 years. Any acute illness in the 5 days, Use of a bronchodilator for the treatment of wheezing within 12 months, OR Any other disease or condition, by history, physical examination, or laboratory abnormalities that would present undue risk to the subject, or may confound the interpretation of study results.</criteria>
