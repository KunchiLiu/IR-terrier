	<brief_summary>This was a study designed to evaluate the efficacy of multiple doses of an investigational drug, NBI-6024, in adult (18 to 35 years of age) and adolescent (10 to 17 years of age) patients with new onset type 1 diabetes mellitus, on endogenous insulin production. A total of 188 patients were enrolled in the study. The study was divided into three periods: screening, treatment (comprising an induction phase and maintenance phase), and follow-up. NBI-6024 was generally well tolerated and exhibits a benign safety profile, as there were no significant safety issues with NBI-6024 treatment. In summary, NBI-6024 did not demonstrate statistically significant efficacy compared with placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate NBI-6024 in Adult and Adolescent Patients With New Onset of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a Phase II, multicenter (international), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, dose-ranging study to evaluate the efficacy of multiple doses of an altered peptide ligand, NBI-6024, in adult (18 to 35 years of age) and adolescent (10 to 17 years of age) patients with new onset type 1 diabetes mellitus. Study drug was administered subcutaneously a total of 26 times over a 24-month period. The first three doses were administered every 2 weeks (induction phase); all subsequent dosing occurred monthly (maintenance phase). Patients returned to the study center to receive study drug and have efficacy and safety assessments collected. The primary efficacy endpoint was the 2-hour peak C-peptide at Month 24. Other secondary analyses included AUC C-peptide, prescribed insulin usage, AUC blood glucose, HbA1c, hypoglycemic events, and hyperglycemic events.</detailed_description>
