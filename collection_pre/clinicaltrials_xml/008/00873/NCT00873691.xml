	<brief_title>Comparison of Fixed Tilt and Tuned Waveforms in Right-sided Implants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current era implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) have high defibrillation efficacy. This has stimulated a debate about whether DFT testing should be performed at all.1-3 However, this dialog has primarily centered around left sided implants, a group that is characterized by a small incidence of high defibrillation thresholds (DFTs). The mechanism of phase duration programming to improve DFTs would seem to be most effectively applied to a group of patients with a high incidence of high DFTs such as right sided implants. This study therefore aims to prospectively evaluate direct phase duration programming on DFTs in right sided implants.</detailed_description>
