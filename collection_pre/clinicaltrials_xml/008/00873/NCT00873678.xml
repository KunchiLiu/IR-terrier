	<detailed_description>Design: multicentric Aims of this study: to describe clinical and genetic basis of Joubert syndrome and cerebello-oculo-renal syndromes.Joubert syndrome (JS) is characterized by hypotonia, abnormal ocular movements and neonatal breathing dysregulation evolving into developmental delay, ataxia, oculomotor apraxia with variable mental retardation. The neuroradiological hallmark of JS is a complex midbrain-hindbrain malformation consisting of vermis hypoplasia/dysplasia, a deepened interpeduncular fossa, and thickened, elongated and mal-orientated superior cerebellar peduncles (Molar Tooth Sign, MTS). Other organs could be involved in JS (kidneys :nephronophthisis or cystic dysplastic kidneys; eyes : Leber Congenital Amaurosis, retinopathy, colobomas); liver : hepatic fibrosis; others: polydactyly, tongue hamartomas, situs inversus). Several associated central nervous system malformations were described : polymicrogyria, hydrocephalus, corpus callosum anomalies and encephalocele. This pleiotropic involvement identifies a large spectrum of cerebello-oculo-renal syndromes or JS Related Disorders (JSRD). Joubert syndrome and cerebello-oculo-renal syndromes (JS/CORS) are autosomal recessive conditions associated with a high risk of recurrence for further pregnancies (25%). In 2004 mutations in AHI1 gene (Abelson helper integration site gene) were identified in 7-11% JS but the disease is caracterized by a wide genetic heterogeneity. At least five others genes are involved in JS/CORS : NPHP1, which homozygous deletions are responsible for a small percentage of JS (2%) and more recently CEP290 gene which exact mutations prevalence remained to be evaluated. Using molecular analysis of those three genes (sequencing of 29 coding exons of AHI1 and 54 exons of CEP290, searching for NPHP1 homozygous deletions by PCR analysis) we project to study respective prevalence of mutations of those three genes and described associated phenotypes in 65 JSCORS patients. This work will allowed to described genotype-phenotypes correlation in JSCORS and to progress in the characterization of the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms. It will be the first step before identification of novel disease genes.</detailed_description>
