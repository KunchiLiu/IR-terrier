	<brief_summary>The EVE-PMS technology is intended for determination of intolerance or sensitivity to sex hormones, among women suffering from severe PreMenstrual Syndrome (PMS) and desensitizes them with the relevant sex hormones in order to reduce PMS symptoms. The system includes skin testing panel for identification of hormones to which the patients might be sensitive. Tests are applied close to the ovulation period and the skin reaction is examined in 20 minutes, 48 hours and daily during the following month. Results of skin tests and patient's history will determine the eligibility of the patients to enter a desensitization protocol. During the desensitization period hormones to which the patient were found sensitive to, are injected intradermally three times (once a month) within the luteal phase in increasing doses. The end-point of the study is a statistically significant decrease, or elimination of PMS symptoms, compared to a solvent group.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Person is over the age of 20 but not older than age 45. 2. Person is willing to participate as evidenced by signing the written informed consent form. 3. Suffers from known dominant severe symptom of breast swelling and tenderness (level 710 according to standard scale of PMS symptoms severity) 4. Other severe symptoms of Premenstrual syndrome (based on WHO and ACOG criteria). This may include one or more of PMS symptoms with level 710 according to standard scale of PMS symptoms severity. 5.
