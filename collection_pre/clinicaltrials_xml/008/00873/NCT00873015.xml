	<brief_title>Safety and Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of Nitrite for Prevention of Cerebral Vasospasm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intravenous sodium nitrite has been shown to prevent and to reverse cerebral vasospasm in a primate model of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). This was a Phase IIA dose escalation study of sodium nitrite to determine its safety in patients with aneurysmal SAH and to establish its pharmacokinetics during a 14 day infusion. Sodium nitrite was delivered intravenously for 14 days in 18 patients with SAH from a ruptured cerebral aneurysm using a dose escalation scheme in three cohorts of 6 patients each (3 nitrite, 3 saline), with a maximum dose of 64 nmol/min/kg. Sodium nitrite blood levels were frequently sampled and measured using mass spectroscopy and blood methemoglobin levels were continuously monitored using a pulse oximeter.</detailed_description>
