	<brief_summary>The aim of the pilot trial is to assess at what extend women with arrested threatened preterm labor change their activity patterns at home in response to bed rest prescription. An area of concern for the design of a trial is the strength of health provider's recommendation to change women's behaviors, and their compliance with bed rest recommendations. The study was a randomized parallel design. The intervention group consisted of total bed rest for four days (with allowance to go to the toilet). The control group consisted in the restriction of activities during four days.</brief_summary>
