	<brief_summary>This study has been designed to investigate the pharmacokinetic and safety profile of the co-administration of intravenous (IV) and transdermal granisetron, as well as characterise the pharmacokinetics of multiple transdermal dosing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PK, Tolerability and Safety of the co-Administration of Sancuso® (Transdermal Granisetron) and IV Granisetron</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sancuso® is designed to provide antiemetic prophylaxis for chemotherapy of up to 5 days duration. In exceptional clinical situations in which the patch is not applied at the appropriate time (i.e. 24-48 hours pre-chemotherapy), clinicians might use a single IV dose of granisetron to provide prophylaxis while the granisetron from the patch reaches a therapeutic plasma concentration. Most chemotherapeutics are dosed in a single day, with a 2- or 3-week interval between doses; however, several regimens are administered over more than 5 days and others are given at frequencies (e.g. every 5 days). Thus, more than one patch may be required to provide continuous antiemetic prophylaxis. Characterisation of the pharmacokinetics of multiple transdermal dosing offers useful information for clinicians who treat patients with the latter types of regimens.</detailed_description>
