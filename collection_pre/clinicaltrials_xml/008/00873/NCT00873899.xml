	<brief_title>Evolution of Management Strategies of Heart Failure Patients With Implantable Defibrillators</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure patients with implantable defibrillators (ICD) perform frequent clinic visits for routine device monitoring. Moreover, in case of clinical events, such as ICD shocks or alert notifications for changes in cardiac status or safety issues, they often visit the emergency department or the clinic for an unscheduled visit. These planned and unplanned visits create a great burden on healthcare providers. Internet-based remote device interrogation systems, allowing physician's remote access to patients' data, are being proposed for reducing routine and interim visits and for earlier detection and notification of alert conditions.</detailed_description>
