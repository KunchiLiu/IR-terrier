	<brief_summary>Elderly persons in long-term facilities often have denutrition, associated with a bad oral and dental status. Yet, many elderly persons don't attend dentist care and when they have dental prothesis, do not often use them during meals. The impact of a rehabilitation of dental function on their nutritional status has not been proven. The objective of this study is to assess the impact of 2 strategies aimed to restore a good nutritional status, among patients with slight denutrition.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Two interventions are evaluated during a 1 year study period, with a 4 arms factorial design. The "Dentary" intervention implies a trimestrial follow-up of patients and counseling for appropriate care (if needed), in order to restore a minimum masticatory function, associated with particular focus on the realization of daily oral wash. The "Nutrition" intervention consists in 1) comparing the meals and oral supplements administered with the dietary prescriptions and 2) Incite patients to eat.</detailed_description>
