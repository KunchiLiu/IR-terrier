	<brief_summary>Chronic inflammation that comprises the exocrine glands' function leads to xerophthalmia and xerostomia in Sjögren's syndrome. The oral consequences range widely and they are related to decreased salivary output. Hydroxychloroquine may inhibit cholinesterase activity in salivary glands via interference with antigen processing mechanism, and thus, the investigators' hypothesis was that salivary gland function may be improved if treated with hydroxychloroquine. The effects of hydroxychloroquine on the salivary flow rate, subjective and objective parameters of the patients were also assessed.</brief_summary>
