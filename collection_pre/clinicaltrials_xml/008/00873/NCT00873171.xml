	<brief_title>Osteopathic Manipulation Therapy in the Treatment of Interstitial Cystitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The management of interstitial cystitis is predominantly based on the reduction of the symptoms of frequency, urgency, and pain.In addition to Osteopathic manipulation Other conservative treatments frequently include dietary modification, pharmaceuticals, bladder training, neuromodulation, and stress reduction. The goal of Osteopathic manipulation is to relax the pelvic muscles used by the bladder and improve the flow of blood and lymph fluid to this region, which may result in easing pain and discomfort associated with cystitis.Some physicians have found that Osteopathic Manipulation works for some people as an alternative to surgery. A secondary objective will be to determine if the increased attention and power of touch are as effective as OMT in treating patients with interstitial cystitis based on the results of using attention control treatment in some patients.Thus, this is a pilot study comparing OMT to an attention control arm and standard of care arm of treatment.We will review palpatory visceromatic reflex changes as documented by tissue texture changes, asymmetry, restriction of motion and tenderness pre and post treatment.Physical examination including detailed musculoskeletal examination of the lumbosacral region will be performed pre and post and then compared the results.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The criteria for treatment is that the patient must exhibit symptoms of IC for at least one year and have a known diagnosis based on history and clinical findings including glomerulations of the bladder wall seen on cystoscopic examination. Patients who are not eligible are those who have contraindications to OMT such as hypersensitivity to palpation, indurations or mass/tumor, adenopathy, cancer, or local infection</criteria>
