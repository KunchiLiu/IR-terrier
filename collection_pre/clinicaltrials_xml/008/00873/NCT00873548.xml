	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this prospective multicenter study is to assess any fracture fixation complication and revision rates during the clinical use of the Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation Asia (PFNA Asia) for the treatment of unstable trochanteric fractures.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Unstable Trochanteric Fractures With the Proximal Femoral Nail - Antirotation (PFNA)-Asia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>From several studies, e.g. on hip prostheses, it is known that the Asian population has other geometric proportions than Caucasians, e.g. Japanese woman have shorter femoral necks, smaller femoral neck angles and a more anterior bowing of the shaft than white Americans. This was one of the reasons for the development of a new PFNA Asia with adapted sizes and geometry. No controlled clinical data are available whether the rate of mismatch and mismatch-related complications could be reduced.</detailed_description>
