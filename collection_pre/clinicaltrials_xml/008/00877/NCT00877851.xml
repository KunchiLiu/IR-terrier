	<brief_summary>Managing diet and physical activity are vital aspects of diabetes self−care; however, people with diabetes often find it difficult to make changes to their usual diet and physical activity patterns. There is some evidence that computer based education may help some people develop the skills they need to better manage their diabetes. The investigators have developed an interactive CD−ROM, focusing on knowledge, self−monitoring, goal setting and skill−development in relation to diet and physical activity for people with Type 2 diabetes. A major emphasis was placed on eliciting the views of people with Type 2 diabetes throughout the development of the CD−ROM. This study will examine whether this CD−ROM can improve knowledge, skills and self−care behaviour in people with diabetes. One hundred participants who have been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in the past 2 years will be assigned by chance to one of two groups: they will either be assigned to continue with their normal care routine consulting with their doctor as normal, or they will be assigned to use the CD−ROM at least once a week for 12 weeks.</brief_summary>
