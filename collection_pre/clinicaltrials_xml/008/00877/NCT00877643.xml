	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether in patients with early persistent atrial fibrillation and mild to moderate early heart failure an aggressive upstream rhythm control approach, including aldosterone receptor antagonists and statins, dietary restrictions, counseling and cardiac rehabilitation programs, increases persistence of sinus rhythm compared with conventional rhythm control after one year of follow-up. A randomized long term extension of the RACE 3 will be performed with a total follow-up of 5 years to investigate the long term effects on persistence of sinus rhythm and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of the two treatment strategies.</brief_summary>
