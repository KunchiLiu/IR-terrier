	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about certain genes and proteins in tumors that do not respond well to treatment. These features will be compared with the status of the disease after surgery for breast cancer that does not express the HER2 protein, when patients either receive or do not receive ixabepilone. The safety of ixabepilone in this group of patients will also be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Study of Ixabepilone Versus Observation in Patients With Significant Residual Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug: Ixabepilone is designed to work by blocking cell division, which may cause cancer cell death. Surgery: You will have surgery as part of your standard of care. Your tissue will be tested to measure residual disease (leftover cancer). If there is a low amount of leftover disease, you will not be eligible to take part in this study. Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. If you are in Group 1, you will receive ixabepilone. You also will be treated with the standard of care treatments for the disease, including radiation and/or hormonal therapy (if appropriate). If you are in Group 2, you will not receive the study drug. You will be treated with the standard of care treatments for the disease, including radiation and/or hormonal therapy (if appropriate). Study Drug Administration for Group 1: If you are in Group 1, you will receive ixabepilone though a needle in your vein over 3 hours on Day 1 of each 21-day study cycle. Before the infusion, you will be given drugs, by vein, to help decrease the risk of an allergic reaction. These drugs will include Benadryl® (diphenhydramine), Tagamet® (cimetidine), and Decadron (dexamethasone). The infusion will last 30-45 minutes. If you experience severe side effects, future treatments may be delayed, the dose may be decreased, or you may be taken off study. Study Visits: Group 1: On Day 1 of each cycle, the following tests and procedures will be performed: - Your medical history will be recorded. - Your performance status will be recorded. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. - You will have a physical exam. - You will be asked about any side effects you may be experiencing or may have experienced since the last visit. Group 2: At the end of radiation (or on the day of your baseline blood collection), and at Weeks 9 and 18, you will have a physical exam and your medical history will be recorded. Circulating Tumor Cell (CTC) testing: Blood (about 2 tablespoons each time) will be drawn before surgery to measure the amount of CTCs in your blood. If you are in Group 1, blood will be drawn again at Cycles 4 and at the end of Cycle 6. If you are in Group 2, blood will be drawn again at Weeks 9 and 18. Length of Study: If you are in Group 1, you may receive the study drug for up to 6 cycles. You will be taken off study early if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur. If you are in Group 2, you will be off study after Week 18. This is an investigational study. Ixabepilone is FDA approved and commercially available for metastatic (advanced) breast cancer. Up to 116 patients will take part in this multicenter study. Up to 116 may be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with histologic confirmation of invasive HER2/neunegative breast cancer (IHC 01+ or FISHnegative) that have received complete anthracycline and taxane neoadjuvant systemic therapy and that at the time of surgery are expected to have significant residual disease. Therapy should include at least 4 cycles of an anthracyclinebased regimen (AC, FAC, FEC) and 12 weeks of a taxanebased regimen (weekly paclitaxel, every 3week docetaxel). 2. Patients who did not complete therapy due to disease progression are eligible. 3. Age &gt;/= 18 years 4. Patients with bilateral breast cancers are eligible. 5. Patients should have a Karnofsky performance scale of =/&gt; 70%. 6. Patient should have adequate bone marrow function, as defined by peripheral granulocyte count of &gt;/= 1500/mm^3, and platelet count &gt;/= 100000 mm^3. 7. Patients must have adequate liver function with a bilirubin within normal laboratory values. Alkaline phosphatase and transaminases (ALT and AST) may be up to 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) of the institution. 8. Patients should have adequate renal function with creatinine levels within normal range. 9. Negative serum pregnancy test for a woman of childbearing potential. 10. Women of childbearing potential (WOCP) must use a reliable and appropriate contraceptive method during the study and 6 months after chemotherapy is completed. WOCBP are women who are not menopausal for 12 months or had no previous surgical sterilization. 11. Patients must agree to have study tissue collections and blood sample collections. 12. Patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the investigational nature of the study, in keeping with institutional policy. 13. Patients should have their surgical tissues evaluated for RCB and be used for correlative studies. 14. Sexually active women of childbearing potential must use an effective method of birth control during the course fo the study, in a manner such that risk of failure is minimized. Prior to study enrollment, women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. In addition, men enrolled on this study should understand the risks to any sexual partner of childbearing potential and should practice an effective method of birth control. 15. All WOCBP MUST have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days prior to first receiving investigational product. If the pregnancy test is positive, the patient must not receive investigational product and must not be enrolled in the study. In addition, all WOCBP will be instructed to contact the Investigator immediately if they suspect they might be pregnant (e.g., missed or late menstrual period) at any time during study participation. The PI will immediately notify BMS in the event of a confirmed pregnancy in a patient participating in the study. 1. Patients whose tumors express HER2 protein or have HER2/neu gene amplification. 2. Patients with a history of other invasive malignancies diagnosed and treated within the previous 5 years, except nonmelanoma skin cancer and noninvasive cervical cancer 3. Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease which could compromise participation in the study (i.e., uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, severe infection, severe malnutrition, unstable angina, or congestive heart failure New York Heart Association Class III or IV, ventricular arrhythmias, active ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction within six months, chronic liver or renal disease, active upper GI tract ulceration) 4. Patients with a preexisting peripheral neuropathy &gt; grade 1. 5. Evidence of distant metastases</criteria>
