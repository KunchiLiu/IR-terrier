	<brief_summary>Funding Source - FDA OOPD FDR004128 The goal of this study is to see if it is safe and feasible to give chemotherapy, natural killer (NK) cells, and an antibody called 3F8. The NK cells must come from a family member who shares half of the HLA proteins which are immune proteins important in transplant. NK cells are a type of white blood cell. They can recognize and kill abnormal cells in the body and can work together with antibodies to kill target cells. The antibody 3F8 specifically recognizes a protein present on the target cancer cell.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of NB as defined by international criteria, i.e., histopathology (confirmed by the MSKCC Department of Pathology) or bone marrow metastases plus high urine catecholamine levels Highrisk NB as defined by riskrelated treatment guidelines and the International NB Staging System,57 i.e., stage 4 with (any age) or without (&gt;365 days of age) MYCN amplification, MYCNamplified stage 3 (unresectable; any age), or MYCNamplified stage 4S. Patients must have a history of tumor progression or persistent disease or failure to achieve complete response following standard therapy. Patients must have evaluable (microscopic marrow metastasis, elevated tumor markers, positive MIBG or PET scans) or measurable (CT, MRI) disease documented after completion of prior systemic therapy. Disease staging approximately within one month of treatment. Human antimouse antibody (HAMA) titer &lt;1000 Elisa units/ml if applicable Available autologous stem cells: â‰¥2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg Adequate cardiac function as measured by echocardiogram Eligible NK donor Signed informed consent indicating awareness of the investigational nature of this program. Donor Eligibility Donor is bloodrelated and HLAhaploidentical to the recipient. Donor has undergone serologic testing for transmissible diseases as per blood banking guidelines for organ and tissue donors. Tests include but are not limited to: HepBsAg, HepBsAb, HepBcAb, HepC antibody, HIV, HTLV I and II, VZV, CMV and VDRL, West Nile Virus and Chagas screen. Donor must have normal negative test results for HIV, HTLV I and II, and West Nile Virus. Donor exposure to other viral pathogens will be discussed on a casebycase basis by the investigators. Donor must be able to undergo leukopheresis for total volume of 1015 liters. There is no age restriction for the donor. Patients with CR/VGPR disease Existing severe major organ dysfunction, i.e., renal, cardiac, hepatic, neurologic, pulmonary, or gastrointestinal toxicity &gt; or = to grade 3 except for hearing loss, alopecia, anorexia, nausea, hyperbilirubinemia and hypomagnesemia from TPN, which may be grade 3 ANC should be &gt;500/uL; platelet count &gt;25K/uL. History of allergy to mouse proteins Active lifethreatening infection HAMA titer &gt;1000 Elisa units/ml Inability to comply with protocol requirements Donor Exclusion Criteria Cardiac risk factors precluding ability to undergo leukopheresis Concurrent malignancy or autoimmune disease Donor is pregnant.</criteria>
