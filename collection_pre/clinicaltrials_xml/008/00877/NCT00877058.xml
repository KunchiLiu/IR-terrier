	<brief_summary>The present study "Elderly person in the risk zone" form part of the research programme "Support for frail elderly persons - from prevention to palliation" (www. Vardalinstitutet.net) which comprises research into three interventions. A fundamental principle in the research programme is that it comprises interventions addressing frail elderly person in different phases of the disablement process, from elderly persons who are beginning to develop frailty to very frail elderly persons receiving palliative care in the final period of their lives. The interventions also address the different requirements that arise with regard to professional contributions during the various phases of the ageing and disease process, ranging from health promotion to a need for an increasing degree of medical care, nursing, special care and rehabilitation, and finally, efforts that promote symptom relief, quality of life, security and satisfaction with care during the final period of life. The intervention "Elderly persons in the risk zone" addresses elderly persons that are on the point of developing frailty ("pre-frail") and are beginning to feel that they are being hindered from taking part in everyday activities. The hypothesis is that if an intervention is made when the persons are not so frail, it is possible to prevent/delay deterioration. 1. Can a health-promoting and preventive intervention for "prefrail" elderly persons: - prevent frailty, activity limitations and morbidity, - be a supportive factor in the social and physical environment, - affect life satisfaction - have an impact on the consumption of care - be cost-effective? 2. How do the frail elderly persons experience the intervention and its importance to health?</brief_summary>
