	<criteria>Chronic hepatitis B (HBsAg positive &gt; 6 months) HBeAg positive, antiHBe negative at screening ALT &gt; 1.3 x ULN within 60 days prior to screening and during screening Liver biopsy performed within 2 years prior to screening or during screening Age &gt; 18 years Written informed consent Adequate contraception for males and females during treatment and follow up; negative pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential) Antiviral therapy against HBV within the previous 6 months Treatment with any investigational drug within 30 days of screening Previous treatment with lamivudine or telbivudine for more than six months Severe hepatitis activity as documented by ALT&gt;10 x ULN History of decompensated cirrhosis (defined as jaundice in the presence of cirrhosis, ascites, bleeding gastric or esophageal varices or encephalopathy) Preexistent neutropenia (neutrophils &lt; 1,500/mm3) or thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt; 90,000/mm3) Coinfection with hepatitis C virus or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Other acquired or inherited causes of liver disease (i.e. alcoholic liver disease, obesity induced liver disease, drug related liver disease, autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease or alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency) Alpha fetoprotein &gt; 50 ng/ml Hyper or hypothyroidism (subjects requiring medication to maintain TSH levels in the normal range are eligible if all other inclusion/exclusion criteria are met) Immune suppressive treatment within the previous 6 months Contraindications for alphainterferon therapy like suspected hypersensitivity to interferon or PEGinterferon or any known preexisting medical condition that could interfere with the patient's participation in and completion of the study. Pregnancy, lactation Other significant medical illness that might interfere with this study: significant pulmonary dysfunction in the previous 6 months, malignancy other than skin basocellular carcinoma in previous 5 years, immunodeficiency syndromes (e.g. HIV positivity, autoimmune diseases, organ transplants other than cornea and hair transplant) Any medical condition requiring, or likely to require chronic systemic administration of steroids, during the course of the study Substance abuse, such as alcohol (&gt; 80 g/day), I.V. drugs and inhaled drugs in the past 2 years. Any other condition which in the opinion of the principal investigator would make the patient unsuitable for enrollment, or could interfere with the patient participating in and completing the study</criteria>
