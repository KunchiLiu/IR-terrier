	<brief_title>Nurture: A Program for Mothers With Histories of Disordered Eating</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mothers who have struggled with disordered eating or body image struggles are often concerned how best to provide proper nutrition to their child and/or model healthy eating behavior. We have developed a curriculum that provides information about how to establish healthy eating patterns and social support for mothers with children under three years of age. The curriculum will be delivered in a support group format led by co-therapists affiliated with the UNC Eating Disorder Program.</detailed_description>
