	<brief_summary>Systolic function is a substantial determinant of overall hemodynamics and organ function. Therefore assessment of left ventricular systolic function (LVF) has been of central interest in Echocardiography. Ejection fraction (EF) measurement has been the gold standard echo-derived measure to describe LVF. However, EF is a blood pool derived and therefore load dependent measure. Global longitudinal peak systolic strain average is a new parameter derived from speckle tracking tachnique. As a primarily myocardial deformation parameter it is considered to be an equivalent to EF measurement, but maybe less load dependend. The aim of the study is to investigate the reliability of GLPSS average to quantify LVF in the perioperative setting (in cardiac and non-cardiac cases).</brief_summary>
