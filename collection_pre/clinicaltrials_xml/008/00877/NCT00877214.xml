	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if an extended maintenance therapy with Rituximab in follicular and a maintenance therapy in other indolent and mantle cell lymphomas has advantages compared to a shorter or no maintenance therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Significance of Duration of Maintenance Therapy With Rituximab in Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Results from several randomised studies show a clinical benefit of a maintenance therapy with rituximab in follicular lymphomas. The advantage of a maintenance therapy in other indolent and mantle cell lymphomas is - due to the lower incidence of these diseases- not well investigated. This study tries to determine the significance of an extended maintenance therapy with rituximab in follicular lymphomas and the significance of a maintenance therapy other indolent and mantle cell lymphomas compared to observation.</detailed_description>
