	<brief_summary>Isoflavonoids, through their estrogen-like activity, are in part responsible for the cholesterol lowering properties of soy foods. If this is found to be so, then it would be advantageous not only to promote soy consumption, but also to identify and use soy cultivars with high isoflavonoid content in production of soy food products. These foods may have a use in the reduction of serum cholesterol and if they effectively increase the phytoestrogen activity of soy, may have a role in the prevention of other hormone dependent diseases (e.g. osteoporosis, certain cancers) in the same way as natural estrogens.</brief_summary>
