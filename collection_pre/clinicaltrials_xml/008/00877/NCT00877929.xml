Mean seated Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) =180 mm Hg and/or mean seated Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) =110 mm Hg during any visit of the screening and placebo runin periods 5. Patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus 6. Renal dysfunction as defined by the following laboratory parameters: Serum creatinine &gt;3.0 mg/dL (or &gt;265 Âµmol /L) or known creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min or clinical markers of severe renal impairment 7. Bilateral renal artery stenosis, renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney, postrenal transplant patients or patients with only one kidney 8. Clinically relevant hypokalaemia or hyperkalaemia 9. Uncorrected sodium or volume depletion 10. Primary aldosteronism 11. Hereditary fructose intolerance 12. Biliary obstructive disorders (e.g., cholestatis) or hepatic insufficiency 13. Congestive heart failure New York Heart Academy (NYHA) functional class CHF IIIIV (Refer to Appendix 10.3) 14. Contraindication to a placebo runin period (e.g., stroke within the past six months, myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, unstable angina or coronary artery bypass graft within the past three months prior to start of runin period) 15. Clinically significant ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter or other clinically relevant cardiac arrhythmias as determined by the Investigator 16. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, severe obstructive coronary artery disease, aortic stenosis, hemodynamically relevant stenosis of the aortic or mitral valve 17. Patients whose diabetes has not been stable and controlled for at least the past three months as defined by an HbA1C &gt;10% 18. Patients who have previously experienced symptoms characteristic of angioedema during treatment with Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensinII receptor antagonists 19. History of drug or alcohol dependency within six months prior to signing the informed consent form 20. Concomitant administration of any medications known to affect blood pressure, except medications allowed by the protocol 21. Any investigational drug therapy within one month of signing the informed consent 22. Known hypersensitivity to any component of the study drugs (telmisartan, amlodipine, or placebo) 23. History of noncompliance or inability to comply with prescribed medications or protocol procedures 24. Any other clinical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would not allow safe completion of the protocol and safe administration of telmisartan and amlodipine</criteria>
