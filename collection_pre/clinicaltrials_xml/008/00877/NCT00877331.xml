	<brief_title>Brief Intervention in Primary Care for Problem Drug Use and Abuse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A substantial body of research has established the efficacy and effectiveness of brief interventions (BI) for excessive or "hazardous" alcohol use in patients seen in medical settings. Dissemination projects of brief interventions for alcohol and drugs have recently been implemented on a widespread scale. This rapid progression of brief intervention for drugs other than alcohol has outstripped its evidence base. The aims of the study as outlined in the grant are: 1. To examine whether BI is effective at improving outcomes (self-reported drug use and attendance in drug abuse treatment) in individuals with a wide range of problem drug use over and above enhanced care as usual. The enhanced control condition will consist of routine screening, patient notification, and referral for treatment. 2. To test whether fidelity to the BI model or lower severity of drug use is associated with better outcomes. 3. To estimate the impact of BI on several public health outcomes that are directly related to the hazardous effects of illicit drug use, including the use of acute health care services, involvement in the criminal justice system, employment, HIV risk behavior, and mortality. 4. To estimate the costs of the intervention, potential cost offsets, and its incremental cost-effectiveness versus enhanced usual care from the payer perspective based on health care service use and drug use frequency.</detailed_description>
