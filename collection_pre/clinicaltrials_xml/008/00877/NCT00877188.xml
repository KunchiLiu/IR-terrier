	<brief_title>Effect of Combined Aerobic and Resisted Exercise in Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer and cancer treatment side effects are associated with fatigue, pain, decreased cardiovascular fitness and muscle strength, and overall quality of life. Furthermore, cancer survivors are at increased risk for cancer recurrence and for secondary effect such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis, and functional decline. Increase physical activity or exercise is proposed to overcome the negative psychological and physiological effects. Preliminary research evidence shows that exercise in cancer survivors improves quality of life, cardiorespiratory fitness, physical functioning, and decrease of fatigue. However, the best exercise mode and intensity has not been well established. Little is known regarding the long term effect. No study investigated impact of exercise for breast cancer survivors on upper extremity function, and correlation between fitness, upper extremity function and quality of life.</detailed_description>
