	<detailed_description>Stage 1, divided into Stage 1a and Stage 1b, focuses on development, refinement, and pilot testing of interventions. The formative research leading to and including intervention development is completed in Stage 1a. A pilot study to provide acceptability/feasibility data and obtain effect size estimates of the intervention's strength in changing a desired outcome is conducted in Stage 1b. If Stage 1b results are "promising," the intervention moves to full scale efficacy testing in Stage 2 using the classic experimental design of a randomized control trial (RCT). The intervention is ready for Stage 3 effectiveness testing only after its efficacy has been demonstrated in at least two Stage 2 trials.</detailed_description>
