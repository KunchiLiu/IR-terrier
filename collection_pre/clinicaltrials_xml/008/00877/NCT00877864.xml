	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to determine the effects of supervised combined aerobic and resistance training, and the effects of stage-matched written materials delivered by mail or internet, alone or in combination, on glycemic control as reflected in A1C (glycated hemoglobin).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Rationale: Structured, supervised exercise programs involving aerobic exercise, resistance exercise or their combination resulted in significant improvements in glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. It has also been shown that programs which include a psychological/behavioral component in addition to diet and exercise have been most effective for long-term treatment of obesity in diabetes. The supervised exercise program has stronger evidence for improvement of metabolic control and cardiac risk, but its longer-term sustainability has not been demonstrated, and it is relatively costly. A stage-matched printed materials/pedometer intervention has been shown to increase physical activity over a longer period of time, and likely at a lower per-patient cost than the supervised exercise intervention, but with less evidence for improvement of metabolic control.</detailed_description>
