	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of three airway secretion clearance techniques (chest physical therapy, flutter device and high frequency chest wall oscillation) on decline in pulmonary function over a three year period in patients with cystic fibrosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Airway Secretion Clearance in Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design: Randomized clinical trial with pulmonary function testing obtained every three months in each of the three treatment groups. Change in slope of FEV1 will be compared. Days of hospitalization and use of oral or IV antibiotics for respiratory tract infection, quality of life, subject satisfaction, and compliance will also be compared. Sample Size: Enrollment will be completed after 180 subjects have been recruited. Fifteen CF centers will participate. Subject Selection: Subjects must have the diagnosis of CF, be &gt; 7 years of age and have an FEV1 &gt; 45% of predicted. Prescribed Therapy: Each subject will receive airway secretion clearance twice a day. Outcomes: Change in slope of FEV1; days of hospitalization and use of oral or IV antibiotics for respiratory tract infection; quality of life; subject satisfaction; compliance.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A proven diagnosis of CF as evidenced by a positive sweat test (as documented by a sweat chloride &gt;60 mEq/L by quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis), or by the presence of two known CF mutations. Aged 7 or older. FEV1 &gt;45% (Knudson). Able to perform reproducible maneuvers for spirometry at screening as defined by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines. Willing to participate in and comply with the study procedures, and willingness of a parent or legally authorized representative to provide written informed consent. Hospitalization for complications of CF, or a respiratory exacerbation resulting in treatment with IV antibiotics within 60 days prior to screening. Use of any investigational drug or device within 60 days prior to screening. An episode of gross hemoptysis (&gt;249 ml) within 60 days prior to screening, or during the course of the study. A pneumothorax in the six months preceding the study or during the course of the study. Patients who are pregnant or become pregnant. Patients colonized with Burkholderia cepacia.</criteria>
