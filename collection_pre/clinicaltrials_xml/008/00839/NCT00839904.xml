This has not been sufficiently examined in children in remission from cancer. In this study, children in remission from cancer will be divided into exercise and control groups. The interventional group will perform two supervised, 60-minute weekly exercise sessions. Outcome measures of the exercise intervention will be quality of life, mood, cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition and bone mineral density.</brief_summary>
