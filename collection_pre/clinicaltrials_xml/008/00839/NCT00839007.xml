	<brief_title>Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of CD-NP in the Treatment of Patients With Acute Decompensated Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Heart Failure</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Key 1. Hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure. 2. Systolic blood pressure ≥ 115 mmHg and ≤ 200 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure ≥ 60 mmHg and ≤ 110 mmHg at screening 3. Renally compromised. 4. Female patients must be postmenopausal or surgically sterile. Key 1. Acute or suspected acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or troponin levels &gt; 3X the upper limit of normal at the institution's local laboratory 2. Cardiogenic shock 3. Evidence of uncorrected volume or sodium depletion other clinical condition that would predispose the patient to adverse events 4. Clinically significant aortic or mitral valve stenosis 5. Temperature &gt;38°C (oral or equivalent), sepsis or active infection requiring IV antimicrobial treatment 6. ADHF due to significant arrhythmias 7. Severe renal failure defined as creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min 8. Current or planned ultrafiltration, hemofiltration, or dialysis 9. Significant pulmonary disease 10. Major neurologic event, including cerebrovascular events in the prior 60 days. 11. Acute myocarditis or hypertrophic obstructive, restrictive, or constrictive cardiomyopathy (not including restrictive mitral filling patterns) 12. Known hypersensitivity or allergy to natriuretic peptide or its components, nesiritide, other natriuretic peptides or related compounds</criteria>
