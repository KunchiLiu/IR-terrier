	<detailed_description>The Advisa IPG is an investigational dual chamber pacemaker that provides rate-responsive bradycardia pacing and diagnostics and atrial tachycardia detection and therapy. The study will be a prospective, non-randomized, multicenter clinical study, conducted. To allow for sufficient experience with the device, a maximum of 80 subjects may be implanted with the Advisa device. Data will be collected at baseline (enrollment), implant, 1-, 3- and 6- months post implant and every 6 months thereafter or until study closure (whichever occurs first), unscheduled follow-up visits, System Modifications, Technical Observations, Study Deviations, Study Exit, upon notification of new or updated Adverse Events and in case of death.</detailed_description>
