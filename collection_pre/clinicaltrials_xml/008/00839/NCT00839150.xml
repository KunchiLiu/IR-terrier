	<brief_summary>The primary purpose was to assess, in diabetic patients without diabetic retinopathy and control subjects, color vision, contrast sensitivity, electroretinography, and flicker-induced vasodilatation using the Dynamic Vessel Analyzer, in order to specify the earliest impaired retinal cells in diabetes, and gain more insight into diabetic retinopathy pathogenesis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients with no diabetic retinopathy and no hypertension were compared with sex and age-matched control subjects. Color vision was tested with the desaturated LANTHONY 15-Hue test. Contrast sensitivity was assessed with the Pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity test. Pattern-electroretinogram, Ganzfeld full-field electroretinogram and multifocal electroretinogram were recorded according to the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV). Flicker-induced vasodilatation in retinal arteries and veins was assessed using the Dynamic Vessel Analyzer.</detailed_description>
