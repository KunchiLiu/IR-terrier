	<brief_summary>Background: How best to improve iron status among infants in low-income settings is of continued concern in many countries, including Brazil Objective: Design: In a double blind, 5-mo, home-based trial in Brazil, mildly anemic 6 - 24 month-old children (n=175) were randomly assigned to receive either Ultra Rice (URG) fortified with 23,4, mg Fe as micronized ferric pyrophosphate (MFP) and a placebo solution of iron drops, or identical non-fortified rice (CG) and a solution of iron drops. Parents were instructed on the correct dosage of iron drops and to feed their children (including whether and how much rice) as they normally would. Iron status and hemoglobin (Hb) were measured at baseline and at 5 mo.</brief_summary>
