	<brief_summary>Exercise training is proved to protect against premature cardiovascular mortality. Additionally there is evidence that relatively high exercise intensity may be an important factor for improving aerobic capacity and endothelial function in patients with post-infarction heart failure, metabolic syndrome, coronary artery disease, as well as in overweight and obese individuals. The aim of this study is to investigate the amount of high-intensity exercise needed to improve aerobic capacity and endothelial function.</brief_summary>
