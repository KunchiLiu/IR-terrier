	<brief_summary>There are two major goals of this project: 1. Comparison of DXA and QCT for diagnosis of bone loss in CKD-5 patients and determination of the prevalence of low bone turnover in CKD-5 patients with bone loss. 2. Identification of the optimal combination of noninvasive tests for definition of the turnover component of ROD.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Aged 18 years or older; Chronic maintenance dialysis of at least 3 months' duration; Mental competence; Willingness to participate in the study; Calcidiol levels within normal range. Pregnancy; Systemic illnesses or organ diseases that may affect bone (except type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus); Clinical condition that may limit study participation (e.g., unstable angina, respiratory distress, infections). Chronic alcoholism and/or drug addiction; Participation in a study of an investigational drug during the past 90 days; Allergy to tetracycline. Planning to move out of the area within 2 years of the study; On active transplant list; Treatment within last 6 months with drugs that may affect bone metabolism (except for treatment with calcitriol, vitamin D analogs and/or calcimimetics). Calcidiol level below the normal range. The current routine clinical practice in our dialysis clinics is to check calcidiol status twice yearly and supplement with vitamin D according to serum calcidiol levels. It is therefore unlikely that a substantial number of patients will be excluded due to this exclusion criterion.</criteria>
