	<brief_summary>People who have long-term conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, arthritis etc. face challenges in staying active and able to participate in activities that are important to them. There is some research that suggests that a care model that focuses on physical functioning and helping patients to manage their own conditions will assist them to stay active and healthy longer. In this project, the investigators are testing whether physiotherapy and occupational therapy offered to groups of patients and information about rehabilitation offered to other members of the health care team can help people with chronic conditions to maintain their physical abilities.</brief_summary>
