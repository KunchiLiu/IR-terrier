	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine the diagnostic values of EBUS-TBNA in the mediastinal re-staging after induction treatment in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Primary objective: 1. To determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and the accuracy of EBUS-TBNA in the detection of mediastinal metastasis in mediastinal re-staging after induction treatment. Secondary objectives: 1. To compare the diagnostic values of EBUS-TBNA and integrated PET/CT in mediastinal re-staging 2. To evaluate the changes of ultrasonographic features of mediastinal lymph nodes after induction therapy 3. To determine procedure related complications</brief_summary>
