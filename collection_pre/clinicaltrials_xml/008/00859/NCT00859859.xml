	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the short-term effects of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) by auricular stimulation (stimulation of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve which innervates the ear) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is characterized by a chronic systemic inflammation affecting the joints but also carries an increased risk for extra-articular manifestations as well as other organ manifestations such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), which significantly contributes to morbidity and mortality in this disorder.</brief_summary>
