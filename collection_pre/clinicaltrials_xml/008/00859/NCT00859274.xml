	<brief_summary>It is generally accepted that symptoms and lung function are not sufficient ways to monitor asthma control. Therefore, several objective tests have been developed to help asthma control monitoring, each having their own shortcomings. We have developed a new test, the hypertonic saline cough challenge. In our previous publication this test has proven useful in diagnosing asthma. The present study is planned to investigate whether hypertonic saline cough challenge could be used to monitor asthma control. A group of steroid-naive asthmatics will be recruited. A treatment with inhaled budesonide is started. Asthma control is monitored at regular intervals utilising a validated questionnaire. At the same time points, hypertonic saline cough challenges will be performed. We will analyse whether changes in the responsiveness to the cough challenge reflects the changes in asthma control</brief_summary>
