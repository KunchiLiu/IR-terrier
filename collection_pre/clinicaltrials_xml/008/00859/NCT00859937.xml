	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well dasatinib works in treating patients with recurrent or metastatic malignant salivary gland tumors. Dasatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dasatinib in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Malignant Salivary Gland Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective response rate (complete and partial response) in patients with recurrent or metastatic c-KIT-expressing adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of the salivary gland treated with dasatinib. II. Determine the progression-free survival of these patients. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the duration of response in patients with non-ACC or c-KIT-expressing ACC of the salivary gland. II. Determine the stable disease rate and duration of stable disease in these patients. III. Determine the median survival of these patients. IV. Determine the overall survival of these patients. V. Determine the safety and tolerability of dasatinib in these patients. VI. Determine the progression-free survival of patients with non-ACC of the salivary gland. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Correlate biomarkers that relate to Src signal transduction with clinical response to dasatinib in patients with non-ACC or c-KIT-expressing ACC of the salivary gland. II. Determine if activating mutations in PDGFA and KIT are associated with response in patients with c-KIT-expressing ACC of the salivary gland. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts according to histologic subtype (adenoid cystic carcinoma [ACC] vs non-ACC). Patients receive oral dasatinib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Blood and tumor tissue samples are collected at baseline for correlative laboratory biomarker and pharmacogenomic studies. Samples are analyzed for total c-Src and phosphorylated Src expression by IHC; polymorphisms and gene rearrangements/activating mutations in PDGFA (within exons 18 and 12) and KIT (within exons 9, 11, 13, and 27) by PCR; and additional biomarkers associated with Src signal transduction and/or dasatinib response (e.g., phospho-KIT, phospho-PDGFR, EPHA2, VEGF, Stat3, Bcl-x, survivin, cyclin D1, and p27_Kip) by IHC. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 4 weeks.</detailed_description>
