	<brief_summary>Aromatase inhibitor therapy is in France the adjuvant reference treatment for postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer. This treatment induces bone loss and a higher risk of fractures. This study aimed to document the effect of bisphosphonate therapy in preventing bone loss and osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women with aromatase inhibitor treatment for breast cancer</brief_summary>
