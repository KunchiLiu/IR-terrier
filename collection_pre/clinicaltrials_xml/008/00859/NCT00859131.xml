	<criteria>Male and female patients between 18 and 75 years of age Male or female patients who are primary or repeat cadaveric, living unrelated or non Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) identical living related donor renal transplant recipients Female patients of child bearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within the past 48 hours prior to study inclusion. The patient has given written informed consent to participate in the study Patient has previously received or is receiving an organ transplant other than a kidney. Patients who are recipients of a multiple organ transplant. Patient has received a primary or retransplant from an HLAidentical living donor. Any positive crossmatch. Patient is the recipient of a pediatric donor kidney from a pediatric donor aged 8 years or less. Patient has received an ABO incompatible donor kidney. Recipient or donor is known to be seropositive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) or B virus (HBV) except for hepatitis B surface antibody positive. Recipient or donor is known to be seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Patient has uncontrolled concomitant infection or any other unstable medical condition that could interfere with the study objectives. Patients with thrombocytopenia (&lt;75,000/mm3 ), with an absolute neutrophil count of &lt; 1,000/mm3); and/or leucopoenia (&lt; 2,000/mm3), or anemia (hemoglobin &lt; 6 g/dL) prior to study inclusion. Patient is taking or has been taking an investigational drug in the 30 days prior to transplant. Patient has a known hypersensitivity to tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, rabbit antithymocyte globulin, daclizumab or corticosteroids. Patients with severe diarrhea or other gastrointestinal disorders that might interfere with their ability to absorb oral medication. Patients with a history of malignancy within the last five years, except for successfully excised squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin. Patient is pregnant or lactating, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by positive human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) laboratory test. Women of childbearing potential must use two reliable forms of contraception simultaneously, unless they are status post bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy. Effective contraception must be used before beginning study drug therapy, for the duration of the study and for 6 weeks following completion of the study. Patient has any form of substance abuse, psychiatric disorder or a condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, may invalidate communication with the investigator. Inability to cooperate or communicate with the investigator.</criteria>
