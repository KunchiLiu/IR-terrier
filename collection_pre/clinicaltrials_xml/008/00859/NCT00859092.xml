	<brief_summary>Swallowing dysfunction and delay of oral feeding skills in premature infants significantly delay discharge from the hospital. Thickening oral formula or breast milk feeds with commercial thickeners and rice cereal has been used in some nurseries with the goal of promoting development of adequate feeding skills. The objective of this pilot study is to examine the effect of thickened feeds on premature infants with oral feeding difficulties due to dysfunction secondary to immature swallowing. Hypotheses: - Thickened feeds will lead to a reduction in symptoms secondary to immature swallowing in 32-40 weeks gestational age infants when compared to non-thickened feeds - Thickened feeds will promote transition to hospital discharge.</brief_summary>
