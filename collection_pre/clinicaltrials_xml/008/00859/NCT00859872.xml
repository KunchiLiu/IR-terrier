	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Risperidone Oral Solution Combination Clonazepam Versus Haloperidol Intramuscular (IM) Injection for Treatment of Acute Psychotic Agitation in Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute psychotic agitation is a common problem in many patients with schizophrenia that includes agitation, aggression, excitement and violence. An investigation showed that about 26% psychotic patients were brought to the psychiatric emergency room because of the psychotic agitation symptoms. The primary objective is to compare the efficacy between risperidone oral solution combination clonazepam oral and haloperidol IM injection on controlling psychotic agitation in patients of acute schizophrenia and schizophrenic-affective disorder. The secondary objectives are: (1) to explore the possibility of decreasing efficacy of acute 6 weeks treatment from IM injection to oral; (2) to compare the safety between risperidone oral solution combination clonazepam oral and haloperidol IM injection.</detailed_description>
