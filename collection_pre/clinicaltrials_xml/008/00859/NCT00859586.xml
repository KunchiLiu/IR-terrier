	<brief_summary>Patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplantation for hematological malignancies who suffer a relapse of their disease post-transplant have limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. With the exception of patients with chronic leukemias who may achieve prolonged remissions after donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs), treatments using either chemotherapy or a DLI achieve less than a 10% median survival beyond 6 months. Most of these patients die of progressive leukemia, underlying the need for new therapeutic approaches. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched DLIs appear to possess a more potent graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect. However, when given after an HLA-mismatched transplant DLIs have a high risk of causing graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), which can be severe. To reduce the risk of GvHD, infusions of mismatched lymphocytes from an alternative donor may be used to avoid permanent engraftment and associated risk of GvHD. In this study, we propose to use a novel strategy to treat leukemias relapsing after HLA matched allogeneic stem cell transplantation by using haplo-identical DLIs to promote the associated antileukemic effect while minimizing the possibility of permanent engraftment and associated GvHD. To achieve only temporary engraftment and to promote disease control we will give fludarabine immunosuppression prior to the DLI. We anticipate the infusion of HLA-mismatched donor lymphocytes in this setting will produce no detectible engraftment or only temporary engraftment, but may result in a strong GvL effect regardless of engraftment outcome. We will select patients for this protocol who fall into the worst category for post-transplant relapse. Specifically, we will enroll patients with acute leukemia or MDS relapsing within 6 months of transplant, of which less than 5% survive beyond a year from relapse.</brief_summary>

We will select patients for this protocol who fall into the worst category for post-transplant relapse. Specifically, we will enroll patients with acute leukemia or MDS relapsing within 6 months of transplant, of which less than 5% survive beyond a year from relapse. The primary objective of this phase II clinical trial will be to evaluate the safety and efficacy of using a non-engraftment model and a lymphocytes infusion from a haplo-identical donor to treat relapsed disease following matched sibling stem cell transplantation in subjects who are not candidates for alternative treatment options. We therefore propose this is a phase II clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an infusion of unmanipulated lymphocytes from a haplo-identical donor in subjects with relapsed disease following matched sibling stem cell transplantation who are not candidates for alternative treatment options. The primary endpoint of this phase 2 study is survival at 6 month post-relapse of disease. Successful outcome of the study will be a survival of 100% greater than the National Heart Lung and Blood (NHLBI) historical 25% at 6-months. Secondary endpoints will include: incidence and severity of induced GvHD, proportion of DLI engraftment, peak chimerism, leukemia response at 21 days post DLI, residual leukemia measured by patient chimerism, leukemia free survival from date relapse, and safety of the mismatched DLI procedure.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Inclusion Criteria Recipient: 1. Diagnosed with one of the following hematological conditions: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) of any subtype or Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) of any subtype or Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) of any subtype or Blastic phase CML 2. Relapsed disease within 6 months of matched sibling allogeneic stem cell transplant procedure 3. Evaluation for protocol within 8 weeks of relapse and enrollment within 12 weeks or relapse 4. 875 years of age 5. Availability of previous HLA identical (6/6) related donor (ages 8 to 17 must have previously donated bone marrow [not peripheral blood] 6. At least one haploidentical (13 antigen mismatched) related donor available for apheresis Exclusion Criteria Recipient (any of the following): 1. Active grade IIIV GvHD 2. Extensive chronic GvHD 3. Posttransplant DLI from original donor within 1 month of protocol enrollment. 4. Progressive disease despite postrelapse chemo or monoclonal therapy. 5. Comorbidity of such severity that it would preclude the patient s ability to tolerate protocol therapy. 6. AST/SGOT greater than 10 x ULN (grade 3, CTCAE). 7.
