	<brief_summary>Fifty methamphetamine dependent treatment-seeking volunteers will be enrolled in this 10 week, double bind, placebo controlled, randomized clinical trial to receive either modafinil or placebo. Eligible subjects will reside at the Recovery Centers of Arkansas residential facility to achieve initial abstinence and be inducted onto study medication during wks 1-2. Then during wks 3-10, subjects participate on an outpatient basis, receiving weekly psychotherapy while continuing to receive study medications. Urine samples will be collected thrice weekly and self reports weekly to assess methamphetamine use. It is hoped that the results of this study will contribute to our understanding of which types of agents may be good candidates for further development as potential treatment agents for this disorder.</brief_summary>
