	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to determine the feasibility (as determined by lack of serious adverse events) and tolerability (as determined by patient's ability to complete the study) of a multimodal lung sparing regimen of surgery, interpleural and intravenous chemotherapy, and local P-32 irradiation for malignant pleural mesothelioma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trimodal Lung-Sparing Treatment of Pleural Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current surgical and/or chemotherapeutic approaches for malignant pleural mesothelioma are unsatisfactory and have not been shown to significantly prolong survival, and often lead to worsened pulmonary function and quality of life. We will investigate whether a prospective trial of trimodal (surgery, pleural chemotherapy, and pleural radiation) therapy can improve the overall 1 year survival in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. The proposed treatment will include exploratory thoracoscopy, placement of Mediport catheters into the pleural space, intraoperative chemotherapy, repeated intraperitoneal chemotherapy, and intrapleural instillation of radioactive P32 to radiate the pleural surfaces. In addition, because this study is randomized, half the patients will receive an additional three intravenous systemic chemotherapy treatments of cisplatin and pemetrexed (Alimta) in tandem with their intrapleural chemotherapy (weeks 3, 6, and 9 only). The potential significance of this research is that such treatment may render it less necessary to surgically remove the affected lungs in whole or in part, in order to achieve significant disease cytoreduction. We hope to alter the currently accepted paradigm that major lung surgery is an inescapable component of such treatment, and advance the concept that a combination of judicious preparative surgery, systemic chemotherapy, and locoregional drug treatment of the pleural surfaces may offer the best hope for prolongation of survival with intact lung function.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirmed malignant mesothelioma, &lt; 20% sarcomatoid type No radiographic or other imaging evidence of Stage IV (cardiac, mediastinal, peritoneal, other distant) disease. Ineligible for other high priority national or institutional study. Age &gt;18 years [to physiologic 75 years]. Life expectancy &gt; 3 months. Performance status, PS 02 [Karnofsky Performance Status, KPS=70100 %]. Prior therapy allowed (one prior systemic regimen) meeting the following parameters. No prior chest radiation therapy within 6 weeks of treatment No prior chemotherapy regimens within four weeks of treatment Non pregnant, nonlactating. (serum HCG test will be performed in patients in whom there is a possibility of pregnancy.) Required initial laboratory data/clinical parameters (see also Sec. 8.0) White cell count: &gt;3000/ul. Platelet count: &gt;100,000/ul. Creatinine clearance: â‰¥ 45 ml/min Bilirubin: &lt; 2 x ULN SGOT or SGPT: &lt; 2 x ULN Informed Consent: Each patient must be completely aware of the nature of his/her disease process and must willingly give consent after being informed of the procedure to be followed, the experimental nature of the therapy, alternatives, potential benefits, sideeffects, risks, and discomforts. No other coexistent malignancy. However, curatively treated or fully controlled solid tumors (other than mesothelioma) may be eligible if in the judgement of the PI, the benefit of treatment outweighs the risk. No serious medical or psychiatric illness preventing informed consent or intensive treatment (e.g., serious infection, congestive heart failure, angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia(s), or uncontrolled hypertension). HIV status or other severe illnesses will be assessed using medical records.</criteria>
