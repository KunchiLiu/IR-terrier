	<brief_summary>In previous in vitro studies it could be shown, that Dexpanthenol has an influence on the gene expression of fibroblasts. The genes which are influenced by Dexpanthenol play mainly a role during cell proliferating processes.The aim of this study is to investigate the molecular effect of Dexpanthenol on human living skin, during wound healing.</brief_summary>
