	<brief_title>Efficacy of GLP-1 Infusion in Comparison to an Insulin Infusion Protocol to Reach Normoglycemia Type 2 Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intervention studies in patients with acute myocardial infraction or cardiac surgery, using intravenously administered human insulin, suggest that normalization of hyperglycemia can reduce morbidity as well as mortality in these patients. Insulin-based regimens require frequent blood glucose measurements and adjustments of infusion rate to achieve normoglycemia. In addition, hypoglycaemia is a frequent and important side effect. Glucagon-Like-Peptide 1 (GLP-1) is an insulinotropic, glucagonostatic gastrointestinal hormone that lowers glucose in a glycemia-dependent manner and therefore does not cause hypoglycemia. The aim of our study was to compare for the first time efficacy and safety of intravenously administered GLP-1 with an established intravenous insulin regimen in hyperglycaemic type 2 diabetic patients.</detailed_description>
