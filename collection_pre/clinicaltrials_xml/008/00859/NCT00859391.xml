	<brief_title>Effects of Gluten Digestion With ALV003</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to compare the effects of gluten treated with ALV003 vs placebo: - The clinical response by symptom measurement before and after oral challenge - The immune response measured by ELISPOT testing and serology The secondary objective of the study is to - Describe the immunotoxic epitope profile of gluten digests with ALV003 compared with placebo</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 1875 years Well controlled Celiac Disease without flare in symptoms for the past 8 weeks History of biopsy proven Celiac Disease Able and willing to complete a symptom diary for 3 days prior and through 3 days post gluten challenge Been on a gluten free diet for 8 weeks prior to study entry Have normal celiac serology (anti tTG level of &lt;20 units/mL) Uncontrolled complications of celiac disease which in the opinion of the Investigator would impact their immune response, or pose an increased risk to the subject. (example: like type 1 diabetes or other autoimmune disease) Pregnant or breast feeding women, subjects of childbearing potential to use two methods of contraception Concomitant medications such as over the counter digestive enzymes, immunosuppressive therapies, anticoagulants, NSAIDs. Chronic medications for wellcontrolled chronic conditions are allowed.
