	<brief_summary>This study is a multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled, fully blinded, clinical trial of twice daily oral valacyclovir 500mg versus placebo with the goal of delaying the need for initiating HAART among HIV infected individuals who neither use nor require HAART, and who have not used chronic suppressive anti-HSV therapy for at least the 6 months prior to study initiation.</brief_summary>
