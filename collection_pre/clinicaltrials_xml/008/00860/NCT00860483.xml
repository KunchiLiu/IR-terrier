	<brief_summary>The purpose of the research is to determine how practicing laparoscopic motor tasks affects the functional anatomy of the brain, and to investigate whether there is a correlation between surgical experience and functional brain activition. Additionaly, the investigators plan to use eye-tracking technology to see if the use of this technology can distinguish surgeons of various skill levels. The investigators hope that this study leads to new and effective methods of training surgical residents. All of the data will be collected at The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, and may be used in future studies, which may or may not be related to urological diseases.</brief_summary>
