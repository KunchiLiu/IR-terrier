	<brief_title>Voluven® in Paediatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the past, human albumin has been widely accepted as the therapeutic "gold standard" in paediatric volume replacement therapy because of the physiological hypoproteinemia in newborns and infants. In adult patients, artificial colloids such as hydroxyethyl starch have replaced human albumin as first choice in many settings. This study will compare the clinical efficacy and safety of HES 130/0.4 (6%) in normal saline vs. HSA 50g/L in volume replacement therapy during elective open-heart surgery in paediatric patients. The hypothesis of this study is to demonstrate that HES 130/0.4 (6%) and HSA 50g/L are equivalent regarding efficacy and provide comparable safety during elective open-heart surgery in paediatric patients 2 to 12 years of age.</detailed_description>
