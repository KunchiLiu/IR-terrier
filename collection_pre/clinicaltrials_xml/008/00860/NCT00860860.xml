	<brief_summary>This study will investigate the toxicity, safety and pharmacokinetics of pretargeted radioimmunotherapy with anti-CEA x anti-hapten bispecific antibody TF2 and Lu-177-labeled di-HSG-DOTA peptide IMP-288. Furthermore, the sensitivity of pretargeted imaging with In-111-labeled IMP-288 as compared to standard methods of tumor detection, and the preliminary efficacy of the therapy.</brief_summary>
