	<brief_summary>Studies have shown that phytosterols will lower LDL cholesterol. Typical diets can contain between 250 to 500 mg of naturally-occurring phytosterols. Long-term studies with phytosterol-containing products(such as margarines) have not taken into account the amounts of naturally occurring phytosterols in the diet. This means that the effects of small amounts of natural dietary phytosterols on LDL cholesterol are not known. In this study, we will examine the effects of phytosterols across a range of levels. The information will likely be used to further support and possibly extend the current dietary recommendations for phytosterol use.</brief_summary>
