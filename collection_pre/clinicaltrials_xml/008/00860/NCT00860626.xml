	<brief_summary>For HBeAg(+) patients, interferon is used for 12 weeks. On 12th week of treatment, If HBV DNA is undetectable (&lt;1000 copies/ml), interferon is continued alone for one year. If HBV DNA is still positive, nucleoside analogue is added for 3 months. After nucleoside analogue is added for 3 months, HBV DNA is tested again. If negative, stop nucleoside analogue and use interferon alone for another 6 months or longer. If HBV DNA is still positive, change to another nucleoside analogue or add another nucleoside analogue.</brief_summary>
