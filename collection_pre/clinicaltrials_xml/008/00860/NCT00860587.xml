	<brief_summary>The objectives of the study were: 1. To study risk factors for colonization and infection with antibiotic resistant bacteria among patients with severe IAI before and after antibiotic treatment and surgical intervention. 2. To study species changes in the rectal flora among patients with severe IAI before and after antibiotic treatment and surgical intervention. 3. To review guidelines for antibiotic use in participating units. 4. To evaluate surgical antibiotic prophylaxis and treatment in relation to risk for colonization and infection with antibiotic resistant bacteria among patients with severe IAI 5. To use the results from the study in the process of a more appropriate use of antibiotics in participating units and care of patients with severe IAI. 6. To study the dynamics of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing and wild-type Enterobacteriaceae in patients with suspected severe intra abdominal infections before, during and after antibiotic treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In order to evaluate if standard empirical treatment was adequate in relation to resistance pattern among most prevalent species at admission we need another 70 patients to be included with at least data and cultures from admission.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with evidence of intraabdominal infections that require surgical intervention will be eligible. In addition will patients with intraabdominal abscess confirmed with CT/ultrasound be eligible, but not treated with surgical intervention if estimated to require at least 5 days antibiotic treatment, with a severity needing initial intravenous administration of antibiotics.
