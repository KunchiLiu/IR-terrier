	<brief_title>Immune Benefits of Coffee</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidemiological studies suggest that coffee consumption is associated with protective effects against several types of chronic diseases. Recent data have shown that certain coffee components may possess anti-inflammatory and immune-enhancing properties. Low-grade inflammation and poor capacity of immune response is highly prevalent in elderly subjects. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether coffee consumption improves immune and inflammatory status in healthy elderly subjects. To sort out the role of antioxidants, we will test 2 different soluble coffee, i.e. fully torrefied coffee and partially torrefied coffee.</detailed_description>
