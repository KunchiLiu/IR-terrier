	<brief_summary>This pilot feasibility study is assessing the safety and technical performance of the Neurostep™ System for the restoration of independent gait in subjects with gait disorder (i.e. foot drop) secondary to a CNS lesion (e.g. stroke).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Assessing the Feasibility of Treating Foot Drop With the Neurostep™ System.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Neurostep™ System is a neurostimulation investigational medical device. The entire system is designed to be implanted into the subject's leg via a surgical procedure, during which electrodes are attached to the peripheral nerves responsible for sensing and stimulating the proper muscles that lift the foot during normal walking.</detailed_description>
