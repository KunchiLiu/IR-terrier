	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Gathering information over time from patients receiving paclitaxel for cancer may help doctors learn more about pain caused by paclitaxel and plan the best treatment. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying acute pain caused by paclitaxel in patients with cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acute Pain Caused by Paclitaxel in Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To describe the incidence and characteristics of and change in pain related to paclitaxel infusions over several courses in patients receiving paclitaxel weekly or every 2-4 weeks with or without neurotoxic chemotherapy. - To investigate the association between paclitaxel-induced acute pain syndrome symptoms and eventual chemotherapy-induced neuropathy. - To perform exome-sequencing analysis and identify genetic variants that predict paclitaxel- induced peripheral neuropathy. - To identify clinical phenotypes associated with paclitaxel toxicity (i.e., acute pain syndrome and neuropathy). - To explore whether there are any evident differences between results seen in the majority Caucasian population and the minority populations. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are grouped according to paclitaxel dosing schedule (weekly vs every 2-4 weeks) and concurrent use of neurotoxic agent (yes vs no). Blood samples are collected at baseline for correlative laboratory studies, including genetic biomarker and polymorphism studies.</detailed_description>
