	<brief_summary>Major non-cardiac surgeries are common and major heart problems during or after such surgeries represent a large population health problem. Few treatments to prevent heart problems around the time of surgery have been tested. There is encouraging data suggesting that low-doses of Acetyl-Salicylic Acid (ASA) and Clonidine, which are two medications, given individually for a short period before and after major surgeries may prevent major heart problems.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The POISE-2 Pilot Trial will provide the essential remaining feasibility data that POISE-2 researchers require prior to conducting a large international study to test the effect of ASA and Clonidine in preventing major vascular complications during the first 30 days after surgery. The POISE-2 Pilot Trial is a factorial design randomized control trial that will compare ASA to placebo and clonidine to placebo. Patients in the POISE-2 pilot trial will be randomly assigned to one of four groups: ASA and Clonidine together, ASA and Clonidine placebo, ASA placebo and Clonidine, or a ASA placebo and Clonidine placebo. Two to four hours prior to surgery, eligible patients are given ASA study drug and Clonidine study drug orally (162mg ASA or its placebo and 0.2mg Clonidine or its placebo) and a patch to apply (0.2mg/day Clonidine or its placebo). The patch will remain in place for 72 hours after surgery. After the surgery, patients ingest one tablet a day (81mg ASA or its placebo) for 7 days if patient was were taking ASA chronically prior to surgery or for 30 days if they were not chronically taking ASA prior to surgery. Troponin measurements will be collected between 6 to 12 hours after the operation and on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd days after surgery. If blood tests reveal an elevation in the troponin measurement an electrocardiogram (ECG) will be undertaken immediately. Research personnel will follow patients until 30 days after surgery.</detailed_description>
