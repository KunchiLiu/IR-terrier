	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate that following eight weeks of treatment the FDC of telmisartan 80 mg plus amlodipine 10 mg (T80/A10) is superior as first line therapy in reducing mean seated trough cuff Systolic Blood Pressure [SBP] compared to the monotherapies of telmisartan 80 mg (T80) and amlodipine 10 mg (A10) in patients with severe hypertension. A key secondary objective is to identify the duration of treatment required to demonstrate the superiority of the FDC over both of the monotherapies.</brief_summary>
