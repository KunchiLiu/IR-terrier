	<brief_title>Acupuncture in Infantile Colic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infantile colic is a common problem. Both the baby and the parents are suffering and there is a risk that the early relationship is disturbed. There is no known treatment that is both effective and harmless. Acupuncture releases different neurotransmitters and hormones, gives pain reduction and affects digestion. Acupuncture in infantile colic has not been studied in a scientific way even though the method is used in many countries. In this randomised study we will investigate if acupuncture affects symptoms in infantile colic.</detailed_description>
