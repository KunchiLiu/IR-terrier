	<brief_title>P300 Brain Computer Interface Keyboard to Operate Assistive Technology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this research is to develop tools to help people who are paralyzed. These tools are called brain computer interfaces (BCIs). BCIs would let a person use brain signals to operate technology. The investigators want to make a BCI that can be used to operate commercially available technologies for communication, environmental control or computer access. The BCI would replace a keyboard to let people operate these technologies without moving. However, the investigators need people to test the BCI so that the investigators can see how well it can replace a keyboard. The investigators want to understand how well it can work so that the investigators can make it useful for people who are paralyzed. The investigators will ask people to use the BCI to do things like make a communication system speak or type words on a computer.</detailed_description>
