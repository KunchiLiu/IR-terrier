	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to compare cholesterol absorption and metabolism after feeding diets naturally low or high in phytosterols. All meals will be prepared in a metabolic kitchen and analyzed for phytosterols. In a randomized crossover design a group of up to 25 healthy subjects will consume diets containing either 100 mg/day or 600 mg/day phytosterols for 4 weeks. At the end of each dietary period percent cholesterol absorption, fecal cholesterol excretion and LDL cholesterol level will be measured. The hypothesis is that LDL cholesterol and cholesterol excretion will be improved on the high phytosterol diet even though macronutrient composition, mineral intake and fiber consumption are similar.</brief_summary>
