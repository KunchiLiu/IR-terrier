	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose escalation study of JVRS-100. The study will proceed in 2 stages to minimize the number of patients treated at doses substantially below the recommended phase 2 dose. In stage 1, an accelerated titration schema will be followed with one patient at each dose level. Stage 2 will commence after a dose limiting toxicity is observed in stage 1 or after the maximum dose for stage 1 is reached. Stage 2 will follow a modified Fibonacci schema with 3-6 subjects at each dose level until a recommended phase 2 dose is determined. The cohort will then be expanded to a maximum of 12 patients to more fully evaluate the recommended phase 2 dose.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose escalation study of JVRS-100. The study will proceed in 2 stages to minimize the number of patients treated at doses substantially below the recommended phase 2 dose. In stage 1, cohorts of three will be treated at each dose level however doses will be doubled from level to level. Stage 2 will commence after a dose limiting toxicity is observed in stage 1 or after the maximum dose for stage 1 is reached. Stage 2 will follow a modified Fibonacci schema with 3-6 subjects at each dose level until a recommended phase 2 dose is determined. The cohort will then be expanded to a maximum of 12 patients to more fully evaluate the recommended phase 2 dose. The Principal Investigator will assign dose level to be administered to all patients.</detailed_description>
