	<brief_summary>Recent studies suggest that HIV patients are at increased risk for cardiovascular events; however, the mechanisms underlying this increased risk remain unclear. Our group was one of the first to demonstrate that HIV infection is independently associated with accelerated atherosclerosis, as measured by carotid artery-intima media thickness (IMT), and that HIV-associated inflammation may be driving this accelerated atherosclerosis. The mechanism by which HIV disease independent of any drug-specific toxicity increases the risk of cardiovascular disease during HAART is not known. We hypothesize that even well controlled HIV infection is independently associated with cardiovascular risk and that further decreasing HIV-associated inflammation adding newer antiretroviral agents will also decrease cardiovascular risk. We will perform a small clinical trial of approximately 50 HIV-infected patients each to study the relationship between HIV infection, inflammation, thrombosis, atherogenic lipoproteins, and measures of atherosclerosis. We propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: To determine the influence of traditional and novel markers of inflammation on endothelial function and IMT progression; Aim 2: To determine if "intensification" with raltegravir in subjects on long-term antiretroviral therapy with clinically undetectable HIV RNA levels will improve endothelial function, and to determine if this effect is mediated by alterations in inflammatory markers, lipoproteins and/or thrombotic factors. For Aim 2, subjects from 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled raltegravir intensification studies will be asked to co-enroll in this cardiovascular study.</brief_summary>
