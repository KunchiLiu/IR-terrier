	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn more about how insulin resistance (inability to process glucose correctly resulting in mildly elevated glucose levels) affects the hormone ghrelin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ghrelin Regulation and Structure: Effect of Thiazolidinedione Therapy on Ghrelin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Insulin resistance suppresses fasting ghrelin levels and impairs postprandial ghrelin suppression. Improved insulin sensitivity with a thiazolidinedione will raise ghrelin levels, enhance meal-related suppression, but not change the ratio of total to active ghrelin or result in an alteration of ghrelin structure.</detailed_description>
