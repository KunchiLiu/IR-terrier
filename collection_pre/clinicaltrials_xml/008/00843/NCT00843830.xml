	<brief_summary>This study is being done to determine whether it is possible to use an investigational vaccine that consists of dendritic cells in patients with pancreas cancer. Dendritic cells are immune cells that are obtained from your blood that are important in the body's immune response to foreign substances. The vaccine would be injected directly into a tumor that has spread to the liver after a short course of radiation therapy has been given to that tumor. The study will try to determine if this treatment would be safe and effective in treating this cancer. This is a phase 1 pilot study of this treatment. Phase 1 trials test the best way to give a treatment where little is known about its possible risks or benefits. Phase 2 studies then test the possible benefits of a treatment and may show the specific situations where they are seen. Promising treatments are then tested in Phase 3 trials which compare the new treatment to standard treatment in a larger group of patients. Phase 4 trials are those conducted on a treatment after it has been approved for general use outside of research. A pilot study tests a treatment in a small number of patients to learn if and how the treatment could be tested in a larger group. Pilot studies can be performed at any phase but are commonly performed in the earliest phases of research on a treatment.</brief_summary>
