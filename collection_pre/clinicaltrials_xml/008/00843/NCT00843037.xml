	<brief_summary>This is an open-label phase II study of an investigational drug, sunitinib malate in patients with advanced malignant paraganglioma or phaeochromocytoma cancer. Paragangliomas (PGs) are tumours that arise from the para-sympathetic system in the head and neck and sympathetic system in the thorax and abdomen. Paragangliomas that secrete hormones (catecholamines) from the adrenal glands are called pheochromocytomas (PCs). In this study, patients whose disease has advanced or spread despite prior standard therapy, will receive sunitinib for 4-weeks followed by a 2-week rest period, for up to 12 months, in the absence of disease progression. Sunitinib is an investigational drug, which has been shown to shrink tumours in several tumour models. The study will evaluate the efficacy as well as the toxicity profile of sunitinib when used as an alternative treatment for patients with PG/PC tumours.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Of Sunitinib In Patients With Recurrent Paraganglioma/Pheochromocytoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be a single arm, open-label, phase II trial of sunitinib in patients with metastatic or locally advanced malignant paraganglioma or phaeochromocytoma. Oral sunitinib (50 mg) will be administered to all patients daily for the first four weeks of a six week study cycle, followed by a 2-week rest. Patients will be assessed for response to study treatment using MRI/CT scans as well as bio-chemical tests, and will receive the study treatment for up to 12 months or until disease progression. Primary study outcomes include: To assess the efficacy (response rate) of sunitinib given orally daily for 4 out of every 6 weeks in patients with advanced or metastatic paraganglioma/ pheochromocytoma. To assess the toxicity of sunitinib in patients with advanced or metastatic paraganglioma/ pheochromocytoma. To document effects of sunitinib on markers of biochemical activity of advanced or metastatic paraganglioma/ pheochromocytoma.</detailed_description>
