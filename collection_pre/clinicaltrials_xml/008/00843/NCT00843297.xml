	<brief_summary>Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) remains one of the major leading causes of death. Cognitive deficits are common in survivors of SCA. Postresuscitative mild induced hypothermia (MIH) lowers mortality and reduces neurologic damage after cardiac arrest. The investigators evaluated the efficacy and side effects of therapeutic hypothermia in an unselected group of patients after SCA.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>COOL-Trial: Outcome With Invasive and Non-invasive Cooling After Cardiac Arrest</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Consecutive patients with restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after resuscitation due to out-of-hospital SCA, admitted to our intensive care unit, underwent MIH. Hypothermia was induced by infusion of cold saline and whole-body-cooling methods (electronic randomization: invasive Coolgard or non-invasive ArcticSun). The core body temperature was operated at 32 to 34 Â°C over a period of 24 hours followed by active rewarming. Neurological status was evaluated at hospital discharge and 6 months after discharge using the Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Category (CPC). Blood samples of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) were collected during 72 hours.</detailed_description>
