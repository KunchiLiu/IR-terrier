	<brief_summary>Despite immediate symptomatic success after coronary bypass surgery in patients with coronary artery disease, this effect is not sustained over time since risk factors for coronary artery disease are still in place. The role of secondary prevention becomes increasingly important as it can potentially decrease or eliminate the need for another intervention in these high risk subjects. This project seeks to evaluate the effect of emphasizing secondary prevention measures in this patient population during hospital admission and through six months post-discharge.</brief_summary>
