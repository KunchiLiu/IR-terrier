	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial studies lenalidomide to see how well it works with or without epoetin alfa in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and anemia. Lenalidomide may stop the growth of myelodysplastic syndrome by blocking blood flow to the cells. Colony stimulating factors, such as epoetin alfa, may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood. It is not yet known whether lenalidomide is more effective with or without epoetin alfa in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and anemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide With or Without Epoetin Alfa in Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome and Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare the rate of major erythroid response (MER) between lenalidomide monotherapy and combined treatment of lenalidomide and epoetin alfa in erythropoietin non-responsive low-/intermediate-1 (Int-1)-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients or erythropoietin treatment naïve patients with low probability of erythropoietin benefit. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare the time to MER by treatment assignment. II. To evaluate the duration of MER by treatment assignment. III. To estimate the frequency of MER to salvage combination therapy in patients who fail to experience a MER with lenalidomide monotherapy. IV. To evaluate and compare the frequency of minor erythroid response by treatment assignment. V. To investigate the mechanism and target of lenalidomide action in patients with chromosome 5q31.1 deletion. VI. To evaluate the frequency of cytogenetic response and progression, and the relationship between cytogenetic pattern and erythroid response. VII. To evaluate the frequency of bone marrow response (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]). VIII. To evaluate the relationship between erythroid response and laboratory correlates outlined below: pretreatment and on study endogenous erythropoietin level (Arm A); to evaluate the effect of cluster of differentiation (CD)45 isoform profile on lenalidomide enhancement of erythropoietin-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A (STAT5) phosphorylation in CD71^Hi erythroid precursors and the relationship to erythroid response; to characterize molecular targets relevant to lenalidomide cytotoxicity in del5q31.1 cells; to evaluate the frequency of cryptic chromosome 5q31.1 deletions in patients with non-del5q31.1 MDS by array-based genomic scan, and to determine the relationship to hematologic response. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Patients with del 5q31.1 karyotype are assigned to Arm A. ARM A: Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. ARM B: Patients receive lenalidomide PO QD on days 1-21 and epoetin alfa subcutaneously (SC) once weekly. In both arms, treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses. Patients who achieve a major erythroid response (MER) may continue treatment beyond 4 courses in the absence of disease progression, disease conversion to acute myeloid leukemia, or unacceptable toxicity. Patients in Arm A who fail to achieve MER or who achieve MER but relapse after 16 weeks of treatment with lenalidomide may crossover and receive treatment in Arm B. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>NOTE: Results of the bone marrow biopsy and aspirate as well as cytogenetics are mandatory to register subjects onto study, which are indispensable to determine International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) category needed for eligibility; please note that it is not necessary to wait for the week 16, week 32, or week bone marrow and cytogenetic results prior to starting the next cycle unless deemed necessary by the treating physician; one example of this exception can include if the subject shows signs of progression, such as increased peripheral blood blast percentage; at that juncture, the treating physician may prefer to await the results prior to starting a new cycle; if a cycle is started, and based on the bone marrow results it is felt by the treating physician that the subject should not continue on treatment, please be sure to note this information on the case report forms at end of treatment Patient must have documented diagnosis of MDS lasting at least three months (MDS duration &gt;= 3 months) according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria or nonproliferative chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) (white blood cell [WBC] &lt; 12,000/mcL) Patient must have IPSS categories of low or intermediate1risk disease; patients must have IPSS score determined by cytogenetic analysis prior to randomization; patients must have cytogenetic analysis done (to calculate IPSS); if the current bone marrow biopsy is a dry tap, patients with cytogenetic failure and &lt; 10% marrow blasts will be eligible; subjects with cytogenetic failure must have previous cytogenetic results (fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH] is not a substitute) within the last 6 months post last type of MDS treatment (in this case, not referring to growth factors as type of MDS treatment) Must have symptomatic anemia untransfused with hemoglobin &lt; 9.5 g/dL =&lt; 8 weeks prior to randomization or with red blood cells (RBC) transfusion dependence (i.e., &gt;= 2 units/month) confirmed for =&lt; 8 weeks before randomization NOTE: For nontransfusion dependent patients (i.e., receiving &lt; 2 units/4 weeks x 8 weeks prestudy) who receive periodic transfusions, the mean 8 week pretransfusion hemoglobin should be used to determine protocol eligibility and response reference For nontransfusion dependent patients, a minimum of 2 pretransfusion or untransfused hemoglobin values are required Applies only for patients without the deletion 5q 31.1; patients must have failed treatment with an erythropoietic growth factor, or have a low probability of response to rhuerythropoietin; patients with low probability of response to rhuerythropoietin or prior erythropoietin failures are defined as follows: Prior erythropoietin failurerequires a minimum trial of &gt;= 40,000 units epoetin alfa/week x 8 weeks or equivalent dose of darbepoetin alfa for 8 weeks with failure to achieve transfusion independence in dependent patients or a failure to achieve a &gt;= 2 g rise in hemoglobin sustained for &gt;= 4 weeks in nontransfusion dependent patients Low erythropoietin response profilerhuerythropoietin and epoetin alfanaïve patients receiving &gt;= 2U packed (p)RBC/month for a minimum of 8 weeks, and serum erythropoietin &gt;
