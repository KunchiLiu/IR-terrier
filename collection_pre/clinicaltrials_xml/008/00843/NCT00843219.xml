	<brief_title>Motion Correction of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Data Using Amplitude Gating</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Routine PET/CT scans are taken while patients are breathing normally. The motions made by breathing can reduce the image quality of the scan. Minimizing the effects of this motion by taking the images and processing the scans differently may improve the image quality. The PET/CT Scan: If you agree to take part in this study, an elastic belt will be placed around your lower chest/upper abdomen before your routine PET/CT scan. This belt is used to track your breathing motion. This information will be used to help process the scan. Your PET/CT scan will be performed as usual. During the scan, researchers will focus on your lower chest/upper abdomen (areas that experience breathing motion). Having to focus on this area might extend the scan by up to 10 minutes. The additional scan time will not increase your radiation exposure since only PET scanning will be performed. Length of Study: Your participation on this study will be complete when your scheduled PET/CT scan is complete. This is an investigational study. The imaging focused on your lower chest/upper abdomen during the scan is investigational. Up to 26 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with lung or liver lesions measuring 0.52cm in diameter will be considered. 2. Patients that are scheduled to be imaged in the PET/CT suite at the Mays Building will only be considered. 1. Pediatric patients (younger than 18 years) will be excluded. 2. Patients that cannot tolerate being scanned for an additional 10 minutes with arms above their head will be excluded.</criteria>
