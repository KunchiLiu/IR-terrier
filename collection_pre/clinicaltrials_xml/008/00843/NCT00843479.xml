	<brief_summary>Like most endocrine axes, the entero-insular axis is expected to go through an age-related physiological deterioration, what might contribute to special features of the elderly onset type 2 diabetes in comparison to middle-age. Twenty four NGT volunteers will be evaluated by a meal tolerance test (MTT) for incretin hormone measurements, and by the hyperglycemic clamp followed by an arginine test for assessing the beta-cell function and the acute insulin response. Others parameters as body composition and basic biochemistry will be also evaluated at Laboratory of Investigation on Metabolism and Diabetes - LIMED / State university of Campinas, Brazil. The characterization of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) production, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) activity and/or endocrine pancreas incretin-response at aging, might be an interesting evidence to reinforce an incretin-based therapeutic approach for elderly onset type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
