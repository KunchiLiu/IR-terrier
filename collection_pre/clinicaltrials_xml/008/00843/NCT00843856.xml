	<brief_summary>Membranous nephropathy is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. It is difficult to treat and if persistent leads to end stage renal failure in a significant number of patients. It is currently treated in this institution with tacrolimus monotherapy. This is effective in the majority of patients in reducing proteinuria but the remissions are often partial and patients tend to relapse when the tacrolimus treatment is stopped. We propose to use mycophenolate mofetil in combination with tacrolimus with the aim of obtaining a more complete initial response to treatment, a decreased rate of relapse on withdrawal of therapy and less progression of renal failure. This will be a randomised control trial, patients will be randomised to receive treatment with tacrolimus alone (our current standard therapy)or treatment with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. Participants will receive treatment for up to 2 years and then be monitored for relapse of their nephrotic syndrome. Study Hypothesis: When mycophenolate mofetil is added to tacrolimus in the treatment of membranous glomerulonephritis it is likely to improve the initial response to treatment and reduce the risk of relapse on stopping therapy.</brief_summary>
