	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Conivaptan in Hyponatremic Patients With Symptomatic Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (ADHF)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be recruited from the Emergency Department. It is expected that subjects will be treated according to the institution's accepted conventional therapy protocol for the treatment of ADHF. Therapy may also include the use of loop diuretics for the relief of pulmonary congestion and maintenance of adequate urine output.</detailed_description>
