	<brief_summary>Medication-related non-adherence increases the risk of rejections and associated graft loss after solid organ transplantation. A randomized controlled intervention will use adherence enhancing strategies out of a larger sample of 300 heart transplant recipients. Non-Adherence will be assessed by patients' self-report and based on immunosuppression level. All non-adherent patients will be randomly designed to either intervention or control group. Multi-module interventions include patient education, electronic medication event monitoring, and a combined behavior and symptom management. Longitudinal follow-up is envisioned after initial intervention.</brief_summary>
