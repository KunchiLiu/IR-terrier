	<brief_summary>Metoprolol succinate is a beta1-selective beta-blocker, becoming non-selective at higher doses, while carvedilol is non-selective. We examined whether metoprolol remained beta1-selective compared to carvedilol during dose up-titration in Class C heart failure (HF) Beta-blocker naïve patients. METHODS: Twenty-five NYHA FC II-III HF patients were randomized to carvedilol or metoprolol. Patients were studied at baseline and after 2 weeks of up-titration (metoprolol at 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg daily; carvedilol IR at 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 mg and 50mg twice daily). Beta2- blockade was determined by an infusion of terbutaline at 6 mg/kg over 1 hour. Glucose and potassium levels were serially measured at baseline, every 15 minutes for the 1st hour and 30 minutes for 2nd hour post-infusion. The median area under the curve (AUC) for glucose and potassium changes were calculated.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients eligible for the study had objective evidence of systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction ≤40%), were &gt;18 years of age, and were on stable optimal medical heart failure therapy excluding the use of betablockers within the previous 30 days. . Patients were excluded for active viral myocarditis; hemodynamically significant valvular heart disease; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, peripartum cardiomyopathy; contraindications to betablockers (asthma or obstructive airway disease requiring scheduled bronchodilators or inhaled steroids), resting heart rate &lt;55; supine blood pressure &lt;85/50; second or third degree heart block); concomitant use of betaagonists, betaantagonists, or antiarrhythmics; unstable angina; myocardial infarction or bypass surgery within 3 months; or significant renal insufficiency (creatinine &gt;2.5 mg/dL), liver disease (transaminase levels &gt; 3 fold above laboratory normal), or anemia.</criteria>
