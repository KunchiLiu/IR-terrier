	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Giving low doses of chemotherapy before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It also stops the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving fludarabine together with busulfan and antithymocyte globulin followed by donor stem cell transplant and to see how well it works in treating patients with multiple myeloma that has not responded to treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fludarabine, Busulfan, Antithymocyte Globulin, and Donor Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma That Has Not Responded to Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To study the toxicity of reduced intensity conditioning comprising fludarabine phosphate, busulfan, and anti-thymocyte globulin followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with refractory or relapsed multiple myeloma. Secondary - To study the tumor response in these patients. - To study the incidence of acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease in these patients. - To study the incidence of infectious complications in these patients. - To study relapse- or progression-free and overall survival of these patients. - To study the biological mechanisms (i.e., taking graft, immunological recovery, antitumor activity, and chimerism). OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive reduced intensity conditioning comprising fludarabine IV on days -5 to -1, oral busulfan on days -4 and -3, and anti-thymocyte globulin IV on days -2 and -1. Patients undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation on day 0. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every month for 6 months and then every 3 months for 1Â½ years.</detailed_description>
