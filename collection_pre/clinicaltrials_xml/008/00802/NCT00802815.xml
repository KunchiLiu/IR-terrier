	<brief_summary>Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is the most common late onset acquired muscle disease. Patients develop progressive weakness that may result in the need for assistive devices including a wheelchair. IBM may be due to abnormal immune activation, due in part to overproduction of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Etanercept blocks the activity of TNF-alpha, thereby blunting immune overactivation. Previous unblinded studies and case reports suggest that etanercept may improve strength or slow the progressive weakness in IBM. We are conducting a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to test if Etanercept is beneficial in slowing the progressive weakness in patients with IBM.</brief_summary>
