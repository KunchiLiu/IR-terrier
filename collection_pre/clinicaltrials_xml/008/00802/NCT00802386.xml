	<brief_summary>A number of studies have shown a higher prevalence of BV among IUD users.13,,14 None, however, have screened women prior to inserting the IUD. No data exists detailing the status of the vaginal microflora and possible cervical infection prior to IUD insertion. Thus, no inference can be made about the possible influence of IUD insertion and presence to the development of upper genital tract infection . Consequently, with the current literature, it would be difficult to make an argument for screening and treatment for BV prior to IUD insertion. This study will help us determine whether women with an IUD develop a change in the normal bacteria that are present in the vagina, known as bacterial vaginosis (BV). In addition, in those women with BV, we are looking to see if they develop more significant problems with the IUD, than those who do not have BV. Overall, this will help us determine whether all women should be screened for BV prior to IUD insertion.</brief_summary>
