	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of an initial subthreshold retinal micropulselasercoagulation versus a single intravitreal 1.5mg bevacizumab injection in central serous choriretinopathy, as the micropulse will selectively treat the damaged RPE to induce reproliferation of healthy RPE cells, whereas the intravitreal injection should non-selectively stop the RPE leakage.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Versus Micropulse in Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate the clinical efficacy of an initial subthreshold retinal micropulselasercoagulation in twelve eyey per group versus a single intravitreal 1.5mg bevacizumab injection in central serous choriretinopathy, as the micropulse will selectively treat the damaged RPE to induce reproliferation of healthy RPE cells. BCVA in EDTRS score, OCT, and leakage in FLA, static perimetry of both groups will be correlated to a control group without treatment over 10 months.</detailed_description>
