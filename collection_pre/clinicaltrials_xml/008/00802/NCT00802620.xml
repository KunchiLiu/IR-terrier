	<brief_title>Amniotic Membrane Associated With Conjunctival Autograft Versus Conjunctival Autograft for Recurrent Pterygia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with recurrent pterygia without symblepharon were randomly assigned to undertake pterygium excision followed by amniotic membrane associated with a small conjunctival autograft (2x3mm) or conjunctival autograft (approximately 5x8mm) alone. The patients were examined after 1, 7, 30, 90, 180 and 360 days after the surgery. Recurrence was considered as a fibrovascular ingrowth of 1.5 mm or more beyond the limbus with conjunctival drag.</detailed_description>
