	<brief_summary>To compare the efficacy and safety of highly purified menotropin (Menopur®) with that of follitropin beta (FOLLISTIM®) in patients who are undergoing gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MENOPUR® Versus FOLLISTIM®</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter, randomized, open-label exploratory study will be performed in approximately 200 healthy females undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). Each study center will follow its study center standard practice for in vitro fertilization (IVF) within the study parameters as noted in this protocol. The study centers will use marketed products purchased from Schraft's Pharmacy for all phases of the study (down-regulation, stimulation, ovulation induction, and luteal support). Subjects will be randomly assigned prior to the start of stimulation to highly purified menotropin (Menopur®) or follitropin beta (Follistim Pen®) for stimulation and progesterone vaginal insert (Endometrin®) or progesterone in oil for luteal support. Subjects will return to the study center for regular scheduled clinic visits as required per in vitro fertilization (IVF) protocol at the site and at specified time periods during the cycle for estradiol (E2), progesterone (P4) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) tests, and first serum pregnancy test. All subjects will be required to complete a final study visit at completion of luteal support or negative serum pregnancy test following embryo transfer.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Premenopausal females between the ages of 18 and 42 years 2. Body mass index (BMI) of 1834 3. Early follicular phase (day 24) Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &lt;15 IU/L and Estradiol (E2) within normal limits 4. Documented history of infertility (e.g., unable to conceive for at least one year, or for 6 months for women &gt;38 years of age, or bilateral tubal occlusion or absence, or male factor but excluding severe male factor requiring invasive or surgical sperm retrieval. Donor sperm may be used.) 5. Transvaginal ultrasound at screening consistent with findings adequate for assisted reproductive technology (ART) with respect to uterus and adnexa 6. Signed informed consent 1. Gestational or surrogate carrier, donor oocyte 2. Presence of any clinically relevant systemic disease (e.g., insulindependent diabetes mellitus, uterine cancer) 3. Surgical or medical condition which, in the judgment of the Investigator or Sponsor, may interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the drugs to be used 4. Previous In vitro fertilization (IVF) or Assisted reproductive technology (ART) failure due to a poor response to gonadotropins. Poor response is defined as development of 2 mature follicles or history of &gt;2 previous failed in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles. 5. History of recurrent pregnancy loss (&gt;2). 6. Presence of abnormal uterine bleeding of undetermined origin 7. Current or recent substance abuse, including alcohol or smoking &gt;10 cigarettes per day 8. Refusal or inability to comply with the requirements of the Protocol for any reason, including scheduled clinic visits and laboratory tests 9. Participation in any experimental drug study within 30 days prior to Screening 10. Severe male factor requiring invasive or surgical sperm retrieval (e.g., microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration [MESA], testicular sperm extraction [TESE])</criteria>
