	<brief_summary>This study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of twice-daily oral dosing of 6R-BH4 to improve endothelial function, reduce systolic blood pressure and reduce arterial stiffness.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oral 6R-BH4 for the Treatment of Isolated Systolic Hypertension and Endothelial Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>By comparing values measured at different timepoints, the study is expected to provide insight regarding the ability of 6R-BH4, administered along with their currently prescribed antihypertension medications, to improve endothelial function, reduce SBP, and reduce arterial stiffness in patients with ISH and endothelial dysfunction</detailed_description>
