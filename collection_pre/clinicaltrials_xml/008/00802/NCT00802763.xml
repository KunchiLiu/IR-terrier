	<brief_summary>This study was designed to validate the color appearance on the newly developed panty liner (NORMA-SENSE). The NORMA-SENSE liner changes color when worn by the user and comes into contact with vaginal secretion with an elevated pH level, without false positives due to urine remains or incontinence. The study will also asses the physical comfort in using NORMA-SENSE and the result reading clarity which includes the ability to visualize and interpret the NORMA-SENSE strip results.</brief_summary>
