	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this proposal is to conduct a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial to examine whether or not treatment based on a person's direction-specific, impairment-based LBP classification is more effective than Non-specific treatment in improving short- (6 weeks) and long-term (6 and 12 months) outcomes in people with chronic LBP. We hypothesize that treatment based on a person's direction-specific, impairment-based LBP classification (Classification-specific) will result in better outcomes than Non-specific treatment. Our approach to classification-directed treatment is based on the proposal that a person's LBP is the result of adopting direction-specific strategies of movement and alignment of the spine which then are used repeatedly during the person's everyday activities. The exposure of spine tissue to repeated loading in the same direction across a day is proposed to accelerate the accumulation of stress, microtrauma, and eventually LBP. We also hypothesize that until the factors contributing to the use of the direction-specific strategies of the spine are modified, the LBP problem will persist or recur. Identification of homogeneous subgroups of people with LBP will enhance 1) the power of clinical trials, 2) prognosis, and 3) the ability to identify mechanisms contributing to different LBP problems.</brief_summary>
