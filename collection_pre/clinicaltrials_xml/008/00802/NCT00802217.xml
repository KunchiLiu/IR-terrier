	<brief_title>Oral Civamide Safety, Tolerability First in Human Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, non-randomized pharmacokinetic study of two dosage strengths of oral Civamide. The study consists of a Screening Period (Days -21 to Day -2), an Admittance Period, A 4 Day in-house Treatment Period(Days 1-4))and a follow-up Visit on Day 7. Pharmacokinetics will be assessed at specified timepoints relative to dosing on Day 1 during the in-house stay. Subjects will be discharged from the research unit following the 72 hr blood draw. Subjects will return to the research unit on Day 7 for a follow-up safety assessment.</detailed_description>
