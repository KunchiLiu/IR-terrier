	<brief_summary>Patients undergoing surgery of the hand often are treated with a nerve block in the shoulder/neck area that provides anesthesia/numbing during surgery. Nerve blocks usually last for a few hours after surgery and provide pain relief for this period. It may be possible to extend the duration of anesthesia by using a steroid, which has anti-inflammtory properties. This study will compare the duration of the nerve block when dexamethasone (steroid) is added to the anesthetic injected around the nerve.</brief_summary>
