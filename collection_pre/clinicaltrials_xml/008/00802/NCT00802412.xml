	<brief_title>Topiramate to Aid Smoking Cessation in Alcohol Dependent Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to test the efficacy of topiramate versus placebo as an aid to smoking cessation for recovering alcohol dependent men. Another aim of the study is to explore whether or not topiramate reduces relapse to alcohol use in patients with comorbid alcohol and nicotine dependence. All participants will receive a standardized psychosocial intervention in combination with the medication (or placebo). Following completion of the treatment phase of the study, participants will enter a 24-week follow-up period during which the longer-term outcome of the intervention will be assessed.</detailed_description>
