	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to report the treatment effect and safety of combined intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) with verteporfin using a reduced (RF) light fluence rate, in choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to pathologic myopia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravitreal Bevacizumab and Low Fluence Photodynamic Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this retrospective interventional case series, 16 patients with myopic CNV were included. All patients were treated with 1.25 mg of intravitreal bevacizumab followed by RF-PDT (25 J/cmÂ²), 2 days later. All patients were previously treated with IVB monotherapy and active leaking of CNV occurred 90 to 120 days after the treatment. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA-ETDRS), foveal thickness (FT) on optical coherence tomography (OCT), and fluorescein and indocyanine green angiographic (FA; ICG) findings were recorded. Follow-up evaluations were carried out for 12 months.</detailed_description>
