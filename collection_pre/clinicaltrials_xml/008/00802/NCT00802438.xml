Safety laboratory assessments within normal ranges (labs to include complete blood count with differential, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, Prothrombin time, Partial Thromboplastin Time, and platelet count) Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test (urine HCG) within 48 hours of the methacholine challenge at Visit 2 and agree to use a reliable method of birth control for the duration of the study (reliable methods of birth control can include abstinence, barrier methods, oral contraceptives, injection contraceptives or skin absorption contraceptives).
