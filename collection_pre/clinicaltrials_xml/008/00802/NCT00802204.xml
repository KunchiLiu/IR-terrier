	<brief_summary>Obese individuals have fewer striatal dopamine type 2 receptors (DRD2) than normal weight individuals. Lower DRD2 levels are associated with addiction and a decreased sense of pleasure.Obesity is also associated with insulin resistance (poor insulin action).We propose that insulin resistance and low DRD2 are associated. Using PET imaging,we aim to determine DRD2 binding potential (BP) in the brain is associated with insulin resistance and neuroendocrine hormone levels. Obese participants will be compared to lean, gender and age similar participants. We also aim to determine the effect of caloric restriction on DRD2 BP in obese subjects</brief_summary>
