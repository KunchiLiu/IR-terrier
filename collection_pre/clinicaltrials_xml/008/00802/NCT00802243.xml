	<brief_summary>Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most common blistering auto-immune disease of skin with an incidence estimated to 400 new cases per year. Topical corticosteroid therapy is considered the standard treatment for bullous pemphigoïd in 2002. Topical corticosteroid requires an initial large hospitalization during the acute phase and rehospitalization during relapse. The usefulness of immunosuppressive drugs have suggested by uncontrolled study. In this way, leflunomide could be an alternative therapy, and to reduce relapse and/or resistance risks. This study could prove the efficacity of leflunomide, associated with short time topical corticosteroids.</brief_summary>
