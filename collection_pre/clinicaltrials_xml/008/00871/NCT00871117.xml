	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of Kinrix when co-administered with varicella (Varivax® [varicella virus vaccine live], Merck and Company) and (measles mumps rubella) MMR vaccines, compared to Kinrix co-administered with MMR vaccine alone. Both Kinrix and the second dose of Varivax are indicated in children 4-6 years of age, and there is great potential for the vaccines to be given concurrently. The aim of this trial is to demonstrate that co-administered Varivax does not negatively affect the immunogenicity or reactogenicity of Kinrix.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunogenicity and Safety of Kinrix + (Measles Mumps Rubella) MMR Vaccine With and Without Varicella Vaccine in Healthy Children 4-6 Years</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects 4-6 years of age will be randomized into two groups to receive either Kinrix, Varivax and M-M-RII on day 0 (Group 1) or Kinrix and M-M-RII on day 0 and Varivax at month 1(Group 2). All subjects in both groups to provide blood samples prior to vaccination on day 0 and at month 1 (for Group 2, blood sampling is prior to vaccination with Varivax). Duration of the study will be approximately 6 months for each subject with a safety telephone contact 6 months after vaccinations.</detailed_description>
