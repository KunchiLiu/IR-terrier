	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate extent, location, and perception of paresthesia as a function of anode/cathode configuration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimized Programming in Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The clinical results from this study may help to validate predictions made by mathematical models of neurons that are activated by SCS and increase scientific knowledge about the way in which different programs relate to satisfactory outcomes, such that use of the model may help in the development of new products.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Be previously implanted with Precision SCS System (336 months post permanent implant) having 2 parallel percutaneous leads placed between T8T10. Be implanted with Precision SCS System for the treatment of neuropathic pain of trunk and/or limbs Be 18 years of age or older Be extremely satisfied, very satisfied, or satisfied with SCS therapy for treatment of pain condition Be able to use pen tablet to document regions of paresthesia and pain Be able to lie in the supine position for 45 minutes at a minimum Be able to verbally report qualitative and quantitative aspects of paresthesia sensations. Have a paresthesia threshold on a standard program below 4mA while in the supine position Have at minimum the upper contact of one lead below T8 and the lower contact above T11 vertebral levels Be willing and able to comply with studyrelated procedure Agree to study requirements and provides written Informed Consent Unable to read, write, speak, and understand English Currently pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the course of the study Have negative finding in any of the prescreening and screening requirements Upon fluoroscopy, location of both leads is identified to be outside T8T10 vertebral levels Unable to perceive the sensation of paresthesia associated with stimulation in the trunk and/or lower extremities Have a drug pump and/or a nonPrecision neurostimulation device (regardless of whether active or inactive) Have had any interventional pain procedure or surgeries (including Interlaminar epidural steroid injection, Transforaminal epidural steroid injection, Caudal epidural steroid injection, Selective nerve root block, Intraarticular lumbar facet injection, Sacroiliac joint injection, Piriformis muscle injection, Trochanteric bursa injection, Hip/knee joint injections, Medial branch block (innervates facet joint), Pulsed radiofrequency neurotomy medial branches, Pulsed radiofrequency dorsal root ganglion, Thermal (high temperature) radiofrequency neurotomy medial branches, Trigger point injections, and Botulinum toxin injections) involving the spine within the past 30 days Have any condition that is likely to confound evaluation of study endpoints. Conditions that may make paresthesia coverage variable over the course of the study include multiple sclerosis, partial spinal cord injury, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, scoliosis, deafferentation, etc.</criteria>
