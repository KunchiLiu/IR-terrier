	<brief_summary>Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) is used as a measure of the body's ability to produce growth hormone. Growth hormone is important for muscle tissue as well as many other tissues in the body. Growth hormone (GH) and IGF-I have been shown to be reduced in many persons with SCI. Baclofen is a FDA approved drug that is used to treat spasticity. Persons receiving long-term baclofen therapy have been demonstrated to have increased growth hormone and IGF-I levels. IGF-I levels will be determined before and after treatment with baclofen. In this study, the investigators will determine the minimum dose of baclofen at which improvements in GH and IGF-1 levels occur.</brief_summary>
