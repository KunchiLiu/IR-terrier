	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to determine whether or not computed tomography (CT) scans performed on patients with symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) but without any physical signs of the disease will (1) prove to be less expensive in the treatment and evaluation as compared to current practices, (2) avoid the use of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions, and (3) provide a more efficient way to diagnose conditions in patients who have had CRS ruled out as a cause. The investigators hypothesize that current guidelines, when applied to subjects with symptoms of CRS in the absence of physical signs may be associated with (1) increased unnecessary prescription of antibiotics, (2) delay in further essential workup, and (3) increased overall health care costs.</brief_summary>
