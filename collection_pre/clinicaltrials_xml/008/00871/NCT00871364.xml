	<criteria>Healthy adult male or female volunteers, 1855 years of age. Weighing at least 60 kg for males and 52 kg for females and within 15% of their ideal weights (Table of "Desirable Weights of Adults", Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, 1983). Medically healthy subjects with clinically normal laboratory profiles, vital signs and ECGs. Females of childbearing potential were either sexually inactive (abstinent) for 14 days prior to the first dose, throughout the study and for 6 days following the last dose or were using one of the following acceptable birth control methods: surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy) 6 months minimum; IUD in place for at least 3 months; barrier methods (condom, diaphragm) with spermicide for at least 14 days prior to the first dose, throughout the study and for 6 days following the last dose; surgical sterilization of the partner (vasectomy for 6 months minimum); hormonal contraceptives for at least 3 months prior to the first dose of the study and up to 6 days following the last dose. Other birth control methods may have been deemed acceptable. Postmenopausal women with amenorrhea for at least 2 years were eligible. Gave voluntary written informed consent to participate in the study. History or presence of significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, haematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, neurologic, or psychiatric disease. In addition, history or presence of: alcoholism or drug abuse within the past year; hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to venlafaxine or other selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors; glaucoma. Female subjects who were pregnant or lactating. Subjects who tested positive at screening for HIV, HbsAg or HCV. Subjects who received monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors within 28 days prior to dosing. Subjects who used any drugs or substances known to be strong inhibitors of CYP enzymes (formerly known as P450 enzymes) within 10 days prior to the first dose. Subjects who used any drugs or substances known to be strong inducers of CYP enzymes (formerly known as P450 enzymes) within 28 days prior to the first dose. Subjects who donated 50 to 499 mL of blood within 30 days and more than 499 mL within 56 days prior to the first dose. Subjects who, through completion of the study, would have donated in excess of: 500 mL of blood in 14 days; or 1500 mL of blood in 180 days; or 2500 mL of blood in 1 year. Subjects whose PR interval is &gt;200 msec at screening and prior to dosing. Subjects whose QTc interval is &gt;450 msec at screening and prior to dosing. Subjects who completed another clinical trial within 28 days prior to the first dose. Subjects who were on a special diet (for whatever reason) during the 28 days prior to the first dose and throughout the study.</criteria>
