	<criteria>Age &gt;=18 years, either sex, any race. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0, 1, or 2. There must be no known standard therapy, or disease must be refractory to standard therapy Adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic organ function and laboratory parameters For advanced solid tumors, nonHodgkin's lymphoma, or multiple myeloma: Participants must have histologically proven solid tumors, nonHodgkin's lymphoma, or multiple myeloma. Evaluable malignancy must be present by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, obtained within 4 weeks prior to the start of treatment with SCH 727965. Subjects with multiple myeloma must have measurable disease defined as: Serum monoclonal protein greater than 0.5 g/dL or urine light chain excretion of greater than 0.2 g/24hour obtained within 4 weeks prior to the start of treatment. Participants with lower M protein values or nonsecretory myeloma are eligible if measurable disease can be established within 4 weeks prior to start of treatment, such as: serum free light chain ratio greater than 5 times the normal ratio limit; and/or measurable soft tissue plasmacytoma greater than 2 cm, by either physical examination and/or applicable radiographs; and/or bone marrow involvement greater than 30%. For Bcell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (BCLL): Diagnosis of BCLL according to the National Cancer Institute Working Group (NCIWG) criteria or a histological diagnosis of small lymphocytic lymphoma. Disease must be evaluable according to NCIWG response criteria. Symptomatic brain metastases or primary central nervous system malignancy. Previous radiation therapy to &gt;25% of the total bone marrow. Previous treatment with SCH 727965. Known HIV infection.</criteria>
