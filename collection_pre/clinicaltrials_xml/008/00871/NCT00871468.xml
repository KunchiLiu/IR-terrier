	<brief_summary>The anterior-inferior clavicle plate position will have a lower rate of soft tissue irritation that limits activity and/or requires hardware removal compared to superior plate position.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Plating Clavicle Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Compare the rates of soft-tissue irritation with two different methods of plating for clavicle fractures. Patients will be randomized to anterior-inferior or superior plating. Validated shoulder scoring systems will be used to assess outcome. Specific follow-up questions will address the patient's ability to wear his/her uniform, body armor, ruck sack, and other shoulder-borne equipment over the surgical site.</detailed_description>
