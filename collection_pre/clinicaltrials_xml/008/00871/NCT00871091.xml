	<brief_summary>In orthodontics, conventional fixed appliances, usually consisting of prefabricated components, require step-by-step adjustment in order to move teeth in the planned direction. May treatment be improved with customized archwires? Study hypotheses: - By using CAD/CAM in planning and fabrication of customized archwires, unnecessary tooth movements can be avoided and teeth can be moved on their direct path to the intended position. - The application of CAD/CAM improves reproducibility, efficiency, and quality of orthodontic treatment.</brief_summary>
