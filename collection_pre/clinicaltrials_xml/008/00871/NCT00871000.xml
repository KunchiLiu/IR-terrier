	<brief_summary>This phase 3b study will compare the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of the dTpa-IPV vaccine to that of a DTPa-IPV vaccine when administered as a booster dose in healthy children 5-6 years of age who have received three primary vaccination doses of DTPa-based vaccine according to the "3-5-11" month schedule recommended in Italy. In this study, MMRV vaccine will also be co-administered to all children.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>A male or female child of 5 and 6 years of age at the time of vaccination. Subjects who received a complete 3dose vaccination with a DTPabased combined vaccine according to a 3511 month schedule in line with recommendations in Italy. Subjects who received a first dose of a live attenuated measlesmumpsrubella vaccine in the second year of life, in line with recommendations in Italy. Subjects who the investigator believes that their parents/guardians can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol should be enrolled in the study. Written informed consent obtained from the parent or guardian of the subject. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product other than the study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the booster vaccine dose. Administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 30 days prior to vaccination, or planned administration during the study period. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational product. Previous booster vaccination against tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis and/or poliomyelitis since vaccination in the first two years of life. Previous measles, mumps, rubella and/or varicella second dose vaccination. Known history of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, rubella and/or varicella disease. Known exposure to measles, mumps, rubella and/or varicella within 30 days prior to study start. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficiency condition, based on medical history and physical examination. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine. Administration of immunoglobulin and/or any blood products within the three months preceding vaccination or planned administration during the study period. Occurrence of transient thrombocytopenia or neurological complications following an earlier immunisation against diphtheria and/or tetanus. Occurrence of any of the following adverse events after a previous administration of a DTP vaccine: Hypersensitivity reaction to any component of the vaccine; Encephalopathy of unknown aetiology occurring within 7 days following previous vaccination with pertussiscontaining vaccine; Fever &gt;= 40°C within 48 hours of vaccination, not due to another identifiable cause; Collapse or shocklike state within 48 hours of vaccination; Convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of vaccination. Residence in the same household as a person high risk for varicella The following condition is temporary or selflimiting, and a subject may be vaccinated once the condition has resolved if no other exclusion criteria is met: Current febrile illness or axillary temperature ≥ 38.5 ºC or other moderate to severe illness within 24 hours of study vaccine administration.</criteria>
