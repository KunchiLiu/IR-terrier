	<brief_summary>The aim of the research is to determine if Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) specific for BDD is more effective than a credible non-specific form of CBT for treating BDD and its delusional variant in adults aged 17 or over. This will be done in a single centre randomised controlled trial that compares specific CBT for BDD versus non-specific CBT over 12 weeks. The hypotheses to be tested are that: (1) specific CBT for BDD will be more effective than non-specific CBT at 12 weeks (2) Treatment effects from Specific CBT will be maintained at 1 month follow up. The main study end-point is at 12 weeks and the secondary end-point is at 1 month follow up. A secondary aim is to explore whether delusionality (insight) as measured by the Brown Assessment of Beliefs and co-morbid depressed mood predicts response to treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>BDD is the main psychological problem. We will use DSMIV criteria as BDD does not exist as a separate diagnosis in ICD10. They may have an additional diagnosis of Delusional Disorder when it refers to beliefs about being ugly or defective. They must have a total of 24 or more on the twelveitem YBOCS modified for BDD (Phillips et al., 1997). They may be of either gender but must be 17 years or above. They are willing to travel to the treatment centre for weekly sessions. They are wiling to complete regular questionnaires and be audiotaped for supervision and for listening to enhance their learning. They may be taking psychotropic medication so long as it is stabilised and there are no plans to increase the dose. They have a current or past diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder. They have current suicidal intent or severe selfneglect that requires hospitalisation. They have a current alcohol or substance dependence or anorexia nervosa or borderline personality disorder that requires treatment in its own right. They are currently receiving any other form of psychotherapy, They have received CBT for BDD in the past 6 months, which is judged as competently delivered and did not respond. They cannot speak sufficient English for CBT. (Assistance will be provided for those who speak English but are unable to read questionnaires).</criteria>
