	<brief_summary>This study is designed to investigate factors that are associated with prolonged recovery from mild head injury. The investigators are particularly interested in defining the impact of anxiety related variables, such as health anxiety and anxiety sensitivity in the maintenance of symptoms. A further goal of the study is the evaluation of two treatment methods that have been proposed to be effective in reducing the impact of post concussion symptoms. The investigators hypothesize that a treatment which is directly focused on changing these anxiety related variables will be more effective than one that does not.</brief_summary>
