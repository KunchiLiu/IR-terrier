	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of atorvastatin 10 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg coadministration in Japanese participants with hypercholesterolemia whose low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels have not reached the lipid management target value with atorvastatin 10 mg alone, versus increasing the dose of atorvastatin to 20 mg or changing to rosuvastatin 2.5 mg.</brief_summary>
