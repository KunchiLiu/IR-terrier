	<brief_summary>Participants will be randomized to SCH 727965 or a comparator drug (bortezomib for mantle cell lymphoma [MCL] or alemtuzumab for B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia [B CLL]). Part 1 of the study will determine the activity of SCH 727965 treatment in participants with MCL and participants with B-CLL. Part 2 of the study will determine the activity of SCH 727965 treatment in participants who experienced disease progression after standard treatment with the comparator drug during Part 1.</brief_summary>
