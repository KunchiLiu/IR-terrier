	<brief_summary>To evaluate the feasibility, safety and tolerability of aerosolized lucinactant delivered by nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) for the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in premature infants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Study of Aerosolized Surfaxin in the Prevention of Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) in Premature Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Use of a device in the early treatment of RDS that permits the effective aerosolization of an exogenous surfactant that also allows for the simultaneous delivery of continuous positive airway pressure would permit the delivery of surfactant to the distal airways without intubation. This approach could reduce the frequency of severity of the adverse events relative to endotracheal intubation and surfactant administration via bolus.</detailed_description>
