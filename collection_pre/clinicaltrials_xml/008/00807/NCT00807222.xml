	<brief_title>Effect of Vyvanse on Sleep in Children Aged 6-12 Years With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment with psychostimulants has been associated with sleep disturbances, including both sleep onset and maintenance problems, in children with ADHD. This analysis evaluated the effect of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) on sleep in children with ADHD. This single center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial enrolled children aged 6-12 years with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of ADHD. The study included a screening period, 1-week washout, 3-week open-label LDX dose optimization phase, and a 4-week double-blind treatment phase in which subjects were randomized to placebo or active LDX treatment at 30, 50, or 70 mg/d. Polysomnograph and actigraph measures as well as assessments of subjective sleep parameters were performed in all subjects prior to treatment and reassessed after treatment with either LDX or placebo.</detailed_description>
