	<brief_title>A Comparison of Three Medications to Treat Diarrhea in Adults.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single (investigator) blind, randomized, 3-arm, parallel-group study design was selected to show non-inferiority of loperamide/simeticone caplets compared to chewable tablets in a heterogeneous subject population aiming at validity of results and reducing bias. The study will also compare the loperamide/simeticone combinations versus a probiotic (Saccharomyces boulardii) in the treatment of acute diarrhea in adults. Probiotics have been used for acute infectious diarrhea to reduce the duration and severity of the illness.</detailed_description>
