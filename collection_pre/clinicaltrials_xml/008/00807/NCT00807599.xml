	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effects, good and bad, of two ways to treat patients with standard-risk symptomatic multiple myeloma. Patients with standard-risk myeloma have myeloma with specific features: levels of 2 blood tests have to be in a specific range and there can be no myeloma tumors found outside of the bones or bone marrow, the areas where myeloma is usually discovered. In past clinical studies, patients with standard-risk myeloma have done well with intensive therapy in the form of stem cell transplant. But multiple myeloma is not curable and, although it may respond to standard treatments including stem cell transplant, myeloma always recurs.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 and ≤ 75 Histologic and serologic findings from MSKCC confirming the diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Standard diagnostic criteria for multiple myeloma will be used, as per the revised International Myeloma Working Group diagnostic criteria. Patients must have symptomatic multiple myeloma without advanced organ damage (such as multiple fractures or advanced bone disease causing immobilization, renal failure, spinal cord compression, or organ compromise due to soft tissue plasmacytoma). If immediate therapy with radiation and highdose steroids (eg, for cord compression) or with bortezomibbased therapy (eg, for renal failure) is required, the patient is not eligible for this trial. Patients may have received 1 cycle of prior therapy with dexamethasone for multiple myeloma. Adequate organ function is required, defined as follows: ANC ≥ 1,500/μl and platelets ≥ 100,000/μl (unless low ANC and platelets are due to multiple myeloma) Serum bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dl AST, ALT and alkaline phosphatase &lt; 3 times the upper limit of laboratory normal Adequate renal function as assessed by calculated creatinine using CockcroftGault estimation of CrCl (see Appendix I): Subjects must have calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 30ml/min by CockcroftGault formula Performance status (ECOG) ≤ 2 (Appendix E). Eligible for SCT with LVEF ≥ 50% by MUGA or ECHO, and diffusing capacity &gt; 50% predicted by pulmonary function testing Ability to understand the investigational nature of this study and to give informed consent All study participants must be registered into the mandatory Revlimid REMS® program, and be willing and able to comply with the requirements the of Revlimid REMS® program Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)† must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL within 10 14 days prior to and again within 24 hours prior to prescribing lenalidomide for cycle 1 (prescriptions must be filled within 7 days) and must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth control, one highly effective method and one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28 days before she starts taking lenalidomide. FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing. Men must agree not to father a child and agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with females of child bearing potential even if they have had a successful vasectomy. See Appendix C: Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and Acceptable Birth Control Methods. Able to take aspirin 325mg or 81mg daily as prophylactic anticoagulation (patients intolerant to ASA may use Coumadin or low molecular weight heparin). Prior treatment for myeloma except for one cycle of dexamethasone History of thromboembolic disease within the past 6 months regardless of anticoagulation Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment, or New York Hospital Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure (see APPENDIX F), uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities. Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded due to the potential teratogenicity of lenalidomide. Concurrent active malignancy other than nonmelanoma skin cancers or carcinomainsitu of the cervix, or presence of myelodysplastic or myeloproliferative disease. Patients with prior malignancies with a diseasefree interval of ≥ 5 years are eligible. Patients who have had prior malignancies within the past 5 years but are considered to be "cured" with a low likelihood of recurrence may be eligible at the discretion of the Principal Investigator. Active hepatitis B or C infection HIV 1 or 2 positivity Any other medical condition or laboratory evaluation that, in the treating physician's or principal investigator's opinion, makes the patient unsuitable to participate in this clinical trial</criteria>
