	<brief_summary>The study aims to evaluate maintenance of lingual/palatinal marginal bone with the (ASTRA TECH Implant System) OsseoSpeedâ„¢ Profile implant in sites where the alveolar crest anatomy is sloped in a lingual to buccal direction. The hypothesis is that the sloped marginal contour of the implant will help preserve the lingual/palatinal marginal bone.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Provision of informed consent Aged 1870 years at enrolment A lingualbuccal difference in bone height between 2.05.0 mm at the implant site History of edentulism in the study area of at least 3 months Presence of alveolar bone crest dimensions judged by the investigator to allow &gt;1mm of bone circumferential to the implant after implant placement. In need for a single implant replacing a missing tooth in any location with an adjacent natural tooth mesially, and an adjacent natural tooth or edentulous space distally to the planned implant position (i.e. no existing or planned implant adjacent to the planned study implant position) Deemed by the investigator as likely to present an initially stable implant situation Uncontrolled pathological processes in the oral cavity Known or suspected current malignancy History of radiation therapy in the head and neck region History of chemotherapy within 5 years prior to surgery Systemic or local disease or condition that would compromise postoperative healing and/or osseointegration Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus Corticosteroids or any other medication that would compromise postoperative healing and/or osseointegration Smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day Present alcohol and/or drug abuse Current need for bone grafting in the planned implant area Previous enrolment in the present study Simultaneous participation in another clinical study or participation in a clinical study during the last 6 months Involvement in the planning and conduct of the study (applies to both Astra Tech staff or staff at the study site) Unlikely to be able to comply with study procedures, as judged by the investigator</criteria>
