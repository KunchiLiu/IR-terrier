	<brief_summary>A clinical study to investigate the maximum tolerated dose of Vandetanib and concurrent WBRT in patients with NSCLC and brain metastases. All patients will receive WBRT, 10 fractions of 3 Gy. Patients will start 7 days prior to start of radiation treatment with Vandetanib. Total treatment time with Vandetanib is 3 weeks (21 days). Patients will have the opportunity to continue Vandetanib until progression at a dose of 300 mg. This multi-centre study will be conducted in a minimum of 9 patients and a maximum of 18 patients at 3 sites.</brief_summary>
