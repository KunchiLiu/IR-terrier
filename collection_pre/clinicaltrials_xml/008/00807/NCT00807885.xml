	<brief_summary>The purpose is to evaluate the ease of use and technical challenges encountered during subcutaneous infusion of Lactated Ringer's (LR) solution, preceded by recombinant human hyaluronidase (hylenex), utilizing commonly used angiocatheter gauges and button delivery systems. The safety and tolerability of hylenex-augmented SC infusion of LR through these delivery systems is also being evaluated.</brief_summary>
