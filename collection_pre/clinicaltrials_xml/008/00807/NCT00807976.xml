	<brief_summary>Rationale: Orthostatic hypotension increases with age and is associated with increased vascular and all-cause mortality. The prevalence of orthostatic hypotension is also increased in diabetic subjects. In order to prevent related adverse events and vascular mortality it is of great interest to examine the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension in elderly diabetic subjects. Objective: To examine the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension and associated adverse events in type 2 diabetic elderly subjects. Study design: Cross-sectional observational study. Study population: Elderly type 2 diabetic subjects (70 years and older).</brief_summary>
