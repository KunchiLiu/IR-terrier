	<criteria>Each patient must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study: 1. Patients must have histological or cytological diagnosis of a hematological malignancy of the following types that has relapsed or was refractory to prior therapy: Diffuse large Bcell lymphoma Mantle cell lymphoma Burkitt's lymphoma Precursor Blymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma Tcell lymphoma, excluding primary cutaneous Tcell lymphoma Transformed follicular lymphoma with ≥ 50% diffuse large cell component 2. Male or female patients 18 years or older 3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 02 4. Measurable disease Exclusion criteria include the following: 1. Pregnant or lactating females 2. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive or AIDSrelated illness 3. Any serious medical or psychiatric illness that could interfere with the completion of treatment 4. Total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) 5. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≥ 2.5 × the ULN. AST, ALT may be elevated up to 5 times the ULN if their elevation can be reasonably ascribed to their underlying hematological disorder. 6. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1,250/mm3 7. Platelet count &lt; 75,000/mm3 8. Calculated creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/minute 9. Autologous stem cell transplant less than 6 months prior to enrollment 10. Patients who have undergone allogeneic stem cell or organ transplantation 11. Systemic antineoplastic therapy within 14 days preceding the first dose of study drug treatment 12. Patients who have received treatment with nitrosoureas, mitomycin C, rituximab, alemtuzumab, or other unconjugated antibody treatment, within 42 days 13. Patients who have received treatment with radioimmunoconjugates or within 12 weeks 14. Patients who have received radiotherapy within 21 days prior to first dose 15. Myocardial infarction within 6 months of enrollment or current history of New York Heart Association(NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia 16. Major surgery within 14 days prior to the first dose 17. Infection requiring systemic antibiotic therapy within 14 days prior to the first dose or other serious infection 18. Clinically uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) involvement. 19. Inability to swallow capsules 20. History of uncontrolled sleep apnea syndrome and other conditions that could result in excessive daytime sleepiness.</criteria>
