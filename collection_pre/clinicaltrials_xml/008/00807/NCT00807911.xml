	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the disease-free survival in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy with fluoropyrimidines and surgery followed by adjuvant combination chemotherapy with oxaliplatin/5-FU/Leucovorin vs 5-FU/Leucovorin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjuvant Chemotherapy After Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy to Treat Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preoperative chemoradiotherapy with fluoropyrimidines followed by surgery is one of the standard treatments for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer; however, the role of adjuvant chemotherapy is still controversial. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of adjuvant FOLFOX for rectal cancer who underwent fluoropyrimidine based chemoradiotherapy and complete total mesorectal excision.</detailed_description>
