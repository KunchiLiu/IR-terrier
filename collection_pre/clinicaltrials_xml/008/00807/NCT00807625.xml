	<detailed_description>In this randomized controlled trial, 66 HIV-infected women who desire contraception will be assigned to one of two treatment groups: IUD or Depo Provera. The study builds on findings from a previous study which examined the safety and acceptability of hormonal contraception and IUD among HIV-infected women. Secondary analyses from the previous study indicated that women who were assigned to the hormonal arm appeared to have faster disease progression based on death and decline in CD4+ count as compared to women assigned to the IUD arm. With the current study, investigators seek to understand potential mechanisms for the effect of hormonal contraception on hastening HIV disease progression. Enrolled women will be asked to use the assigned contraception method for a period of six months, and various indicators of disease progression will be collected at four follow-up visits after randomization.</detailed_description>
