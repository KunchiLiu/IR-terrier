	<brief_summary>This study of neurotropic viral infection and Tuberculous CNS infection is the comprehensive investigation of CSF PCR arrays (Hybrydiaztion technique,Sybergreen and Taqman real time PCR arrays of CSF ) in suspected cases of viral CNS infection, Tuberculous CNS infection in both AIDS and non AIDS patients. Patients with clinical viral encephalitis and all meningoencephalitis including all patients with HIV/AIDS CSF and non AIDS will be banked and test for RNA and DNA viral sequence by Real time PCR arrays and IS6110 gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Clinical data and final diagnosis will be used to analyze the result of this PCR arrays technique compared to clinical gold standard criteria.</brief_summary>
