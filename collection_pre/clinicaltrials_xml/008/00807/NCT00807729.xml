	<brief_summary>Objective: We compared outcome parameters for good-risk patients with classic signs, symptoms, laboratory and abdominal imaging features of cholecystolithiasis and choledocholithiasis randomized to either LC + LCBDE or ERCP/S + LC. Design: Our study was a prospective trial conducted following written informed consent with randomization by the serially-numbered opaque envelope technique. Setting: Our institution is an academic teaching hospital and the central receiving and trauma center for the City and County of San Francisco. Patients: We randomized 122 patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists Grade I or II) meeting entry criteria. Ten of these patients, excluded from outcome analysis, were protocol violators having signed out of the hospital against medical advice before one of both procedures were completed. Interventions: Treatment was pre-operative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography sphincterotomy (ERCP/S) followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), or laparoscopic cholecystectomy plus laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LC + LCBDE). Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure was efficacy of stone clearance from the common bile duct. Secondary endpoints were length of hospital stay, cost of index hospitalization, professional fees, hospital charges, morbidity and mortality, and patient acceptance and quality of life scores.</brief_summary>
