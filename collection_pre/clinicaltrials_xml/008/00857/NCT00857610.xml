	<brief_summary>Topical therapy with retinoids is the only proven medical therapy for aged/photoaged human skin. However, topical therapy with retinoids often result in unwanted cutaneous dermatitis, including erythema and scaling. The reseachers intend to investigate the dose, frequency of use, and time dependence of topical retinol-induced dermatitis. The researchers intend to evaluate retinoid-induced dermatitis biochemically, including retinol regulation of retinoid responsive genes that control retinoid metabolism and serve as markers for retinoid bioactivity. The researchers will also investigate the role of EGF receptor pathway in retinoid-induced dermatitis.</brief_summary>
