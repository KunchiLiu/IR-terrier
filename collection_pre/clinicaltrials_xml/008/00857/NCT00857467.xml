	<brief_summary>This is a healthy volunteer three-way crossover study. A total of 12 subjects will receive three single administrations of 1 g rectal suppositories (containing either 5 mg NRL001, 10 mg NRL001 or matching placebo), with a washout period of at least 7 days between dosings. A further 12 subjects will receive three single administrations of 2 g rectal suppositories (containing either 5 mg NRL001, 10 mg NRL001 or matching placebo), again with a 7 day washout period between dosings. The pharmacodynamic response, pharmacokinetics and safety profile will be determined.</brief_summary>
