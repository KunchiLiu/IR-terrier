	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if thiotepa, busulfan, and clofarabine, when given before an allogeneic (bone marrow , blood, or cord blood cells) or haploidentical (bone marrow) stem cell transplantation can help to control cancers of the bone marrow and lymph node system. The safety of this treatment will also be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thiotepa-Clofarabine-Busulfan With Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant for High Risk Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs: Thiotepa and busulfan are designed to bind to DNA (genetic material of cells), which may cause cancer cells to die. They are commonly used in stem cell transplants. Clofarabine is designed to interfere with the growth and development of cancer cells. Study Drug Administration: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will begin receiving the study drugs before you receive the stem cell transplant. On Day -8 (8 days before you receive the stem cell transplant), you will receive thiotepa through a central venous catheter (CVC) over 2 hours. A CVC is a sterile, flexible tube that will be placed into a large vein while you are under local anesthesia. Your doctor will explain this procedure to you in more detail, and you will be required to sign a separate consent form for this procedure. On Day -7, you will receive busulfan through a CVC. This dose of busulfan is a low level "test" dose to check how your blood levels change over time. This information will be used to decide the next dose level of busulfan. Blood (about 1 teaspoon each time) will be drawn 6-11 times total over Days -7 and -5 for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing. PK testing measures the amount of busulfan in the body at different time points. This PK testing will be done to find the dose of busulfan needed for your body size on the other days that you receive busulfan. A heparin lock line will be placed in a vein to lower the number of needed sticks performed for draws. If you cannot have the blood level tests performed for any reason, you will receive the standard busulfan dose. On Days -6, -5, -4, and -3, you will receive clofarabine through a CVC over 1 hour. On Days -5, -4, and -3, you will receive busulfan through a CVC over 3 hours. On Days -4 and -3 you will also receive antithymocyte globulin (ATG) by vein over 4 hours. This will help to reduce the risk of your body rejecting the transplant. If your transplant will involve haploidentical stem cells, you will not receive ATG on Days -4 and -3. On Days -2 and -1, you will "rest," which means you will not be given any drugs, but your CVC will remain in place. Stem Cell Transplant: On Day 0, you will have an allogeneic or haploidentical stem cell transplant through the CVC. Allogeneic stem cells come from a donor whose cells closely match your own cells. Haploidentical stem cells come from a donor whose cells do not match your own cells as closely, but they are specially processed to help prevent graft versus host disease (GVHD). Receiving stem cells is similar to receiving a blood transfusion. The time required to receive the stem cells will depend on the type of cells you are receiving. Receiving cord blood stem cells can take several minutes. Receiving bone marrow and blood stem cells may take several hours. You will receive G-CSF (filgrastim) (which helps to produce white blood cells) as an injection under the skin once a day, starting 1 week after the transplant, until your blood cell levels return to normal. You will receive drugs (mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), tacrolimus and/or methotrexate) to help prevent side effects, such as GVHD. You will receive methylprednisolone if you develop GVHD. You will stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks after the stem cell transplantation. If you had a haploidentical stem cell transplant, on Days 3 and 4 after your stem cell transplant, you will receive cyclophosphamide through a CVC over 30-60 minutes. Mesna will be given by vein at the same time you are given each dose of cyclophosphamide, to help protect your bladder from bleeding. Study Visits: Beginning on Day -9, once a day while you are in the hospital: - You will have a physical exam, including measurements of your vital signs. - You will be asked if you have had any side effects. - Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn to test your blood cell counts. Two (2) times a week, this blood will be also be used for routine tests. After you are out of the hospital, 2 times a month until it has been 100 days after the transplant: - You will have a physical exam, including measurements of your vital signs and weight. - You will be asked if you have had any side effects. - Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. About 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the transplant, blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn to check the status of the disease. You will also have bone marrow aspirations to check the status of the disease. You will also have a physical exam. If the doctor thinks it is necessary, you may have extra tests and procedures. Length of Study: You will be on study for about 1 year. You will be taken off study if the disease gets worse or needs further treatment. Follow-Up: If you live close to M. D. Anderson, you will return to the clinical once every several months for a physical exam. At these visits, blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. You and/or your local doctor will be called every several months and asked about your health status and if the leukemia or MDS has come back. This is an investigational study. Thiotepa and clofarabine are FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of leukemia. Busulfan is FDA approved and commercially available for use in stem cell transplantation. The combination of thiotepa, clofarabine, and busulfan together with a stem cell transplant is investigational. Up to 60 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.</detailed_description>
