	<brief_summary>The purpose of the DEBIUT study is to assess procedural, clinical and angiographic outcomes of: 1. Provisional T-stenting use for dilation the Paclitaxel-eluting PCI-balloon (DiorTM) in comparison to dilation with a standard balloon prior to the implant of the Liberty Bare Metal Stent in bifurcation lesions (with side branch involvement). 2. Comparison of the results above with the results of using a standard balloon prior to provisional T-stenting with the Paclitaxel-eluting stent TaxusTM Libert√©TM.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Stable angina pectoris (CCS class 1,2,3,4) or unstable angina and documented ischemia or silent ischemia Patients eligible for coronary revascularisation The target bifurcation lesion has a major native coronary artery (&gt;2.5mm) with a stenosis &gt; 50% (on visual assessment) located at a side branch (&gt;2mm) Patient must be acceptable for CABG De novo lesion The main vessel lesion can be covered by one stent (up to 32mm) Only one target lesion can be included in the study: other lesions in different vessels are successfully treated before the treatment of the target lesion (residual stenosis &lt;30%, stent well deployed, no residual dissection, normal TIMI flow, no chest pain, ECG unchanged compared to preprocedural ECG) Signed patients informed consent Patient unable to give informed consent Patients with a previous PCI in the target vessel Patients with in stent restenosis of target lesion Left ventricular ejection fraction more than 30% Patients with left main disease Severe calcifications with an undilatable lesion during balloon predilatation History of bleeding diathesis Untreated significant lesion greater than 50% diameter stenosis remaining proximal or distal to the target intervention. Patient has suffered a stroke or TIA within the past 3 months Life expectancy &lt; 1 year Any major surgery planned or required during the next 6 months Acute Myocardial Infarction Only one target lesion can be included in the study Allergy to contrast and/or required antiplatelet medication Patients unwilling to return for followup at 6 months</criteria>
