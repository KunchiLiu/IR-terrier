	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this protocol is to determine if brain amyloid imaged with florbetapir F 18 (18F-AV-45) PET scans is predictive of progressive cognitive impairment during the subsequent 36 months for groups of: normal controls, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Hypothesis 1: The probability a subject will experience progressive cognitive impairment within 36 months of imaging will be greater in subjects whose 18F-AV-45 PET scan was rated amyloid positive compared to subjects whose PET scan was rated amyloid negative. The secondary objective is to determine the stability, over 36 months of a clinical diagnosis, of AD in patients with an amyloid positive 18F-AV-45 PET. Hypothesis 2: The diagnosis of AD will remain unchanged in patients whose PET scan were rated as amyloid positive.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Observational Study of Cognitive Outcomes for Subjects Who Have Had Prior PET Amyloid Imaging With Florbetapir F 18 (18F-AV-45)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study AV-45-A11 is designed to determine if brain amyloid aggregation imaged on 18F-AV-45 PET scans is predictive of progression of cognitive impairment during the subsequent 36 months. Approximately 180 subjects enrolled in a prior clinical study (AV-45-A05[NCT00702143]) will be offered an opportunity to be studied under this protocol. The initial visit will occur as soon as possible following the AV-45-A05(NCT00702143) imaging day. Subjects who qualify for the study and their caregiver/partners will be contacted approximately 6,12,18,24 and 36 months after PET imaging in study AV-45-A05(NCT00702143), and will undergo a standardized functional and psychometric evaluation. NOTE: This study is a clinical follow-up of subjects previously enrolled in trial 18F-AV-45-A05(NCT00702143). No new patients are being enrolled in this trial.</detailed_description>
