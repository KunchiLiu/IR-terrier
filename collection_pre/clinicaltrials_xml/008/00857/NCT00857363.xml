	<brief_summary>The protocol described herein is designed to provide clinical evidence of the substantial equivalence of SmartPill GI Monitoring System (SP) to the Sitzmarks (Konsyl Pharmaceuticals, Easton, MD) radio-opaque markers (ROM). The trial will enroll symptomatic subjects who meet Rome III criteria (1) for chronic functional constipation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Colonic Transit Time Validation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim of this study is to assess the equivalence of SP to ROM through characterization of device agreement using SP cutoffs for colonic and whole gut transit (59hrs and 73 hrs respectively) derived from the above mentioned study. The cutoffs are derived from the 95th percentile of the healthy subjects in the study. Demonstration of agreement will also serve to validate these SP cutoffs. Device agreement will be evaluated by comparing the percentage of subjects identified with slow transit versus normal transit with SmartPill to the percentage of subjects identified with slow versus normal transit with ROM in the study population. The colonic transit time results will serve as the primary measure for slow versus normal transit for SmartPill. For ROM test we will employ the Metcalf protocol which provides a measure of whole gut transit to compare the SmartPill results to. Additionally, we will characterize gastric emptying and small bowel transit time of the SmartPill in this population. The SmartPill test will be administered simultaneously with ROM. A modified Metcalf procedure will be employed for characterization of slow transit by ROM. The SmartPill GI Monitoring System offers an alternative non-invasive method for characterizing disorders of the stomach. The system consists of an ingestible capsule that houses sensors for pH, temperature, and pressure, a receiver for receiving and storing signals from the capsule, and software for displaying data on a personal computer. The capsule samples at regular intervals and transmits the sensed pH, pressure, and temperature data to a portable receiver worn by the subject. After test completion, the recorded data is downloaded to a personal computer for subsequent evaluation. This trial is for subjects 18 years of age to 80 years of age.</detailed_description>
