	<brief_summary>Comparison of efficacy and safety of glargine insulin and metformin as first line drug of patients insufficiently treated with lifestyle intervention. So far treatment also algorithm with lifestyle and metformin has not been evaluated in patients with type 2 diabetes and HbA1C greater or equal 7 % and lower than 8.1%.Besides HbA1C postprandial glucose excursion and glycemic variability as determinants of oxidative stress will be measured by continuous glucose measurement(CGM). Further more CGM will reveal risk of hypoglycemia at night. As secondary objectives effect on endothelial function, renal function and biomarkers of low great inflammation will be evaluated. So far only scarce information on face to face comparison in ealy diabetes exists.</brief_summary>
