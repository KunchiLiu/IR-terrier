	<brief_summary>The study was to evaluate the long term effects, over one year, of five airway clearance techniques used by people with cystic fibrosis (active cycle of breathing techniques, autogenic drainage, positive expiratory pressure and oscillating positive expiratory pressure (R-C Cornet and Flutter)). The primary outcome measure was forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)and the null hypothesis was that there are no differences among the regimens.</brief_summary>
