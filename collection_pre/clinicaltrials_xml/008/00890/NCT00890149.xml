	<brief_title>Ondansetron for the Treatment of Heavy Drinking Among Emerging Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose to conduct a 9 week study to test the efficacy of ondansetron in a heavy drinking (non-dependent) emerging adult population. We will enroll individuals between the ages of 18 and 25 years as this period overlaps with the general population of those attending college and who can be defined as emerging adults. We will conduct a double-blind control study in which 150 individuals will be randomized into 2 groups, therefore the N will be 300.</detailed_description>
