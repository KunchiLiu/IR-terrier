	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer is a major health problem in Western society contributing to a high mortality rate. Treatment options for the majority of patients with metastases are limited to cytotoxic chemotherapies. The first line chemotherapy containing with oxaliplatin is recommend by guideline. The use of antiangiogenic agents, either alone or in combination with other therapies may provide an alternative treatment modality in the management of these patients. Metronomic chemotherapy refers to the close, regular administration of a chemotherapeutic drug, over prolonged periods. The advantages of metronomic chemotherapy include reducing acute toxicities and sometimes surprisingly good activity against drug resistant tumors via antiangiogenic effect. Thalidomide is an agent, which has shown potential in the treatment of hematological and solid tissue malignancies such as multiple myeloma via antiangiogenic mechanism. Tegafur/uracil (UFUR) is one of the effective chemotherapeutics reported to be an effective antiangiogenic agent in an animal model of metastatic colorectal cancers (CRCs). In the present study, the investigators will try to use low dose metronomic schedule of thalidomide with tegafur/uracil regimen to see the anti tumor efficacy in recurrent and metastasis colorectal cancer patients after oxaliplatin-contained chemotherapy. The primary endpoints are overall response rate and clinical benefit and the secondary endpoint were to determine the progression free survival, and duration of objective response, the overall survival (OS) and to assess the safety profile. This is a prospective phase II study. After having checked all eligibility criteria, patients will be treated with Tegafur/Uracil (TU) regimen. About 34 patients will be enrolled.</brief_summary>
