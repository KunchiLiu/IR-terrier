	<brief_title>Safety Study of Electrocardiogram (ECG) Effects of Sancuso® (Granisetron TDS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Granisetron is a well tested and established 5-HT3 receptor antagonist used in both oral and intravenous (IV) forms. A transdermal form of granisetron (Sancuso®) was approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September 2008. Many of the 5-HT3 antagonists were developed and approved before the adoption of the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E14 standard on QTc and cardiac testing. The association of non-cardiac medicinal products with the potential to prolong the QT interval and induce torsades des pointes (TdP) has significant implications for the future development of medicinal products.</detailed_description>
