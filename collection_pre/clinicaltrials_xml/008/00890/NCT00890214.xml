	<brief_summary>The researchers investigated the influence of a prostacyclin analogue (PGIA) versus unfractionated heparin (UFH) on ex vivo platelet function, during continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prostacyclin's Effect on Platelet Responsiveness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Context and purpose of the study: Prospective, randomized comparison of a PGIA versus UFH as circuit anticoagulant. Platelet responsiveness was assessed from peripheral blood by light-transmittance aggregometry (LTA) induced by collagen and ADP, at baseline, 4 and 24 hrs after treatment onset. Platelet function was also assessed in blood samples collected in the circuit before and after the filter. The Setting was a University Hospital Intensive Care Unit. 23 ICU patients with Acute Renal Failure needing CVVHDF were studied during standard CVVHDF therapy, at random infusion in the extracorporeal circuit of PGIA or UFH.</detailed_description>
