	<brief_title>Transcatheter Closure Versus Surgery of Perimembranous Ventricular Septal Defects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Perimembranous Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is the most common congenital cardiac malformation and constitutes over 20% of all congenital cardiac disease. Though conventional surgery for VSD is a widely accepted procedure with minimal operative mortality, it carries a small but definite risk of morbidity and mortality associated with cardiopulmonary bypass and surgical closure. The newly appeared transcatheter device closure technique provides an alternative to surgical closure. However, the mid-to-long term effects of this technique using occluders is not clear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of transcatheter closure of perimembranous ventricular septal defects using septal occluders.</detailed_description>
