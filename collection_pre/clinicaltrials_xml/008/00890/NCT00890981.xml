	<brief_summary>To evaluate the combined effect of denosumab treatment and discontinuation on cortical thickness at the distal radius by High Resolution-Peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (HR-pQCT). Participants randomized to either denosumab or placebo in the 20050179 (NCT00293813) study who completed that study (ie, attended an end of study visit) can be included in this study. At least 12 months should have elapsed since the patient's 20050179 end of study visit.</brief_summary>

Current use of the following osteoporosis agents: bisphosphonates, calcitonin, fluoride, parathyroid hormone analogue, selective estrogen receptor modulators, systemic oral or transdermal estrogen (except vaginal preparations and estrogen creams which are acceptable), strontium or tibolone. Currently enrolled in or has not yet completed at least 1 month since ending other investigational device or drug trial(s) (other than Amgen trial 20080287), or subject is receiving other investigational agent(s).</criteria>
