	<brief_summary>The primary aim of the present study is to assess satisfaction in a large sample of next of kin in Swiss-German ICUs. Secondary aims are to test the hypothesis that family satisfaction is related to ICU structure and process and to factors related to patients and next of kin. Further, the hypothesis will be tested that proxy assessment is possible, i.e. next of kin rate satisfaction with care similar to patients.</brief_summary>
