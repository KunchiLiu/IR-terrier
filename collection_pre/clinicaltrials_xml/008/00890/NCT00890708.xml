	<brief_title>Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Voriconazole</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Voriconazole is an anti-fungal agent, which is used in the treatment of invasive fungal infection, especially aspergillosis. The serious side effects of voriconazole include liver function abnormality, encephalopathy, etc. Recently, the several studies showed that the blood level of voriconazole is variable and it is associated with drug side effect and treatment outcome. However, there is no randomized controlled study which proves that therapeutic drug monitoring of voriconazole can improve the clinical outcome in routine clinical practice.</detailed_description>
