	<brief_title>Brachial Artery Peak Velocity Variation to Predict Fluid Responsiveness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Predicting the hemodynamic response to fluid administration (or fluid responsiveness) in critical ill patients is still a matter of concern, since fluid overload could worse the clinical situation of these patients. Parameters of fluid responsiveness usually require an invasive monitoring (like arterial pulse pressure variation). We hypothesize that noninvasive evaluation of respiratory variation of peak velocity in brachial artery using Doppler ultrasound could provide a feasible estimation on fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients with acute circulatory failure.</detailed_description>
