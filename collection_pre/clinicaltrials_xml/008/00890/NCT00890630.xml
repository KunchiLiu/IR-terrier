	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of using intracervical balloon catheters for cervical ripening as part of labour induction in healthy, GBS-negative women with prelabour rupture of membranes at term.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intracervical Catheters for Induction of Labour in Women With Prelabour Rupture of Membranes at Term</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized controlled trial comparing two methods of induction of labour for pregnant, GBS-negative women presenting with prelabour rupture of membranes at term. The intervention consists of the insertion of a double-balloon intracervical catheter at the time of induction, followed immediately by oxytocin infusion. The control consists of standard therapy: oxytocin induction. Our primary outcome is feasibility, and our secondary outcomes are length of first and second stages of labour, rate of vaginal delivery, intrapartum fever, chorioamnionitis, NICU admission, suspected or proven neonatal sepsis, or serious neonatal complication.</detailed_description>
