	<brief_summary>This phase II study examines the safety and efficacy of combination therapy for hypertension in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). This study examines the safety and efficacy of combination therapy by imidapril (ACEI) or cilnidipine (CCB) in ADPKD patients whose blood pressure is not controlled under 120/80 mmHg by candesartan (ARB) alone.</brief_summary>
