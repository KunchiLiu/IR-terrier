	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Hypothermia to Treat Neonatal Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) remains a major cause of neonatal death and long term disabilities. Data from animal studies have shown protective effects of mild hypothermia to both the mature and immature brain. Recently research priorities have moved from bench to bedside. Several studies have shown a trend for brain protection of mild to moderate hypothermia and mild hypothermia has emerged as a promising treatment for HIE. Therefore,the investigators organized a multi-centered randomized controlled trial of selective head cooling (SHC) combined with mild systemic hypothermia in HIE newborn infants.</detailed_description>
