	<brief_summary>This is an open label phase I study, to assess the safety of a novel malaria vaccine, AdCh63 ME-TRAP, simian adenovirus encoding Plasmodium falciparum antigens. This follows promising phase I clinical studies of MVA ME-TRAP and preclinical studies of AdCh63 and MVA ME-TRAP used together in prime-boost regimes. All volunteers recruited will be healthy adults. They will be primed with various doses of AdCh63 ME-TRAP administered intradermally or intramuscularly. Some of the volunteers will receive a booster vaccination with MVA ME-TRAP at various doses administered via the intradermal or intramuscular route. Safety data will be collected for each of the eight regimens. Secondary aims of this study will be to assess the immune responses generated by each of these regimes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of AdCh63 ME−TRAP Alone and With MVA ME−TRAP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ME-TRAP insert contains a fusion protein of multiple epitopes (ME) and the Plasmodium falciparum pre-erythrocytic thrombospondin-related adhesion protein (TRAP). The 'ME' is a string of 20 epitopes fused to the thrombospondin-related adhesion protein. TRAP was selected as it is well characterized and has a protective homologue in rodents. We have safely administered ME-TRAP to over 700 volunteers in the UK and Africa. MVA vector proved to be non-contagious and avirulent. Viral replication is blocked late during infection of cells but importantly viral and recombinant protein synthesis is unimpaired even during this abortive infection. Replication-deficient recombinant MVA has been viewed as an exceptionally safe viral vector. When tested in animal model studies recombinant MVAs have been shown to be avirulent, yet protectively immunogenic as vaccines against viral diseases and cancer. Recent studies in macaques severely immuno-suppressed by SIV infection have further supported the view that MVA should be safe in immuno-compromised humans. Simian adenoviruses have not been used previously in a clinical trial in humans. However, they are under active development as vaccines for HIV, (by GSK), and for HCV, (Merck).</detailed_description>

Any history of malaria or Travel to a malaria endemic region during the study period or within the previous six months Any clinically significant abnormal finding on screening biochemistry or haematology blood tests or urinalysis Any other finding which in the opinion of the investigators would significantly increase the risk of having an adverse outcome from participating in the protocol.</criteria>
