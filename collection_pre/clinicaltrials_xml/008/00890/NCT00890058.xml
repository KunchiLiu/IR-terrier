	<brief_summary>The CIRAS study will investigate postmenopausal breast cancer patients with hand pain and compare those receiving aromatase inhibitors (cases) to breast cancer patients with hand pain not receiving aromatase inhibitors (controls) in order assess whether this syndrome is an inflammatory arthritis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Case Control Study to Define Clinical, Immunologic and Radiographic Features of the Aromatase Inhibitor Arthralgia Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is for women with post-menopausal breast cancer and hand pain. Patients do not need to be taking aromatase inhibitors to be eligible for the study. We want to study the joint findings in patients with hand pain and breast cancer undergoing treatment with aromatase inhibitor medications and compare them to patients with hand pain and breast cancer not treated with these medications. Aromatase inhibitor drugs are used in certain types of breast cancer to reduce the risk of cancer returning after treatment. One of the side effects of aromatase inhibitors is the development of joint pain, a complication known as the Arthralgia Syndrome. The cause of the Arthralgia Syndrome is not known, but we suspect that the pain may be due to inflammation in the joints. Currently, the only effective treatment is to stop the aromatase inhibitor, and so affected patients may miss out on an otherwise useful treatment to prevent return of their cancer. Post-menopausal patients with breast cancer and hand pain can enroll in the study. Patients will be asked to come for a separate visit which will take about half a day.</detailed_description>
