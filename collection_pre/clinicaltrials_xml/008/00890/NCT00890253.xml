	<brief_summary>A prospective, non-randomized two stage monocentric phase II clinical trial to evaluate a de-novo calcineurin-inhibitor (CNI)-free immunosuppressive regimen based on induction therapy with anti-CD25 monoclonal anti-body (basiliximab), mycophenolic acid (MPA), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) - inhibition with everolimus to determine its safety and to investigate the preliminary efficacy in patients with impaired renal function at the time-point of liver transplantation (OLT) with regards to the incidence of steroid resistant acute rejection within the first 30 days after liver transplantation.</brief_summary>

Patients with a known hypersensitivity to mycophenolate acid. 5. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to anti CD 25monoclonal antibodies. 6. Patients with platelets &lt; 50.000/nl prior to initiation of therapy with mTOR inhibition. 7. Patients with triglycerides &gt; 350 mg/dl and cholesterol &gt; 300 mg/dl refractory to optimal medical treatment prior to initiation of therapy with mTOR inhibition. 8.
