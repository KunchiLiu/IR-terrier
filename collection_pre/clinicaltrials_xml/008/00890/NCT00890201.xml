	<brief_summary>Pancreaticobiliary reflux has been found in patients with cholelithiasis and gallbladder cancer associated with normal pancreaticobiliary union. However, the presence of pancreaticobiliary reflux has not been studied in patients without gallstones (healthy gallbladders). The authors believe that pancreaticobiliary reflux might be a normal phenomenon in patients with and without gallstones, although in patients with cholelithiasis it might constitute a pathological condition associated with dismotility of the biliary tree and the sphincter of Oddi.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to measure the levels of amylase and lipase in gallbladder bile of patients without gallstones and compare these values to the values of amylase and lipase of patients with gallstones and normal pancreaticobiliary union evidenced by intraoperative cholangiography.</detailed_description>
