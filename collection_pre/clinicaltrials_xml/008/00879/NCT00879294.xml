	<brief_title>The Effect of Gum Chewing on Postoperative Ileus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After operations for a ruptured appendix, children are usually not allowed to eat or drink anything. This is because the infection inside the abdomen and the manipulation of the intestines during the operation cause the bowels to stop their normal movement. The resulting lack of bowel function is called an "ileus". When this occurs, intestinal secretions and anything taken in by mouth can become backed up, causing bloating, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Children are not allowed to eat or drink anything during this time and require fluid hydration through an IV or even nutrition through an IV. This ileus usually lasts an average of 4-5 days, and can sometimes delay the discharge of children who are otherwise ready to go. The purpose of this research study is to determine if simple things, like gum chewing or anti-motion sickness bracelets can help speed the time it takes for the bowels to begin working after an operation for a ruptured appendix. Because the gum is not swallowed, it does not have the same effects as eating and drinking would on someone with an ileus. The same is true for the anti-motion sickness bracelets. Yet, it is thought that the chewing action from gum may stimulate the intestines into thinking that food is on the way and cause them to start working sooner than they otherwise might. The same may be true for the bracelets, and some studies show them to be helpful with nausea after surgery. Nevertheless, the effects of a bracelet on postoperative ileus are unproven.</detailed_description>
