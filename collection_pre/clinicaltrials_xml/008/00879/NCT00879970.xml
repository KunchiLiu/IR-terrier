	<brief_summary>This study will answer two separate questions. The first question is to test the cardiovascular effects of long-term treatment with rosiglitazone or pioglitazone when used as part of standard of care compared to similar standard of care without rosiglitazone or pioglitazone in patients with type 2 diabetes who have a history of or are at risk for cardiovascular disease. The second question will compare the effects of long-term supplementation of vitamin D on death and cancer</brief_summary>
