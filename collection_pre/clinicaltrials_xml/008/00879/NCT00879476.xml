	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study of Ramipril 10 mg Capsules Under Fasting Conditions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hour, a single oral dose of ramipril 10 mg capsule was administered during each period of the study, along with 240 mL of drinking water at ambient temperature, under low light condition and supervision of trained study personnel. A total of sixty-eight (68) subjects were enrolled into the study, to be administered a single oral dose of the test or reference formulation of ramipril 10 mg capsule according to a randomization schedule. Two subjects (subject numbers 01 and 06) were withdrawn from the study in period I and subject number 02 did not report for period II. Sixty-five (65) subjects completed both the periods of the study.</detailed_description>
