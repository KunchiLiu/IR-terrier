	<brief_title>Losartan in Treating Patients With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Evaluate the effects of losartan potassium on disease progression in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. - Determine the safety of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral losartan potassium daily for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo pulmonary function tests with gas diffusion lung volumes, Carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) tests, and 6-minute walk tests at baseline and then at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Patients also complete baseline/transition dyspnea index questionnaires at baseline and then at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.</detailed_description>
