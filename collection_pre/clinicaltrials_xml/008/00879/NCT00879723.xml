	<brief_summary>Burn injury patients undergo a series of metabolic changes that, if untreated, could lead to reduced health outcomes. Nutrition is thought to play a vital role in post-burn recovery. The research team developed a novel vitamin and mineral supplementation protocol based on current scientific literature. The study will test the hypothesis that the novel vitamin and mineral supplement regimen will improve adult patient recovery from burn injury.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Burn Micronutrient Repletion Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Burn injury patients undergo a series of metabolic events that, if untreated, could lead to severe physical impairment and even death. Antioxidants minimize free radical damage by neutralizing the chemical reaction as well as promoting cellular repair. Currently there is no consistent protocol for micronutrient repletion in adult burn patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the current vitamin regimen in comparison to the novel vitamin and mineral supplementation protocol developed by the research team. Dosages for oral and intravenous supplementation are based on current literature. The combination of intravenous and enteral treatment is important due to gastrointestinal mucosal swelling related to post-burn fluid resuscitation. Measurable health outcomes will include rate of infection, length of hospital stay, mortality rate, hospital cost, number of days in intensive care unit, number of ventilator-dependent days and wound healing. The investigators hypothesize that use of the novel vitamin and mineral supplement regimen will improve adult burn patient outcomes.</detailed_description>
