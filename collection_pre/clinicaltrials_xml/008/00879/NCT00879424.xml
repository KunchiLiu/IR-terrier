	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical trial is to investigate the therapeutic role of vitamin D supplementation in a subset of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD): children with disease onset or worsening in the winter. The investigators hypothesis is that (1) vitamin D supplementation in patients with either wintertime onset or exacerbation of AD will improve Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) scores, and (2) vitamin D supplementation will improve the Investigator's Global Assessment.</brief_summary>
