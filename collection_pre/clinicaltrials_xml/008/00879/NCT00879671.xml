	<brief_summary>The macular pigment (MP) in humans consists of the yellow, blue-absorbing carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin. The highest concentrations of lutein and zeaxanthin are found in the fovea. Since light entering the eye passes through the MP before reaching the photo receptors it absorbs a significant portion of short-wavelength light. There is evidence that this absorbing properties of the MP as well as the ability of inactivating highly reactive oxygen species are protective for the retina. Age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness among developed countries. The pathogenesis of this disease remains unknown. There is, however, evidence that low fruit and vegetable consumption increases the risk of Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Accordingly, it has been hypothesized that lutein supplementation may be beneficial in AMD. The present study investigates whether 6 months lutein supplementation increases MP optical density (OD), influences visual acuity, depth and dimension of central scotoma and alters symptoms in patients with AMD.</brief_summary>
