	<brief_title>Consolidation PET-based and Donor-based After Salvage Therapy in Patients With HL in Relapse or Refractory</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective observational study in which patients with positive PET scan after salvage therapy are candidates to a sequential scheme "auto-allotransplantation" in case of availability of a donor . In the event of unavailability of a donor , the same patients are candidates for a double high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support.</detailed_description>
