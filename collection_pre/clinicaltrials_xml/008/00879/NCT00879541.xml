	<brief_summary>The aim of this study are to - assess the efficacy of Biostate® [Study Product (SP)] in subjects with Haemophilia A - compare the pharmacokinetics of Biostate® [SP] with the previously marketed product Biostate® (here referred to as Biostate® [Reference Product (RP)]). This study is divided into 3 parts: Part 1: Cross-over pharmacokinetic (PK) component. PK subjects will be randomised to determine the order in which they receive the two study products. This part of the study is double-blinded. Part 2: Efficacy component. All subjects will receive Biostate® [SP] as required to manage their haemophilia condition for an estimated period of 6 months (or minimum of 50 exposure days) to assess efficacy and safety of the product. This part of the study is open-label. Part 3: Repeat pharmacokinetic assessment. Subjects who participated in Part 1 (PK component) will undergo a repeat PK assessment on Day 180 following administration of Biostate® [SP].</brief_summary>
