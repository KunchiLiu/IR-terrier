	<brief_summary>This study is being carried out to see if patients make the lifestyle changes or take their medication as instructed by their doctor during their visit as a result of the T.H.T. patient-education training. Proper information exchange between doctors and patients is an important part of quality health care. Although many patients would like more information, they often do not ask for it directly during doctor-patient visits. The patient-training in this study specifically aims at improving patient participation during medical appointments by building communication skills such as requests for information and sharing health concerns with the doctor.</brief_summary>
