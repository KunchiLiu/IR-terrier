	<brief_summary>There is sound evidence that quetiapine is effective in the treatment of manic and depressive episodes associated with Bipolar Disorder (BD) (Yatham et al 2006). However, even with the development of effective new treatment options, not all patients respond to treatments available. Biological markers have been investigated as predictors of response to treatment and of remission of symptoms. This would explain in part the individual's differences in the response to treatment, taking into account the genetic variability plus environmental factors influencing specific biological markers. A potential biological marker of response to treatment in BD would be the levels of neurotrophins, as they are, in fact, altered during acute mood episodes (Cunha et al 2006). Among neurotrophins, the Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) has been repeatedly and consistently reported to be associated with BD physiopathology (Post 2007).

	<detailed_description>There is sound evidence that quetiapine is effective in the treatment of manic and depressive episodes associated with Bipolar Disorder (BD) (Yatham et al 2006). However, even with the development of effective new treatment options, not all patients respond to treatments available. Biological markers have been investigated as predictors of response to treatment and of remission of symptoms. This would explain in part the individual's differences in the response to treatment, taking into account the genetic variability plus environmental factors influencing specific biological markers. A potential biological marker of response to treatment in BD would be the levels of neurotrophins, as they are, in fact, altered during acute mood episodes (Cunha et al 2006). Among neurotrophins, the Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) has been repeatedly and consistently reported to be associated with BD physiopathology (Post 2007). Furthermore, medications that are known to be effective in BD, like lithium and divalproex, increase BDNF levels. Diverse sources of evidence provide support to the alteration of BDNF in mood disorders: - Patients with major depressive disorder showed lower levels of BDNF and the treatment with antidepressants recovered those levels back to normal. (Gonul et al 2005). - Studies with brain tissue (post-mortem) showed that BDNF levels were decreased only on those who were not on antidepressants. (Karege et al 2002). - The polymorphism of BDNF gene was associated with response to treatment with lithium during maintenance phase. (Rybakowski et al. 2005). - Our group showed that BDNF levels are decreased during mania and depression, but not during remission (Cunha et al 2006, Machado-Vieira et al. 2007). Therefore, BDNF appear to be involved in the mechanisms of acute mood episodes. - Treatment with mood stabilizers, such as lithium and divalproex, increase BDNF levels (Frey et al. 2006). Prediction of drug treatment response based on variation in genetic make up is a rapidly growing area. However, few studies examined the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms and drug response in bipolar disorder. The design of this study offers a unique opportunity to examine genetic predictors of drug response. Interestingly, a single nucleotide polymorphism at nucleotide196 (G/A) in the human BDNF gene at codon 66 (Val66Met) have been reported to be associated with a predisposition to BD in family-based studies (Rybakowski et al 2006, Green et al 2006). In humans, this polymorphism produces a valine - to - methionine substitution in the proBDNF protein and reduces the trafficking and secretion of BDNF protein. This is relevant because it has been estimated that 20-30% of the human population is heterozygous for the Met polymorphism of BDNF. Furthermore, there are consistent findings in BD regarding the association of Val66Met polymorphism of BDNF gene with prefrontal cognitive impairment, which was recently confirmed in a large sample of bipolar subjects (Rybakowski et al 2006). In addition, crosssectional studies showed that the polymorphism of BDNF gene (Val66Met) was associated with response to lithium prophylaxis, but findings were not universal (Rybakowski et al 2005, Masui et al 2006). However, there is a need for prospective studies in order to confirm these findings. It is possible that a single polymorphism of BDNF gene would have a negative impact of BDNF levels and, consequently, a negative impact in the response to treatment. Despite consistent evidence of changes in BDNF levels during mood episodes and treatment, one important aspect remains unknown: Whether the change in BDNF levels is required for treatment response and whether the magnitude of change happens in portion with the response to treatment and remission of symptoms. The hypothesis for this project is that those patients who have a good response to treatment are the same ones who show the greater increase in BDNF levels earlier in the course of treatment, and who are less likely to present a polymorphism of BDNF gene. Given this context, we aim to investigate BDNF levels prospectively in patients with BD, before, during and after the treatment with quetiapine and compare measures with response to treatment, as indicated by remission in symptoms. We also aim to investigate the polymorphism of BDNF gene (Val66Met) and its correlation with BDNF serum levels and treatment response.</detailed_description>
