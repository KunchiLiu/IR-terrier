	<brief_summary>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in affluent countries. It may progress to cirrhosis and liver cancer. At present, there is no approved drug for NAFLD. Although healthy diet and exercise is often recommended, there is little supportive evidence. Therefore, the investigators plan to conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing a low glycemic index dietary intervention program and simple lifestyle advice in NAFLD patients. The primary endpoint is resolution of NAFLD. Non-invasive tests will be used to assess the study subjects. Proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy is used to quantify hepatic triglyceride content, and transient elastography is used to quantify liver fibrosis.</brief_summary>
