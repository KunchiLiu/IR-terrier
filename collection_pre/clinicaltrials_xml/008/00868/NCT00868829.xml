	<brief_summary>The experimental design is a multi-center, prospective, non-controlled, non-randomized, single-arm clinical registry trial. The study will enroll 5,000 patients who receive the Firebird2TM Cobalt-ChromiumAlloyed Sirolimus-Eluting Stent implantation. For patient with multivessel disease, only Firebird 2TM Stent will be implanted. The enrollment of patients will take about 4 months. Clinical follow-up will be at 30 day, 6 month, 12 month, 24 month and 36 month. Patients withdrawing the study due to any reasons will not be replaced.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>[Definition and management of adverse event] Adverse event refers to any undesirable clinical event. It may be caused by devices, rapamycin, procedure related complications, or the adjunctive medications (such as aspirin, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, or other anti-platelet agent) used in this study. Self report of adverse events by patients should be encouraged. Patients have a right to inquire any information on adverse event at any time of the study. If an adverse event is confirmed, the investigator should collect all related information and complete the Adverse Event Form. [Classification of adverse events severity] Mild: Mild adverse event refers to clinical event not interfering patient's daily activities. Moderate: Moderate adverse event refers to clinical event affecting patient's daily activities. Serious: Serious adverse event refers to clinical event results in patient's inability to undertake daily activity. [Management of adverse event] All adverse events occurring during the study period should be documented on Adverse Event Forms. Investigators should provide appropriate treatment for all adverse events and follow up the patient until symptom(s) disappear or remain stable [Documents Recordkeeping] All CRFs and their other original supporting files (such as the informed consent, the lab report, the process records, medical history, the results of physical examinations and diagnosis, the diagnosis, procedure dates and the records regarding equipment management) must be set up in a secure central location by a research site staff and maintained for at least 2 years upon the notification on the termination or completion of the trial issued by MicroPort Medical. In case the person in charge of keeping these files cannot keep the trial records continuously due to retirement, transferring or any other reason, the recordkeeping should be handed over to another person who is able to accept this task, and a written notification with the successor's name and address should be sent to MicroPort and the Ethics Committee.</detailed_description>
