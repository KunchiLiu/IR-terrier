	<brief_title>Examining the Effect of Acupuncture on Sleep Difficulties Related to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Approximately 70-91% of veterans with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) report insomnia. Presently, conventional treatments for PTSD-related insomnia include medications, psychotherapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy. While some of these conventional treatments do improve PTSD-related insomnia, many of these treatments have limitations (e.g., medication effects, lengthy time commitments, psycho-social stigma). Because of these limitations, many veterans are increasingly turning to complementary and alternative therapies to relieve their symptoms. There is a growing body of research that shows that acupuncture may improve many health symptoms including depression, PTSD, addiction, headaches, musculoskeletal pain, and insomnia. However, to date, no study has specifically explored how acupuncture may affect PTSD-related insomnia. Because so many veterans with PTSD experience PTSD-related insomnia, and because the current conflicts in Southwest Asia are producing a new generation of combat veterans, it is critical that the VA explore innovative treatments for PTSD-related health concerns.</detailed_description>
