	<brief_title>Safety of Lapaquistat Acetate in Subjects With Hypercholesterolemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elevated plasma cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia) and various other plasma lipid imbalances (dyslipidemias) are major risk factors for coronary heart disease. Normally, the balance among cholesterol synthesis, dietary intake, and degradation is adequate to maintain healthy cholesterol plasma levels. However, in patients with hypercholesterolemia, elevation in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol leads to atherosclerotic deposition of cholesterol in the arterial walls. Consequently, it has been established that lowering the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol plasma concentration effectively reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. As a result of this finding, the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III identifies control of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as essential in the prevention and management of coronary heart disease. Additional lipid risk factors designated by Adult Treatment Panel III include elevated triglycerides, elevated non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Lipoproteins rich in triglycerides, such as very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, appear to contribute to atherosclerosis, whereas the apparent protective effect of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol may be limited at low density lipoprotein concentrations. Lapaquistat acetate is a squalene synthase inhibitor currently under development at Takeda for the treatment of dyslipidemia. Participants in this study have primary hypercholesterolemia and have completed either the 12-week monotherapy protocol 01-04-TL-475-008 (NCT00143663) or the 24-week atorvastatin add-on study 01-04-TL-475-009 (NCT00143676).</detailed_description>
