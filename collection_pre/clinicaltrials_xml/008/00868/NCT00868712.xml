	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to assess whether the use of warfarin, a commonly used anticoagulation drug, is associated with increased amounts of coronary artery calcification. Studies in animals and preliminary but small retrospective studies in humans have suggested a possible link to increased tissue calcification with use of this drug. The researchers will investigate this by assessing the amount of calcification seen in the coronary arteries using a specialized computed tomography (CT) scan (electron-beam CT) and assessing to see if the amount is influenced by the amount of time a patient has been taking warfarin. The researchers will exclude patients with known coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease or hyperparathyroidism.</brief_summary>
