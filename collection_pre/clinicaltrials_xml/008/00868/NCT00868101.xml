	<brief_title>The Effect of Remote Ischemic Preconditioning Applied in Children the Day Before Open Heart Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children undergoing repair of congenital heart defects were randomized to RIPC (remote ischemic preconditioning) or control treatment. RIPC was induced by four 5-minutes cycles of lower limb ischemia and reperfusion using a blood pressure cuff. Measurements of troponin I, brain natriuretic peptide, interleukines 8 and 10, real time PCR to NFKB and clinical parameters were obtained and compared postoperatively (4, 12, 24 and 48 hous after).</detailed_description>
