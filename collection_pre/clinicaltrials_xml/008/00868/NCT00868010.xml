	<brief_title>Enhancing Rehabilitation After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke is a leading cause of disability in the US (Thom 2006). The total number of stroke survivors (currently estimated as 5.5 million Americans) will continue to increase as the population ages and as the medical management of acute stroke continues to improve. Given stroke's devastating impact on activities of daily living and the large numbers of Americans afflicted, improving acute medical rehabilitation outcomes after stroke is of great public health importance. Predictors of poor functional recovery post-stroke include impairments in cognition and motivation. Recent evidence indicates that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may improve cognition and motivation; hence, their use post-stroke may lead to improved rehabilitation outcomes. Our group has demonstrated that use of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil is associated with improved functional recovery in a pilot sample (n = 40) of elderly, cognitively impaired stroke survivors undergoing inpatient rehabilitation. Specifically, in this 12 week open-label study, those subjects receiving donepezil experienced a clinically meaningful 14 point greater improvement on the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) than an archival comparator group. Based on these promising pilot study results, we propose a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (followed by a 12 week off-drug observation period) in order to test the efficacy of donepezil to promote post-stroke functional recovery in older, cognitively impaired stroke survivors undergoing inpatient rehabilitation. We will also use this randomized controlled trial to examine the drug's effect on cognition post-stroke; specifically, the drug's effect on those cognitive domains (attention/working memory, information psychomotor speed, and episodic memory) that are relevant to functional outcomes.</detailed_description>
