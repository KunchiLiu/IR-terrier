	<brief_summary>This study assessed the safety and efficacy of MK-3577. The primary efficacy hypothesis was that, after 4 weeks of treatment, either the morning (AM) administration or the evening (PM) administration of MK-3577 provides superior reduction of 24-hour weighted mean glucose (WMG) levels compared to placebo (PLA). The primary safety hypothesis was that MK-3577 is well tolerated compared to placebo.</brief_summary>

The 5 treatments consisted of MK-3577 10 mg once daily (QD) in the AM, MK-3577 6 mg QD in the evening (PM), MK-3577 25 mg twice daily (BID), metformin 1000 mg BID, and placebo to MK-3577/placebo to metformin. Participants were to be randomized to one of 14 treatment sequence arms.
