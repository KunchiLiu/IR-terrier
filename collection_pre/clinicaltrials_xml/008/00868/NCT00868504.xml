	<brief_summary>Previous studies have indicated that tumors are warmer than the surrounding tissues. We want to ascertain that this is true for tumors in the GI tract. If so, a thermal camera in an endoscope may aid the diagnosis of tumors. The experiment entails inserting a cannula sheathed thermocouple into the work canal of an endoscope or a colonoscope. The examining physician will bring the distal end to touch the tumors he finds and their adjacent tissues, noting their respective temperatures. This experiment must be conducted before embarking on the complicated and costly project of producing a tiny thermal camera which will be able to navigate the GI tract.</brief_summary>
