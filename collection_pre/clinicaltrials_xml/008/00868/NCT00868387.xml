	<brief_summary>The burden of overweight and obesity has dramatically increased during the last decades. High carbohydrate intake, particularly refined carbohydrates, probably increase the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. There is evidence that energy-restricted low-carbohydrate diets show greater weight loss and better improvement of cardiovascular risk markers compared to energy-restricted low-fat diets. Beside macronutrient relations, efficacy of weight loss programs depends on care and control. The investigators aim to investigate whether or not a carbohydrate-restricted telemedically guided weight loss program results in a more pronounced weight loss and influences metabolic risk markers more beneficial than a fat-restricted diet.</brief_summary>
