	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see whether patients controlling their own sedation during colonoscopy are less likely to need help breathing than when an anesthesiologist controls the medicine, and whether we can predict when the need for help will occur. The pump used in the study is approved for clinical use by the FDA, as are the medicines used in the pump.</brief_summary>
