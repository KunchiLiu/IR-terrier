	<brief_summary>The aim of the trial is to detect the superiority of the triple combination of capecitabine, bevacizumab and vinorelbine versus the combination of capecitabine and bevacizumab in patients with metastatic breast cancer. 600 patients, 300 in each treatment group, are treated until progression of disease to determine PFS.</brief_summary>
