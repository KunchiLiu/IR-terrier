	<criteria>Patient's written informed consent obtained prior to any studyrelated procedures. Outpatient male or female aged ≥ 18 years. Evidence for "partly controlled" asthma in the 2 weeks before the screening visit Under previous inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) treatment at the screening visit Forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) ≥ 60% and ≤ 90% of the predicted normal values at the screening visit. A documented positive response to the reversibility test at the screening visit, defined as ΔFEV1 ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL over baseline, 30 minutes after 400 μg salbutamol pMDI Patients free of longacting beta2agonists (LABAs) treatment for at least 2 weeks before the screening visit. Patients free of shortacting beta2agonists (SABAs) treatment for at least 6 hours before the screening visit. Nonsmokers or exsmokers Pregnant or lactating women or all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant UNLESS they are menopausal or are using effective and acceptable methods of contraception. Significant seasonal variation in asthma or asthma occurring only during episodic exposure to an allergen or a chemical sensitizer. History of near fatal asthma (e.g. brittle asthma, hospitalisation for asthma exacerbation in Intensive Care Unit) within 1 year before screening. Occurrence of asthma exacerbations or respiratory tract infections in the 4 weeks preceding the screening visit. Diagnosis of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) History of cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis or alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency. Diagnosis of restrictive lung disease. Patients treated with oral or parenteral corticosteroids in the previous 8 weeks (12 weeks for parenteral depot corticosteroids) before screening visit. Intolerance or contraindication to treatment with beta2agonists and/or inhaled corticosteroids. Allergy, sensitivity or intolerance to study drugs or excipients. Significant medical history of and/or treatments for cardiac, renal, neurological, hepatic, endocrine diseases, or any laboratory abnormality.</criteria>
