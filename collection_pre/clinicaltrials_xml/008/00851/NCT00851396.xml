	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to assess the relationship between vitamin D status and insulin- glucose dynamics in obese Adolescents. The study is intended to assess the difference in the insulin sensitivity before and after correction of vitamin D deficiency.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of Influence of Vitamin D on Insulin Secretion and Sensitivity in Obese Teenage Girls</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The vitamin D deficient subjects are identified initially through an existing study. Those identified with vitamin D deficiency are notified and subsequently treated with standard therapy for vitamin D deficiency as part of their clinical care. Patients who self report that they have taken the treatment are enrolled in this study. Patients will be evaluated in this study with measurement of serum 25 OH D level, PTH and oral glucose tolerance test. The study will assess if there is improvement in glucose- insulin sensitivity dynamics once the serum 25OH D level is normalized</detailed_description>
