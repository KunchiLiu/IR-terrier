	<brief_summary>Accurate cardiac output determination is a commonly used and important index of myocardial performance. The thermodilution method using a pulmonary artery catheter is the most common approach to cardiac output determination; however, placement of the pulmonary artery catheter is not without risk and at times can be problematic. Ultrasound dilution measurement has been shown to correlate with measured cardiac output in animal models and adults, but it has not been validated in pediatric patients. This study will validate the accuracy of ultrasound dilution measurements of cardiac output to thermodilution measurements of cardiac output in pediatric patients.</brief_summary>
