	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine the effects of distributing free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to tobacco quitline callers directly. Specifically, this study aims to: 1. Test if sending active nicotine patches directly will lead to a higher quit rate, compared to a condition where the quitline assists the smokers to obtain patches by other means (e.g. via their health plans). 2. Test if sending placebo patches directly will also lead to a higher quit rate. 3. Test if quitline counseling increases the quit rate when the smokers already receive the nicotine patches.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Telephone Counseling and the Distribution of Nicotine Patches to Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies have shown that statewide tobacco quitlines can dramatically increase call volume by offering direct mailings of free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products. Sending free NRT such as patches to quitline callers, however, often requires a large budget because quitlines have a large number of smokers calling for help each year. A strong rationale is needed for state funding agencies to pay for the patches, which are generally considered the responsibility of health plans. This study will contrast the condition of sending nicotine patches directly from the quitline with a condition where the quitline assists smokers to obtain patches by other means, primarily through their health plans. The study aims to demonstrate that sending patches immediately after smokers call the quitline has a motivational effect that will lead to a higher quit rate than if smokers have to obtain the patches themselves, even if they are able to obtain them for free. To tease apart how much of the effect of sending patches directly from the quitline is due to the active ingredient in the patches and how much is due to motivational effects, this study adds a placebo condition. We hypothesize that the active patches condition will outperform the placebo condition, and the sending of placebo patches will outperform the condition in which the smokers obtain the nicotine patches themselves. We also hypothesize that counseling has its own effect on quitting above and beyond that of the nicotine patches. This study will supply data that can be used to decide what role nicotine replacement therapy should play in publicly funded tobacco cessation programs. Results will also add to the theoretical understanding of behavior change from which new, effective interventions can spring.</detailed_description>
