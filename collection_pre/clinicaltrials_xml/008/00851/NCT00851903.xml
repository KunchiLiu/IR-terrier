	<brief_summary>This study was the extension of the LANTU_C_02761 study named EASIE and identified as NCT00751114 (core study comparing insulin glargine versus sitagliptin in insulin-naïve patients treated with metformin and not adequately controlled). All patients with Glycosylated Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥ 7% at the end of the core study had the possibility to enter this extension study if they met the other inclusion criteria and did not present with any exclusion criteria. The visit 14 of the core study (week 24) was the visit 1 (baseline, week 0) of the extension study which consisted of a 12-week treatment period. The objectives of this extension study were: - To assess the glycemic control (HbA1c &lt;7%) of a 3-month combination therapy with metformin, insulin glargine and sitagliptin in patients not adequately controlled by a previous treatment with metformin plus either insulin glargine or sitagliptin. - To assess the effect of insulin glargine in combination with sitagliptin on HbA1c level, fasting plasma glucose, 7-point glucose profile, hypoglycemia occurrence, body weight and overall safety.</brief_summary>
