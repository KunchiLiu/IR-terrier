	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to estimate the progression-free survival rate at 12 months for the two arms of the study. Secondary objectives include the evaluation of overall objective response rate to treatment, progression-free survival, overall survival, safety and documentation of potential immunogenicity of aflibercept. This study was a non-comparative randomized trial and was not powered for a comparison of any of the efficacy endpoints. Rather, the aim of the trial was to get, for all endpoints, an estimation of the efficacy and safety of aflibercept combined with a modified FOLFOX6 regimen. In such type of non-comparative randomized trial, the control FOLFOLX6 arm was intended to only act as a check on the similarity of the current patients to the historical controls with respect to clinical outcome when given FOLFOX6 treatment.</brief_summary>
