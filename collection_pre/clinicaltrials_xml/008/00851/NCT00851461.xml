	<brief_summary>This is a therapeutic trial study to demonstrate whether Goserelin, a LHRH agonist has benefit in SBMA Objective: 1. To study effects of Goserelin to clinical course of patients with spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy in Thailand 2. To demonstrate physiological and pathological changes in treated patients with Goserelin. 3. To assess tolerability and adverse effect of Goserelin therapy</brief_summary>
