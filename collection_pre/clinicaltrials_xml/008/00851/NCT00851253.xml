	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Stereotactic radiosurgery may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of stereotactic radiosurgery in treating patients with locally advanced or recurrent head and neck cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Radiosurgery in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Recurrent Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To determine the feasibility and tolerability of CyberKnife® stereotactic radiosurgery as boost therapy after standard chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer. - To determine the feasibility and tolerability of CyberKnife® stereotactic radiosurgery as salvage therapy in patients with locally recurrent head and neck cancer. OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups according to disease status after prior standard therapy. Patients with residual disease after standard therapy are assigned to group 1. Patients with recurrent disease ≥ 6 months after standard therapy are assigned to group 2. All patients undergo placement of 3-6 gold fiducial markers within 1-2 weeks of beginning CyberKnife® stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) treatment. - Group 1 (CyberKnife® SRS boost therapy): Patients undergo CyberKnife® SRS boost therapy (2 fractionated doses) beginning 4-8 weeks after completion of standard therapy. - Group 2 (CyberKnife® SRS salvage therapy): Patients undergo CyberKnife® SRS salvage therapy (5 fractions) 3 times weekly. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 2 years.</detailed_description>
