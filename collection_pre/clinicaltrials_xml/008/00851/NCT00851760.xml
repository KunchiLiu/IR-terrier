	<brief_title>Epiretinal Macular Membrane and Cataract Extraction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A retrospective nonrandomized clinical case series study collected 174 consecutive eyes of 174 patients undergoing macular surgery between January 2005 and December 2006. Patients suffering from epiretinal macular membranes (ERM) secondary to uveitis, trauma, or associated with a simultaneous retinal detachment (RD) were excluded. We treated 109 eyes with a combined procedure (group 1) and 65 eyes with a consecutive surgery (membrane surgery and cataract separately)(group 2).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patients had symptomatic visual loss and needed vitrectomy for ERM removal. Patients suffering from ERM secondary to uveitis, trauma, or associated with a simultaneous RD were excluded.</criteria>
