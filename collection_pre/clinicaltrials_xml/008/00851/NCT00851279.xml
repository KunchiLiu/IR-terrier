	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center clinical case series evaluating the outcomes of the magnetic navigation system in ventricular tachycardia (VT) cases. Subjects will be evaluated acutely and will be followed clinically at 1, 6 and 12 months post-treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotaxis Study To Obliterate Persistent Ventricular Tachycardia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia (VT) is greatly facilitated by using a substrate mapping approach - that is, mapping of the left ventricle during sinus or paced rhythm to identify diseased myocardium. Using three dimensional electroanatomical mapping, it is possible to reconstruct an anatomical rendering of the left ventricle based on voltage. For hemodynamically stable or unstable VTs, various electrophysiologic maneuvers can then be used to identify the critical portions of the VT circuit within the scar (entrainment mapping, identification of diastolic potentials, identification of electrically-unexcitable scar, fractionated potentials and pace mapping). These methods are limited by the resolution of the substrate map, accuracy of catheter manipulation, and operator skill. To this end, a magnetic navigation system has been developed that allows for remote cardiac mapping. When used in concert with a compatible electroanatomical mapping system, it is possible to create a high-density ventricular substrate map of healed myocardial infarction. By removing the necessity for technical skill with catheter manipulation, this system has the potential for both improving the efficacy of VT ablation and expanding the clinical use of this substrate mapping approach. Recently, a higher-powered, irrigated tip catheter has become available in certain markets for use in cardiac arrhythmia ablations. This study will evaluate the outcomes of using this magnetic irrigation ablation catheter during mapping and ablation of VT while also using remote magnetic navigation.</detailed_description>
