	<brief_summary>A major challenge of peritoneal dialysis (PD) therapy is the development of glucose-sparing strategies able to provide an efficacious ultrafiltration (UF) profile. Study hypothesis is to evaluate the possibility to formulate PD solutions containing L-carnitine as an osmotic agent to partially replace glucose.</brief_summary>
