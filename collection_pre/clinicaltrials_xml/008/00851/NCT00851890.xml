	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Antiviral Activity of Multiple Doses of ABT-333 Alone and in Combination With Pegylated Interferon (pegIFN) and Ribavirin (RBV) in Subjects With Genotype 1 Chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a Phase 2a, blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected adults with 2 planned sequential evaluations, Part 1 and Part 2. The study evaluated the safety, tolerability, antiviral activity, and pharmacokinetics of ABT-333 or placebo monotherapy, followed by 26 days of ABT-333 or placebo with pegylated interferon a-2a (pegIFN) and ribavirin (RBV) combination therapy. Review of safety and efficacy in Part 1 of the study showed similar response rates across ABT-333 doses so Part 2 of the study was not performed. The study also assessed emergence of resistant HCV in conjunction with kinetics of viral load decay and rebound in treatment-naïve, HCV-infected participants.</detailed_description>

Participants must have a liver biopsy with histology consistent with HCVinduced liver damage, and with no evidence of cirrhosis or liver pathology due to any cause other than chronic HCV. Condition of general good health other then HCV infection. Participants with a history of thyroid disease must have a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) value in the normal range. No prior history of receiving therapy for HCV infection. Positive test result for hepatitis A virus immunoglobulin M (HAVIgM), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or human immunodeficiency virus antibody (HIV Ab). Pregnant or breastfeeding females or male partners of women who are pregnant. History of seizures or cancer. History of major depressive disorder within 2 years. Any current or past history of cirrhosis. Any cause of liver disease other than chronic HCV infection.</criteria>
