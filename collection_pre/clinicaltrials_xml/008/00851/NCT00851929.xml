	<brief_title>Ambrisentan (Letairis) for Sarcoidosis Associated Pulmonary Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Endpoint: Change in 6 minute walk distance. Secondary Endpoints: - Safety - Oxygen saturation at rest and with exercise - Hospitalization - Mortality - WHO functional class - Quality of life as measured by - Short-form 36 - Sarcoidosis Health Questionnaire - Dyspnea as measured by - Borg Dyspnea Index - St. George Respiratory Questionnaire - Sarcoidosis activity as measured by the - STAI sarcoidosis instrument (33) - Prednisone dose - Pulmonary function - Forced vital capacity (FVC) - Diffusion (DLCO) - Endothelin-1 levels - Bronchoalveolar lavage - Plasma - B-type natruetic peptide - Inflammatory and fibrotic mediators (IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, IL-23, TNF-α) in BALF - Compliance with treatment - Time to clinical worsening (defined by the initiation of ambrisentan treatment to the first occurrence of death, lung transplantation, hospitalization for pulmonary arterial hypertension, arterial septostomy, a change in chronic prostanoid or sildenafil treatment due to protocol defined worsening criteria or study withdrawal due to additional of other clinically approved PAH therapeutic agents)</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Biopsy proven sarcoidosis Mean pulmonary artery pressure &gt; 25 mmHg at rest and greater than 30 mmHg with exercise by right heart catheterization within 1 year prior to entry into study Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ≤ 15 mmHg PVR values &gt;3.0 Woods units Forced vital capacity (FVC) &gt;40% WHO functional class II or III Stable sarcoidosis treatment regimen for three months prior to entry into study 6 minute walk distance between 150450 meters Stable dose of antihypertensive medications On no other medication to treat PAH (sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, treprostinil, epoprostenol, iloprost, bosentan, sitaxsentan) within one month prior to enrollment and during duration of the study Nonpregnant females Exercise limitation related to a noncardiopulmonary reason (e.g. arthritis) Severe systemic hypertension &gt; 170/95 Patients with congestive heart failure (left ventricular dysfunction) or primary right ventricular dysfunction Anticipation by the investigator for escalation in sarcoidosis treatment during the course of the study Pulmonary hypertension related to etiology other than sarcoidosis (i.e. HIV, scleroderma, etc.) Use within 1 month of an endothelin receptor antagonists (bosentan, sitaxsentan). WHO functional class IV status Patients with significant left ventricular dysfunction Significant liver dysfunction not due to sarcoidosis. Patients with severe other organ disease felt by investigators to impact on survival during the course of the study.</criteria>
