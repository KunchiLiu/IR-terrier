	<criteria>Signed and dated informed consent form by the participant or the participant's legally authorized representative The participant is ≥ 4 to ≤ 65 years of age The participant has a Karnofsky performance score of ≥ 60 Hemophilia A and B of any severity, with documented history of hightiter inhibitor (&gt; 5 Bethesda unit (BU)) for at least 12 months; or, if inhibitor titer is ≤ 5 BU, and the participant is refractory with increased dosing of either factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX), as demonstrated from the participant's medical history Currently being treated on an ondemand basis for treatment of bleeding episodes Adequate venous access, with or without central venous device ≥ 12 bleeding episodes requiring treatment with bypassing agents in the past 12 months, based on medical history Competent inhome treatment and infusion therapy Currently using bypassing agents (activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC) or recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa)) for treatment of bleeding episodes HCV, either by antibody testing or polymerase chain reaction (PCR); or HCV+ with stable hepatic disease HIV, or HIV+ with stable disease and CD4 count &gt; 200 cells/mm3 at screening Female participant of childbearing potential, presents with a negative serum pregnancy test, and agrees to employ adequate birth control measures for the duration of the study Currently receiving immune tolerance induction (ITI) Currently on regular prophylactic therapy to prevent bleeding episodes Clinically symptomatic liver disease (e.g. diagnosis of cirrhosis [confirmed by liver biopsy], portal vein hypertension, ascites, prothrombin time (PT) 5 seconds above upper limit of normal) Platelet count &lt; 100,000/ml Planned elective surgery during participation in this study Participant is currently participating in another clinical study and has received an investigational product or device within 30 days prior to study entry Planned use of pegylated or nonpegylated alphainterferon with or without ribavirin for HCV infected participants or planned use of a protease inhibitor for HIV infected participants. Participants currently taking any of these medications for a 30day course are eligible. Clinically significant increase in Ddimer levels from historical baseline and/or associated with chronic liver disease or clinically evident thromboembolic event Known hypersensitivity to antiinhibitor coagulant complexes (AICCs) Currently treated with a systemic immunomodulating drug Prior history of thromboembolic event: acute myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism Diagnosis of advanced atherosclerosis, malignancy and/or other diseases that may increase the participant's risk of thromboembolic complications Clinically significant medical, psychiatric, or cognitive illness, or recreational drug/alcohol use that, in the opinion of the investigator, would affect participant safety or compliance</criteria>
