	<brief_summary>The objective is to conduct an exploratory study on the effect of Omalizumab on COPD patients with elevated IgE. Exploratory outcomes include to determine whether Omalizumab use: reduces exacerbations in COPD patients; or improves rescue medication use, decreases ICS use, modified Medical Research Council (MMRC) dyspnea score, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1)(the latter 3 with BMI make up the BODE score), residual volume (RV), total lung capacity (TLC), exhaled nitric oxide (ENO), and determination C-reactive protein (CRP).</brief_summary>

The severity of an exacerbation will be determined by the following: Mild: Home management, with or without contacting a health care provider, or unscheduled office visit Moderate: Requiring a visit to an emergency department Severe: Requiring hospitalization Very Severe: Requiring intubation and medical ventilation Postbronchodilator FEV1 3064% of predicted; the first 5 subjects enrolled will be required to have postbronchodilator FEV1 5064% Postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt; 0.7 Smokers or exsmokers with at least a 20 packyear smoking history Able to communicate meaningfully with the study personnel and to understand and read fluently in English Written informed consent; BODE score 310.
