Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) or planned participation in another investigational study within 30 days prior to study enrolment, or during the 180 days following the first test article dose. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product with immunosuppressive properties is exclusionary at any time during the trial. Receipt of any immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within 3 months of study enrolment or planned administration of any of these products during the study period.
