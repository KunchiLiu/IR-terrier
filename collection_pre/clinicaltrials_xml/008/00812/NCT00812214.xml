	<brief_summary>It is hypothesized that treating insomnia in migraineurs, many of whom also have tension headaches, prolongs total sleep time to the extent that it decreases overall headache frequency. Chronic headache sufferers also feel more tired during the day2, undoubtedly affecting daytime functioning, which is hypothesized to improve as well with prolonged total sleep time.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective of the study is to determine the effect of prolonging total sleep time in migraineurs with insomnia on overall headache frequency, daytime alertness, fatigue, and functioning. The prolongation of total sleep time is accomplished by bedtime administration of 3 mg eszopiclone (Lunesta™), compared with placebo through a parallel-group design.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects included in the study are men and women, 18 to 64 years of age (inclusive), with IHSII migraine with/without aura and DSMIV primary insomnia (sleep onset/sleep maintenance). The required migraine frequency is 412 times per month, with a maximum of 20 days with headache per month, for 1 month or longer prior to screening. The requirement with regard to insomnia is a usual, estimated total sleep time of 6½ hours per night or less, for 1 month or longer prior to screening, due to problems falling asleep, waking up during the night, or waking up early. The sleep and headache eligibility criteria are confirmed at the randomization visit on the basis of the daily diary.</criteria>
