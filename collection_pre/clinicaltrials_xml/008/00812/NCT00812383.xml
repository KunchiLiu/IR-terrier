	<brief_summary>Single center randomized clinical trial, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of carotid artery stenting using the RX ACCULINK™ Carotid Stent System with RX ACCUNET™ Embolic Protection System or PercuSurge GuardWire® 3-6 Temporary Occlusion and Aspiration System using Angiomax (bivalirudin)versus heparin as the anticoagulant for treatment of occlusive carotid artery disease in low and high risk patient cohorts.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The patient must be at least 18 years of age. The patient must have a significant diameter reduction of the extracranial or intracranial internal or common carotid artery, defined as ≥50% stenosis for symptomatic patients or ≥80% stenosis for asymptomatic patients determined by carotid duplex ultrasound scan and/or carotid angiography. Female patients with child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test. The patient and the patient's physician must agree to have the patient return for a 30day and oneyear clinical and ultrasound imaging followup evaluations as indicated in the protocol. Reference vessel diameter ≥ 3.5 mm ≤ 9.0 mm diameter. The patient has had a recent (&lt;4 weeks) disabling stroke or dementia with major neurologic deficit (stroke scales: Barthel &lt;60, NIH &gt;15, or Rankin &gt;3) at preprocedure neuro exam. The patient has had within four weeks of the treatment procedure an intracranial hemorrhage, hemorrhage stroke, major stroke, or any stroke with mass effect demonstrated on MRI or CT. The patient has a known allergy to heparin, bivalirudin, aspirin or to antiplatelet agents that prevents taking aspirin plus ticlopidine or aspirin plus clopidogrel. The patient has received fractionated or unfractionated heparin within 8 hours prior to the procedure. The patient has a history of prior lifethreatening radiocontrast reaction that cannot be pretreated. The patient has a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy within 3 months. The patient is currently participating in another study protocol that may influence either procedure results or followup evaluations. Plasma/serum creatinine &gt; 3.0 mg/dl at time of intervention. Hemodynamic instability at the time of intervention. Previous stent placement in the ipsilateral carotid distribution. Angiographic Exclusion Criteria The patient has an intracranial tumor, or cerebral arteriovenous malformation(s) &gt; 5mm, aneurysms or severe intracranial stenosis distal to target lesion. The patient has inaccessible intracranial arterial stenosis greater in severity than the extracranial internal carotid artery lesion. There is angiographic evidence of significant intraluminal thrombus burden with presumed increased risk of plaque fragmentation and consequent distal embolization. There is total occlusion of the ipsilateral carotid artery treatment site with TIMI 0 flow characteristics. The reference segment diameter (internal carotid artery segment cephalad to the lesion) is less than 3 millimeters by operator visual estimate. The patient has peripheral vascular, supraaortic or internal carotid artery tortuosity precluding use of catheterbased techniques required for successful CSSA</criteria>
