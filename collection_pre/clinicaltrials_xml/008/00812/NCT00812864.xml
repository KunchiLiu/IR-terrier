	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Study of Capecitabine in Elderly Cancer Patient (≥ 75 Years)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Blood samples will be taken before 1rst course of chemotherapy of capécitabine for colorectal or breast metastatic cancer. Pharmacokinetic will be realizes at several times (H0,5, H1, H1,5, H2, H4, H6, H8) and repeated at D14 of the 2d cycle</detailed_description>
