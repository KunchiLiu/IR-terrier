	<brief_title>Participation to Colorectal Cancer Screening With Fecal Occult Blood Test and Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A nationwide, population-based, multicenter, randomized trial comparing attendance to TC with that to FOBT was performed. Sixty-four general practitioners (GPs), overall including in their lists 9,889 average-risk subjects aged 55-64 years, were randomized between TC and FOBT screening programs. Eligible subjects were mailed a personal invitation letter co-signed by their GP and the coordinator of the area-reference GI centre. Attendance rate and detection rate for advanced neoplasia (colorectal cancer, adenoma &gt;10 mm or with villous histology or high-grade dysplasia) for each arm of the study were assessed.</detailed_description>
