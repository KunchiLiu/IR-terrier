	<detailed_description>Patients with heart failure often have high blood sugar. High glucose contributes to severe hospital complications and even death. Studies suggest that heart failure patients who have high glucose or diabetes do not live as long as patients with normal glucose. In this study, we will determine whether normalizing blood sugars using intravenous insulin short-term will improve outcomes in patients hospitalized for congestive heart failure. We enrolled patients with severe heart failure and randomly assigned them into 2 groups. We used intravenous (given through the vein) insulin to lower blood sugar levels in group 1, and insulin injections in group 2. We determined whether intravenous insulin improved hospital length of stay, rates of readmission, inflammatory markers, and cardiovascular tests that predict mortality in patients with heart failure.</detailed_description>
