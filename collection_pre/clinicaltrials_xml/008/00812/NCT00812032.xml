	<brief_summary>The efficacy of low dose aspirin appears to be substantially lower in diabetic patients, compared to patients without diabetes. The aim of the investigators study is to test the laboratory response to different dosing of aspirin in type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. The investigators will compare the regular dose of 75mg once daily to 75 mg twice daily or to 320 mg once daily. The hypothesis of the study is that twice daily dosing of aspirin may improve the response to aspirin.</brief_summary>
