	<brief_summary>Autoregulation is the ability of a vascular bed to maintain blood flow despite changes in perfusion pressure. For a long time it had been assumed that the choroid is a strictly passive vascular bed, which shows no autoregulation. However, recently several groups have identified some autoregulatory capacity of the choroid. Choroidal autoregulation was first shown in a rabbit model where intraocular pressure (IOP) and arterial blood pressure could be varied independently. In these experiments regulation of choroidal blood flow was not only dependent on ocular perfusion pressure, but was also dependent on the value of IOP. This indicates that a myogenic mechanism contributes to choroidal autoregulation, because the regulatory capacity is dependent on the transmural pressure. In the model of myogenic autoregulation arterioles change their vascular tone depending on the pressure inside the vessel and outside the vessel. The present experiments are designed to test whether a myogenic mechanism may also be involved in choroidal autoregulation in humans. For this purpose the investigators perform experiments during which the IOP and the arterial blood pressure is increased. According to the myogenic theory of autoregulation one would expect stronger vasoconstriction at lower IOPs for the same increase in ocular perfusion pressure.</brief_summary>
