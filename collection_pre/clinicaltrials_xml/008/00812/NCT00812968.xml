	<brief_summary>The purpose of this clinical experience study is to determine whether CC-5013 is safe and effective (to include studying the process by which a drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and eliminated by the body [pharmacokinetics]) in Japanese subjects with low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS (IPSS risk categories) associated with a deletion 5(q31-33) abnormality and symptomatic anemia.</brief_summary>
