	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying whether giving a combination of docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil chemotherapy followed by the combination of cisplatin with radiation therapy works in treating patients with advanced nasopharyngeal cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving combination chemotherapy together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Sequential and Concurrent Chemoradiation for Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: I. To establish the progression free survival rate at 2 years, using RECIST criteria, to induction treatment with docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (TPF) followed by chemoradiotherapy of locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: I. To evaluate complete response rates, safety and feasibility of TPF followed by chemoradiation in patients with NPC OUTLINE: This is a single site study. INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 1; cisplatin IV over 1-3 hours (or carboplatin IV over 30 minutes) on day 1; and fluorouracil IV continuously over 24 hours on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. CONCURRENT CHEMORADIOTHERAPY: Beginning within 3-6 weeks after initiating the last course of induction chemotherapy, patients undergo 3-dimensional conformal or intensity-modulated radiotherapy once daily for 6.5-7 weeks. Patients also receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour (or carboplatin IV over 30 minutes) once weekly in weeks 1-6 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 2 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically confirmed nasopharyngeal carcinoma meeting the following criteria: WHO type I, II, or III Stage II IVB disease (minimally T2a, N0, M0 or any T any, N1, M0) Measurable disease, defined as &gt;= 1 lesion that can be accurately measured in &gt;= 1 dimension as &gt;= 20 mm by conventional techniques or as &gt;= 10 mm by spiral CT scan Prior diagnostic surgery(s) at the primary site or neck allowed provided there is still measurable disease present No known brain metastases ECOG performance status 01 Life expectancy &gt; 3 months ANC &gt;= 1,500/mm^3 Platelet count &gt;= 100,000/mm^3 Total bilirubin &lt;= 1.5 times ULN AST and ALT &lt;= 2.5 times ULN Creatinine &lt;= 1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance &gt;= 55 mL/min NOTE: * Patients with creatinine &gt; grade 1 but &lt; grade 3, hearing loss &gt;= grade 2, and peripheral neuropathy &gt;= grade 2 are eligible provided they receive carboplatin in place of cisplatin throughout study treatment Not pregnant or nursing Fertile patients must use effective contraception prior to and during study treatment Hearing loss &lt; grade 2. Hearing loss grade 2 or greater attributable to tumor obstruction, when the bone conduction in the audiogram is consistent with less than grade 2, is permissible for cisplatin. Hearing loss will be evaluated by hearing in the best ear. If hearing loss is grade 2, patients are still eligible but should receive carboplatin throughout the protocol instead of cisplatin. Peripheral motor/sensory neuropathy &lt; grade 2. If peripheral neuropathy is grade 2, patients are still eligible but should receive carboplatin throughout the protocol instead of cisplatin. No uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, any of the following: Ongoing or active infection Symptomatic congestive heart failure Unstable angina pectoris Cardiac arrhythmia Psychiatric illness or social situations that preclude compliance with study requirements No clinically significant cardiovascular disease No cerebrovascular accident within the past 6 months No myocardial infarction or unstable angina within the past 6 months No NYHA class IIIV congestive heart failure No serious and inadequately controlled cardiac arrhythmia No significant vascular disease (e.g., aortic aneurysm, history of aortic dissection) No clinically significant peripheral vascular disease No history of allergic reaction attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to docetaxel, cisplatin, carboplatin, fluorouracil, bevacizumab, or other agents used in this study No concurrent combination antiretroviral therapy for HIVpositive patients No prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma</criteria>
