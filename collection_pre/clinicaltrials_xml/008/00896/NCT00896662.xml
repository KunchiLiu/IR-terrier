	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying the dendritic cells in samples of blood from patients with cancer receiving aflibercept may help doctors learn about the effect of aflibercept on dendritic cells. PURPOSE: This laboratory study is evaluating dendritic cells in patients with advanced solid tumors or non-Hodgkin lymphoma receiving aflibercept on clinical trial VGFT-ST-0202.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Evaluate the effect of in vivo aflibercept on the presence of different populations of dendritic cells (DC) and immature cells (ImC) in the peripheral blood of cancer patients by characterizing the time course (kinetics) of the improvement in antigen presenting cell (APC) phenotype (decline in DC/ImC ratio) occurring early and late after aflibercept administration. - Evaluate the effect of aflibercept administration on DC function based on ability to stimulate antigen specific proliferative (allogeneic and tetanus toxoid) and cytolytic T cell responses (influenza) by characterizing the time course (kinetics) of the improvement in APC function occurring early and late after aflibercept administration. - Explore the relationship of baseline aflibercept level and host APC phenotype. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo phlebotomy and blood collection at baseline and on days 15, 29, and 57. Samples are analyzed for dendritic cell phenotype, subpopulations, maturation status, and function in terms of ability to activate autologous T cells.</detailed_description>
