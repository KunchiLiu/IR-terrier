	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Breast cancer and its treatment may cause changes in a patient's ability to think, learn, and remember. Gathering information about a woman's genes, brain function, and personal history may help doctors learn more about the disease and plan the best treatment. PURPOSE: 1. To determine changes in brain function that occur following breast cancer chemotherapy. 2. To gain further understanding of the individual differences in brain function changes and recovery based on demographic, medical and treatment variables.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>3.1.1 Primary, nonmetastatic breast cancer 3.1.2 Newly diagnosed patients who have not yet begun treatment. 3.1.4 Female participants age 4065 years of all ethnicities who speak fluent English will be recruited. 3.1.5 There are no life expectancy restrictions. 3.1.6 Karnofsky Performance Status 70% minimum. ECOG will not be employed. 3.1.7 There are no requirements for marrow function. The brain must be free from gross neuropathology and metastases in order to participate. 3.1.8 Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. 3.2.1 History of cognitive, psychiatric or medical conditions prior or unrelated to cancer diagnosis and/or known to significantly impact assessments (e.g. premature birth, developmental delays, learning disabilities, severe psychiatric conditions, brain injury, stroke). NonEnglish speaking. Major sensory impairment (e.g. hearing loss, blindness) that would render assessments invalid. MRI contraindications (e.g. metallic implants or devices). Distant metastases. See also section 4.2.1. 3.2.2 Participants currently involved in studies specifically aimed at improving cognitive symptoms will be excluded. 3.2.3 Participants with significant comorbid diseases known to significant impact neuropsychological function such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's will be excluded. 3.2.4 There are no known risks for allergic reactions to any of the study procedures. 3.2.5 Participants taking certain medications that affect neuropsychological and/or brain function including Haldol, Aricept, Ritalin, etc. will be excluded. Most antidepressants are acceptable. Some antianxiety medications may not be. Each case will be individually reviewed. 3.2.6 There are no other agentspecific exclusion criteria. 3.2.7 Pregnant individuals will be excluded as this is a contraindication for the 3 Tesla research MRI scanner employed by this study but not because of the treatment programs per se. Nursing individuals can enroll. 3.2.8 Patients who are HIV positive will be excluded given the known effects of this condition on cognitive function which would confound the effects of anticancer treatments on cognitive outcome.</criteria>
