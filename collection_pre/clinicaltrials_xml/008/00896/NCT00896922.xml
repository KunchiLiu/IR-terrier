	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how patients respond to treatment. PURPOSE: This laboratory study is examining biological markers in patients with follicular lymphoma treated on clinical trial SWOG-8809, SWOG-9800, or SWOG-9911.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S8809-S9800-S9911TM- Biological Markers in Patients With Follicular Lymphoma Treated on Clinical Trial SWOG-8809, SWOG-9800, or SWOG-9911</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Determine the prognostic significance of MUM-1, lymphoma-associated macrophages, and regulatory T cells in patients with follicular lymphoma treated on clinical trials SWOG-8809, SWOG-9800, or SWOG-9911 representing pre- and post-monoclonal antibody therapy protocols. - Determine whether these factors have similar prognostic significance in patients treated with chemotherapy alone vs chemotherapy and monoclonal antibody therapy on these clinical trials. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Previously collected tissue samples from patients are analyzed by immunohistochemistry, gene expression profiling, and quantitative analysis for MUM1 expression, lymphoma-associated macrophages, FOXP3-positive regulatory T cells, CD68, and CD163. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 318 samples will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
