	<criteria>Subjects who the investigator believes will comply with the requirements of the protocol should be enrolled in the study. A male or female between, and including, 18 and 41 years old at the time of vaccination. Subjects who previously participated in the study NCT00707798 and received one of the two investigational GSK2189242A vaccine formulations during the primary study. Written informed consent obtained from the subject. Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history, clinical examination and clinical laboratory assessment before entering into the study. Female subjects of nonchildbearing potential (defined as premenarche, current tubal ligation, hysterectomy, ovariectomy or postmenopause) may be enrolled in the study. Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the subject: has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period and for 2 months after vaccination. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccines within 30 days preceding the vaccination, or planned use during the study period. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to vaccination. Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol during the period starting 30 days prior to the vaccination and ending one month (minimum 30 days) after vaccination. Administration of any pneumococcal vaccine other than the study vaccine during the period between end of study NCT00707798 and study vaccination. Bacterial pneumonia within the period between end of study NCT00707798 and study vaccination. Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) within the period between end of study NCT00707798 and study vaccination. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (no laboratory testing required). History of thrombocytopenia or bleeding disorder. Anaphylactic reaction following the previous administration of the vaccine or history of reactions or allergic disease likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine. Current serious neurologic or mental disorders. Inflammatory processes such as known chronic active infections (e.g. Hepatitis B, C). All past or current malignancies (excluding nonmelanic skin cancer) and lymphoproliferative disorders. Acute disease at the time of enrolment/vaccination. Fever at the time of vaccination. Fever is defined as temperature &gt;= 37.5Â°C on oral setting. Physical examination positive for acrocyanosis, jaundice, splenomegaly. Acute or chronic, clinically significant anaemia, pulmonary, cardiovascular, hematologic, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening tests, at the discretion of the investigator Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding vaccination or planned administration during the study period. Pregnant or lactating female. Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions. History of chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse. Other conditions that the principal investigator judges may interfere with study findings.</criteria>
