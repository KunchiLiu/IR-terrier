	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the potential of denosumab to treat Hypercalcemia of Malignancy in patients with elevated serum calcium who do not respond to recent treatment with intravenous bisphosphonates by lowering corrected serum calcium &lt;/= 11.5 mg/dL (2.9 millimoles /L) by day 10.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Hypercalcemia of Malignancy (HCM) as defined as documented histologically or cytologically confirmed cancer and a corrected serum calcium (CSC) &gt; 12.5 mg/dL (3.1 millimoles /L) at screening by local laboratory Last IV bisphosphonate treatment must be &gt;/= to 7 days and &lt;/= to 30 days before the screening corrected serum calcium Adults (&gt;/=18 years) Adequate organ function as defined by the following criteria: serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt;/= 5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;/= 5 x upper limit of normal serum total bilirubin &lt;/= 2 x upper limit of normal Evidence of benign hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, vitamin D intoxication, milk alkali syndrome, sarcoidosis, or other granulomatous disease Receiving dialysis for renal failure Treatment with thiazides, calcitonin, mithramycin, or gallium nitrate within their window of expected therapeutic effect (as determined by the physician) prior to the date of the screening CSC Treatment with cinacalcet within 4 weeks prior to the date of the screening CSC Thirty days or less since receiving an investigational product (other than denosumab) or device (ie, does not have marketing authorization; thalidomide use is allowed) in another clinical study Known sensitivity to any of the products to be administered during the study (eg, mammalian derived products) Female subject is pregnant or breast feeding, or planning to become pregnant within 7 months after the end of treatment Female subject of childbearing potential is not willing to use 2 highly effective methods of contraception during treatment and for 7 months after the end of treatment Subject will not be available for followup assessment. Any organic or psychiatric disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, might prevent the subject from completing the study or interfere with the interpretation of the study results</criteria>
