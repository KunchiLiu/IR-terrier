	<brief_title>Study of 9cUAB30 in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To characterize the single-dose pharmacokinetics of 9cUAB30 in healthy volunteers. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the toxicities of this drug in these participants. II. To correlate the pharmacokinetics with the toxicity of this drug in these participants. OUTLINE: Participants receive a single dose of oral 9cUAB30 on day 1. Blood and urine samples are collected at baseline, periodically on day 1, and then on day 8 for pharmacokinetic studies by high performance liquid chromatography. After completion of treatment, participants are followed at days 8 and 30.</detailed_description>
