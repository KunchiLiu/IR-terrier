	<brief_summary>Two hundred and sixty patients with breast cancer will be accrued into the study. After inclusion in the study, all the patients will be randomized into two arms. Arm 1 will receive Tamoxifen given concurrently with radiotherapy while in Arm 2 radiotherapy will be given followed by tamoxifen sequentially. The patients will be stratified for the following factors: a) BCS (Breast conservative surgery) versus MRM (modified radical mastectomy) and b) central lung distance (CLD) &gt; 2 cm. Patients in both arms will continue tamoxifen for a period of 5 years. The patients will be evaluated by high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) (baseline and at 2 years), serum transforming growth factor (TGF) beta levels (baseline and at 6 months) and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) aerosol clearance half life (baseline and at 6 months).</brief_summary>
