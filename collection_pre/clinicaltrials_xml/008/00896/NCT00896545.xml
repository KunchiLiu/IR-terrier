	<brief_title>Early Childhood Prevention of Childhood Overweight</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to understand more about childhood obesity and how to prevent it. Two different methods of prevention will be tested and participants will be allocated at random to one of these methods. The investigators hope to learn how families influence each others eating habits. Participants in this study will attend a series of five classes, once a week for five weeks, on the topic of child feeding. The aim of the classes is to learn how to feed your child so as to prevent future eating and weight problems. The research component includes filling out some surveys before classes begin and at the end of the last class. Classes are small and interactive so that parents have a chance to voice concerns and get feedback.</detailed_description>
