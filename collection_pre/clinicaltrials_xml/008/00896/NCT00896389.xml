	<brief_summary>Although hypertension can be easily diagnosed and there are many medications available to treat hypertension, this condition is poorly managed in many patients and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Because a newly identified hypertension susceptibility gene, STK39 (Serine Threonine Kinase 39), plays a central role in kidney sodium transport, the investigators propose a pharmacogenetics study to examine the relationships between STK39 genotypes and responses to salt loading and to thiazide diuretics, hydrochlorothiazide. The investigators hypothesize that STK39 genotypes will be associated with the outcome of both interventions and can contribute to personalized care for hypertension by predicting patients most likely to effectively control their blood pressure by adopting salt-reducing diet and taking thiazide diuretics.</brief_summary>
