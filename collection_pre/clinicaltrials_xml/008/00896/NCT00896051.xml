	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetics (how the body absorbs, distributes, metabolizes and eliminates a drug) (PK) of ETR when given with ATV/rtv and 1 NRTI in treatment experienced HIV-1 infected patients. In addition, safety, tolerability and anti-HIV effect of this regimen will also be studied. A total of 46 patients will be enrolled.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TMC125-TiDP2-C238: An Exploratory Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Anti-HIV Activity Study of Etravirine (ETR) When Given With Boosted Atazanavir (ATV/Rtv) at Two Different Doses and 1 Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NRTI) in Treatment Experienced HIV Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), exploratory, open-label (all involved people know the identity of the intervention) trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, tolerability and anti-HIV (anti Human Immunodeficiency Virus) activity of etravirine (ETR ) when given with atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/rtv) and 1 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) in 46 treatment experienced HIV-1 infected patients. The trial will consist of : 4 weeks of Screening Period, 2 weeks Pre-Treatment Phase, 48-week Treatment Period, and a Final Visit followed by a 4-week Follow-up Period (only for patients not continuing treatment with ETR in another trial or program). Safety evaluations (AE reporting, labs, vital signs, etc.) will be monitored at each study visit. A PK substudy (included in the protocol, with optional participation) with tenofovir (TDF) added to the antiretroviral regimen for 7 days will be conducted in patients with &gt; 24 weeks of treatment with suppressed HIV-1 viral load. In Pre-Treatment Phase, all patients will receive ATV/rtv 300/100 mg once daily to be taken following a meal each morning + 2 NRTIs (dose as specified in the labels) for 14 days. In Treatment Phase, patients will receive ETR 200 mg twice daily in addition to ATV/rtv (300/100 mg or 400/100 mg) once daily with meals + 1 investigator-selected NRTI for 48 weeks. In substudy TDF 300 mg once daily will be added to the treatment regimen x 7 days.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Documented HIV1 infection Failing on a stable ART (anti retroviral therapy) with HIV1 plasma viral load above 500 HIV1 RNA copies/ml Presence of at least 1 documented NNRTI mutation Demonstrated sensitivity to ATV, ETR and at least one of the selected NRTIs based on the resistance test at screening General medical condition, in the investigator's opinion, does not interfere with the assessments and completion of the trial Substudy: patients who have been treated in C238 for more than 24 weeks and are currently suppressed (defined as patients with at least 2 most recent and consecutive viral loads less than 50 cp/mL) will be considered eligible for the substudy Primary HIV1 infection Previously documented HIV2 infection Previously failed 2 or more HIV PIcontaining regimens Previous diagnosis of hereditary hyperbilirubinemia (eg. Gilbert's syndrome, CriglerNajjar syndrome). Grade 3 or 4 toxicities (according to DAIDS grading) Acute and chronic viral hepatitis Receipt of an investigational drug or investigational vaccine within 30 days prior to the trial drug administration Pregnant or breastfeeding female</criteria>
