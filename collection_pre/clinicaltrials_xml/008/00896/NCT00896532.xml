	<brief_summary>This phase 2 clinical trial will study the safety and efficacy of AMG 785, an investigational bone building agent, in the treatment of postmenopausal women with low bone mineral density. Different doses and dosing frequencies of AMG 785 will be compared to placebo in a double-blind fashion. In addition, AMG 785 will be compared to open label alendronate and open label teriparatide. The clinical hypothesis is that AMG 785 compared with placebo will cause a greater percent change from baseline in lumbar spine bone mineral density. At the end of the initial 24 months treatment phase, eligible subjects will enter a 12 months extension phase. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 within their original treatment group to receive either denosumab or placebo every 6 months Subjects not participating in the 12 months extension phase will be followed for an additional three months to Month 27. At the end of the 12 month extension phase, eligible subjects will enter a 12 month retreatment phase. All subjects participating in the re-treatment phase will receive 210 mg of AMG 785 QM for 12 months. Subjects not participating in the 12 month re-treatment phase will complete the study at Month 36. At the end of the 12 month AMG 785 retreatment phase, subjects will enter a 24 month follow-on phase. Based on the outcome of the eligibility assessment, subjects will either receive one dose of 5 mg ZOL intravenously or no intervention. Subjects not participating in the 24 month follow-on phase will be followed for an additional 3 month observational period to month 51.</brief_summary>
