	<brief_title>Prometra's Utilization in Mitigating Pain (PUMP)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic conditions of pain and spasticity are and have been major challenges to traditional medical treatment. Chronic pain and spasticity seriously reduce the quality of life and restrict normal daily activities for many people. The first line of defense is normally oral medications. However, a significant number of these patients require additional or alternative therapy due to the side effects of the oral medications or the intractable nature of the condition. In 1979, Wand et. al. found that small amounts of morphine, when injected into the sub-arachnoid space, had significant affect in reducing pain. Since that time a number of drug products and infusion pumps have been developed to address this condition. The primary drug used for this purpose in preservative-free morphine sulfate solution which is delivered via an implanted intrathecal catheter. The Prometra Intrathecal Pump System is only the second programmable pump to be used in the treatment of chronic pain.</detailed_description>
