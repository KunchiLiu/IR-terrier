	<brief_summary>- Purpose - to validate a combination of biological and clinical markers in the rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) population as indicative of the pre-symptomatic stage of Parkinson's disease (PD). - Procedures - All subjects (RBD diagnosis, PD diagnosis and controls) will have 1) a medical and neuro history and physical including videotape of movements, 2) neuropsychological testing, 3) a sleep study, 4) olfactory testing, 5) blood draw for serum testing , 6) functional MRI, &amp; 7) eye tracking test. All of these procedures are often performed clinically in the diagnosis of PD. Any testing performed prior to enrollment as part of the clinical evaluation may be used in place of repeating the procedure for the study. Subjects will be followed for 5 years. It is hypothesized that a 5 year follow up may capture a significant number of pre-Parkinson's subjects who will be diagnosed.</brief_summary>
