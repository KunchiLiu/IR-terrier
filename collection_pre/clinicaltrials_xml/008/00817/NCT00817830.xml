	<brief_title>Cardiovascular Safety Study of Lodenafil Carbonate in Patients With Coronaropathy During Physical Effort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (iPDE5) are effective drugs to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). ED is linked to several factors, like advanced age and diabetes as predominant in its incidence. In addition, ED can be an early manifestation of cardiovascular diseases. Among the iPDE5 existing in the Brazilian market there is a new molecule which called lodenafil carbonate. It was recently approve and release for use in Brazil, and has similar effectiveness and adverse reactions comparing with other drugs from the same family. The molecule was evaluated with respect to possible changes in heart rate, blood pressure and QT interval, and the results point out excellent cardiovascular safety profile. There is a corelated incidence between patients with coronary artery disease and erectile dysfunction. Although patients with stable angina and, under appropriate clinical treatment did not show increase in cardiovascular risks during sexual intercourse, the increased incidence of erectile dysfunction in this population determines a specific group of patients with high potential for use iPDE5. Therefore it is essential that any new phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors should be evaluated in patients with coronary artery disease, especially in heart rate, during physical effort.</detailed_description>
