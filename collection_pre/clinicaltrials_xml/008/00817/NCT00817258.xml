	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to determine the overall survival in patients with stage II (T1-2N1M0) NPC treated with concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the disease free survival, and distant metastases free survival of patients with stage II NPC treated with this regimen</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Concurrent Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy for Stage II Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiotherapy alone is the standard treatment for early stage NPC. In retrospective study of early stage NPC patients treated with radiotherapy alone. Patients who had Stage II disease had a worse outcome compared with patients with stage I disease. Chemotherapy, delivered concurrently with radiation therapy, has been adopted as standard treatment for locally advanced NPC. However, concurrent chemoradiation for stage II NPC patients has never been prospectively studied. In the present trial, we hope to assess the value of concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy in patients with stage II (T1-2N1) NPC.</detailed_description>
