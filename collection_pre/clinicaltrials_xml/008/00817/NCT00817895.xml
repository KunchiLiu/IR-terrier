	<brief_summary>Hepatectomy is still the most important treatment for HCC.High recurrence rate mostly influence it's prognosis, especially for the patient with tumor &gt;5cm, multiple tumor and who cannot accept R0 resection.Our retrospective study showed sustained released 5-FU implanted into the liver incisal margin after tumor was resected could reduce the recurrence rate of HCC after liver resection.According to this, we proceed this RCT to prospectively observe the effect of sustained released 5-FU,and we also want to know whether combined with sustained released cisplatin will get better effect in preventing the tumor recurrence,especially in short time after liver resection.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>150 HCC patients with tumor &gt;5cm, multiple tumor and who cannot accept R0 resection will be randomized divided into 3 groups. Group A (50 cases) will be implanted 600mg sustained released 5-FU into liver incisal margin after tumor is resected. Group B (50 cases) will be implanted 600mg sustained released 5-FU and 60mg sustained released cisplatin. Group C (50 cases) will be the controlled one which will not be implanted any chemotherapeutic drugs. All patients will accepted TACE 30 days after liver resection. We will follow up all patients until they are dead or missed connected. Related adverse reaction will be recorded. Total survival time (TST) and disease free survival time (DFST) will be calculated too. At the end of the study we will compare the difference of adverse reaction, complication, TST and DFST between the 3 groups. According to the result we will estimate these drugs' antitumor effect and safety.</detailed_description>
