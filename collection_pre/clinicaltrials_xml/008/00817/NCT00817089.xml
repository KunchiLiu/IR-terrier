	<brief_summary>This is a study involving treatment for alcohol dependence among males of European or Asian decent. The ultimate aim of this line of investigation is to further establish a genetic link between alcohol dependence and treatment by defining an endophenotype associated with treatment response. The study will combine two inpatient alcohol challenge sessions along with 12 weeks of outpatient treatment using random assignment to either naltrexone or placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Understanding Treatment Response With Naltrexone Among White Alcoholics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite the well-established efficacy of naltrexone, there are significant variations in individual responses to naltrexone. A critical question remains: under what circumstances and for which patients will naltrexone be most beneficial? Recent work at our center provides evidence that the mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1) gene polymorphism A118G (Asn40Asp) imparts a significant change in treatment response. We have shown that patients with Asn40 variant (absence of heavy drinking -73.9% v/s 49% response). To further consolidate our knowledge, we wish to test the relationship between A118G polymorphism and the subjective/objective measures to alcohol among alcoholics treated with naltrexone. This work is focused on subjects of European or Asian decent as the A118G polymorphism occurs in less than 1% of those of African decent. Up to 40 subjects will be recruited. The study is divided into two phases. For the first phase (Phase I) subjects are admitted to the UPenn Translational Research Center and receive two alcohol challenge sessions after pretreatment with naltrexone or placebo. Phase II continues with 12 weeks of outpatient treatment, immediately following the sessions, after random assignment to naltrexone or placebo.</detailed_description>
