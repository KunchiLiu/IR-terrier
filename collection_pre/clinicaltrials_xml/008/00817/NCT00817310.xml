	<brief_summary>Currently, when premature infants develop severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), a type of intracerebral bleed, there are no proven therapeutic interventions to prevent the devastating consequences of this event. These children will be likely to develop cerebral palsy or severe cognitive delays. The purpose of our study is to characterize differences in brain physiology, imaging, and function between premature infants with severe IVH and controls. The goals for gathering this information are to generate baseline data, which could facilitate early screening for complications of IVH in premature infants. These baseline data would also allow the design and implementation of early therapeutic interventions to help rehabilitate premature infants with severe IVH.</brief_summary>
