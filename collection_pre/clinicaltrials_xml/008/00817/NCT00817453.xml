	<brief_summary>Purpose: 1. To see if cytokine levels and oligomeric alpha-synuclein levels in blood and cerebrospinal fluid could be used as biological markers for Parkinson's disease (PD) onset and progression. 2. To characterize and define patterns in the clinical features of sleep, olfactory function and motor function in the early stages of idiopathic (sporadic) Parkinson's disease (PD)and atypical or late Parkinsonian Syndromes. Procedures: All subjects, control,early PD diagnosis and atypical or late Parkinsonian Syndromes, will have 1) a medical and neuro history and physical including videotaping of movements, 2) neuropsychological testing, 3) a sleep study, 4) olfactory (sense of smell) testing, 5)blood draw and LP for serum and CSF testing, &amp; 6) functional MRI. All of these procedures are often done in the diagnosis of PD. Any test performed prior to enrollment as part of the clinical evaluation may be used in place of repeating the procedure. Subjects will have 1 set of study visits (up to 3 visits) in order to accomplish a complete set of data.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. 3580 year old men &amp; women 2. Patients with iPD or Parkinsonian syndromes, or controls consisting of healthy subjects, or subjects who have a nonneurodegenerative diagnosis but are otherwise healthy. 3. Gives written informed consent 4. Pregnant women are not excluded, but will be identified by HCG. 1. Parkinsonian symptoms not due to idiopathic (sporadic) PD, such as those that are medication induced, toxic substance induced or representative of an atypical Parkinsonian syndrome will be categorized separately. 2. Any unstable or uncontrolled medical or psychiatric condition. 3. Renal (creatinine over 1.6) or hepatic insufficiency (LFT threefold higher than normal range), or a history of significant cardiac disease. 4. If there is a history or evidence of coagulopathy, on medications such as Plavix, Aggrenox, heparin, coumadin, or large doses of aspirin, must be able to remain off these medications for at least 3 days, and have stable blood coagulation values prior to any lumbar puncture (LP). 5. Significant dementia (MMSE&lt;25/30 or MOCA&lt;25/30) that would interfere with study procedures or the giving of informed consent for the study . 6. Active infections including skin, respiratory or GI infections, and HIV+ (if undergoing an LP). 7. Any evidence of a different neurodegenerative disorder, for example, Alzheimer's Disease or Huntington's Disease. 8. fMRI will not be performed is screening questionnaire identifies a reason.</criteria>
