	<brief_summary>This is 2-armed parallel group, prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter Phase 3 controlled trial to establish the efficacy and safety of conversion from maintenance immunosuppressive therapy with Prograf® capsules (tacrolimus, Astellas Pharma US, Inc., Deerfield, IL) twice daily to maintenance immunotherapy with LCP Tacro™ tablets (tacrolimus, LifeCycle Pharma A/S, Hoersholm, Denmark) once daily for the prevention of acute allograft rejection in stable adult kidney transplant patients. Patients on a stable dose of Prograf® will be randomly assigned to be converted from Prograf® twice daily to LCP Tacro™ once daily or to remain on maintenance therapy with Prograf® twice daily. Patients entering the study will be treated with assigned study drug and followed for one year for patient survival and the incidence of graft rejection or graft loss.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of LCP-Tacro™ Once Daily in Stable Renal Transplant Patients Converted From Prograf® Twice Daily</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is 2-armed parallel group, prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter Phase 3 controlled trial to establish the efficacy and safety of conversion from maintenance immunosuppressive therapy with Prograf capsules (tacrolimus, Astellas Pharma US, Inc., Deerfield, IL) twice daily to maintenance immunotherapy with LCP-Tacro tablets (tacrolimus, LifeCycle Pharma A/S, Horsholm, Denmark) once daily for the prevention of acute allograft rejection in stable adult make and female kidney transplant patients. Recipients of kidney transplant 3 months to 5 years before Screening and on a stable dose of Prograf will be randomly assigned to be converted from Prograf twice daily to LCP-Tacro once daily or to remain on maintenance therapy with Prograf twice daily. There will be 11 study visits in the Treatment period.</detailed_description>
