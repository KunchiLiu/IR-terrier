	<brief_title>Study of Herbal Formula Corresponding to Syndrome in Treating Post Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) Patients With Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The effectiveness of a Chinese herbal formulae is not completely based on the disease or some biomedical indexes, but much more on the TCM syndrome(Chinese name:Zheng Hou)which is generalized from patients' TCM signs and symptoms. Thus, conventional medical curative effecacy evaluation system seems not to so fit for TCM clinical studies. Although many clinical studies from Chinese literature have reported the beneficial effects of various of TCM herbal agents in improving symptoms and signs as well as antagonism of specific pathological changes in CHD patients, most of these trials are lack of well-designed methodologies and the reliability of results still remains unclear. Therefore, we designed this clinical trial, with a randomized, placebo controlled way, to evaluate the curative effects of Xuefu Zhuyu capsule(a Chinese herbal medicine)in patients with Post-PCI CHD patients and find out whether this effects will be better displayed within subjects administered with syndrome-based individualized medication.</detailed_description>
