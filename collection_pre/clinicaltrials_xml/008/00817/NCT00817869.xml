	<brief_summary>In hospitals, older people can fall and hurt themselves. The investigators want to see if a new type of flooring can help stop people hurting themselves as badly, if they accidentally fall.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The HIP-HOP Flooring Study: Helping Injury Prevention in Hospitalised Older People</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will carry out the study in eight elderly care wards across England. We will first study the wards for up to 6 months. Then, half of the wards will have the new floor laid. Wards will be chosen to receive the new floor, or remain with a standard floor, by chance. The new floor has 'shock-absorbent' properties. We will study all the wards for another 12 months. This will allow us to compare the new flooring with the normal flooring.</detailed_description>
