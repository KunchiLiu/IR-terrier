	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: under fasting there will primarily be an activation of growth hormone(GH) signalpathways and a inhibition of insulin signalpathways, and the opposite will happen under physical activity. Primarily we will investigate markers for GH and insulin signaltransduction in muscle- and fat-biopsies after fasting for 72 hours and after 1 hour of ergometer-cycling at 65% Vo2max. In addition to this we will investigate the effect of fasting and exercise on the velocity of carbamide synthesis, aminoacid rate of turnover and glucose rate of turnover.</brief_summary>
