	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of a Retinoid in the Treatment of Severe Chronic Hand Eczema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic hand eczema (CHE)is a distressing disease that poses difficult problems for dermatologists. CHE leads to considerable work-absenteeism, disability and exclusion from labour market. Conventional treatments, including highly potent topical steroids, yield often unsatisfactory results. This study investigates the efficacy and safety of oral alitretinoin, a retinoid, in patients who have not responded to avoidance of causative factors, such as contact allergens and skin irritants, non-medicated skin care and highly potent topical steroids. Eligible patients are randomly assigned to receive alitretinoin or a placebo.</detailed_description>
