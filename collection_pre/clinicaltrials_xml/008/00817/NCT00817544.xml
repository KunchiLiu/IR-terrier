	<brief_title>Excretion Balance and Metabolism After a Single Oral Dose of 14C-Labelled ORM-12741</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Six healthy males will receive 3 mg of ORM-12741 as a single oral solution(0.1mg/mL). The oral dose contains 0.73 mg of 14C-ORM-12741 (2.5 MBq), 1 mg of 13C-ORM-12741 and 1.27 mg of ORM-12741. Subjects will be confined to the study site from Day -1 (the afternoon prior to the day of dosing) up to at least 168 hours following drug administration (Day 8). Subjects will be discharged on Day 8 if radioactivity in urine and faeces meet pre-defined criteria (urinary excretion &lt;0.5% and faecal excretion &lt;0.5% of the dose per 24 hours based on 14C radioactivity quick counts, which will be measured from Day 7 onwards). If on Day 8 these pre defined criteria are not met, subjects will remain hospitalised for a maximum of seven more days (Day 15) until the criteria are met (daily check on quick counts). If on Day 15 these pre defined criteria are not met, subjects will be discharged and requested to collect a 24-hour sample of urine and/or faeces at home once per week and to deliver this to the clinical research unit in Zuidlaren. These weekly collections will be continued until the criteria are met. The total duration of the study will be approximately 5 - 6 weeks for each subject.</detailed_description>
