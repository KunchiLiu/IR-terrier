	<brief_summary>Oxidative stress has been linked to many diseases associated with aging, including coronary heart disease and Alzheimer's disease. Antioxidants and special proteins in the body work together to help prevent damage by free radicals. Some studies have indicated that as people age, they are less able to fight off oxidative stress and have increased levels of inflammation. Tart cherries are known to be rich in antioxidants and plant-nutrients. The product we are using in this study is an all-natural tart cherry juice, mixed with apple juice concentrate and containing no additives and no preservatives. We hope to learn whether antioxidant supplementation, such as tart cherry juice, can measurably decrease oxidative damage and inflammation associated with aging.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study on Whether Tart Cherry Juice Can Reduce Oxidative Stress and Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives The primary objective of this pilot study is to investigate whether tart cherry juice consumption can reduce oxidative stress in older adults as measured by attenuation of F2-isoprostane responses to a forearm ischemia-reperfusion, and a decrease in urinary excretion products of oxidative damage. The secondary objective is to examine whether age-sensitive markers of inflammation are reduced in response to the cherry juice consumption.</detailed_description>
