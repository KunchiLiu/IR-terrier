	<brief_summary>This study is an observational study analyzing the biopsy samples collected from subjects that participated in Study 3115A1-303 (NCT00675688). These endometrial biopsy samples will be de-identified at an anatomical laboratory and then sent to a molecular biology lab where an RNA extraction and analysis will be performed. The purpose of this study is to compare specific endometrial gene regulation at the level of mRNA expression in samples from placebo, bazedoxifene/conjugated estrogens, and raloxifene treated groups with a known set of genes that have been previously identified to be associated with estrogenization, endometrial hyperplasia, and endometrial cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The termination date was June 23, 2010. The study was terminated because the endometrial biopsy blocks from the 3115A1-303 study that were to be used for this study need to be retained and accessible in case of a regulatory inspection of the 303 protocol. Additionally, the Brazilian sites were not likely not to receive national IRB (CONEP) approval, and enrollment could not be met without the inclusion of these subjects. The study was not terminated due to safety concerns.</detailed_description>
