	<brief_summary>This is a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of bedside volumetric bladder ultrasound prior to transurethral catheterization of pediatric patients presenting to an emergency department with suspected urinary tract infection. Ultrasound prior to catheterization allows Emergency Physicians to determine if the urine volume of the bladder is sufficient for successful catheterization. Advance knowledge of insufficient urine allows the Emergency Physician to defer the procedure until success is likely.</brief_summary>
