	<brief_summary>HPV infection has been recognized as the most prevalent sexual transmitted infection worldwide. Burden of many HPV related diseases is well known particularly regarding the different associated cancers (cervical, anal, vaginal, vulvar, oro-pharyngeal) (3) ; however, there is much less available information on the general burden of genital warts, the associated HPV types, the costs of related medical treatments and the knowledge and perceptions towards the disease and its prevention. Objectives: 1. To determine the HPV genotypes distribution in genital warts in the study population. 2. To assess the knowledge about transmission &amp; prevention of HPV infection related diseases 3. To determine the direct medical costs of genital warts attention.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Genotypes in Genital Warts in Colombian Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study population Female and male between 18 - 45 years of age living in Bogota, Colombia Sample frame Patients attending to gynecologic or STD consult in a mayor out patient clinic in Bogot√° (PROFAMILIA) Analysis Analysis of the information will be exhaustive. We will calculate prevalence of HPV genotypes in the GW in both sexes separately. Analyses of the survey will include simple frequencies, percentages, and comparison of results related to HPV knowledge with sociodemographic and clinical information. Explorative analysis using parametric or non parametric statistics of the items included in the questionnaire and clinical forms will be done as appropriate. We will calculate the medical cost of patients enrolled in the study. The treatment protocols used for this protocol will reflect the current clinical practice accepted for the treatment of genital warts. We will use national reference cost list (SOAT) to determine the cost of procedures included.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age between 1845 years. Lesions suspicious of being HPV related. The main manifestations of anogenital warts include: Cauliflowerlike condylomata acuminata lesions that usually involve moist surfaces keratotic and smooth papular warts, usually on dry surfaces subclinical "flat" warts, that can be found on any mucosal or cutaneous surface and, which are probably overseen in the majority of cases. Lesions other than the described above, are not to be biopsied, according to the investigator criteria.
