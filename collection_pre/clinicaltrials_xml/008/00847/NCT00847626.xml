	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Azilsartan Medoxomil Combined With Chlorthalidone in Participants With Moderate to Severe Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), hypertension is the most common attributable cause of preventable death in developed nations, as uncontrolled hypertension greatly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and renal failure. As the population ages, the prevalence of hypertension will continue to increase if broad and effective preventive measures are not implemented. Despite the availability of antihypertensive agents, hypertension remains inadequately controlled; only about one third of patients continue to maintain control successfully. Although most antihypertensive agents are effective at the appropriate dose, the majority have side effects that limit their use. As a class, angiotensin II receptor blockers generally are considered more tolerable than other classes of antihypertensive agents. TAK-491 (azilsartan medoxomil) is an angiotensin II receptor blocker that is being evaluated by Takeda to treat essential hypertension. Treatments for essential hypertension commonly include use of a thiazide-like diuretic, either alone or as part of combination treatment. This study is designed to compare the antihypertensive effect and the safety and tolerability of the azilsartan medoxomil plus chlorthalidone fixed-dose combination product (TAK 491CLD FDC) with azilsartan monotherapy and chlorthalidone monotherapy during 8 weeks of treatment. Participants in this study will be randomized to receive one of 11 possible dosing combinations of azilsartan medoxomil , chlorthalidone and placebo over an 8 week period. The total duration of the study will be approximately 13 weeks. Participants will make 12 visits to the clinic. Each participant will also be contacted by telephone 14 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.</detailed_description>
