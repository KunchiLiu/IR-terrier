	<brief_summary>This study investigates whether assisted movement with biofeedback and muscle vibration applied to the lower limb reduces impairment and improves gait.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinic-Based AMES Treatment of Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis of this study is that chronic stroke survivors, more than one year post-stroke, with a motor problems in the lower extremity will be able to walk and move the affected leg better after 30 treatments with a new robotic therapy device, the AMES device. The device rotates the ankle while vibrators stimulate the tendons attached to muscles that move the ankle. Testing will be done before, during and after the treatments to determine response to the therapy.</detailed_description>
