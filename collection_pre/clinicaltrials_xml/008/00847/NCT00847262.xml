	<brief_summary>Recent studies have shown that obese people are more prone to high blood pressure. With the co-existence of obesity, hypertension and diabetes, patients were more susceptible to hyperlipidemia, coronary and cerebral atherosclerosis and peripheral vascular disease. Abdominal obesity has often accompanied by substantial accumulation of visceral fat, which increased secretion of many inflammatory mediators, cytokines and adipocytokines and played an important role in cardiovascular and metabolic disease. Some reports had shown that angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) may improve metabolic profiles in patients with diabetes or metabolic syndrome, in addition to its hypotensive effect. It has been reported that some ARB, such as telmisartan and candesartan, can prevent weight gain and high-fat-induced obesity in experimental animals. However, whether telmisartan intervention on improvement of fat deposition and other related metabolic profiles is better than a CCB drugs (amlodipine) in those obese hypertensive patients with diabetes, was still unknown.</brief_summary>
