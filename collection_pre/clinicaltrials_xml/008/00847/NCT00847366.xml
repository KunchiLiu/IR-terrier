	<brief_title>Open Label Trial of Perifosine in Patients Currently Being Treated on Perifosine Trials in Solid Tumors or Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Perifosine is an oral anticancer agent with limited toxicity and a novel mechanism of action that is distinctly different from cytotoxic chemotherapies. It has been shown to inhibit and otherwise modify signaling through a number of pathways including Akt, p21, and JNK. Perifosine has been tested in Phase I and Phase II settings in a variety of dosing schedules including daily, weekly, and daily following a loading dose. In general, it has been well tolerated with dose-related nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue being the most commonly observed toxicities. Perifosine has induced partial responses or stable disease in solid tumors including but not limited to renal cell, sarcoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Perifosine is currently being studied in multiple diseases as a single agent as well as in combination with other cancer therapies. As studies are closed there are patients that have achieved a partial response or stable disease.</detailed_description>
