	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to investigate depolarization characteristics represented by changes in HyperQ in asymptomatic, apparently healthy athletic and non-athletic individuals. We also aim to examine a subgroup of obese and non-obese subjects. The goal of the study is to establish normal HyperQ values in these populations and compare HyperQ values of age-matched athletic vs. non-athletic individuals of similar health status.</brief_summary>
