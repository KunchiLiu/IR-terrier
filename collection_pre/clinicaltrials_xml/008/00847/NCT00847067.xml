	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn if paravertebral block (PVB) will reduce chronic pain after surgery. Our hypothesis is that chronic pain from breast surgery as a consequence of central sensitization can be prevented by blocking sensory input to the CNS during surgery and the immediate post-operative period.</brief_summary>
