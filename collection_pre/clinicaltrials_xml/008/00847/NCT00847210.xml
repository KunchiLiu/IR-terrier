	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic and Safety of Dexlansoprazole in Adolescents With Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a condition of multifactorial etiology resulting in the reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus through the lower esophageal sphincter. The prevalence of Gastroesophageal reflux disease in the pediatric population is becoming increasingly recognized and documented. It is a chronic disease that can persist through adulthood with symptoms in older children and adolescents being similar to those seen in adults. The prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease increases with age, from 2.5% of children between the ages of 3 and 9 years, to 8.5% of those between the ages of 10 and 17 years. Younger children generally present with extra-esophageal manifestations, regurgitation, and epigastric pain, while older children and adolescents typically present with adult-type gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation. Treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease is aimed at alleviating symptoms and healing the esophageal inflammation. This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics and safety of dexlansoprazole MR in the pediatric population (ages 12-17) and determined if the pharmacokinetic profile is similar to that in adults given the same dose.</detailed_description>

Must have an estimated creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 80 mL/minute as determined from the CockcroftGault formula. Participants who take prescription or nonprescription proton pump inhibitors, histamine receptor antagonists (except cimetidine), sucralfate, or antacids on a regular or as required basis must agree to discontinue usage throughout the study. Must have a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms, as documented by a physician, for at least 2 months prior to Screening or is currently symptomatic. Must be able to swallow study drug capsule or must be able to ingest study drug granules sprinkled on 1 tablespoon of applesauce. Has evidence of current cardiovascular, central nervous system, hepatic, hematopoietic, renal, or metabolic dysfunction, serious allergy, asthma, or allergic skin rash. Has any finding in his/her medical history, physical examination, or safety clinical laboratory tests giving reasonable suspicion of a disease that might interfere with the conduct of the trial or that would contraindicate taking dexlansoprazole MR or a similar drug in the same class. Has a known hypersensitivity to any proton pump inhibitors or any component of the formulation of dexlansoprazole MR (see most current version of the Investigator Brochures). Has a history of malignant disease. Has a positive test result for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C virus antibody. Has a known history of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus. Has donated or lost greater than or equal to 300 mL blood volume, undergone plasmapheresis, or has had a transfusion of any blood product within 90 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Is required to take or intends to continue taking any disallowed medication, prescription medication, herbal treatment or overthe counter medication that may interfere with evaluation of the study medication. Has consumed grapefruit or grapefruit juice within 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug or is unwilling to agree to abstain from grapefruit or grapefruit juice while participating in the study. Has a history of alcohol abuse or illegal drug use or drug abuse in the past, or tests positive for alcohol or drugs of abuse at the initial Screening Visit or Day 1 or is unwilling to agree to abstain from alcohol and drugs throughout the study. Has used a product containing nicotine within 90 days prior to the first dose of study drug or has a positive cotinine screen at the initial Screening Visit or Day 1 or is unwilling to agree to abstain throughout the study. Has participated in a study of an investigational agent (including dosing or follow up) within 30 days prior to first dose of study drug. Has an initial Screening Visit or Day 1 laboratory value that the principal investigator considers to be clinically significant. Participant is determined to be a CYP2C19 isozyme poor metabolizer (ie, genotyped homozygous nonwild type). Is unlikely to comply with the protocol or is unsuitable for any other reason per the opinion of the investigator</criteria>
