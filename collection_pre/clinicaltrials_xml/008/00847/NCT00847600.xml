	<brief_summary>Pregnenolone (PREG) is a neurosteroid, which displays multiple effects on the central nervous system, and may be beneficial in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia. Our recent 8-week, randomized, double-blind trial among patients with chronic schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders, in which PREG versus placebo and DHEA have been added to conventional or atypical antipsychotics have yielded encouraging results with low-dose PREG (30 mg/day; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00140192; Ritsner et al., in press). The goal of the present study is to evaluate the potential role of PREG's augmentation compared to placebo in the treatment of young patients with newly diagnosed schizophrenia or schizophreniform or schizoaffective disorders. In a 8-week, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial PREG (50 mg/day) or placebo capsules will be added to the stable ongoing antipsychotic treatment of 60 patients with recent-onset schizophrenia or schizophreniform or schizoaffective disorders. Participants will be assessed at baseline and after 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks of treatment. A battery of research instruments will be used for assessment of psychopathology, cognitive functions, side effects, general functioning and quality of life. In addition blood PREG levels will be monitored at baseline and during the study. The study is powered to detect moderate between-group effects on persistent positive, negative and cognitive symptoms.</brief_summary>

No change in anticholinergic, benzodiazepine, or mood stabilizer medications for the pretreatment stabilization period. 8. No anticipated need to alter any of the above medications (antipsychotics, anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, or mood stabilizers) for the 8week duration of the study. 9. Ability to participate fully in the informed consent process, or have a legal guardian able to participate in the informed consent process. 1. Evidence of serious neurologic or endocrine disorder, for example severe head trauma, seizure disorder, dementia, Cushings disease, or thyroid disorder, mental retardation, alcohol or drug abuse, substance dependence (other than nicotine dependence), or presenting symptoms likely substanceinduced, as judged by a study physician. 2. Unstable medical illness or neurologic illness (seizures, CVA); history of prostate, breast, uterine, or ovarian cancer. 3.
