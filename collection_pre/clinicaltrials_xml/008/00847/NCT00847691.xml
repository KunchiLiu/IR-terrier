	<brief_summary>The clinical and histological diagnosis of sarcomas is often very difficult. The identification of chromosomal and molecular anomalies, such as amplifications, deletions or fusion genes is a powerful help for establishing a correct diagnosis of sarcomas and their benign counterparts. However, the cost of the cytogenetic and molecular techniques for the detection of these alterations is often a limitation to their use. The aim of our study is to evaluate the direct cost of the molecular techniques in comparison to the cost that would be generated by an appropriate therapy and care management of the patient in case of an erroneous diagnosis.</brief_summary>
