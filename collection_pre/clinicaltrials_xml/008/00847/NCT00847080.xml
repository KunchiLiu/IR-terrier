	<detailed_description>Symptomatic reactive hypoglycemia is an abnormal glucose decrease after meal ingestion. Patients with this abnormality as an early manifestation of glucose intolerance are at higher risk of type 2 diabetes. The pathophysiology of this abnormality appears to be related with delayed first phase insulin release. Improvement of first phase insulin secretion and delay in gastric emptying induced by sitagliptin phosphate could have favorable effects in patients in whom delayed insulin secretion is associated with reactive hypoglycemia.</detailed_description>
