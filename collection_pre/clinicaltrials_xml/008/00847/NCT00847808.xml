	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if patients with well-controlled heartburn symptoms on twice-daily proton pump inhibitor therapy remain well-controlled after stepping down to once-daily (QD) dexlansoprazole modified release (MR) 30 mg.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Dexlansoprazole MR on Heartburn Control in Participants Previously Receiving Twice Daily Proton Pump Inhibitor Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastroesophageal reflux disease is recognized as a common and persistent medical problem in the US adult population. Gastroesophageal reflux disease comprises a spectrum of acid-related disorders including symptomatic nonerosive gastroesophageal reflux disease and erosive esophagitis. It affects men and women in nearly equal proportions, and the severity and intensity of heartburn symptoms may be similar in both types of patients. Dexlansoprazole modified release is a dual delayed release formulation that consists of two types of granules contained in a single capsule. This dual delayed release formulation is designed to extend the duration of drug exposure and maintain pharmacologically active levels over a longer time period. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that participants with gastroesophageal reflux disease whose symptoms are well-controlled on twice daily proton pump inhibitors, remain well-controlled when switched to dexlansoprazole MR.</detailed_description>

Chronic use (&gt; 12 doses per month) of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs Drugs with significant anticholinergic effects such as tricyclic antidepressants or drugs with central nervous system effects that could mask perception of symptoms. Any investigational drug(s) within 30 days of Screening. 8. Has received blood products within the 3 months prior to Screening. 9. History of alcohol abuse or illegal drug use or drug addiction in the 12 months prior to Screening. 10. Evidence of uncontrolled, clinically significant neurologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, metabolic, gastrointestinal, or endocrine disease or other abnormality, which may impact the ability of the participant to participate or potentially confound the study results. 11. Atypical manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease. 12. Has abnormal screening laboratory values that suggest a clinically significant underlying disease or condition. 13. Cancer within 5 years prior to Screening. 14. Is known to have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. 15.
