	<brief_title>Effect of Rye Bread Breakfasts on Eight Hour Satiety Ratings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Energy-dense foods that require little effort to consume and that are rapidly digested may cause passive over-consumption by failure to provide a feeling of fullness corresponding to the energy content. A diet that is predominantly based on such foods may lead to overweight. It is therefore important to identify properties of foods that facilitate energy balance by creating a high satiety per calorie. A number of studies have confirmed that foods naturally rich in dietary fiber promote the feeling of fullness and reduce hunger in the short term.</detailed_description>
