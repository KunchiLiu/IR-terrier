	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether a single bolus of dose of Amphoterin B lipid emulsion (Amphomul) is as efficacious and safe compared to a single dose Liposomal Amphotericin B in treating patients with Indian Visceral Leishmaniasis (Kala Azar).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>To Study the Effect Of Single Infusions Of Amphotericin B Lipid Preparations in Treatment of Patients Of Kala Azar</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Visceral Leishmaniasis, which is progressive and fatal if not treated, is an insidious, chronic disease that is characterized by irregular fever, anorexia, weight loss, cough, gross enlargement of the spleen and liver, mild anemia and emaciation. This may be preceded by rigors and vomiting. If untreated, Kala-azar, which is the most severe form of Leishmaniasis, has a mortality rate of nearly 100%. The goal of the project is to establish that a single dose of AMPHOMUL® can be used to achieve a Definitive cure for Visceral Leishmaniasis leading to a short course therapy. The project will also seek to establish that AMPHOMUL ® is safe, at least as effective and more affordable than current treatment, and is without the risk of drug resistance. The trial is a Prospective, Multicentric, Randomized, Two Arm, Open label Phase III study to Assess Efficacy and Safety of Infusion of Amphomul® (Amphotericin B Emulsion) as Compared to Liposomal Amphotericin B in Patients of Visceral Leishmaniasis (Kala azar)who are either treatment naive or treatment resistant to other antileishmanial drugs.</detailed_description>
