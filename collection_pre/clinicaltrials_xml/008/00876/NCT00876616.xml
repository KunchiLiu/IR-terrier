	<detailed_description>1. To assess the efficacy of FK506 combined with MMF vs intravenous cyclophosphamide (CTX) pulses in treatment of class Ⅲ,Ⅳ,Ⅴ,Ⅲ+Ⅴand Ⅳ+Ⅴ Lupus Nephritis (LN). 2. To investigate the safety and tolerability of FK506 combined with MMF vs intravenous CTX pulses in the treatment of class Ⅲ,Ⅳ,Ⅴ,Ⅲ+Ⅴand Ⅳ+Ⅴ LN.</detailed_description>
