	<brief_summary>MR Elastography is a new technique aimed at non-invasively measuring the stiffness of tissues. It has recently given interesting results in the assessment of liver fibrosis. The objectives of the current study are: 1. to develop an imaging protocol for MR Elastography of the kidneys; 2. To calculate the stiffness of normal kidneys; 3. To evaluate the variability of the measurements of kidney stiffness by repeating the procedure twice on the same volunteers.</brief_summary>
