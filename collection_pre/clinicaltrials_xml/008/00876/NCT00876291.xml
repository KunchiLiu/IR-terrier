	<brief_summary>Probiotics play an important role in preventing overgrowth of potentially pathogenic bacteria and maintaining the integrity of the gut mucosal barrier. The beneficial effects of probiotics have been previously studied in adult patients with IBS. Even though most of the studies demonstrate efficacy, other studies do not support these observations. Few studies addresses the efficacy of probiotics in children with IBS. The goal of the present study was to determine whether oral administration of the probiotic Lactobacillus GG under randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled conditions would improve symptoms of children with abdominal pain.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients were considered for study inclusion, if they were 4 12 years of age and had if they had a pain history of at least 12 weeks (which need not be consecutive) in the preceding 12 months suggestive for IBS or FAP with no structural or metabolic abnormalities to explain the symptoms and according to the Rome II diagnostic criteria valid at the time of the design of the study. IBS was diagnosed in presence of an abdominal discomfort or pain with at least two of three features: relieved with defecation onset associated with a change in stool frequency onset associated with a change in the form (appearance) of the stool. FAP was diagnosed in presence of symptoms of Continuous (nearly continuous) abdominal pain No or only occasional relation of pain with physiological events (e.g. eating, menses) Some loss of daily functioning The pain is not feigned (e.g. malingering) The patient has insufficient criteria for other functional gastrointestinal disorders that would explain the abdominal pain. Known concomitant psychiatric, neurological, metabolic, hepatic, renal, infectious, haematological, cardiovascular and pulmonary disease Treatment with antibiotics/probiotics in the last 2 months A pain history suggestive for functional dyspepsia or aerophagia or abdominal migrain Growth failure Gastroparesis Gastrointestinal obstructions/stricture Any disease that may affect bowel motility such as diabetes, connective disease or poorly controlled hypo/hyperthyrodism Previous abdominal surgery.</criteria>
