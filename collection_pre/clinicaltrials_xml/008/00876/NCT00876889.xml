	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to find out if the use of the drug Riluzole is both safe and improves outcome in patients with acute traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety of Riluzole in Patients With Acute Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim of the study is to develop acute care safety and pharmacokinetic profiles of riluzole in patients who have sustained a acute traumatic spinal cord injury. Secondary objectives are to conduct exploratory analyses of functional outcomes for purposes of planning a subsequent Phase II randomized study of the efficiency of Riluzole for the treatment of acute traumatic spinal cord injury.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age equal to or greater than 18 years and less than or equal to 70 years; Willing to give written informed consent to participate in the study. The informed consent may require legally authorized representative to sign if arm/hand function is compromised. No other lifethreatening injury Spinal cord injury at the neurologic level from C4 to T12 ASIA Impairment Scale level A, B or C No cognitive impairment which would preclude an informed consent (including moderate or severe traumatic brain injury) Less than 12 hours since injury Equal or more than 12 hours since injury Hypersensitivity to riluzole or any of its components Unable to receive riluzole orally or via nasogastric tube History of liver or kidney disease (e.g. Hepatitis A, B or C, Cirrhosis, etc.) Has a recent history of regular substance abuse (illicit drugs, alcohol) Unconscious Penetrating spinal cord injury Pregnancy as established by urine pregnancy test Breastfeeding Life expectancy less than 12 months Is currently involved in another therapeutic SCI research study that precludes or complicates participation in this study (e.g. study of another therapeutic drug aiming for spinal cord injury recovery, any study that substantially interferes with the follow up schedule (f/u) schedule, or any high risk study that complicates evaluation of safety outcomes. Types of studies that would not preclude participation are e.g. behavioral adaptation studies, mental health interventions) Has a mental disorder or other illness, which in the view of the site investigator, would preclude accurate evaluation (e.g. schizophrenia, severe cognitive disability, Parkinson disease) Unable to commit to the followup schedule Is a prisoner Unable to converse, read or write English at the elementary school level</criteria>
