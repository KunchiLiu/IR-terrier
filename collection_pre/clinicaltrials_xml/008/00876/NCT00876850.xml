	<brief_title>Phase 3 Study - Safety and Efficacy of PTK 0796 in Patients With Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infection (CSSSI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pharmacologic profile of PTK 0796 in humans suggests that it has the potential to be used safely and effectively for this indication. Data from in vitro and animal studies support this hypothesis. In PTK 0796-CSSI-0805 the safety and efficacy of PTK 0796 in the treatment of cSSSI will be compared to an antibiotic approved for this indication by the FDA. Initial treatment will be administered intravenously with the option for subsequent oral treatment.</detailed_description>
