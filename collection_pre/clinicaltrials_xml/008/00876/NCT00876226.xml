	<brief_summary>This prospective study will determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of citalopram in 12 adult patients with short bowel syndrome. While data on the prevalence of depression in patients with short bowel syndrome is sparse, the investigators' experience is that these patients have a high incidence of depression and should benefit from a psychopharmacological intervention.</brief_summary>
