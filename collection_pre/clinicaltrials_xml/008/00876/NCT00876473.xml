	<brief_title>Evaluation of Different Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) Systems in Patients With Acute Respiratory Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Three CPAP systems are studied for each patient at the same level of PEEP: 1) continuous high-flow CPAP with fixed value PEEP valve; 2) continuous high-flow CPAP with Boussignac PEEP valve; 3) demand flow CPAP, supplied by a ventilator.</detailed_description>
