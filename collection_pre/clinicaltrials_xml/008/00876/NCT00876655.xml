	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of 2 different TR-701 oral formulations (free acid phosphate powder in capsule and di-sodium phosphate salt formulated capsule) after single doses in normal healthy adult subjects and to assess the relative bioavailability of TR-701 free acid phosphate powder in capsule formulation compared to di-sodium phosphate salt formulated capsule.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects will receive the following treatments in a crossover design: Treatment A (Reference): One 200 mg capsule of TR-701 di-sodium phosphate salt (equivalent to 150 mg TR-700) administered orally after at least an 8-hour fast with 240 mL room temperature water; Treatment B (Test): One 182 mg capsule of TR-701 free acid phosphate (equivalent to 150 mg TR-700) administered orally after at least an 8-hour fast with 240 mL room temperature water; Descriptive statistics will be calculated for PK parameters including Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-inf.</detailed_description>
