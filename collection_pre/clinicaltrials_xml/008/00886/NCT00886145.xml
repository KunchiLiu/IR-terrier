	<brief_title>Effect of Vibration Therapy on Bone in Persons With Sub-acute Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One of the major complications in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) is marked bone loss because it greatly predisposes to skeletal fractures, even after minimal trauma. The use of low magnitude mechanical stimulation has been shown to be both safe and effective in improving bone mass and strength in animal studies. This modality has also been shown a beneficial effect in children with disability and in postmenopausal women. The investigators are interested in obtaining data to determine the possible benefits that mechanical intervention with vibratory stimulation may have on bone in individuals with subacute SCI (e.g., &gt;1 month after injury but &lt;1 year). Changes in bone density and mass of the leg and arm will be determined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA); bone architecture of the distal leg and distal arm will be determined by peripheral quantitative computed tomography; circulating metabolic markers of bone will also be performed. OBJECTIVES In persons with subacute spinal cord injury: 1. To determine differences in bone mineral mass and parameters of bone structural integrity of the stimulated tibia versus the unstimulated tibia. 2. To determine changes in the metabolic markers of bone resorption and formation in persons with subacute spinal cord injury.</detailed_description>
