	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Recombinant human mannose-binding lectin (MBL) may be effective in preventing infection in young patients with fever and neutropenia receiving chemotherapy for blood disease or cancer. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of recombinant human mannose-binding lectin in treating young patients with MBL deficiency and fever and neutropenia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Recombinant Human Mannose-Binding Lectin (MBL) in Treating Young Patients With MBL Deficiency and Fever and Neutropenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine the safety and tolerability of recombinant human mannose-binding lectin (MBL) in pediatric patients with MBL deficiency and fever and neutropenia who are undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy for hematological/oncological disease. - Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. Secondary - Determine the pharmacodynamic effect of this drug in these patients. - Determine nonspecific activation of complement by in vivo determination of C3d complement activation in patients treated with this drug. - Determine the ex-vivo activity of recombinant MBL in opsonization capacity of patients' sera to yeast and bacteria. - Determine immunogenicity of this drug in these patients. - Determine the incidence and duration of fever and breakthrough infections in patients treated with this drug. OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, multicenter, open-label, prospective, cohort study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups. - Group I: Patients receive low-dose recombinant human mannose-binding lectin (MBL) IV over 1 hour within 72 hours of onset of fever and neutropenia. - Group II: Patients receive high-dose recombinant human MBL IV over 1 hour within 72 hours of onset of fever and neutropenia. Patients undergo blood collection periodically during study for pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, MBL immunogenicity, and opsonization/phagocytosis studies. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 48 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
