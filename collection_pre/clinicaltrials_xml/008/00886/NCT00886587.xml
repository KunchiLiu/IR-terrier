	<brief_title>To Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of a New Device in the Management of Mild to Moderate Atopic Dermatitis in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled trial in children 2 to 12 years of age with mild to moderate AD. A sufficient number of subjects will be screened to ensure that approximately 80 subjects are randomized, to yield 70 completed subjects. Subjects will be randomized to one of the two treatment groups: the J&amp;J Device or AtopiclairÂ®. All subjects will return to the clinical site for clinical assessments at baseline (Day 1) and at Days 3, 8, 15, 22, 29 and 43 after initial investigational product application. The investigational products will be used topically during the duration of the study.</detailed_description>
