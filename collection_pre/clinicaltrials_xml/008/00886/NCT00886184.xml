	<brief_summary>The aim is to precise the place of therapeutic hypothermia induced before Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC) in pre hospital cardiac arrest. If we find a benefit in terms of biomarkers in inducing in early hypothermia compared to hypothermia induced only after arrival at the hospital, there will be arguments to develop a higher scale study, allowing to prove benefits in terms of survival and neurological status.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Principal aim : prove the efficiency of early therapeutic hypothermia induced during ischemia in pre hospital cardiac arrest by a reduction of brain damage biomarkers. Secondary aim: prove the efficiency of early therapeutic induced hypothermia in the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion. Determine the number of ROSC, patients survival, neurological status 48 hours after cardiac arrest (GCS) and when leaving the hospital, impact following initial cardiac rhythm and the cooling rate of early therapeutic induced hypothermia.</detailed_description>
