	<brief_summary>Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) can change the respiratory dynamics and performance of the inspiratory and expiratory muscles, affecting ventilatory capacity. This was a randomized, controlled, open study to test the impact of a physiotherapeutic program of aerobic exercises on respiratory muscle strength, in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Patients with AIS were randomly assigned to the aerobic exercise-training program group or the no treatment group. There was a significant increase in Pimax and Pemax in the group which received physiotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Aerobic Exercising Program on Respiratory Muscle Strength in Patients With Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design: This was a randomized, controlled, open study to test the impact of a physiotherapeutic program of aerobic exercises on respiratory muscle strength, in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Objective. To analyze, by means of maximum respiratory pressure measurements, the conditioning of the respiratory muscles after four months of aerobic exercise training. Summary of Background Data. AIS can change the respiratory dynamics and performance of the inspiratory and expiratory muscles, affecting ventilatory capacity. Methods: Patients with AIS, aged between 10 and 20 years, were randomly assigned to the aerobic exercise-training program group or the no treatment group. They were evaluated for respiratory muscle strength before and after the treatment period, by means of a manometer, and radiographs of the chest and spine. The physical therapy exercise protocol consisted of three weekly sessions, including stretching, aerobic exercises (first mild and then accelerated) and relaxation techniques, for a period of four months.</detailed_description>
