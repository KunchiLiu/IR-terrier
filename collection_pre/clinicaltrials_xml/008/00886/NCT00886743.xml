	<brief_summary>This is an open-label study in which oprelvekin will be administered for the prevention of severe low blood platelet cell counts (cells in your blood that keep bleeding and clotting stable) in adults with cancer who are taking chemotherapy (anti-cancer drug) that has a side effect of blocking your bone marrow from making platelet cells. The purpose of this study is to learn more about the effects of the recommended dose of oprelvekin on the heart's electrical cycle.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Men and women must be 18 to 65 years of age, with nonmyeloid malignancies for whom oprelvekin is indicated. At least one documented occasion of adequate hematologic recovery from previous or current chemotherapy. Adequate renal and hepatic excretory function.
