	<brief_summary>Neurofeedback is increasingly advocated for treatment of ADHD despite a thin evidence base. The numerous open and partially controlled studies suffer serious design flaws. In particular, there is no published double-blind randomized clinical trial (RCT), which would control for experimenter and participant biases. The primary aim of this R34 pilot study is to conduct a small-scale pilot with 39 8-12 year-olds with ADHD to prepare for such a larger RCT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Feasibility Study of Neurofeedback for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thirty-nine boys and girls aged 6-12 with rigorously diagnosed DSM-IV ADHD not currently taking medication will be twice-randomized: first to active neurofeedback (n=26) vs. sham neurofeedback (n=13), and simultaneously to 2 vs. 3 times a week treatment frequency (at least 18 in each frequency, 12 active and 6 sham) for 40 treatments. At treatment 24, major assessments will include measures of satisfaction and blinding, and subjects will be given the option of switching to the opposite treatment frequency for the remaining 16 treatments to generate a practical measure of schedule palatability. Major assessments (at baseline, treatment 12, treatment 24, treatment 40, and follow-up) will include measures of symptoms, functional impairment, academic performance/achievement, and neuropsychological tests of attention, vigilance, and executive functioning. Every 3 treatments parents will rate ADHD symptoms and every 6 treatments teachers will rate, to track the response curve over time. Baseline EEG arousal and ADHD subtype will be examined as possible moderators. By determining the optimal frequency and number of treatments and demonstrating feasibility of double blinding, this pilot study should pave the way for a definitive large RCT of neurofeedback.</detailed_description>
