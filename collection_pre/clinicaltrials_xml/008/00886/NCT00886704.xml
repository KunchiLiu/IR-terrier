	<brief_summary>An increase in intake of omega-3 fatty acids should increase the Omega-3 Index. Current evidence indicates that this may lead to a reduction in risk for sudden cardiac death and atherosclerotic diseases like myocardial infarction. The aim of the study is to investigate, how supplementing a convenience drink with omega-3 fatty acids influences the Omega-3 Index, as compared to an unsupplemented matching convenience drink. Palatability and safety of the drink are also to be assessed.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Subjects must meet the current guideline criteria for atherosclerosis, like coronary, peripheral or carotid artery disease, like previous myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome, coronary revascularization (operation or transluminally), or positive angiography or ultrasound. 2. Age: 30 75 years 3. Low Omega3 Index (&lt;5%) 4. Subjects must have adequate fluency in German or English to complete baseline and followup interviews. 5. Stable intake of food containing EPA+DHA before and during study 6. Subjects must be able and willing to give written informed consent, and to comply with study procedures. 1. Subjects for whom the intake of omega3 fatty acids is mandatory according to recent treatment guidelines or who take omega3 fatty acids supplements on a regular basis. 2. Patients consuming &gt;2 portions of fatty fish / week 3. Patients with serious bleeding disorder. Use of platelet inhibitors or anticoagulation with a target INR of 2.0 3.0 is not an exclusion criterion. 4. Subjects with any acute and lifethreatening condition, such as collapse and shock, acute myocardial infarction (last three months), stroke, embolism. 5. Subjects with significant medical comorbidity, seriously limiting life expectancy or insulintreated diabetes mellitis or a BMI&gt;30 6. Allergy/intolerance or history of hypersensitivity to components of study intervention, like lactose. 7. Pregnant subjects due to any possible teratogenic effects of study nutrition on the fetus and breastfeeding subjects. In addition, women of childbearing potential who will not practice a medically accepted method of contraception will be excluded. 8. Subjects who, in the investigator's judgement, will not likely be able to comply with the study protocol or with known drug or alcohol abuse/dependence in the past 2 years. 9. Use of any investigational agents within 30 days prior to t0</criteria>
