	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the six-minute-walking-distance of COPD-patients with breathing oxygen in comparison to breathing normal air. Patients, who increase their walking-distance about more than 15% or 35m only because of breathing oxygen, are so-called "Oxygen Responders." The study is aimed to find attributes of Oxygen Responder and to investigate, if a patient can change the "respond" with higher performance and endurance.</brief_summary>
