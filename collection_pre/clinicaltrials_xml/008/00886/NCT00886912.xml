	<brief_summary>Some studies suggest that high-altitude related illnesses - like acute mountain sickness - could be prevented by acclimatisation, reached at low altitude using training in simulated altitude. The purpose of this study is to determine whether training in hypoxia is suitable to prevent acute mountain sickness.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Training in Hypoxia to Prevent Acute Mountain Sickness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In a three week-period, healthy probands undergo 3 times a week a bicycle ergometer training in simulated altitude followed by 1 week passive exposure at simulated low altitude. 5 days after last exposure, a field study starts performing a rapid ascent to the Capanna Regina Margherita (4559m). Acute mountain sickness is assessed by established scoring systems.</detailed_description>
