	<brief_title>The Evaluation of Safety and Efficacy of JWHGWT on Diabetic Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>120 participants with diabetic neuropathy were screened in endocrine and metabolism clinics of Taichung Veterans General Hospital and Chinese Medical University Hospital . Subjects were randomly distributed into a double-blind, 12 weeks, placebo-controlled procedure. Subjects were measured by MNSI, SF-BPI, SF-36, SF -MCQ, NCV, AC sugar, HbA1c, lipid profiles, liver and kidney functions. Safety evaluations including GPT and creatinine revealed no deterioration after treatment. Several domains in MNSI, SF-BPI, SF-36, SF -MPQ questionnaires revealed significant improvements. F-wave in peroneal, tibial nerves and distal latency in tibial nerve in objective nerve conduction studies revealed significant improvements.</detailed_description>
