	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) treatable by PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) is to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of subcutaneously applied, pegylated granulocyte colony stimulating factor (Pegfilgrastim, PEG-G-CSF; NeulastaÂ®, Amgen Switzerland) with regard to the promotion of collateral growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peg-Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (GCSF) for Coronary Collateral Growth in Coronary Artery Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in industrialized countries. Current revascularization therapies are PCI or surgical revascularization. However, inherent to them are procedure-related risks and the fact, that progression of CAD is not prevented. Additionally, up to one fourth of all CAD patients are not amenable to standard revascularization therapies. Thus, there is a need for alternative therapies. The coronary collateral circulation is prevalent in humans, and in CAD the amount of collateral flow is a pivotal protective factor with respect to infarct size, all-cause- and cardiac mortality. Coronary collateral growth promotion is an alternative to conventional revascularization which can be achieved by cytokine-based approaches (e.g. with colony-stimulating factor-therapy) in humans. The goal of collateral promotion is to reduce myocardial damage in case of a coronary occlusion.</detailed_description>
