	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to: - clarify whether macrophage imaging using ferucarbotran is able to delineate the region of myocardial infarction as accurate as gadolinium-based necrosis/fibrosis imaging; - identify possible differences in infarct imaging using ferucarbotran for macrophage imaging compared to necrosis/fibrosis imaging with gadolinium-based compounds; and - evaluate which MRI pulse-sequences maximise sensitivity for macrophage imaging with ferucarbotran in the setting of acute myocardial infarction.</brief_summary>
