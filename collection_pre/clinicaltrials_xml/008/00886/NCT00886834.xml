	<brief_title>Misoprostol Prior to Intrauterine Device (IUD) Insertion in Nulliparous Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intrauterine Devices (IUDs) are an excellent method of contraception but are underutilized in the U.S. IUD use is expanding in the U.S. and is now routinely recommended for nulliparous women. The cervix of a nulliparous woman has a smaller diameter and can lead to more difficult and uncomfortable IUD insertions. Because of misoprostol's known ability to cause cervical dilation, some family planning providers use this drug to facilitate insertion. While there is a wealth of data on the use of misoprostol prior to many procedures requiring cervical dilation there is minimal objective evidence assessing its effect on provider ease of insertion or patient comfort during IUD insertion in nulliparas. The goal of this project is to evaluate whether misoprostol relative to placebo prior to IUD insertion in nulliparous women eases insertion and decreases pain. The results of this trial will be contributed to a prospective meta-analysis on the subject.</detailed_description>
