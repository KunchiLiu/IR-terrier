	<brief_summary>The objectives of this study are to estimate the efficacy and safety of the daily administration for 6 months of 5 mg versus 10 mg. A 6 month follow-up of subjects is carried out to estimate how the effects of mifepristone are kept in time. The hypothesis of this study is that both mifepristone doses reduce the volume of the myoma up to 50% in six months treatment.</brief_summary>
