	<brief_summary>Prospective, non-randomized, multicenter study in subjects with coronary artery chronic total occlusions (CTOs). Published results of safety and effectiveness of conventional techniques will be used for comparison. Enrollment of up to 149 subjects with a CTO refractory to currently marketed guidewire use and meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria at up to 15 US clinical sites. Hypothesis is that the BridgePoint Medical System is safe and effective in treating coronary CTOs compared to CTO literature.</brief_summary>
