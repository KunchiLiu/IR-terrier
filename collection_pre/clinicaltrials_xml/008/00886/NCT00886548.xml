	<brief_title>Echocardiographic Examination Performed by Nurses in Cardiac Intensive Care Unit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For a period of 1 year patients in our cardiac intensive care unit will be recruited to nurse-drive ultrasound and echocardiographic examinations, after informed consent. Nurses underwent a training programme and their skills are approved by cardiologist. Our department does not always have a cardiologist on duty and indication for nurse-driven ultrasound examination is decided by the doctor responsible for the treatment, who not always are trained in echocardiography/ultrasound. We aim to study the described hypothesis.</detailed_description>
