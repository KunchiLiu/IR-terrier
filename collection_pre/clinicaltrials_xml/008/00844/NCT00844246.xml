	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of implementing the AAP's recommendation that clinicians provide developmental surveillance at all well child visits and institute developmental screening at critical developmental periods in childhood, namely at 9, 18, 24 and 30 months of age. The study will also examine its acceptance by pediatric practices, its adoption and adaptation in urban pediatric practices, and the effectiveness of a developmental screening protocol that conforms to the AAP and Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) recommendations compared with that of developmental surveillance alone.</detailed_description>
