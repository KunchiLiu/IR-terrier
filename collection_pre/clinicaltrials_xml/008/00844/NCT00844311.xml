Two ovaries; 6. Tubal or unexplained infertility, including endometriosis stage I/II; 7. A uterus consistent with expected normal function (e.g. no clinically interfering uterine fibroids) documented by transvaginal ultrasound at the screening; 8.

Presence of unilateral or bilateral hydrosalpinx at ultrasound; 4. More than three previously COS cycles; 5. Previous poor response on an IVFcycle, defined as &gt;20 days of gonadotrophin stimulation, cancellation due to limited follicular response or less than four follicles of ³15 mm diameter; 6. Previous IVF cycle with unsuccessful fertilization, defined as fertilisation of £20% of the retrieved oocytes; 7. History of recurrent miscarriage; 8. FSH&gt;12IU/L or LH&gt;12UI/L (early follicular phase); 9. Contraindications for the use of gonadotropins or GnRH analogues; 10.

Current past (last 12 months) abuse of alcohol or drugs; 13. History of chemotherapy (except for gestational conditions) of radiotherapy; 14. Undiagnosed vaginal bleeding; 15. Tumours of the ovary, breast, adrenal gland, pituitary or hypothalamus and malformation of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy; 16. Abnormal karyotyping of the patient (if karyotyping is performed); 17. Hypersensitivity to any trial product.</criteria>
