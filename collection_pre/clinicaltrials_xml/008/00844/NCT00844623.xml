	<detailed_description>The study is a phase I clinical trial evaluating the intratumoral injection of defective adenovirus containing HSVtk (the thymidine kinase of herpes simplex virus), in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma that were not amenable to curative therapy. The study was conducted in a single center in Spain. Five consecutive cohorts of two patients received increasing doses of the vector by intratumoral injection and equal doses of either intravenous ganciclovir or oral valganciclovir. The dose received by each consecutive cohort of patients was progressively higher according to a prefixed scale.</detailed_description>
