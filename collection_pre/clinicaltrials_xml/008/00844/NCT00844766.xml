	<brief_summary>The hypothesis underlying this study is that whilst there is no home-screening test for lactose intolerance, this test would have significant value as lactose tolerance tests and breath hydrogen tests are expensive and time consuming. Therefore, it would be highly beneficial to validate a simple home-screening test. This study will validate a simple home-screening test that uses lactose and not milk.</brief_summary>
