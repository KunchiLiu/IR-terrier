	<brief_title>Exploring New Approaches in Reaching Behavior Post Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Analysis indicated that both methods improved reaching without trunk use Reaching performance scale (RPS), but the trunk -stabilized group led to more significant changes. Training under less restrictive conditions associated with Task-Related Training (TRT) (auditory feedback from trunk sensor) as compared to stabilized TRT, led to improved functional and impairment measure scores (WMFT, FM and shoulder flexion). Conclusion: Fading feedback with both training methods, during extended TRT reaching/grasping practice generally led to some improvements. However, as demonstrated by impairment and functional outcome measures, using TRT with an auditory feedback signals is a more effective approach than forcing the stabilization of the trunk during rehabilitation of the upper-limb.</detailed_description>
