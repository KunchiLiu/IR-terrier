	<brief_summary>Study objective: Feasibility and efficacy of a standardised psychosocial intervention (psychoeducation) in substituted opioid dependent patients</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Psychoeducation Reaches HCV-infected Methadone/Buprenorphine Substituted Patients in Standard Antiviral Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective: - Retention in antiviral treatment (feasibility) Secondary objectives: - Mental Health Mental health is monitored by means of the Symptom Checklist 90-R (SCL-90-R). Its sum score, the Global Severity Index (GSI), serves as indicator. Mental health will be regarded as stable in case of a change of less than 6 GSI-points, otherwise mental health will be regarded as improved (GSI - 6 points) or decreased (GSI + 6 points). - Course of Addiction Course of addiction under antiviral treatment will be monitored according to retention in substitution treatment, compliance with scheduled visits, and co-consumption of illicit drugs (patients record, urinalysis). - Sustained viral response (SVR) SVR as measured by polymerase chain reaction 6 months after per protocol antiviral treatment (ITT-analysis).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Women and men at the age of 18 to 70 years Opiate dependence according to ICD10 Stable substitution (i.e. either keeping the last 5 dates or fulfilling criteria for the Take Home assignment) Proof of HCV by means of PCR Patient must be therapy naive regarding the hepatitis C (no preceding treatment attempts with interferon and/or Ribavirin) Ability to comprehend und follow the study protocol Compensated liver disease with the following haematological and biochemical minimum criteria: 1. Leukocytes ≥ 3.000/mm3 2. Neutrophile granulocytes ≥ 1.500/mm3 3. Thrombocytes ≥ 90.000/mm3 4. Direct and indirect bilirubin within the standard range (if not factors, which are not hepatitisconditioned, as M. Meulengracht, represent an explanation for the increase of the indirect bilirubin; in these cases the indirect bilirubin must be less than 3.0 mg/dl or 51.3 µmol/l) 5. Albumin within the standard range 6. Creatinine within the standard range TSH (Thyreotropine) within the standard range of the test laboratory Normal blood sugar value for nondiabetics or haemoglobin A1c max. 8.5% for diabetics (induced by pharmacotherapy and/or diet controls). An eye examination is required in diabetics. Haemoglobin values ≥ 12 mg/dl for women and/or ≥ 13 mg/dl for men ANA ≤ 1:160 In patients with cirrhosis or transition to cirrhosis: exclusion of hepatocellular carcinoma Readiness to abstain from alcohol during interferon treatment. Negative pregnancy test in female patients within 24 hours before the first dose Regular confirmation that sexual active women at the age capable of childbearing and/or sexual active men use two reliable methods of contraception during interferon / ribavirin treatment and six months thereafter, one contraception method with barrier effect (e.g. condom, diaphragm) Female patients may not breastfeed during interferon / ribavirin treatment. Decompensated liver cirrhosis (ChildPugh B or C) Haemochromatosis Lack of Alfa1Antitrypsin (homozygote PIZZ) MorbusWilson positive proof of HBsAg, anti HIV or anti HAV IgM antibodies Autoimmune diseases (e.g. autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune thyroid disease, rheumatoid arthritis) Kidney failure (Creatinine &gt; 1,5 mg/dl) Liver or kidneytransplantation Hyperlipidemia (Cholesterol &gt; 1,5times above the upper standard value) Clinically manifested gout Severe heart insufficiency Severe coronary heart disease Patients with cardiac pacemaker Severe chronic pulmonary diseases (e.g. COPD) Serious psychological illness, in particular severe depression Epilepsy Oesophagus varicose in the prehistory Patient with high anaemia risk (e.g. Thalassaemia) Retinopathy Severe other illness Patients, who cannot follow the study conditions Male partners of pregnant women Current desire to have children / no safe contraception under therapy and until including 6 months after study end Participation in a clinical study within the last 6 months</criteria>
