	<brief_title>Near to Infrared (NIR) Light Neuroprotection in Glaucomatous Optic Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ganglion cell dysfunction in glaucomatous optic neuropathy has been ascribed to ganglion cell electrophysiological inactivation and to apoptotic cell death. Near-to-infrared light stimulation has been used to induce mitochondrial activation and to prevent apoptotic death through mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase c stimulation. Near-to-infrared light stimulation might be useful to induce ganglion cell activation and inhibit apoptotic cell death. We propose that near-to-infrared light stimulation can be used as an adjuvant treatment combined with ocular hypotensive treatment in glaucomatous patients.</detailed_description>
