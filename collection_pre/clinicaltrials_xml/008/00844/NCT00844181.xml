	<brief_summary>Our central hypothesis is that baroreflex sensitivity is attenuated in black women compared to white women, and that this dysregulation will be apparent during orthostatic challenges. We expect that the cumulative stress index (CSI), a measure of maximal orthostatic tolerance, is higher in Black women (BW) compared to White women (WW).</brief_summary>
