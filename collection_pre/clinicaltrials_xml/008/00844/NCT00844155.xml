	<brief_summary>This proposed pharmacokinetic study will test the hypothesis that in critically ill patients with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation such as might be anticipated to be needed to treat patients with severe influenza pneumonia, oseltamivir administered enterally via nasogastric tube, with and without concomitant food or alimentation, will have similar oral bioavailability to that observed in ambulatory adults ill with influenza in whom oseltamivir therapy 75 mg BID is efficacious and well tolerated. Additionally, this experiment will test the hypothesis that increasing the dose (150 mg), with and without concomitant enteral feeding, will show a proportionate increase in bioavailability. Relative oral bioavailability will be assessed from plasma concentration vs. time over 12 hrs and urinary recovery of drug from 0 to 48 hrs after administration.</brief_summary>
