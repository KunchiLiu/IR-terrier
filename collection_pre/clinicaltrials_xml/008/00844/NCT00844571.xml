	<brief_title>Effect E-learning Program About Child Maltreatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Child abuse and neglect represents an international problem with high prevalence and unacceptable levels of morbidity and mortality. Many children are seen each day in the accident and emergency departement of an hospital. Therefore the A&amp;E departement have an important role in the identification of child maltreatment. The lack of an effective teaching program together with the failures in the child protection process has encouraged the development of a clinical-practice-oriented e-learning program on detecting child maltreatment. We will investigate the effect of this e-learning program.</detailed_description>
