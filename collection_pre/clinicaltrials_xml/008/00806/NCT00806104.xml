	<brief_summary>Fructo-oligosaccharides are known as prebiotic ingredients to modulate the composition of the intestinal microbiota and particularly to stimulate the growth of Bifidobacteria. Imbalance of the intestinal microbiota such as reduction of Bifidobacteria is implicated in Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Thus the objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of fructo-oligosaccharides to improve IBS score and to explore which modifications of the microbiota are responsible of this improvement.</brief_summary>
