	<brief_title>A Randomized, Double-Blind, Parallel-Arm, Placebo and Active Controlled Dose-Ranging Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Multiple Doses of Tapentadol IR for Postoperative Pain Following Bunionectomy Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tapentadol hydrochloride is a centrally active analgesic (antinociceptive) compound. This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo- and active-controlled dose study in men and nonpregnant, nonlactating women. The patients were at least 18 and no more than 75 years of age and experienced moderate to severe pain within 9 hours after removal of postoperative analgesia. The surgery was a standardized first metatarsal bunionectomy. Treatment of postsurgical pain after the 9 hr period was with either placebo, tapentadol, or oxycodone using various dosing regimens. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these treatments on total pain relief and total change in pain intensity over 12 hours and reporting of adverse events, laboratory values, vital signs, and ECGs. Secondary objectives included evaluation of several other pain measures, and drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Six patient treatment groups received study medication orally at 0, 4, and 8 hours with one of the following dosing regimens: 1) placebo, placebo, and placebo, 2) 93 mg, 93 mg, and 93 mg tapentadol IR, 3) 140 mg, 140 mg, and 140 mg tapentadol IR, 4) 140 mg, 70 mg, and 70 mg tapentadol IR, 5) 186 mg, 93 mg, and 93 mg tapentadol IR, and 6) 10 mg, 10 mg, and 10 mg oxycodone IR.</detailed_description>
