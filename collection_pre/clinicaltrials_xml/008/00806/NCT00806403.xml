	<brief_summary>The main objective is to compare a fibrinolytic strategy with an interventional strategy initiated as early as possible, preferably in the pre-hospital phase, with respect to resolution of ST-segment elevation at 120 minutes after inclusion and Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade evaluated at a mandated coronary angiography 5 to 7 days after inclusion.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients in the fibrinolytic group received an intravenous injection of 30 mg enoxaparin followed by subcutaneous injections of 1 mg/kg body weight every 12 hours during hospital stay. Patients in the invasive group were given an intravenous injection of enoxaparin of (0.75 mg/kg body weight) and abciximab as a intravenous bolus (0.25 mg/kg body weight) followed by a 12 hour infusion (10 microg/minute). Secondary outcome measures were death, myocardial infarction and stroke alone or as a composite at 30 days. Data on use of health care resources, loss of production and health-related quality of life were collected during one year. Cost-effectiveness was determined by comparing costs and quality-adjusted survival.</detailed_description>
