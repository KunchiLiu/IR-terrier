	<brief_title>An Ascending Multi-Dose, Tolerance and Pharmacokinetic Study in Obese or Overweight Type 2 Diabetic Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Different amounts of trodusquemine (MSI-1436) will be given to each volunteer group throughout the study. Another purpose is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK - the study of the way the drug enters and leaves the blood and tissues over time) of trodusquemine (MSI-1436). Finally, this study will also determine whether trodusquemine (MSI-1436) has any effect on appetite, mood or behavior, and selective biomarkers (substances in your blood that may change in response to the study drug).</detailed_description>

Insulin requiring diabetics; 8. any subject who has received any known hepatic or renal clearance altering agents (eg, erythromycin, cimetidine, barbiturates, phenothiazines, St. John's Wort, etc.) within a period of 90 days prior to the first dose of study medication; 9. any subject who has received any approved prescription antiobesity drug or has taken any overthecounter medication for weight loss or who has received a thiazolidinedione or exanatide within a period of 90 days prior to the first dose of study medication; 10. ingestion or use of any investigational medication or device within 60 days prior to the first dose of study medication; ingestion or use of any investigational antiobesity medication is prohibited within 3 months prior to the first dose of study medication; 11. any subject with history of malignancy in last 5 years, with exception of basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin; 12. any subject who is positive for HBsAG, Hepatitis C antibody, Hepatitis A IgM, or Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Viral Serology tests at the screening visit; 13. a positive qualitative urine drug or alcohol test at screening or at checkin; 14. mental capacity is limited to the extent that the subject cannot provide legal consent or understand information regarding the study; 15. any subject who has had a 10% weight loss in the past 3 months prior to the screening visit.</criteria>
