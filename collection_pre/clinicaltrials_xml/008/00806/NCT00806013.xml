	<brief_title>Study the Effects of CYP2C Polymorphisms on the Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Glipizide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Compared with CYP2C19, CYP2C9 polymorphism appears to have a dominant role in glipizide pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in vivo. This indicated that dose adjustment based on CYP2C9 genotype may improve antidiabetic treatment.</detailed_description>
