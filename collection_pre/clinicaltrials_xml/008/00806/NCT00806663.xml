	<brief_summary>This is an open label single arm prospective multicenter Phase II study in around 20 patients. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether the addition of sunitinib to FOLFIRI results in a significant reduction of tumor vessel permeability (TVP) and blood flow (BF) measured by DCE-MRI and DCE-USI, measured on liver metastases. Secondary objectives are antitumor response, time to progression (TTP), effect on pharmacokinetics of sunitinib and biomarkers (VEGF und soluble VEGF-receptor) and drug/treatment safety.</brief_summary>
