	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to obtain young white blood cells (monocytes) from the investigators donated blood for research into how these cells change into large, mature white blood cells (macrophages) and how smoking causes Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our research goal is to identify new targets and strategies to help care for patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). COPD is a chronic airway inflammatory disorder characterized by a progressive loss of pulmonary function. Mononuclear phagocytes are known to be critically involved in both repair/remodeling and destructive events in COPD. Although smoking is the chief environmental risk factor for COPD, the molecular details responsible for the genesis and progression of smoking-mediated COPD require further investigation. In searching for new knowledge and research strategies for this challenging topic, we have made substantial progress in mononuclear phagocyte proteomics and laid the groundwork for this translational research of COPD.</detailed_description>
