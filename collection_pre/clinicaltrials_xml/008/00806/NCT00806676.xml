	<brief_summary>People with chronic kidney disease are known to have immune response abnormalities, including a diminished response to some vaccinations. Those with chronic kidney disease have a disproportionate burden of HPV 6-, 11-, 16- and/or 18-related genital tract disease. Due to immune response abnormalities, the CKD population may or may not respond to the recommended three-dose regimen of Gardasil速, a vaccine intended to protect against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, and 18-related genital tract disease. The objective of this study is to measure the antibody response to Gardasil速 in female patients 9-21 years of age with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (Stage 1-4), end-stage kidney disease (Stage 5 CKD), and status-post kidney transplant. Gardasil速 vaccine will be administered according to the FDA-approved schedule. Blood samples to measure antibody levels to vaccine strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) will be obtained at months 0, 7 and 24.</brief_summary>
