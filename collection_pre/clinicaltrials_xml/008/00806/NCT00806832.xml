	<brief_summary>Cataract surgery is the most prevalent surgical procedure. Since most candidates are elderly patients, hypertension is common among these patients. Preoperative anxiety and tension may cause elevation of patient's heart rate and blood pressure and thus expose them to serious potential complications such as stroke and myocardial infarction. Medical clowns are known to reduce preoperative anxiety of both children and their parents. It is possible therefore that medical clown may have such a beneficial effect also on patients scheduled for cataract surgery under local anesthesia.</brief_summary>
