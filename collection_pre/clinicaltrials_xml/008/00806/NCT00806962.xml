	<brief_summary>Randomized, double blind, multi-site, study in healthy adults, comparing safety and immunogenicity of two dosage levels of Norwalk VLP Vaccine with adjuvant/excipients and with placebo controls Primary Objective: - Safety as determined by occurrence of local intranasal symptoms or other symptoms as reported by a self-administered memory aid for 7 days after each vaccination and hematology, blood chemistry and physical examinations performed by the clinical research staff - Subjects will also be monitored for Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and onset of any new medical conditions for 180 days following the last study vaccinations (Day 201). Secondary Objectives Evaluations of immunogenicity as determined by: - Geometric mean titers and seroconversion rate of serum anti- Norwalk VLP IgG and IgA - Stimulation of anti-Norwalk VLP IgA antibody secreting cells (ASC) - Presence of antigen specific memory B-cell response Cells will be collected and stored for possible future evaluation of Norwalk VLP-specific cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses Study Hypothesis: The incidence of adverse events after intranasal Norwalk VLP Vaccine will be the same as the incidence of adverse events after intranasal adjuvant/excipients alone. Norwalk VLP Vaccine and adjuvant/excipients will have a higher incidence of mild to moderate nasal adverse events compared to placebo but similar incidence of other adverse events. Two doses of the 100 µg of Norwalk VLP Vaccine will be more immunogenic than two doses of 50 µg of Norwalk VLP Vaccine. The post-vaccination serum antibody responses, the number of antibody secreting cells (ASC) and IgG and IgA memory B-cell responses directed against Norwalk Virus antigen will be increased after Norwalk VLP Vaccine compared to adjuvant/excipients and to placebo.</brief_summary>

Agrees not to participate in another clinical trial with an investigational product for the entire duration of the study (six months after the last study dose i.e. 201 days) 8. Agrees to storage of unused clinical specimens for an indefinite period of time only for those specimens collected by the University of Maryland CVD for use in future research at the CVD.

Blood Type B or AB, regardless of Rh + or 3. Allergies or hypersensitivity to chitosan, shrimp, other shellfish or any component of the vaccine, adjuvant/excipients or placebo 4. History of nasal surgery of any type (including tonsilectomy/adenoidectomy) 5.

Hypertension (BP &gt; 140/90 mm Hg on two separate days) 7. Any lab abnormality, as listed below: Neutrophils (WBC) outside the normal range Hemoglobin outside the normal range (may be repeated once if outside this limit) Platelet count outside the normal range (may be repeated once if outside this limit) Creatinine outside the normal range (may be repeated once if outside this limit) Glucose &gt; upper limit of normal (may be repeated once if outside this limit) AST or ALT outside the normal range (may be repeated once if outside this limit) Positive serology for hepatitis C or HIV antibody or hepatitis B surface antigen 8.

Previous participation in a study of Norovirus vaccines 12. Medical, occupational, or family problems as a result of alcohol or illicit drug use during the past 12 months 13. Receipt of an investigational vaccine or drug within 28 days before administration of Norwalk VLP Vaccine, adjuvant/excipients or placebo 14. Other condition that in the clinical judgment of the investigator would jeopardize the safety or rights of a subject participating in the trial, would render the subject unable to comply with the protocol or would interfere with the evaluation of the vaccine 15.
