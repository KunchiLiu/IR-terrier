	<detailed_description>This prospective, monocenter pilot case series was conducted between May 2006 and November 2008. Patients were included because of DME and signs of pre- and early proliferation because of diabetic retinopathy.73 eyes of 56 patients were included, all of which had signed an informed consent to perform a pharmacosurgical procedure consisting of a 23 gauge core Pars Plana Vitrectomy (sutureless single stitch sclerotomy, cutter with 300 cuts/minute) with removement of 1.5ml vitreous and substitution with 1ml BSS, 8mg triamcinolone, and 1.25 mg bevacizumab. At baseline and follow-up, the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA; 6 m Snellen), and intraocular pressure (IOP; Goldmann tonometry), and central macular thickness (optical coherence tomography) were determined. In addition, the need for further treatment and adverse events were monitored.</detailed_description>
