	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, open-label, two-arm, 2-stage, Phase 2 study of NKTR-102 in patients with metastatic or locally advanced platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Approximately 70 patients will be randomized 1:1 into one of two treatment arms. NKTR-102 will be administered at a dose level of 145 mg/m2 in both arms. In Arm A, NKTR-102 will be given on a q14d schedule. In Arm B, NKTR-102 will be given on a q21d schedule. After the initial 70 patients have been enrolled, Arm B will enroll approximately 110 additional patients.</brief_summary>
