	<brief_summary>Exercise is an important clinical feature in cystic fibrosis. Better exercise capacity has been associated with better patient outcomes and quality of life. Exercise-induced bronchospasm is a condition, often associated with asthma, which may make exercise difficult. The role that exercise-induced bronchospasm has in people with cystic fibrosis is unknown. This study is designed to determine how often exercise-induced bronchospasm occurs in cystic fibrosis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We anticipate that Visit 1 will take approximately three hours. This will include obtaining informed consent, completing baseline demographic and quality of life questionnaires, brief physical exam, measuring exhaled nitric oxide level, skin allergy testing, obtaining blood and sputum samples, and performing pulmonary function testing before and after bronchodilators. Visit 2 will take approximately two and one-half hours. This will include performing Eucapnic Voluntary Hyperventilation, measuring exhaled nitric oxide levels, and obtaining blood and sputum samples. Visit 3 will take approximately two and one-half hours. This will include performing Cardiopulmonary exercise testing followed by serial spirometry, measuring exhaled nitric oxide levels, and obtaining blood and sputum samples.</detailed_description>
