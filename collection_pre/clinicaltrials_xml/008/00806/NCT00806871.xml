	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of injecting steroid into the carpal tunnel in relieving symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome for at least 1 year with outcomes measured with patient evaluated symptoms score.Out of the patients referred by primary care, those with a clinical diagnosis of CTS who have tried wrist splint and whose symptom severity is judged by the examining surgeon to warrant surgery are offered to be put on the waiting list for carpal tunnel release. This means a waiting time of approximately 3 months. Patients who give informed consent will be asked to attend the outpatient clinic for a physical examination followed by allocation to one of the three trial groups. Immediately following the allocation the patients will receive the assigned treatment.</brief_summary>
