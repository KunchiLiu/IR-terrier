	<detailed_description>Subjects with documented uterine fibroids, screening UFS-QOL severity score of at least 40, and meeting other eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study.

The study duration is approximately six months, comprised of a one-month screening period, 4 month treatment period and one month follow-up period. Subjects' blood will be drawn in a fasting state to obtain the pre-dose trough (PK) levels of study drug at each study drug dosing/dispensation visit to determine the potential for drug accumulation.</detailed_description>
