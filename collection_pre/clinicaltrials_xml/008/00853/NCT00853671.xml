	<brief_summary>The investigators propose a novel technique using dual source multidetector computed tomography (DSCT) where information on both coronary anatomy and myocardial perfusion is obtained in a single scan. The investigators hypothesize that a coronary CTA protocol can be devised to obtain resting myocardial perfusion, myocardial perfusion after stress, and coronary anatomy. Hence, one diagnostic test will be able to detect the presence of coronary plaque as well as assess the functional significance of a stenosis.</brief_summary>
