	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Sunitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Infusing irradiated donor lymphocytes into the patient may help the patient's immune system kill tumor cells. Giving sunitinib together with irradiated donor lymphocytes may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving sunitinib together with irradiated donor lymphocytes works in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sunitinib and Irradiated Donor Lymphocytes in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine progression-free survival of patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma treated with sunitinib and irradiated allogeneic lymphocytes. Secondary - Determine rates and kinetics of clinical/radiographic response in these patients. - Determine toxicities associated with treatment in these patients. - Assess stable disease at 6 months in these patients. - Assess overall survival of these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning with course 2 of sunitinib malate, patients also receive irradiated allogeneic lymphocytes IV over 1 hour every 8-16 weeks for up to 6 infusions in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 60 days.</detailed_description>
