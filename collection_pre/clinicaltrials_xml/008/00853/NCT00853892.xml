	<criteria>1. Males or nonpregnant, nonlactating females, 18 years of age or older. 2. Female subjects must be postmenopausal for at least one year, surgically sterile, or practicing adequate nonhormonal contraception for at least 3 months prior to and for the duration of study participation. All female subjects will undergo a pregnancy test at screening and at checkin to the clinical study site for every dosing period. The results of the test must be negative for continued participation. 3. Weight must be within 15% of the ideal weight for height and frame, as adopted by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., 1999. 4. Qualifying subjects must be in good health and physical condition as determined by a screening medical history obtained within 30 days prior to study start. Subjects should not present with a history of significant past illness expected to affect the investigation. 5. The normal status of subjects will be confirmed by the following procedures: 1. Laboratory tests (serum chemistry, hematology, urinalysis). A subject with laboratory values that are not within the clinical laboratory's reference range does not qualify, unless specifically accepted (with comment) by the investigator. 2. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), drugs of abuse, alcohol, and hepatitis B and C testing will be performed at screening. Results of these tests must be negative or nonreactive for subjects to qualify for the study. At each checkin to the study site, a urine drug screen will be performed that must be negative for continued participation. 3. Electrocardiogram: A 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be obtained for all subjects at screening. Appropriately trained and experienced medical personnel must interpret this ECG. A subject with an ECG that is not within normal range does not qualify, unless specifically accepted (with comment) by the investigator. 6. Subjects must be able to provide written consent and agree to abide by the study requirements. 1. History of chronic alcohol, drug, or narcotic abuse. 2. Chronic use of tranquilizers, sedatives, aspirin, antibiotics, or other medications. 3. History or presence of major organ dysfunction. 4. History of malignancy, stroke, or diabetes; cardiac, renal, liver, pulmonary, or severe gastrointestinal disease; or other serious illness. 5. History of anxiety, tension, severe agitation, psychosis, or mental depression. 6. Family history or diagnosis of epilepsy or other seizure disorder. 7. History of acute abdominal or pelvic conditions. 8. History of conditions which might contraindicate or require caution be used in the administration of oxycodone, including renal impairment, hepatobiliary or pancreatic disease, GI obstruction, cardiac disease, obstructive pulmonary disease, acute or severe bronchial asthma, hypercarbia, elevated intracranial pressure, depleted blood volume, paralytic ileus, or allergy to oxycodone, or history of hypersensitivity to any opiate agonist 9. Administration of any other investigational drug during the 30 days prior to enrollment into the study. 10. Subjects who have smoked or used nicotinecontaining products within 6 months prior to study entry. 11. Subjects who have donated blood within 30 days prior to study entry, including that withdrawn during the conduct of any other clinical study. 12. Subjects presenting with acute illness. 13. Subjects who have taken prescription drugs within 14 days or overthecounter medications (including herbal preparations) within 7 days prior to dosing except for standard daily dose multivitamins. 14. Subjects who have a positive Narcan® challenge.</criteria>
