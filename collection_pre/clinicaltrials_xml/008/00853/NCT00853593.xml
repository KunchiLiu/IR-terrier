	<brief_summary>This study is designed to show that a new lead, which paces the left bottom chamber (left ventricle) of the heart, is safe and effective. Using a lead on the left side of the heart has been shown to potentially improve heart failure symptoms. The shape and size of this new lead may make it a good choice for patients or physicians.</brief_summary>
