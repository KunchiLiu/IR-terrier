	<brief_summary>In Central Vietnam, forest malaria remains difficult to control due to the complex interactions between human, vector and environmental factors. Untreated bednets had a significantly protecting effect for villagers, except for those regularly sleeping in the forest, who suffer a significantly higher number of clinical attacks. Thus, there is need to target this high-risk group with new intervention based on long-lasting insecticidal materials. Hammocks are extensively used by people working in the forest, therefore long-lasting insecticidal hammocks (LLIH) could achieve a good individual protection. The Investigators proposed to evaluate their effectiveness in a community-based trial, comparing them to the standard vector control methods (insecticide-treated nets).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Cluster Randomized Trial to Evaluate Long Lasting Insecticidal Hammocks to Prevent Forest Malaria in Vietnam</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Central Vietnam, forest malaria remains difficult to control due to the complex interactions between human, vector and environmental factors. A community-based study carried out between 1999 and 2001 showed that regular forest activity was a strong risk factor for malaria infection. Untreated bednets had a significantly protecting effect for villagers, except for those regularly sleeping in the forest, who suffered a significantly higher number of clinical attacks. Thus, there is need to target this high-risk group with new intervention based on long-lasting insecticidal materials. Hammocks are extensively used by people working in the forest, therefore long-lasting insecticidal hammocks (LLIH) could achieve a good individual protection. The Investigators proposed to evaluate their effectiveness in a community-based trial, comparing them to the standard vector control methods (insecticide-treated nets): communities have been grouped into clusters of about 1000 Ã®nhabitants, and clusters were randomized to either the active intervention or the active control, and followed up for 24 month.</detailed_description>
