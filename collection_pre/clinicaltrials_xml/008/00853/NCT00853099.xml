	<brief_title>A Study of Adalimumab in Japanese Subjects With Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria are randomized 1:1:1 to receive subcutaneous injections of adalimumab at either 160/80 mg at Week 0/2 and 40 mg every other week (eow) starting at Week 4 to Week 50, 80/40 mg at Week 0/2 and 40 mg eow starting at Week 4 to Week 50, or placebo eow starting at Week 0 to Week 50 under the double-blind condition. At or after Week 8, participants who have inadequate response during the double-blind period can switch to the rescue arm, where participants from the placebo group initially receive adalimumab 160 mg and 80 mg 2 weeks later and those from the adalimumab group receive adalimumab 40 mg initially and 2 weeks later under double-blind conditions. All participants in the rescue arm then receive 40 mg adalimumab eow until Week 50. Participants who complete the 52-week double-blind period receive open-label adalimumab 40 mg eow starting at Week 52 and continuing until the end of the study. Participants who have an inadequate response or disease flare can dose escalate to 80 mg eow at or after Week 60. Participants who dose escalate to 80 mg eow and continue to have an inadequate response or disease flare are withdrawn from the study.</detailed_description>

And/or At least a consecutive 90day course of azathioprine or 6mercaptopurine (6MP) prior to Baseline, with a dose of azathioprine ≥ 50 mg/day or 6MP ≥ 30 mg/day, or a dose that was the highest tolerated by the patient.
