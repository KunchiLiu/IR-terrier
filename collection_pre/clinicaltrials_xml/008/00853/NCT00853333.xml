	<brief_title>Sedation and Pain (The Effect of IV Sedation on Pain Perception)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose to contrast and compare the effect of propofol and midazolam, two GABA-related sedative drugs, and dexmedetomidine, an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, on pain perception in human volunteers by asking a participant to rate their pain and by evaluating a subject's brain activation using fMRI.</detailed_description>
