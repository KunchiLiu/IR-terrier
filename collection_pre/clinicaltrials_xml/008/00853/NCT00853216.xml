	<criteria>1. Males or nonpregnant, nonlactating females, 18 years of age or older. 2. Female subjects must be postmenopausal for at least one year, or surgically sterile, or practicing adequate nonhormonal contraception for at least 3 months prior to and for the duration of study participation. All female subjects will undergo a pregnancy test at screening and at checkin to the clinical study site for every dosing period. The results of the test must be negative for continued participation. 3. Weight must be within 15% of the ideal weight for height and frame, as adopted by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., 1993. 4. Qualifying subjects must be in good health and physical condition as determined by a screening medical history obtained within 30 days prior to study start. Subjects should not present with a history of significant past illness expected to affect the investigation. 5. The normal status of subjects will be confirmed by the following procedures: 1. Laboratory tests (chemistry, hematology, urinalysis) 2. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis, alcohol, and "drugs of abuse" testing will be done for screening purposes only. Results of the HIV, hepatitis, and "drugs of abuse" tests must be negative or nonreactive for subjects to qualify for the study. 3. Electrocardiogram: A 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be obtained for all subjects. This ECG must be interpreted by appropriately trained and experienced medical personnel. A subject with an ECG that is not within normal range does not qualify, unless specifically accepted (with comment) by the investigator. 6. Subjects must be able to provide written consent and agree to abide by the study requirements. 1. History of alcohol, drug, or narcotic abuse or dependence. 2. Chronic use of tranquilizers, sedatives, aspirin, antibiotics, or other medications. 3. History or presence of major organ dysfunction. 4. History of cardiac disorder, malignancy, stroke, or diabetes; renal, liver, pulmonary, or severe gastrointestinal disease; or other serious illness. 5. History of anxiety, tension, severe agitation, psychosis, or mental depression. 6. Family history or diagnosis of epilepsy or other seizure disorder. 7. History of acute abdominal conditions. 8. History of conditions that might contraindicate or require caution be used in the administration of oxycodone including: renal impairment, hepatobiliary or pancreatic disease, GI obstruction, cardiac disease, obstructive pulmonary disease, acute or severe bronchial asthma, hypercarbia, elevated intracranial pressure, depleted blood volume, paralytic ileus, or allergy to oxycodone or any opiate agonists. 9. Administration of any other investigational drug during the 30 days prior to enrollment into the study. 10. Subjects who smoke or have a history of smoking, or use nicotinecontaining products. 11. Subjects who have donated blood within 30 days prior to study entry, including that withdrawn during the conduct of any other clinical study. 12. Subjects presenting with acute illness. 13. Subjects who have taken prescription drugs within 14 days or overthecounter medications (including herbal preparations) within 7 days prior to dosing except for standard daily dose multivitamins.</criteria>
