	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether lipoprotein(a), also called Lp(a), is a risk factor for cardiovascular (heart) disease. Lipoproteins are tiny particles that circulate in the blood. They contain cholesterol, fat, and protein in varying amounts depending on the body's need. Higher levels of lipoproteins in the blood can cause an increased risk of heart disease. The investigators believe that by studying the Lp(a) lipoprotein in Caucasians and African Americans, the investigators can assess for genetic variation factors related to cardiovascular (heart) disease. The investigators will be looking at 100 African-American families and 100 Caucasian families to confirm whether a higher Lp(a) level is an indicator of a higher risk for heart disease.</brief_summary>
