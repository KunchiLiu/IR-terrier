	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the immune response to 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (13vPnCV) in children who as infants received either a complete series of PnCV versus a combination of PnCV and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PSV). This study is also intended to evaluate the safety of the 13vPnC.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Fully vaccinated children who participated in a previous Wyeth study (Study D139P506) and received a booster dose of either 23valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) or pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PnCV) per the original protocol for that study. Subjects must be in good health as determined by medical history, physical examination and clinical judgment. Known allergy to any component of the 7valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7vPnC) or 13valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (13vPnC). History of documented invasive pneumococcal disease (defined as a positive culture of S. pneumoniae from a normally sterile body site). Any known or suspected disease or dysfunction of the immune system, including: HIV infection, Malignancy, Receipt of immunosuppressive therapy, Sickle cell hemoglobinopathy. Receipt of immuneglobulin within the past 3 months. Receipt of either PSV or 7vPnCV since the completion of Study D139P506.</criteria>
