	<brief_summary>Vigorous fluid resuscitation is currently believed to play a key role in reducing complications associated with acute pancreatitis. However, aggressive fluid replacement can be associated with complications such as pulmonary fluid sequestration. The purpose of this study is to evaluate alternative approaches to early fluid resuscitation for patients with acute pancreatitis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Goal-directed Fluid Resuscitation in Acute Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Aim: Evaluate the impact of a goal-directed fluid resuscitation protocol compared to standard fluid resuscitation on systemic inflammation in patients with acute pancreatitis. Secondary Aim: Evaluate the impact of resuscitation with Lactated Ringer's compared to normal saline on systemic inflammation in acute pancreatitis.</detailed_description>
