	<brief_summary>The data collected through this pilot study will allow us to increase our understanding of cancer cachexia and the effect of Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) on cancer cachexia. Our long-term goal is to improve nutritional treatment and reduce illness in the cancer patient population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study of Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) in Patients With Cancer Cachexia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People who have cancer can get what is called cancer cachexia (CC). The symptoms of CC include getting full quickly when eating (early satiety), loss of appetite, weakness resulting in weight loss and loss of lean body mass. Even a weight loss of 5% in cancer patients reflects poor health, hospitalization, and a higher rate of illness. Research shows that the elderly are at higher risk for deficiency of vitamins and trace minerals. Other pre-existing chronic diseases and drug therapies in this population may increase the needs of certain nutrients. Recent studies have also shown that advanced malnutrition is much more difficult to treat in the elderly than in younger adults, and the consequences of failure to treat it delays recovery and can decrease function and quality of life. At this time, the ways to treat CC include giving medications to increase appetite and giving nutritional supplements that are high in calories and protein. Recent studies have shown that certain types of fats that are present in fish, walnuts and other foods that we eat called Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) may help with weight gain, especially gain in muscle and improve quality of life in patients with pancreatic cancer. However, EPA has never been studied in prevention of cancer cachexia in cancer patients showing early signs of weight loss. Based on these early, small studies, it is clear that we need to study if and how EPA can prevent loss of muscle and weight in cancer patients and prevent this from becoming worse.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men and Women 2580 years of age (inclusive) Confirmed diagnosis of Cancer (other than pancreatic cancer) Unintentional weight loss of &gt;5% of body weight within 3 months of admission to the study Use of effective means of contraception (men and women) in patients of childbearing potential Normal baseline liver function tests (LFTs) as determined by alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC)) version 3 grade 1 elevation in ALT (&gt;Upper Limit of Normal[UNL]2.5 x UNL) withhold admitting participant to the study until recovery to normal; LFTs will be considered valid for consideration of eligibility if drawn within the previous 2 weeks, otherwise new labs will be drawn. Able and willing to give written informed consent : Each participant must be aware of the nature of his current medical condition and must be willing to give consent after being informed of the experimental nature of therapy, alternatives, potential benefits, sideeffects, risks and discomforts. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 2 (Karnofsky score &gt;60%) Concurrent use of coumadin or warfarin is okay. The followup monitoring for prothrombin (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR) for patients on warfarin and/or coumadin will follow the standard of care as dictated by the prescribing physician. If the prescribing physician is not a Moffitt physician, then the prescribing physician will be notified by the research staff of the subject participating in the study, and monitors for PT, PTT and INR will be obtained from patient during the 6 week study for review. Patients with current diagnosis or history of pancreatic cancer Current use of anticoagulants other than coumadin, warfarin, or aspirin Use of other nutritional supplements other than multivitamins and minerals Allergy to fish or seafood Using Marinol or Megace Known history of hepatic or renal disease Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, or may interfere with interpretation of study results, and in the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study. Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, or may interfere with interpretation of study results, and in the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study Pregnant (positive pregnancy test) or lactating</criteria>
