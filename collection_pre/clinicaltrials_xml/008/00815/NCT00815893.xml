	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of dexmedetomidine infusion for oral cancer patients undergoing awake fiberoptic nasal intubation. We hypothesized that a loading dose of intravenous dexmedetomidine before awake fiberoptic nasal intubation for oral cancer patients undergoing general anesthesia will provide adequate sedation and analgesia without respiratory depression and upper airway obstruction.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Case number: 60, ASA I-III oral cancer patients with limited mouth opening Patients will be randomly allocated into three groups, Dex group received dexmedetomidine (1.0 mcg/kg) infusion, Control group received saline, and Propofol group received 1% Propofol administrated usng effect-site TCI. Main outcome was evaluated by grading scores presenting conditions for nasal intubation, post-intubation and satisfaction. Other analysed parameters included airway obstruction, hemodynamic changes, treatment for hemodynamics response, consumption time for intubation, amnesia level, and postoperative adverse events. All outcome measurements were classified by scoring systems.</detailed_description>
