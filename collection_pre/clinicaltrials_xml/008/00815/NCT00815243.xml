	<brief_title>Telemedicine Consultation in Trauma and Orthopedic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Levels of bad outcomes, untimely death and disability due to acute trauma, specific orthopedic pathology (congenital, coxarthrosis) and non-efficient organisation of clinical work-flow are still very high (especially in rural areas). Standard telemedicine work stations (with special protocols and manuals for original approach to telemedicine activity organisation and management) will be placed into small municipal and rural hospitals. Telemedicine links will be established between 3rd level Trauma&amp;Ortho center and remote sites. Synchronous and asynchronous teleconsultations will be perform for help in evidence-based timely clinical decisions, continual support of clinical wor-flow and treatment process.</detailed_description>
