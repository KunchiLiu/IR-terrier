	<brief_summary>Endoscopic subureteral injection for vesicoureteral reflux has become an established alternative to ureter reimplantation in children. Some recent studies suggest that ESI can be also a primary treatment option for VUR in adults. However, the experience with ESI in adults who have VUR associated with decreased bladder compliance is limited. We evaluated the efficacy of endoscopic subureteral injection treatment for vesicoureteral reflux in adults with decreased bladder compliance.</brief_summary>
