	<brief_title>Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Registry for Future Studies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To establish a framework in which biologic samples and physiologic measures from patients with IPF can be longitudinally collected and evaluated. Having a bank of samples that are correlated with physiologic measures that follow patients through their course will allow the following proposed studies as well as future investigations to be efficiently carried out.</detailed_description>
