	<brief_title>Effect of Epoetin Beta on Renal Function Within 30 Days Following a Kidney Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>French study, prospective, multicenter, open, randomized into two parallel groups: Group A: NeoRecormon ® 30000 UI: 4 injections Group B: control group without administration of the medical product Period of recruitment: 18 months Duration of participation of each patient: 90 days Total duration of the test: 21 months. Main objective : Assessing the effect of epoetin beta on the glomerular filtration rate estimated 30 days after kidney transplant. Secondary objectives: Comparing the 2 groups at all times J0 to J90: - The evolution of renal function - The survival of patients and grafts - The time of onset and incidence of acute rejection proved by biopsy - The correction of anemia - The need for transfusions - The need for EPO - Quality of Life - The safety processing</detailed_description>
