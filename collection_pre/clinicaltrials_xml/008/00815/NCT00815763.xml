	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Ginsenoside-Rd for Acute Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A phase â…¢ randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study was conducted to examine the efficacy and safety of ginsenoside-Rd in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Stroke patients were randomized equally to receive a 14-day infusion of placebo or ginsenoside-Rd 20mg. Primary end points were NIHSS scores at 15 days. Secondary end points were NIHSS scores and the Barthel index at 8 days, the Barthel index and the modified Rankin scale at 15 days and 90 days. The safety end points included serious and nonserious adverse events, laboratory values and vital signs. Analysis was by intention to treat.</detailed_description>
