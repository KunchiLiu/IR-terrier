	<brief_title>Functional Electrical Stimulation in Irradiated Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients usually underwent radiotherapy (RT) or chemoradiotherapy(CRT). There were some complications caused by RT, like dysphagia. In recent studies, functional electrical stimulation (FES) was be used in neurologically dysphagia patients, and there were some positive effects with these studies. Hence, we decided applied FES to these NPC patients with dysphagia.</detailed_description>
