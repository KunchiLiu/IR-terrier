	<brief_summary>When oligohydramnion - decreased amniotic fluid, is diagnosed at term pregnancies, the common practice is to induce labor. Whenever the cervix is not ripened, there are several methods to ripen the cervix, two of which are: mechanical, using a double balloon catheter and pharmacological, with prostaglandins. The aim of the study is to compare those two methods of cervical ripening for patients with significant oligohydramnion at term. The study will be a prospective randomised trial.</brief_summary>
