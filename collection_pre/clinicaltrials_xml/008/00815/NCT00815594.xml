	<brief_summary>The occurrence of conjunctival scarring finally leads to the obstruction of the fistula tract created by the filtering surgery. Vascular endothelial growth factor is thought to be a key role in the formation of conjunctival scar, which play a pivotal role in the wound-healing process. So it seems that the recombinant human anti-VEGF antibody could inhibit angiogenesis, and reduce the conjunctival vascular formation in the wound-healing process after glaucoma filtering surgery.</brief_summary>
