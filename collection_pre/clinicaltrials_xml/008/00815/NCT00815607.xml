	<brief_title>Trial of an Intratumoral Injections of INXN-3001 in Subjects With Stage III or IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will examine the effects of an oral Activator Ligand administration to modulate the timing of gene expression of human IL-12 by adenovirus-transduced dendritic cells injected into tumors.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Males or females of all races ≥ 18 years of age and ≤ 75 years of age; 2. Unresectable Stage III C (in transit) or Stage IV melanoma (M1a, M1b, M1c with LDH ≤ 2x ULN), arising from primary cutaneous, mucosal, or subungual melanoma of any tumor thickness or from an unknown primary site; 3. A minimum of 23 accessible nonvisceral lesions (longest diameter ≤3 cm) or palpable tumorinvolved lymph nodes (longest diameter ≤5 cm) for intratumoral injections (INXN3001) and biopsies; 4. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1; 5. Patients without visible brain metastases as assessed by contrastenhanced MRI scan within 6 weeks prior to receiving study treatment; 6. Adequate baseline hematological and organ function, assessed by laboratory values within 42 days (6 weeks) prior to study entry and prior to repeat treatment cycles with INXN1001 as follows: hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/L, granulocytes &gt; 2500/mm3, lymphocytes &gt; 1000/ mm3, platelets &gt; 100,000/ mm3, serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2.5 x ULN, LDH ≤ 2 x ULN, serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN, absolute neutrophils &gt; 500/ mm3; 7. An expected survival of at least approximately 6 months in the opinion of the investigator (as assessed mainly by performance status); 8. Females must be postmenopausal or surgically sterile or practice effective contraception; Men who are not surgically sterile and whose partners are not postmenopausal or surgically sterile must practice effective contraception; 9. Normal coagulation parameters as measured by PT/PTT; 10. Signed, IRBapproved voluntary written informed consent. 1. Active, acute viral, bacterial, or fungal infections requiring specific therapy; 2. HIVinfection due to concerns about ability to mount an effective immune response; 3. Active autoimmune disease requiring steroids (&gt;10 mg prednisolone or comparable) or other immunosuppressive therapy; 4. Patients with detectable brain metastases at the time of screening (or within 6 weeks prior to receiving study treatment), as assessed by contrastenhanced MRI scans; 5. Patients with one or more lesion(s) &gt; 3cm (LD) or palpable, tumorinvolved lymph node(s) &gt;5 cm (LD); 6. Patients with a hemoglobin of &lt; 10 g/L; 7. Presence of Stage IV visceral metastases or other distant metastases if LDH &gt;2 x ULN; 8. Patients who have previously been treated with INXN3001 and INXN1001; 9. Recipients of organ allografts; 10. Other concurrent, clinically active malignant disease, with the exception of other cancers of the skin; 11. Less than 30 days (before the first dose of study medication) have elapsed since the completion of prior chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, or any first line therapy; 12. Clinically significant cerebrovascular disease; 13. History of or concurrent severe cardiac insufficiency (New York Heart Association Class III or IV) or coronary artery disease; 14. QTc interval of &gt;470 ms on screening; 15. Inability to measure the QT interval due to conduction abnormalities such as Bundle Branch Block (left or right) or persistent cardiac arrhythmia e.g. atrial fibrillation, or cardiac pacemaker; 16. Long QT syndrome or family history of sudden cardiac death in young family members; 17. Concomitant use of medication known to affect ventricular repolarization; 18. Cardiac comorbidity such as a left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;45%, myocardial infarction, persistent angina, or cardiac surgery within 3 months prior to enrollment; 19. Uncontrollable hypertension (&gt;150 mm Hg systolic or &gt;100 mm Hg diastolic); 20. Acute medical conditions such as ischemic heart or lung disease that may be considered an unacceptable anesthetic or operative risk; 21. History of or current bleeding or uncorrected clotting disorders; 22. Concurrent immunosuppressive therapy such as corticosteroids (&gt;10mg prednisolone or comparable) and cyclosporin A; 23. Concurrent investigational treatments, or treatment with any investigational treatment within the past 30 days (prior to the first dose of study medication); 24. Concurrent medications that are metabolized by the CYP 3A4 pathway; 25. Females who are lactating or pregnant; 26. A Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than or equal to 40 kg/m2; aa. Patients who have a history of hypersensitivity that may relate to any component of the product, e.g. to benzoic acid that might be related to INXN1001, which contains two benzene rings; bb. Any medical or psychiatric condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would unacceptably reduce the safety or delivery of the proposed treatment, or would preclude obtaining voluntary informed consent.</criteria>
