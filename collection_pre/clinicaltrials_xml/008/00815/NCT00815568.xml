	<brief_title>Feasibility and Efficacy Study of Conditioning Regimen for Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT) With Fludarabine, Busulfan, and Total Body Irradiation (TBI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Conventional allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for patients with hematological malignancies involves conditioning with high doses of systemic chemo/radiation therapy such as cyclophosphamide (CY) plus 1200 or 1000 cGy total body irradiation (TBI; CY/TBI) or busulfan (Bu) / CY (BuCy). Unfortunately, such regimens have been associated with significant toxicities, limiting their use to otherwise healthy, relatively young patients. Recently, Fludarabine plus 4 day dose of busulfan (FluBu4) containing myeloablative regimen has been introduced successfully without increasing transplant-related mortality (TRM). To improve transplant outcomes without increasing the risk of recurrence, Russell et al introduced 400cGy of TBI with antithymocyte (ATG, 4.5mg/Kg) into FluBu4 regimen with successful outcomes.</detailed_description>
