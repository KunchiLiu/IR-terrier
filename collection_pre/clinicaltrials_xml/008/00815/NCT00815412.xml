	<detailed_description>The design is a cluster, randomized controlled trial of two companies with three arms in each company. The arms include two control groups (one from each company), two intervention groups using a standard health promotion intervention, and two intervention groups that constitute using an activated consumer intervention. The standard intervention includes educational offerings to address health behaviors. The activated consumer intervention offers shorter education sessions and includes decision tools and skills development for working with heath care providers to better manage health and clinical conditions. Variables include health risk assessments, clinical measures such as lipids, blood pressure, body mass index, and tobacco use, perception of health care consumer practices, claims costs, and absenteeism analysis.</detailed_description>
