	<criteria>Full functional independence prior to the present stroke (as evidenced by a premorbid modified Rankin Scale score of 02 Clinical diagnosis of acute stroke with CT scan ruling out intracranial hemorrhage Onset of symptoms within 124 hours of commencement of infusion of study drug Measurable deficit on NIHSS (as evidenced by a score of 315) Full consciousness (i.e. the score for NIHSS item 1a=0) Written valid informed consent is obtained from the subject or his/her next of kin or legal representative if the subject is fully conscious (i.e. the score for NIHSS item 1a = 0) but unable to read and/or sign the ICF, in accordance with National legislation and local IRB requirements Subjects who are unlikely to complete the infusion of investigational product and/or are unlikely to undergo active medical management during that period due to a severe clinical condition Subjects with severe illness with life expectancy less than 6 months Body weight in excess of 120 kg Subjects who have received rTPA or other thrombolytics (e.g. urokinase, streptokinase, reteplase, tenecteplase) within the previous 24 hours Likelihood of forbidden concomitant therapy such as vascular surgery, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), valve replacement, or carotid endarterectomy (CEA) Evidence of cerebral herniation Subjects with confounding neurological diseases such as dementia Subjects with CADASIL, Moya Moya, or carotid dissection Subjects who have experienced a stroke within the previous 3 months (Note: subjects who have recently experienced a TIA, but whose premorbid mRS prior to their stroke is 02, will be allowed to enter the study) Evidence from admission imaging tests of infarction involving &gt;1/3 of MCA territory, or entire ACA territory involvement, or internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusions without coexisting separate occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (because of the difficulty distinguishing between chronic and acute ICA lesions in such subjects) Pathology other than cerebral infarction on any admission imaging tests (e.g. ICH or SAH, AV malformation, cerebral aneurysm, or cerebral neoplasm) Current or previous known excessive alcohol use or dependence Current known illicit drug use or dependence Participation in a previous clinical study within 30 days Subjects unlikely to be able and willing to attend all study followup visits Any other conditions which in the opinion of the investigator deem the subject ineligible for inclusion Females who are pregnant or intend to become pregnant or subjects (male and female) who do not agree to use effective contraception for 3 months after end of treatment</criteria>
