	<brief_summary>To see if restenosis rates of superficial femoral artery atherosclerosis with percutaneous techniques can be improved using paclitaxel.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Local Paclitaxel Delivery for SFA Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment of superficial femoral artery atherosclerosis with percutaneous techniques is hindered by high restenosis rates. Paclitaxel inhibits restenosis in coronary arteries, and a few studies suggest it may be effective in reducing restenosis rates in peripheral arteries. The investigators hypothesize that delivering paclitaxel through an irrigating catheter will be superior in preventing restenosis.</detailed_description>
