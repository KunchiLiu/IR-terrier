	<brief_title>Study of Fluphenazine in Relapsed or Relapsed-and-Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, dose-escalating, Phase 1b trial in patients with relapsed or relapsed-and-refractory multiple myeloma. Patients will be dosed on Days 1 and 8 of each 21 day cycle. This study will be conducted in two parts. In Part 1, the MTD determining portion of the study, patients will be enrolled in cohorts of 3 patients at each dose level. At least 3 patients will complete 21 days at each dose level and will be evaluated for safety and tolerability before additional patients are treated at higher doses. Doses will be increased following a modified Fibonacci scheme. In Part 2, twelve additional patients will be enrolled at the MTD determined in Part 1 (or the dose for the highest dose cohort completed if the MTD has not been reached) to further evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of this dose regimen. Serum fluphenazine pharmacokinetic studies will be performed during the first cycle of the therapy in all Part 1 and Part 2 consenting patients.</detailed_description>
