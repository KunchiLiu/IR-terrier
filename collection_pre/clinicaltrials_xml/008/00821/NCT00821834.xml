	<brief_summary>Primary objective: - To evaluate whether 12 weeks of clopidogrel is superior to ticlopidine in terms of lower risk of the safety events of interest in patients with stable angina (SA) or old myocardial infarction (OMI) to which percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is being planned. Secondary objectives: - To compare the incidence of adverse events, adverse drug reactions and bleeding events in patients treated with clopidogrel versus ticlopidine. - To compare the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) in patients treated with clopidogrel versus ticlopidine. - To evaluate the long-term safety (adverse drug reactions, adverse events, safety events of interest and bleeding events) of clopidogrel for a total of 52 weeks; - To evaluate MACE and MACCE of clopidogrel for a total of 52 weeks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Evaluation of Clopidogrel Sulfate in Patients With Stable Angina/Old Myocardial Infarction to Whom Percutaneous Coronary Intervention is Being Planned</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consisted of two periods: - a double blind treatment period of 12 weeks followed by, - an open label clopidogrel treatment period in a subset of patients. All patients should receive aspirin (81-100 mg once daily) as a background therapy during investigational product administration.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Stable Angina / Old Myocardial Infarction patients who met all of the following criteria: Myocardial ischemic finding was proven within 2 months before randomization, Either â‰¥ 75% stenosis documented by CAG or severe stenosis confirmed by multislice computerized tomography (MSCT) angiography within 1 month before randomization, PCI was being planned. Planned coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), emergent/urgent PCI, or staged PCI, 3vessel coronary artery disease with significant lesions in each vessel, Planned PCI associated with 6 or more stent placements, Not less than 50% stenosis of the left main coronary artery, Chronic total occlusion (CTO), Saphenous vein graft (SVG).
