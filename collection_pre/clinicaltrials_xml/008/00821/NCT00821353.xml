	<brief_summary>Paroxysmal or chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) develops in about 20- 25% of adult patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and represents an important complication in the clinical course of the disease, with adverse long-term consequences on functional status and outcome. Therefore, aggressive therapeutic strategies are indicated to restore and maintain sinus rhythm (SR) in patients with HCM. Nevertheless, pharmacologic prevention of AF recurrence is challenging because of the limited long-term efficacy and potentially hazardous side effects of available treatment options. Currently radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) of AF is successfully used in clinical practice. However, comparison of the efficacy and safety of these two therapeutic options has not been done up till now in randomized manner in this group of patients. Thus, the aim of the present study is to compare the efficacy and safety of RFCA vs. antiarrhythmic drug therapy in patients with HCM and AF.</brief_summary>
