	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the hypothesis that nasal intermittent positive pressure(NIPP), used as a primary mode of ventilation in preterm infants with RDS, will decrease the need for conventional endotracheal ventilation when compared to nasal continuous positive airway pressure.(NCPAP)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Non Invasive Ventilation for Respiratoy Distress Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Respiratory distress syndrome(RDS) and its sequelae, bronchopulmonary dysplasia(BPD) are complications of prematurity.The pathogenesis of BPD is multifactorial and one of the most important risk factors is the ventilator-induced lung injury caused by invasive respiratory support. The two modes of non-invasive ventilation, NIPP and specially NCPAP, have been used frequently in the respiratory care of preterm infants in neonatal units.NCPAP is currently a common practice for the treatment of RDS . NIPP has been found to be more effective than NCPAP in apnea of prematurity and immediately after extubation in preterm infants,decreasing the need of endotracheal ventilation. Alternative techniques of non-invasive ventilation has been suggested in some studies to decrease respiratory morbidities associated with prematurity.This non-invasive approach could be used initially as a primary mode of ventilation for infants with RDS in a effort to decrease lung injury and BPD.Studies are needed to compare the effectiveness of these therapies.</detailed_description>
