	<brief_summary>Transradial approach of cardiac catheterization is a common alternative to transfemoral access for diagnostic coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). The transradial approach reduces access site bleeding complications and the procedural discomfort of the patients. Transradial procedures may be performed by cannulation of the right or left radial artery and at present, the choice of the right or left radial artery depends largely on the operator' s preference. The aim of this study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of transradial approach comparing the right radial versus the left radial approach in coronary diagnostic and interventional procedures. The investigators will enroll consecutively for 12 months all patients who undergo to diagnostic or interventional procedures through trans radial approach in two Italian centers (Casilino Policlinic, Catholic University-Rome). Primary end point of the study is the fluoroscopy time and the radiation dose adsorbed by the patients. Secondary end-points are: contrast amount, time to obtain the first angiography, procedural shift rate, number of catheters employed, major complications. The investigators pre-specified a sub-study in patients older than 75 years old with the same end-points.</brief_summary>
