	<brief_title>Action of Amantadine on Post-Stroke Aphasic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In France, there are around 30000 aphasic patients. The actual taking care of these patients after stroke includes the treatment of acute stage in stroke unit, followed by rehabilitation program. However, most non fluent aphasic patients remain chronically handicapped despite of intensive logopedic training. The objective of this clinical project is to test the action of pharmacologic agents on verbal fluency of aphasic patients victims of cerebral infarctions. Only a few studies have been done with various pharmacologic agents, and although the results were not clearly conclusive, they were sufficiently positive for suggesting to launch a well controlled randomized cross-over study. Then the objective of study is to test the action of the amantadine, as DOPA-agonist, in a double blind cross-over trial, amantadine / placebo, on the verbal fluency of chronic post stroke aphasic patients.</detailed_description>
