	<brief_summary>Volunteers are being invited to take part in a research study about insulin therapy of diabetes. They are being invited to take part in this research study because they have diabetes and have an illness requiring hospitalization. If they volunteer to take part in this study, they will be one of about 120 people to do so. The investigators hope to answer the following research questions: - To show that insulin aspart protamine 70/30 mix taken twice daily is as good as insulin NPH/Reg 70/30 mix taken twice a day for treatment of diabetes after discharge from the hospital. - To show how safe the two medicines are (insulin aspart 70/30 mix vs. insulin NPH/Reg 70/30 mix) and how well they work for the treatment of diabetes when transitioning from inpatient therapy to outpatient care.</brief_summary>
