	<brief_title>Behavioral Modification and Vesicare Versus Vesicare Alone for Urge Incontinence in Patients With Overactive Bladder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overactive bladder symptoms are commonly treated with oral anticholinergic medications that work by stopping muscles from tightening or behavioral modification. This study will help determine if behavior modification (fluid regulation, pelvic exercises, timed voiding) performed in conjunction wth oral Vesicare anticholinergic therapy, is more effective for treating overactive bladder symptoms than oral Vesicare anticholinergic therapy alone.</detailed_description>
