	<brief_summary>D-ribose, a natural occurring pentose carbohydrate, has repeatedly shown to enhance high-energy phosphates and improve function following ischemia, states of congestive heart failure, and recently in subjects with lung disease. An initial preliminary, open label pilot study demonstrated a positive benefit of D-ribose in "Baby-Boomer" subjects aged 50 to 65 years old complaining of persistent fatigue. The objective of this study will build on the previously collected data to evaluate oral D-ribose vs. dextrose (administered as a supplement) in relatively healthy, yet fatigued subjects with a goal of improving their state of fatigue.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Presents with complaint of fatigue with duration longer than one month Males/Females between the ages of 50 and 65 years of age No previous clinical diagnosis of pulmonary, cardiac or metabolic disorders based on history Capable of performing a submaximal incremental treadmill exercise using cardiopulmonary analysis methods Normal blood pressure or those with mild, untreated prehypertension (&gt;120/70 or &lt; 140/90 mmHg) Able to be compliant with the supplement regimen, repeat clinical visits and completion of the study questionnaires Must be able to understand the consent form, agree to participate, and to execute their signature Not presently taking any adenine nucleotide enhancing supplements History of noncompliance in previous studies Known to be pregnant Uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias causing symptoms or unstable hemodynamics Moderate to severe gout A diagnosis of arthritis of the lower extremities Mental impairment, inability to cooperate History of acute noncardiopulmonary disorder that may affect exercise performance, (e.g. infection, renal failure, thyrotoxicosis, etc.) Any disorder or condition that in the opinion of the study physician would render exercise unsafe or would impact exercise performance Any person who is incarcerated, or on a work release program Additional Exclusions observed and sequelae during initial baseline evaluation: Drop in systolic blood pressure of &gt;10 mm Hg from baseline despite an increase in workload, when accompanied by other evidence of ischemia Moderately severe angina Increasing nervous system symptoms (e.g. ataxia, dizziness, or near syncope) Signs of poor perfusion (cyanosis or pallor) Technical difficulties monitoring the ECG or systolic blood pressure Subject's desire to stop Sustained ventricular tachycardia Electrocardiographic ST elevation (+1.0 mm) in leads without diagnostic Qwaves (other than V1 or aVR)</criteria>
