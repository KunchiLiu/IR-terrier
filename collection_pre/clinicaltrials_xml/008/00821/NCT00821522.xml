	<brief_summary>Acute kidney injury is associated with cardiopulmonary bypass during heart surgery and its pathogenesis is similar to that of ischemia-reperfusion injury. Remote ischemic preconditioning attenuates myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery. The investigators hypothesize that such preconditioning reduces the incidence of acute kidney injury associated with cardiopulmonary bypass.</brief_summary>
