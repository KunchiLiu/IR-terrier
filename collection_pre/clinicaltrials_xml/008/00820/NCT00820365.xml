A total of ca. 30 - 35 patients will receive SC12267 (4SC-101) tablets, 35 mg once daily for 12 weeks. First of all the patients will undergo a screening period of 1 week and a follow-up visit will be performed 4 weeks after study drug discontinuation or earlier in case of relapse during follow up. Total study duration will be up to 36 (+2) weeks. There will be 8 study visits: one screening visit, 6 visits during the treatment period and one follow-up visit. In addition, four telephone visits will be performed at Week 6, Week 10, Week 20 (+1) and Week 36 (+2). The duration of the entire study (first patient in till last patient out) is expected to be about 13 months.</brief_summary>
