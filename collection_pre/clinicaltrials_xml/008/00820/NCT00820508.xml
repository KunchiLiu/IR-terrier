	<brief_title>Safety and Tolerability of CHR-2845 to Treat Haematological Diseases or Lymphoid Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CHR-2845 is a novel type of histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) for use in cancer that, in addition to having broad ranging anti-proliferative activity against transformed cells, is designed to have an increased therapeutic window against diseases which involve cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage. There are several HDACi's in clinical development and one, SAHA (Vorinostat, Zolinza®), has recently been approved for use in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. CHR-2845 is a cell-permeant ester that is metabolised to give an active acid, CHR-2847, which selectively accumulates in monocytes and macrophages. This results in a 20-100 fold increase in anti-proliferative potency of CHR-2845 for monocytic over non-monocytic tumour cells. This selectivity should lead to an increased therapeutic window in haematological malignancies involving cells of the monocyte lineage (AML M4, AML M5 and CMML). In addition, there is increasing evidence that monocytes and macrophages associated with some haematological tumours (tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs)) are involved in supporting the growth and spread of the tumour. This clinical trial will focus on haematological and lymphoid malignancies with the intention of evaluating the safety and tolerability of CHR-2845. Additionally it will compare response in patients where monocytes/macrophages are important disease drivers, with the response in other patients. This will allow an early determination of the potential improvement in therapeutic window afforded by the monocyte/macrophage directed HDACi activity.</detailed_description>

A history of abnormal QTc intervals or an average QTc interval at screening ≥450 msec 6. Any medical or other condition that in the investigator's opinion renders the patient unsuitable for this study due to unacceptable risk 7. Psychiatric disorders or altered mental status precluding understanding of the informed consent process and/or completion of the necessary studies 8. Gastrointestinal disorders that may interfere with absorption of the study drug 9. Patients with known brain tumours or metastases 10. More than 6 prior chemotherapy regimens 11.
