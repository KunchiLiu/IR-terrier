	<brief_summary>The presence of an abnormally increased pulmonary blood pressure worsens the prognosis of patients with interstitial pulmonary disease. The aim of this study is to estimate the frequency of an increased blood pressure in the lungs among patient with interstitial pulmonary disease, and to evaluate the use of different biomarkers in diagnosis of the condition.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The presence of increased pulmonary blood pressure is established by echocardiography and confirmed by right heart catheterization. The ability of NT-proBNP, vWf, troponin-t, D-dimer and exhaled NO to predict the presence of increased pressure in the pulmonary circulation is evaluated.</detailed_description>
