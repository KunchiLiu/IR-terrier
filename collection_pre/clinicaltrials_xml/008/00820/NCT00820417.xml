	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, phase 1, non-randomised, non-controlled trial, carried out in two centres on patients with advanced cancer expressing EGFR. Primary objective is the determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RD) of the combination of intravenous Cetuximab and oral Gefitinib.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmocokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) Study of the Combination Cetuximab/Gefitinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Between 36 and 66 patients will be enrolled depending on the number of dose levels which can be completed. Patients will have histologically confirmed EFGR-expressing solid malignant tumours (colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer and NSCLC), which did not respond to standard therapy or for which no suitable therapy exists.</detailed_description>
