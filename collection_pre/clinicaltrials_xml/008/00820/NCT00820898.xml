	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying the side effects of gemcitabine and to see how well it works in treating patients with recurrent or persistent endometrial cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Persistent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the antitumor activity of gemcitabine hydrochloride in patients with persistent or recurrent endometrial adenocarcinoma who have failed higher priority treatment protocols. II. To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>
