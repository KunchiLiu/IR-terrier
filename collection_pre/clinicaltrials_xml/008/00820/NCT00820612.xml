	<brief_summary>Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) is the most common complication of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), a procedure for the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the pancreas and bile duct. Preliminary data has shown that non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, when administered rectally, can reduce the risk of pancreatitis after ERCP. This study is intended to definitively determine whether rectally administered indomethacin (a non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug)is effective at preventing pancreatitis after ERCP.</brief_summary>
