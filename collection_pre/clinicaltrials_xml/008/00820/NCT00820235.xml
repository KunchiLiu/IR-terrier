	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to compare the gum response to three different dental implant designs when placed in the front region of the upper jaw. The changes from baseline to one year after will be compared. The null-hypothesis is that the buccal soft tissue (gum) changes from baseline to one year after are equal for all three implant-abutment interface settings.</brief_summary>
