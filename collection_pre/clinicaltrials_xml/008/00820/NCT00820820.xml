	<brief_summary>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the skin. AD is very frequent, and involves T lymphocytes cells. Measles vaccination, as well as measles vaccine, induces a temporary immunosuppression; furthermore, an improvement of AD has been observed during measles infection. This trial is aimed at demonstrating that measles vaccine is able to create an immunomodulation and to improve AD symptoms. 30 adult patients of both sexes with moderate to severe AD will be randomly assigned to measles vaccine (ROUVAX ®), or placebo (vehicle) and follow-up for 45 days. The primary outcome is the effect of anti-measles vaccination on the T cell responses in patients; Other outcomes include: clinical evolution of AD, as measured by the SCORAD, the evolution of blood level of measles specific IgE and antibodies; evolution of other biomarkers and phenotypic characteristics of T lymphocytes.</brief_summary>
