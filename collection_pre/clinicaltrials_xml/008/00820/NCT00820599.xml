	<brief_summary>A single arm, prospective multicenter non-randomized confirmatory clinical trial evaluating the Edwards SAPIEN XT™ transcatheter heart valve (model 9300TFX; "study valve"), its transfemoral delivery system, and crimper accessories. The trial includes a premarket confirmatory cohort to evaluate the system performance as well as a Post Market Clinical Follow-up phase involving expanded enrollment and long-term follow-up of all patients to evaluate valve performance out to 5 years.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All candidates for this study must meet all of the following inclusion criteria: 1. Patients must have comorbidities such that the surgeon (Co Investigator) and interventional cardiologist (Principal Investigator) concur that the predicted risk of operative mortality is &gt; 15% with a minimum STS Risk Calculator score of ≥ 10 and/or Logistic EuroSCORE of &gt; 20%. 2. Patient is symptomatic from his/her aortic valve stenosis, as demonstrated by NYHA Functional Class II or greater. 3. The subject or the subject's legal representative has been informed of the nature of the study, agrees to its provisions and has provided a written informed consent that has been approved by the reviewing Ethics Committee (EC) of the respective clinical site. 4. Subject is willing to comply with specified follow up evaluations, including possible coronary angiography and transesophageal echocardiography. 5. The subject and the treating physician agree that the subject will return for all required postprocedure followup visits. 1. Aortic valve is a congenital unicuspid or bicuspid valve, or is noncalcified. 2. Mixed aortic valve disease (aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation with predominant aortic regurgitation &gt;3+). 3. Any therapeutic invasive cardiac procedure, other than BAV, performed within 30 days of the index procedure (or 6 months if the procedure was a drug eluting coronary stent implantation).</criteria>
