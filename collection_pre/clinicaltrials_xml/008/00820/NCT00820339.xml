	<brief_title>Pringle's Maneuver Versus Selective Hepatic Vascular Exclusion in Hepatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a serious disease with high incidence at home and abroad still shows a rising trend. In recent decade, the overall survival rate of the disease has entered a platform stage with little advance despite diversified methods of treatment. The prognosis of HCC is not so satisfying. Intraoperative bleeding remains a major concern during liver resection. Blood loss usually occurs during parenchymal transection and reperfusion after Pringle's maneuver. The amount of blood loss and the need for blood transfusion have a detrimental effect on the short- and long-term prognosis. Portal triad clamping is sufficient in most situations to control bleeding during hepatectomy. However, it does not prevent backflow bleeding from hepatic veins, which may become troublesome or even hazardous. This is particularly true in tumors that are large or that have invaded into the branches of the major hepatic veins. SHVE completely isolates the liver from the systemic circulation with the advantage of preventing backflow hemorrhage or air embolism without having to resort to caval blood flow interruption of THVE. The purpose of the study is to assess the risk factors for the recurrence and metastasis in HCC patients undergoing hepatectomy by SHVE and to evaluate that SHVE can improve survival in HCC patients or not.</detailed_description>
