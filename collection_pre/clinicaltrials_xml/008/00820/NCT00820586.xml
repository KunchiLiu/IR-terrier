	<brief_summary>A randomized study to assess the safety, feasibility and effectiveness of direct intramyocardial percutaneous delivery of autologous bone marrow-derived total mononuclear cells or selected CD34+ cells in patients with refractory angina pectoris.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intramyocardial Delivery of Autologous Bone Marrow</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Endpoint: Incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 30 days. MACE is defined as a combined endpoint of death, acute MI (Q-wave and non-Q wave), revascularization procedures (percutaneous or surgical), and peri-procedural complications (that is, left ventricular perforation with hemodynamic consequences requiring pericardiocentesis, and stroke). Incidence of MACE at 3, 6 and 12 months Secondary Endpoints: - Change in Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) angina classification score from baseline to 12 months - Changes in the quality of life, as assessed according to the Seattle Angina Questionnaire - Change in exercise duration and exercise tolerance using standardized treadmill exercise testing from baseline, to 6 months and to 12 months - Cumulative number of hospitalizations for coronary ischemia and congestive heart failure at 12 months following treatment. - SPECT-chances in global and regional radionuclide perfusion at rest, peak stress, and redistribution for baseline to 1, 6 and 12 months - Change in angiographic collateral score at 6 months - Change in global and regional myocardial contractility (assessed by echocardiography) at baseline, 6 and 12 months.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. Subjects &gt;21 years old; 2. Subjects with functional class (CCS) III or IV angina; 3. Subjects with left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction ³ 30% 4. Attempted "best" tolerated medical therapy 5. Clinical signs and symptoms of myocardial ischemia with reversible ischemia on perfusion imaging; 6. Patient deemed to be a poor candidate or at high surgical risk; 7. Subject must be able to complete a minimum of 2 minutes but no more than 10 minutes exercise test (Bruce Protocol); 8. Subject (or their legal guardian) understands the nature of the procedure and provides written consent prior to the procedure; 9. Subject is willing to comply with specified followup evaluations; 10. Patient must develop angina and a horizontal or downsloping STsegment depression of ³ 1 mm during exercise, compared to preexercise ST segment, 80 ms from the J point or moderate angina with or without the above ST segment changes. Angiographic 1. Severe obstruction (lumen diameter stenosis &gt; 70%) in a coronary or surgical conduit felt to be solely or partially responsible for angina and myocardial ischemia; 2. There must be at least one coronary or surgical conduit with &lt; 70% diameter stenosis 3. Poor candidate for percutaneous coronary intervention of treatment zone 4. Poor candidates for surgical revascularization procedures, such as inadequate target coronary anatomy or lack of potential surgical conduits. 1. Pregnant women; 2. Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;30% as assessed by either echocardiography or left ventriculography; 3. Severe cardiac heart failure with NYHA functional class IIIIV symptoms; 4. Chronic atrial fibrillation; 5. Prosthetic aortic valve; 6. Severe (grade IIIIV) mitral or aortic insufficiency; 7. Wall thickness of &lt;8 mm (defined by echocardiography) of the proposed target region of myocardium; 8. Severe comorbidity associated with a reduction in life expectancy of &lt;1 year, such as chronic medical illnesses 9. Braunwald class II unstable angina 10. Severe peripheral (or aortic) vascular disease which might increase the risk of vascular complications (perforation, dissection or embolization); 11. Significant aortic valve pathologic sclerosis or stenosis 12. LV thrombus (mobile or muralbased) seen on echocardiography; 13. Recent (within 4 weeks) documented myocardial infarction (Q and/or nonQ wave) defined as CKMB &gt;3times upper normal level; 14. Currently enrolled in another investigational device or drug trial that has not completed the required followup period; 15. Thrombocytopenia or history of heparininduced thrombocytopenia or thrombocytosis 16. Leukopenia 17. Leukocytosis 18. Anemia or erythrocytosis 19. Active peptic ulcer or active gastrointestinal bleeding; 20. Chronic renal failure requiring dialysis; 21. Prior or current malignancy 22. Other conditions that can significantly affect the bonemarrow 23. Evidence of concurrent infection (WBC &gt;12.000 mm3, temperature &gt;38.5° C); 24. Serological of clinical evidence of HIV 25. Immunotherapy 26. Abnormal bonemarrow morphology as evident in bonemarrow smear prior to the intervention Angiographic/Ventriculographic 1. LV thrombus (mobile or muralbased) seen on left ventriculography; 2. Coronary lesions suitable for percutaneous coronary interventions; 3. Unprotected left main coronary artery disease</criteria>
