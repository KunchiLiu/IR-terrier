	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Locally Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Locally advanced breast cancer is a common condition in development countries. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy gives the opportunity to identify genetic signatures associated with objective clinical and pathological complete responses. Patients will receive doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide with paclitaxel. Tumor samples collected before and after chemotherapy will be analyzed.</detailed_description>
