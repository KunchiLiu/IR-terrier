	<brief_summary>The attempt to further reduce the operative trauma in laparoscopic cholecystectomy led in new techniques, as Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) and Single Incision Laparoscopic Surgery (SILS). These new techniques are considered as painless procedures, but there are not any publications to study a possible different pain score in new techniques versus classic laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In this randomized controlled study the researchers have investigated the pain scores, the incidence of nausea and vomiting and analgesics request after the procedure.</brief_summary>
