	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether AMG 386, in combination with Sorafenib, is effective in the treatment of advanced or inoperable Hepatocellular cancer in subjects who have not received any prior systemic therapy except surgery or locoregional therapy. Disease status and disease progression will be assessed every 8 weeks. Subjects will remain on treatment until: progressive disease by RECIST criteria; clinical progression; death or loss to follow-up; or withdrawal of informed consent.</brief_summary>
