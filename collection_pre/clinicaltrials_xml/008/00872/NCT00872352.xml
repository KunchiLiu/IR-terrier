	<brief_summary>In the present study we are planning to study electrophysiological changes related to the dose and time of bortezomib administration in newly diagnosed patients with MM, during the first months of treatment and 6 months after ending. In addition a possible correlation between the incidence of BIPN and the subtype of myeloma and other risk factors will be investigated.</brief_summary>
