	<brief_summary>Pregnancy and delivery have a major impact on couple's inter personal relationship. Different modes of delivery have different effect on pelvic floor function, and it is known that instrumental vaginal deliveries have the worse effect, though various common anatomical injuries have been described following vaginal delivery. Pelvic floor dysfunction has the potential to ameliorate sexual function, and the investigators hypothesis is that the impact of delivery on pelvic floor disorders following delivery will have a direct effect on sexual malfunction and interpersonal relationship. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of delivery mode of primiparous women on inter couple relationship , their sexual function and the female pelvic floor activity. The couples will be followed from the second trimester of the pregnancy by validated specific questionnaires, assessing the couple's satisfaction of their marriage, intimacy in their relationship, their sexual behavior and pelvic floor function. After delivery, the parameters of the parturition will be recorded, and the couples will be interviewed 6 months following delivery. Apart from questionnaires, sample of the participated women will be assessed by ultrasound examination of the pelvic floor.</brief_summary>
