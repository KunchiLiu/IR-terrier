	<brief_title>Balance System Study in Type 2 Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The BALANCE System stimulates the duodenum in a specialized way to strengthen the natural contractions and mimic the sensation of fullness (satiety). The patient is expected to feel full after eating smaller amounts of food than normal. In addition, duodenal stimulation has been shown to induce favorable changes in postprandial glucose levels, glucose tolerance testing and insulin levels. The target population type II diabetic patients uncontrolled with oral medications, and with overweight (BMI &gt;30). The Balance System may overcome the known disadvantages of insulin therapy and allow early treatment of these patients, potentially preventing the progression of obesity and diabetes.</detailed_description>
