	<brief_summary>Aesthetic appearance of repaired incisions is very important to surgical patients. It has been stated that if the edges of a wound are closed in such a manner that will result in eversion, or pouting of the edges that the end cosmetic result will be superior when compared to wound edges that are simply approximated. The purpose of this study is to compare cosmetic outcomes of incisions that are closed with everted edges to those in which the edges are simply approximated.</brief_summary>
