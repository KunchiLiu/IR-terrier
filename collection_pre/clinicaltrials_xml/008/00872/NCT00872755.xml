	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic Nissen Fundoplication has established itself as the procedure of choice in the surgical management of the majority of patients suffering from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Postoperative paraesophageal herniation has incidence ranges up to 7% in the immediate postoperative period. This randomized controlled study was scheduled to investigate the role of the posterior gastropexy, in combination with laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication, in prevention of paraesophageal herniation and improvement of postoperative results, in surgical treatment of GERD.</brief_summary>
