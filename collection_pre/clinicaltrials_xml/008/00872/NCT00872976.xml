	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria (Cohort #1): Diagnosis of BCLL by NCI criteria Require chemotherapy and have fully recovered from previous administered chemotherapy Subjects must have progressed, failed to achieve a meaningful response, or relapsed/intolerant to prior therapy. Failing at least one purine analogue regimen Subjects have received three or fewer prior treatment regimens ECOG status of 0 2 Inclusion Criteria (Cohort #2): If dose level + 3 is reached, the criteria is the same as outlined for Cohort #1, however the subjects should not have a history of prior chemotherapy (treatment naive) Unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method to avoid pregnancy Uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease, including prolonged QTc interval History of significant bleeding disorder, unrelated to CLL Prior concurrent malignancy Drugs that generally accepted to have the risk of causing Torsades de Pointes Autoimmune hemolytic anemia requiring therapy or transfusion support Autoimmune thrombocytopenia requiring steroid therapy or transfusion support Richter's Syndrome Transformation to prolymphocytic leukemia</criteria>
