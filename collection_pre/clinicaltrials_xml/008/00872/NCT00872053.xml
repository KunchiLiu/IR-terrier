	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study is to: 1. Collect pilot data on the effect of task-specific lower extremity training using the Anklebot on subjects with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and who have foot drop; 2. Collect pilot data on the use of combination therapy on improving gait in subjects with MS. This therapy will use both Anklebot training and robot-assisted gait training. Hypothesis: Both trainings will result in improved walking performance, but the combination therapy will result in greater gains than ankle training alone.</brief_summary>
