	<brief_summary>This randomized study investigates two different diagnostic strategies for patients with suspected pulmonary sarcoidosis stage I/II. The objective is to assess the role of endosonography (EBUS/ EUS - FNA) in demonstrating non-caseating granulomas in comparison with conventional bronchoscopy (TBLB + EBB). Also the researchers investigate the additional value of BAL, in relation to endosonography and conventional bronchoscopy (TBLB + EBB), in diagnosing sarcoidosis. Thirdly the researchers aim to assess the rate of complications in both the endosonography and conventional bronchoscopic workup.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial for the Diagnosis of Sarcoidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sarcoidosis is the most prevalent interstitial lung disease in Western-Europe and the US. The disease is most prevalent in young adults. To set the final diagnosis of sarcoidosis, the following parameters need to be present: 1. A clinical and radiological suspicion of sarcoidosis stage I/II. 2. A tissue diagnosis of disease-specific non-caseating granulomas. 3. Exclusion of possible alternative diagnoses as lung cancer or tuberculosis. Nowadays, a bronchoscopy with lung biopsies is advised to set a tissue diagnosis of sarcoidosis. However, these biopsies are only diagnostic in 70% of the procedures and they are associated with a 3% risk of coughing up blood and a 4% risk of a lung collapse. Since recently, a new diagnostic procedure has come available. This procedure, endo-sonography, makes it possible to biopsy lymph nodes in the chest under direct visualization and has a diagnostic accuracy of 85%. The associated risk of complications appears to be small (&lt;1%) We consider the current standard for the diagnostics of sarcoidosis to be outdated, considering the clinical availability of endo-sonography. We expect that endo-sonography is more frequent diagnostic for a tissue diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Also we hypothesize that this technique is safer and more preferred by patients.</detailed_description>
