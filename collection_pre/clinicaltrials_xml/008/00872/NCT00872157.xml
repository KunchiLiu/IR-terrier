	<brief_title>BMTP-11 in Patients With Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer With Bone Mets</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug: BMTP-11 is designed to use a protein to bind to cancer cells, move into the cancer cells, and cause the cancer cells to die. This is the first study using BMTP-11 in humans. Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose level of BMTP-11 based on when you joined this study. Up to 2 dose levels of BMTP-11 will be tested. Three (3) participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of BMTP-11 is found. Study Drug Administration: On Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle, you will receive BMTP-11 though a needle into your vein over 2 hours. Before each dose of BMTP-11, you will receive saline (salt water) by vein for over 2 hours. Study Visits: On Days 7 and 14 of Cycles 1 and 2, the following tests and procedures will be performed: - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs, height, and weight. - Your performance status will be recorded. - You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and if you have experienced any side effects. - Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests. A portion of this blood will also be used to check your heart health. - Urine will be collected over 24 hours to test your kidney function. On Day 21 of Cycles 1 and 2, the following tests and procedures will be performed: - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs, height, and weight. - Your performance status will be recorded. - You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and if you have experienced any side effects. - Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests. A portion of this blood will also be used to check your heart health. - Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to measure your prostatic specific antigen (PSA) and testosterone levels. - Urine will be collected over 24 hours to test your kidney function. On Day 1 of Cycle 2, the following tests and procedures will be performed: - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs, height, and weight. - Your performance status will be recorded. - You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and if you have experienced any side effects. - Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests. A portion of this blood will also be used to check your heart health. - Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to measure your PSA and testosterone levels. Length of Study: You will be on active study for up to 9 weeks. You will be taken off study if you experience intolerable side effects or the disease gets worse. Please note that even if the treatment has a beneficial effect on the cancer, the treatment cannot be continued for more than two cycles due to the very limited supply of drug available. End-of-Study Visit: Between 4 and 6 weeks after the last dose of study drug, you will have an end-of-study visit. At this visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed: - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs, height, and weight. - Your performance status will be recorded. - You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and if you have experienced any side effects. - Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. This routine blood draw will include measurement of your PSA and testosterone levels. A part of this blood will also be used to see if your immune system reacted to BMTP-11 by forming an antibody and to assess your heart's health. - Urine will be collected for 24 hours to test for protein in your urine. - You will have CT or MRI scans of your abdomen and pelvis to check the status of the disease. - You will have a chest x-ray. - You will have a bone scan to check the status of the disease. Follow-Up: At 3, 6, and 9 months after the last dose of study drug, you will be called or e-mailed and asked how you are doing. This will only take a few minutes. You will be required to have blood drawn (about 1 teaspoon) for routine testing. This can be done at your local doctor's office and results faxed to MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). This is an investigational study. BMTP-11 is not FDA approved or commercially available. At this time, BMTP-11 is only being used in research. Up to 22 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Prostatic Neoplasms</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. Have histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate, with clinically significant bone metastases exhibiting castrateresistant progression. Progression is defined as any of the following: 1) New lesions or obviously worsening lesions on bone scan within the previous three months; 2) a PSA doubling time of &lt; 3 months; 3) New or progressive symptoms requiring a change in therapy that are referable to the cancer; 4) New extraosseous lesions within the past 3 months 2. Have progression in the face of a serum testosterone of less than 50 ng/dL, and have either failed or refused chemotherapy 3. Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0, 1 or 2 4. Have adequate bone marrow function defined as an absolute peripheral granulocyte count of &gt;/= 1,000/mm^3 and platelet count of &gt;/= 140,000/mm^3; hemoglobin &gt;/= 9.0 g/dL (without transfusion or growth factor support), unless the patient is &lt; 6 weeks from last cancer therapy in which case transfusion is allowed. 5. Have adequate hepatic function defined as a total bilirubin of &lt;/= 1.5 mg/dl and AST &lt;/= 2* the upper limits of normal 6. Have adequate renal function defined as serum creatinine &lt;/= 1.5* the upper limits of normal or creatinine clearance &gt;/= 60 mL/min (measured or calculated). In the absence of hematuria, patients must have either a negative urinalysis for protein (i.e. no more than "trace" by dipstick) or a 24 hour urine collection showing less than 1,000 mg of protein/24 hour. In the presence of hematuria, patients may have up to 2,000 mg of protein/24 hour. 7. Have adequate cardiovascular function as defined by: i) a normal betanatruetic peptide (BNP) with ii) no signs or symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease and iii) a normal Electrocardiography (ECG). Alternatively, patient not meeting all of these criteria is still eligible if he has both i) an echocardiogram showing an ejection fraction (EF) of 45% or greater (and no more than "mild" diastolic dysfunction) and ii) a Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP)of &lt; 200 8.

(Nonobstructive hydronephrosis in setting of prior urinary diversion is allowed.) 7.
