	<brief_summary>Laser Trabeculoplasty has been shown to be effective in lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Although initially demonstrated with the Argon laser (ALT), several other laser systems have also been employed with comparable efficacy. Recently, Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty (SLT) has been shown to lower intraocular pressure comparable to ALT. The advantage of SLT is that the target eye structure, the trabecular meshwork, remains intact with minimal damage at the cellular level. In contrast, ALT lowers IOP at the expense of scarring of the trabecular meshwork. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of lowering IOP with Pascal Laser Trabeculoplasty (PLT) employing reduced energy levels compared to ALT and a computer guided pattern of laser treatment applications.</brief_summary>
