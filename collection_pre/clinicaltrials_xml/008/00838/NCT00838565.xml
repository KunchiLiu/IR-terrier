	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of PF-04236921 administered monthly as three intravenous infusions. Each group of patients will be assigned to a dose level; Safety and tolerability of a low dose level will be required before proceeding to successively higher dose levels. Blood tests will be performed to measure the amount of drug and changes in measures of inflammation.</brief_summary>
