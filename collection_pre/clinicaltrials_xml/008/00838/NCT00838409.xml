	<detailed_description>To examine physiological and behavioral factors that may help determine health in perimenopausal middle age women. Neuroendocrine function will be measured by broad assessment of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity. We will also assess metabolic profiles and behavioral and emotional function. We plan to determine correlations between these measures and nutritional state. Other measures may include insulin, glucose, leptin, IGF-1, triglycerides, free fatty acids, and ghrelin and eating attitudes and physical reactivity.</detailed_description>
