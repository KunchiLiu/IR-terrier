	<brief_summary>The objective of this randomized, single-dose, two-way evaluation is to compare the bioequivalence of a test cilostazol formulation to an equivalent oral dose of the commercially available cilostazol in a test population of 36 adult subjects under fasting conditions.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Sex: Male and Female; similar proportion of each preferred. Female subjects must be surgically sterile for at least six (6) months or postmenopausal for at least one (1) year. Age: At least 18 years. Weight: Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 or less. Qualifying subjects must be in good health and physical condition as determined by medical history, complete physical examination, and laboratory test, all obtained within four (4) weeks prior to study start. The subject may not have a history of significant past illness expected to affect the investigation. The normal status of subjects will be confirmed by the following procedures: Laboratory Tests: Hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC, WBC, differential count, serum electrolytes (Na, K, Cl), fasting blood glucose, BUN, bilirubin, creatinine, AST, ALT, LD, alkaline phosphatase, and urinalysis. HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and drugs of abuse testing will be done for screening purposes only. Urine drugs of abuse testing will be repeated at each checkin. Female subjects will have a serum pregnancy test done at screening and a urine pregnancy test prior to each study period at checkin. Laboratory values which are greater than 20% of the normal range will not qualify unless specifically accepted (with comment) by the Principal Investigator. Results of HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and drugs of abuse must be negative or nonreactive for the subject to qualify for the study. Electrocardiogram A 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be obtained for all subjects. The original tracings, plus interpretation, will be included in the case report form packet. Subjects must read and sign the Consent Form. History of treatment for alcoholism, substance abuse, or drug abuse within past 24 months. History of sensitivity to cilostazol, quinolones, or any antiplatelet drug. History of malignancy, stroke, diabetes, cardiac, renal or liver disease or other serious illness. History of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), malabsorption syndrome, colon cancer, or chronic colitis, including Crohn's disease. History of treatment for pulmonary obstruction or asthma within the past five (5) years. History of severe headaches or migraines. History of glaucoma. History of chronic infectious disease. History of psychiatric disorder. History of thyroid disorder/disease. History of hypertension. Females who are capable of becoming pregnant or are lactating. Inability to read and/or sign the consent form. Treatment with any other investigational drug during the four (4) weeks prior to the initial dosing for this study. Subjects who have donated blood within four (4) weeks prior to the initial dosing for this study. Subjects who smoke or use tobacco products or are currently using nicotine products (patches, gums, etc.). Three months abstinence is required.</criteria>
