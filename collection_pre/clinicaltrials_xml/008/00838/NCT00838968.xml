	<brief_title>The Efficiency of Postoperative Interferon-alpha Treatment in p48 Positive Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: Postoperative interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) therapy improved survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). P48 is a predictive marker for outcome of postoperative interferon-alpha treatment in patients with HCC. Our study is to identify the Efficiency of Postoperative IFN-Alpha Treatment in p48 Positive Patients With HCC. METHODS: An immunohistochemical study of P48 was performed on specimens that were collected from patients who underwent a curative resection of HCC. These patient with p48 Positive were randomized divided into a treatment group who received postoperative IFN-alpha therapy and a comparison group who not received. Besides the side effect, the overall survival rate and the disease-free survival rate will be observed. Anticipated RESULTS: IFN alpha treatment improved the overall survival of p48 Positive patients with HCC after curative resection, probably by postponing recurrence.</detailed_description>
