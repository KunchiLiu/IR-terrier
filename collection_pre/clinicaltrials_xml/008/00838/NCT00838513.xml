	<criteria>Inclusion Critera: 1. Male or female patients' ≥18 years of age who have been diagnosed with Atypical HemolyticUremic Syndrome (aHUS). 2. Patients must be receiving PT for aHUS and must be observed to receive ≥ 1 PT treatment every two weeks and no more than 3 PT treatments/week (at an unchanged frequency) for at least 8 weeks before first dose of IP. 3. Platelet Count PrePT Baseline SetPoint (collected in the hours before the Qualifying PT Episode) is within 75% of the average of the PrePT platelet counts collected at Screening and during the Observation Period. 4. Known complement regulatory protein genetic abnormality. 5. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level at screening or at the onset of the current aHUS episode was ≥ ULN. If LDH is normal at screening, other markers indicative of ongoing hemolysis such as haptoglobin, schistocytes should be evaluated and discussed with Sponsor. 6. Creatinine level ≥ ULN for age. 7. Female patients of childbearing potential must be practicing an effective, reliable and medically approved contraceptive regimen during the entire duration of the study, including the followup period and for up to 5 months following eculizumab treatment discontinuation. 8. Able to give written informed consent. 9. Able and willing to comply with study procedures. 1. TTP, (defined as ADAMTS13 activity &lt;5%) from an historical observation (prior to initiation of plasma therapy) or as tested at the screening visit by the central laboratory. 2. Malignancy within 5 years of screening. 3. Typical HUS (Shiga toxin +). 4. Known HIV infection. 5. Identified drug exposurerelated HUS. 6. Infectionrelated HUS. 7. HUS related to bone marrow transplant. 8. HUS related to vitamin B12 deficiency. 9. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of sepsis. 10. Presence or suspicion of active and untreated systemic bacterial infection that, in the opinion of the Investigator confounds an accurate diagnosis of aHUS or impedes the ability to manage the aHUS disease. 11. Pregnancy or lactation. 12. Unresolved meningococcal disease. 13. Known Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) or antiphospholipid antibody positivity or syndrome. 14. Any medical or psychological condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, could increase the patient's risk by participating in the study or confound the outcome of the study. 15. Patients who have received previous treatment with eculizumab. 16. Patients receiving IVIg within 8 weeks or Rituximab therapy within 12 weeks of the screening visit. 17. Patients receiving other immunosuppressive therapies such as steroids, mTOR inhibitors or tacrolimus are excluded unless: [1] part of an established posttransplant antirejection regime, [2] patient has confirmed antiCFH antibody requiring immunosuppressive therapy, and [3] dose of such medications have been unchanged for at least 4 weeks prior to the screening period and throughout the Observation Period or [4] patient is experiencing an acute aHUS relapse immediately after transplant. 18. Patients receiving Erythrocyte Stimulating Agents (ESAs) unless already on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to the screening period, or a washout period of at least 2 weeks from the last dose of ESA therapy. 19. Participation in any other investigational drug trial or exposure to other investigational agent, device, or procedures beginning 4 weeks prior to screening and throughout the entire trial. 20. Hypersensitivity to eculizumab, to murine proteins or to one of the excipients.</criteria>
