	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the antiviral activity as measured by the change in viral load from baseline in the 14 days following initiation of treatment with 4 different dose regimens of TMC310911 co-administered with ritonavir.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Determine the Antiviral Activity of TMC310911 When Administered With Ritonavir in Treatment-Naive Human Immunodeficiency Virus - Type 1 (HIV-1) Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention) and randomized (study medication assigned by chance) study in treatment-naive human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected participants (participants who had not been treated with a therapeutic HIV vaccine within 1 year prior to enrollment and who had never been treated with an antiretroviral [ARV] medication indicated for the treatment of HIV-infection or ARVs for treatment of hepatitis B infection with anti-HIV activity prior to screening). In this study approximately 32 participants will be enrolled and randomly assigned to receive 4 different dose regimens co-administered with ritonavir (8 participants in each dosing regimen). The trial will consist of a screening period (maximum 6 weeks), a treatment period with TMC310911 (2 weeks), and a follow-up period (4 weeks). Safety evaluation will include assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, physical examinations and electrocardiograms.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Documented human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV1) infection for at least 6 months prior to the screening date Participant who has not been treated with a therapeutic HIV vaccine within 1 year prior to enrolment and has never been treated with an antiretroviral (ARV) medication indicated for the treatment of HIV infection or ARVs for treatment of hepatitis Binfection with antiHIV activity Participant agrees not to start antiretroviral therapy (ART) before the baseline visit Able to comply with the protocol requirements and have good accessible veins HIV1 plasma viral load at screening visit of above 5,000 HIV1 Ribonucleic acid copies/mL CD4+ cell count above 200 cells/mm3 at screening HIV2 infected participants and/or participants with any active or chronic hepatorenal disease Life expectancy of less than 6 months Documented acute (primary) HIV1 infection Preexisting protease inhibitor (PI) medication resistance Any currently active Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) defining illness Any active clinically significant disease or findings during screening or medical history or physical examination that in the investigator's opinion, would compromise the outcome of the study Any confirmed grade 3 or 4 toxicity according to the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) grading scale at screening</criteria>
