	<criteria>Subjects must have a clinically documented diagnosis of agerelated cataract that is considered amenable to treatment with standard phacoemulsification/extracapsular cataract extraction. Subjects must be undergoing primary intraocular lens implantation for the correction of aphakia following continuous curvilinear anterior capsulotomy and phacoemulsification cataract extraction. Subjects must require a lens power from 15 to 30 diopters. Subjects must have a visual potential of 20/40 or better in the study eye. Subjects with any anterior segment pathology for which extracapsular phacoemulsification cataract surgery would be contraindicated. Subjects with any inflammation or edema (swelling) of the cornea. Subjects with uncontrolled glaucoma or glaucoma under current treatment in the study eye or with ocular hypertension. Subjects with previous retinal detachment. Subjects with diabetic retinopathy (proliferative or nonproliferative). Subjects with rubella, bilateral congenital, traumatic, or complicated cataract. Subjects who have had previous ocular surgery in the planned operative eye, excluding ocular adnexa surgery. Subjects who have already received an Akreos TL IOL in the fellow eye.</criteria>
