	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of istaroxime in patients hospitalized for Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (ADHF) not requiring inotropic therapy.This will be done by comparing the hemodynamic effect of a 24-hour infusion of three different doses of the drug versus placebo. Efficacy will be measured as a change in Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure from pre-infusion to 6 hours after infusion start. Secondary objectives will include the evaluation of clinical efficacy and safety through assessment of cardiovascular and renal tolerability as well as changes in biological markers such as brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and troponin I (TNI), and the neurohormones renin and aldosterone and also to assess the pharmacokinetics of istaroxime and its metabolites.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Istaroxime in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The 32-day study includes a 48-hour screening period, a 30-minute to 2-hour pre treatment period, a maximum 2-hour period for randomization and measurement of baseline values, a 24-hour treatment period, and a 96-hour post-treatment period. A 25-day follow-up period including a visit on Day 30 will take place after the active phase of the study When considered to be eligible, a first cohort of 88 patients will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive 24-hrs treatment with istaroxime 0.5 μg/kg/min or placebo. If after the continuous safety monitoring and interim analyses the DMC determines that there are no safety issues with this dose, a second cohort of 88 patients will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive 24-hrs treatment with istaroxime 1.0 μg/kg/min or placebo. If after the continuous safety monitoring and interim analyses of the second cohort the DMC determines that there are no safety issues with this dose, a third cohort of 88 patients will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive 24-hrs treatment with istaroxime 1.5 μg/kg/min or placebo. In all cohorts, patients will receive standard of care therapy.</detailed_description>
