	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research study is looking at tissue samples in predicting oral cancer in patients who have undergone neck dissection for oral cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers in Tissue Samples From Patients Who Have Undergone Neck Dissection for Oral Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To test preliminary data from node-positive oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) signatures for their ability to predict lymph-positive primaries using a cohort of OSCC tumors. - To perform lymph node prediction using sentinel lymph node-biopsied primaries. - To validate the preliminary data node-positive OSCC signature and test its ability to predict nodal status. OUTLINE: Patient tissue samples are screened using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for human papilloma virus-specific primers. Samples are analyzed to identify a nodal-metastasis signature for oral squamous cell carcinoma. Samples also undergo microarray analysis to quantify expression levels for targeted genes. Initial data analysis is performed using AffymetrixÂ® Microarray Suite 5.0 to quantify expression levels for targeted genes.</detailed_description>
