	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research study is looking at the cancer genome using tumor samples from patients with stage I or stage II non-small cell lung cancer treated on clinical trial ACOSOG-Z0030.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cancer Genome Study Using Samples From Patients With Stage I or Stage II Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treated on Clinical Trial ACOSOG-Z0030</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To investigate the clinical relevance of conducting comprehensive molecular analyses on clinically annotated high-quality tumor biospecimens from patients with stage I or II, N0 or N1 (less than hilar) non-small cell lung cancer. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Biological specimens are collected from participating clinical sites and analyzed by transcription profiling of RNA and microRNA; detection of DNA copy number changes and chromosomal rearrangements; epigenetic modifications analyses; and sequencing of genomic segments, genes, and regulatory regions to assess sequence variation. Clinical information associated with each specimen donor is also collected.</detailed_description>
