	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at tissue samples from patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DNA Analysis of Tissue From Patients With T-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Identify the transcriptional signatures associated with the presence of NOTCH1 mutations in primary T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells using oligonucleotide microarrays. - Characterize the global changes on gene expression resulting from the inactivation of NOTCH signaling in human T-ALL lymphoblasts. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Frozen lymphoblast samples from patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (NOTCH1-mutated and wild type) are assessed for genetic expression profiles and mutations by microarray analysis and activated NOTCH1 protein by western blot analysis. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 48 samples from patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
