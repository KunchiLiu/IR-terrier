	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Collecting and storing stem cells to study in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about collecting stem cells from patients who have undergone treatment for Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. PURPOSE: This laboratory study is collecting stem cells from patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collecting Stem Cells in Patients With Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Harvest and store adequate CD34+ stem cells from patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) for potential future use in transplantation strategies. - Evaluate the ability to harvest stem cells after therapy for WM (e.g., fludarabine-based chemotherapy) by evaluating the number of days to adequate harvest. - Collect aliquots of stem cells for future research analysis as part of a WM database project. OUTLINE: Patients undergo collection of autologous stem cells beginning on day 4 or 5 and continuing until an adequate number of stem cells are collected. Cells are then cryopreserved. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
