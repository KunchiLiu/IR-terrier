	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Collecting and storing samples of tumor tissue and blood from patients to test in the laboratory may help the study of cancer in the future. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to collect and store samples of blood and tumor tissue from patients with osteosarcoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collecting and Storing Samples of Blood and Tumor Tissue From Patients With Osteosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To collect biological specimens from patients with osteosarcoma at Children's Oncology Group (COG) institutions. - To provide a repository for long-term storage of osteosarcoma-related biological materials. - To make these specimens available to qualified researchers to understand the biology of osteosarcoma and correlate these results with the patients' clinical data. OUTLINE: After the initial submission of blood samples, patients may undergo open or closed biopsy in order to obtain fresh and frozen tissue samples as well as paraffin embedded material. Patients who are enrolled at the time of initial diagnosis but then have a definitive surgery or develop recurrent disease may submit additional samples (paraffin block, frozen and fresh tumor tissue, or slides together with blood samples). Autopsy tumor samples may also be submitted.</detailed_description>
