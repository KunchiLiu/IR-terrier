	<brief_summary>The investigators have previously demonstrated that the administration of insulin in the form of an infusion with additional sugar and potassium may improve cardiovascular performance and reduce biochemical evidence of heart muscle injury in non-diabetic patients undergoing coronary artery surgery. The investigators now seek to demonstrate that similar benefits can be achieved in diabetic patients by administering insulin to maintain as near absolutely normal sugar levels as possible.</brief_summary>
