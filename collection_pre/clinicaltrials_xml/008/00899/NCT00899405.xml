	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Examine the mutational status of the EGFR pathway in tumor and blood samples from patients with lung cancer. - Correlate the EGFR pathway mutations in these samples with clinical outcomes of these patients. OUTLINE: Archived tumor tissue and blood samples are analyzed via PCR to detect EGFR pathway mutations in DNA.</detailed_description>
