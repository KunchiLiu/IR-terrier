	<brief_summary>This research study is collecting and storing samples of tumor tissue, bone marrow, and blood from patients with Ewing sarcoma. Collecting and storing samples of tumor tissue, bone marrow, and blood from patients with cancer to test in the laboratory may help the study of cancer in the future.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collecting and Storing Biological Samples From Patients With Ewing Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. Collect biological specimens, including associated demographic and clinical data, from patients with Ewing sarcoma. II. Provide a repository for long-term storage of Ewing sarcoma-related biological materials. III. Make collected specimens available to qualified researchers to understand the biology of Ewing sarcoma and correlate these results with demographic and clinical data. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo collection of tumor specimens, bone marrow, and peripheral blood at diagnosis. Associated demographic and clinical data are collected and archived. Patients who are not enrolled on a therapeutic clinical trial are followed annually.</detailed_description>
