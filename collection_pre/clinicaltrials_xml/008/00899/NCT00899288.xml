	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of fingernails in the laboratory from patients with breast cancer may help in evaluating bone health in postmenopausal women undergoing hormone therapy for breast cancer. PURPOSE: This laboratory study is examining fingernails as a way of evaluating bone health in postmenopausal women with breast cancer undergoing hormone therapy on clinical trial IBCSG-1-98.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fingernails in Evaluating Bone Health in Postmenopausal Women With Breast Cancer Undergoing Hormone Therapy on Clinical Trial IBCSG-1-98</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Compare the effects of tamoxifen vs letrozole on the chemical properties of fingernails by Raman spectroscopy in postmenopausal women with breast cancer undergoing adjuvant hormonal therapy on protocol IBCSG-1-98. - Determine the efficacy of nail structure for evaluating bone fragility. Secondary - Compare fingernail assessments in patients who have had a bone fracture vs those who have not. - Determine the natural variation in chemical (Raman spectroscopy) properties of 2 fingernails sourced at 1 appointment from the same donor. - Evaluate the effect of further drug treatment (after 6 months) on the chemical properties of fingernails. OUTLINE: This is a single-blind, multicenter, pilot study. Patients are stratified according to treatment on protocol IBCSG-1-98 (tamoxifen vs letrozole) and bone fracture (yes vs no). Fingernail clippings are collected at baseline and 6 months later. Fingernail clippings are examined by Raman spectroscopy. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
