	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether subjects receiving a high-flexion knee prosthesis show a better knee function than patients receiving a standard knee prosthesis. Thigh-calf contact force measurements are used to quantify knee function. The investigators' hypothesis is that high-flexion knees show a better knee function.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study title: Functional evaluation of a standard and a high-flexion knee prosthesis using thigh-calf contact force measurements. Objective: The objective of this study is to investigate whether subjects receiving a high flexion knee prosthesis (Sigma RP-F, J&amp;J, UK) show a better knee function than patients receiving a standard knee prosthesis (Sigma FB, J&amp;J, UK). Study Design: Prospective double blind randomized study. Study population: Subjects who will receive total knee arthroplasty (TKA) because of invalidating gonarthritis based on primary osteoarthritis or rheumatic disorders or trauma. Intervention: - 28 subjects will receive the standard Sigma FB knee prosthesis. - 28 subjects will receive the high flexion Sigma RP-F knee prosthesis.</detailed_description>
