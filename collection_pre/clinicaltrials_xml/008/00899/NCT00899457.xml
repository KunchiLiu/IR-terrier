	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood, urine, sputum, mouth cells, and bronchial tissue from healthy participants in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors learn more about the development of cancer. PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking for molecular markers in predicting lung cancer development using tissue samples from healthy participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Molecular Markers in Predicting Lung Cancer Development Using Tissue Samples From Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To obtain biological specimens from healthy participants with no known risk of lung cancer to use as controls in the study of lung cancer progression. - To identify new molecular abnormalities specific to the development of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. OUTLINE: Serum, urine, sputum, and buccal cell samples are collected. Patients also undergo bronchoscopy for collection of bronchial tissue and bronchial brush samples. The samples are used for genomic and proteomic studies to identify new molecular abnormalities specific to the development of lung cancer.</detailed_description>
