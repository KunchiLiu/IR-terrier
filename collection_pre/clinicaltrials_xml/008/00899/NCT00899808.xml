	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. PURPOSE: This research study is looking at molecular markers and genetic markers in patients undergoing radiation therapy for cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Molecular Markers and Genetic Markers in Patients Undergoing Radiation Therapy for Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Determine local-regional control in patients undergoing radiation therapy for cancer, as a function of expression of specific molecular/genetic markers. Secondary - Determine complications of radiation therapy for patients undergoing radiation therapy for cancer. OUTLINE: Previously collected tissue samples are analyzed using immunohistochemical staining and other molecular/genetic study methods to detect markers, including p53, cyclin D1, HER-2-neu, bcl-2/BAX, and EGFR. Patient charts are also reviewed with emphasis on local-regional relapse.</detailed_description>
