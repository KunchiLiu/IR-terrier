	<brief_title>Occlusal Adjustment as Treatment for Chronic Orofacial Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are very common disorders in daily dentistry and oral and maxillofacial practice. The key symptoms are jaw joint pain and limited mouth opening. Other than trauma, the causes remain unknown; consequently, there are no treatments based on specific etiologies. In our experience, patients can usually receive beneficial occlusal adjustments if these are carefully planned and performed in two steps: (1) elimination of premature contacts, which reduces loads in the temporomandibular joints, and (2) individualized remodeling of lateral anterior guidance to facilitate unilateral alternate chewing. The study will use stratified blocking randomization to blindly assign patients to the real or placebo treatment groups in order to evaluate the null hypothesis (H0) that "Occlusal adjustment of sufficient quality has no effect on chronic pain and/or limited mouth opening in TMD patients."</detailed_description>
