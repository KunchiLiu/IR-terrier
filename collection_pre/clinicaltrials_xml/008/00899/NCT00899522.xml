	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Collecting and storing samples of tumor tissue from patients with Fanconi anemia to test in the laboratory may help the study of cancer in the future. PURPOSE: This laboratory study is collecting and storing tumor tissue samples from patients with Fanconi anemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tissue Sample Collection From Patients With Fanconi Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - Acquire rare solid tumor samples from patients with Fanconi anemia in order to create a Fanconi Anemia Cell Repository at the Oregon Health and Science University Cancer Institute. - Study repository tissue using a variety of molecular methods, including gene microarrays. - Develop cancer cell lines that are publicly available from tissue archived from patients with Fanconi anemia. OUTLINE: Tumor biopsies are collected from patients with Fanconi anemia and archived for future molecular studies, cell line generation, and general usage by the research community at large. Medical information about the patient's cancer is also archived. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not specified.</detailed_description>
