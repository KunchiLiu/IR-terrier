	<brief_summary>Primary objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of goserelin acetate (Zoladex) in preserving ovarian function in premenopausal women undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy for primary invasive breast cancer by documenting persistence or resumption of regular menses via menstrual history, serum FSH and E2 measurements. The secondary objectives of this study are as follows: To investigate the impact of treatment with chemotherapy with or without goserelin acetate (i.e. impact of the expectation of ovarian function preservation) on participants' quality of life (QOL) by FACT-ES scale, and to compare safety and tolerability of study drugs in two treatment groups by evaluation of adverse events.</brief_summary>
