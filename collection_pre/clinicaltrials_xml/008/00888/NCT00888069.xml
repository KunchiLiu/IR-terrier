	<brief_summary>This study will investigate how the levels of a single dose of CTAP101 changes in the body over time (pharmacokinetics, PK) and how CTAP101 affects other mineral and hormonal balances (pharmacodynamics, PD) in patients with Stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) with vitamin D insufficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT).</brief_summary>
