	<brief_summary>This phase II trial is studying how well brivanib alaninate works in treating patients with endometrial cancer that has come back (recurred) or is persistent. Brivanib alaninate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brivanib Alaninate in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Persistent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the activity of brivanib (brivanib alaninate) for patients with recurrent or persistent endometrial cancer with the frequency of patients who survive progression-free for at least 6 months after initiating therapy or have objective tumor response.. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival. II. To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of brivanib as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v)3.0 in this cohort of patients. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether activating mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) are associated with progression-free survival status &gt; 6 months following brivanib treatment, objective tumor response following brivanib treatment, or endometrioid histology. II. To explore the associations between select biomarkers and response to brivanib (progression-free survival status &gt; 6 months and objective tumor response), measures of clinical outcome (progression-free survival and overall survival) or disease status including histologic cell type: i) mutations in FGFR2 or phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor or normal blood cells; ii) immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of the FGFR family and ligands, steroid receptor isoforms or phosphorylated (p) v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT) in FFPE tumor; iii) concentration or the change in the concentration of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or type IV collagen in pre-cycle 1, pre-cycle 2 and/or pre-cycle 3 plasma. III. To explore the relationship among the panel of biomarkers evaluated in this cohort: i) mutations in FGFR2 or PTEN; ii) IHC expression of the FGFR family and ligands, steroid receptor isoforms or pAKT; iii) concentration or the change in the concentration of VEGF or type IV collagen. OUTLINE: Patients receive brivanib alaninate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have recurrent or persistent endometrial carcinoma, which is refractory to curative therapy or established treatments; histologic confirmation of the original primary tumor is required Patients with the following histologic epithelial cell types are eligible: endometrioid adenocarcinoma, serous adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, clear cell adenocarcinoma, mixed epithelial carcinoma, adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified (N.O.S.), mucinous adenocarcinoma, squamous cell, and transitional cell carcinoma All patients must have measurable disease; measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest dimension to be recorded); each lesion must be &gt;= 20 mm when measured by conventional techniques, including palpation, plain xray, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or &gt;= 10 mm when measured by spiral CT Patients must have at least one "target lesion" to be used to assess response on this protocol as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST); tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as "nontarget" lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy Patients must not be eligible for a higher priority Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) protocol, if one exists; in general, this would refer to any active GOG Phase III or Rare Tumor protocol for the same patient population Patients who have received one prior regimen must have a GOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2; patients who have received two prior regimens must have a GOG performance status of 0 or 1 Recovery from effects of recent surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy Patients should be free of active infection requiring antibiotics (with the exception of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [UTI]) Any hormonal therapy directed at the malignant tumor must be discontinued at least one week prior to registration Any other prior therapy directed at the malignant tumor, including immunologic agents, must be discontinued at least three weeks prior to registration Patients must have had one prior chemotherapeutic regimen for management of endometrial carcinoma; chemotherapy administered in conjunction with primary radiation as a radiosensitizer will be counted as a systemic chemotherapy regimen Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, one additional cytotoxic regimen for management of recurrent or persistent endometrial disease according to the following definition: Cytotoxic regimens include any agent that targets the genetic and/or mitotic apparatus of dividing cells, resulting in doselimiting toxicity to the bone marrow and/or gastrointestinal mucosa Note: Patients on this noncytotoxic study are allowed to receive one additional cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen for management of recurrent or persistent endometrial disease, as defined above; however, patients are encouraged to enroll on secondline noncytotoxic studies prior to receiving additional cytotoxic therapy Patients must NOT have received any noncytotoxic therapy for management of endometrial cancer with the exception of hormonal therapy Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1,500/mcl, equivalent to Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE v3.0) grade 1 Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mcl Hemoglobin &gt;
