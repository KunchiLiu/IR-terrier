	<brief_title>Aprepitant for Prevention of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting in Elective Hysterectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is the most frequent side effect after anesthesia, occurring in approximately 30% of unselected patients, and can be increased up to 70% in certain populations and procedures. Despite screening for patients at high risk for PONV, current prophylactic interventions fail to completely eliminate PONV for a substantial number of patients, leading to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, prolonged hospitalizations, multiple doses of rescue therapy, and readmissions to the hospital (2). Aprepitant (Emend) is the first neurokin-1-receptor antagonist in a new class of antiemetics, which has already demonstrated powerful additive effects when combined with dexamethasone and a 5-HT3 to prevent both acute and delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). Early studies have also suggested it may useful in the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Patients undergoing elective inpatient or outpatient hysterectomy will be offered enrollment in this prospective, randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled trial. Subjects will receive Aprepitant vs. placebo prior to induction of standardized anesthesia. Postoperative nausea (assessed with a VRS), vomiting, and use of rescue antiemetic therapy will be documented over a 48h period. Additionally, hospitalization days and readmissions for PONV will be compared. Adverse events will be reported to the IRB and manufacturer. By reducing PONV in a group of high risk patients, we anticipate a demonstrated decrease in rescue antiemetic costs and hospitalization days for PONV related issues.</detailed_description>
