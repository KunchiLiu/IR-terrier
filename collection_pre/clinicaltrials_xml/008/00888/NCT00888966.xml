	<brief_summary>Cardiac arrest is a major health problem reaching 375000 cases in Europe each year. Only 5 to 31 % survive after an out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The main complication after OHCA is the anoxic encephalopathy. Recently mild hypothermia has shown a beneficial effect on survival. But the mechanisms underlying these therapy are not clear. Cardiac arrest is an example of ischemia reperfusion of the entire body. And it is well demonstrated that reperfusion generates an oxidative stress. But it has never been shown in a clinical setting. The aim of the study is to evaluate oxidative stress after out of hospital cardiac arrest treated with mild hypothermia.</brief_summary>
