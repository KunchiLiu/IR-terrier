	<brief_title>Effect of Activities and Exercise on Sleep in Elderly Persons With Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elders with cognitive impairment usually do not a get a good night's sleep and wake up often during their sleep at night. Increased daytime individualized social activity and physical resistance training with walking have the potential to increase nighttime sleep in elders. This can lead to a better quality of life, a decrease in caregiver burden and decrease in nighttime falls for this population and associated fiscal savings. Consent forms for this RCT, were written in large print, followed all the guidelines of the Institutional Review Board of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, and assured the participants that their participation in the study was voluntary.</detailed_description>
