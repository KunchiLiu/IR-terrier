	<brief_summary>The investigators are hypothesizing that by offering both self-help materials and mailed nicotine lozenges we will be able to help increase tobacco abstinence rates among ST users, as well as decrease tobacco withdrawal.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Evaluating Nicotine Lozenges and Self Help</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Smokeless tobacco (ST) is a known human carcinogen. Long-term ST use is known to increase the risk for oropharyngeal cancer. Most smokeless tobacco users wish to quit. Assisted-self help interventions (i.e., self-help manual, a targeted video, and two support telephone phone calls) have been shown to be superior to manual-only interventions for increasing tobacco abstinence rates. These interventions lend themselves to widespread dissemination, but abstinence rates at 6 months remains low (21%). Providing nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to ST users receiving assisted self-help interventions could improve upon these ST abstinence rates. If found to be effective, this intervention may increase the ability to disseminate effective interventions to a population of tobacco users for whom few treatment resources currently exist.</detailed_description>
