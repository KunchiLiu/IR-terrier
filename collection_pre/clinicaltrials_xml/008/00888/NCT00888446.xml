	<brief_summary>This phase 2 study will evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and optimal timing of two injections at three dose levels of the tgAAC09 vaccine in healthy volunteers. Study volunteers will receive two intramuscular injections of tgAAC09 or placebo at Months 0 and 6 (groups A, C, E and G) or at Months 0 and 12 (groups B, D and F) and be followed for a total of 18 months following the first injection with the exception of group G in which volunteers will be followed for 12 months after the first injection (6 months after the second injection). This study will explore whether boosting is possible, and compare a shorter and more practical six-month time interval with a twelve-month time interval.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study design will also assess the effect of the presence of anti-AAV2 capsid neutralizing antibodies at the time of vaccination on the safety and immunogenicity of tgAAC09. Since the prevalence of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to AAV2 capsid is high (IAVI and Targeted Genetics, data on file), this protocol amendment adds Group G which is composed of volunteers who have documented pre-existing anti-AAV2 capsid neutralizing antibodies titers ≤ 1/8. This will assure that there are sufficient numbers of volunteers with and without antibodies for a useful comparison.</detailed_description>
