	<brief_summary>Although many reports have been published on colonic resections in patients with suspected appendicitis and the diseases that cause the decision to resect the colon have been identified and their proper treatments have been established, there is no report on the risk factors present in converting a simple appendectomy into a major colonic resection. The investigators aimed to identify the risk factors that lead the surgeon to perform a colonic resection in patients undergoing surgery for initially suspected acute appendicitis.</brief_summary>
