	<brief_summary>Two standards of care exist with regards to posterior splinting post-operatively. The proponents of splinting feel the additional immobilization decreases the stress on the soft tissue, subsequently preventing or limiting pain while improving early range of motion (ROM). The opposing belief is that the splinting is without therapeutic benefit and that early mobilization is beneficial. With regards to both practices, the surgeon's practice is anecdotally based on past experience. The purpose of this study is to compare the results obtained with and without posterior splinting after intramedullary (IM) nailing for tibia fractures in order to provide evidence based reasoning to guide future practice.</brief_summary>
