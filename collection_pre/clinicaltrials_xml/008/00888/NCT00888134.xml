	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to determine if selumetinib is safe and effective in treating patients with cancers with a mutated BRAF gene. Selumetinib is an investigational drug that works by blocking a protein called MEK, which is known to play a role in the growth of cancer cells lines and tumors that have a mutated BRAF gene. There are multiple types of cancers that have mutations in the BRAF gene and depend on the activity of this gene for their growth and survival.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the objective response rate to AZD6244 (selumetinib) in patients with cancers other than melanoma in which BRAF mutations have been identified prospectively. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate progression-free survival in subjects treated with AZD6244. II. To obtain a preliminary estimate of the objective response rate in non-small cell lung cancers and colon cancers with BRAF mutations. III. To explore biologic correlates of responsiveness to AZD6244, and specifically to correlate AKT pathway activity with sensitivity to MEK inhibition in the BRAF mutant class of tumors. IV. To estimate the sensitivity and specificity of detection of the BRAF V600E mutation in circulating tumor cells (CTC) using a microfluidic platform (the 'CTC-chip'). OUTLINE: Patients receive selumetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 3 weeks. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
