	<brief_title>Does Moderate Physical Activity in Hemodialysis Patients Reduce Inflammation?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with ESRD on chronic hemodialysis patients frequently have elevated markers of inflammation (e.g., serum CRP values) and accumulation of proinflammatory monocyte populations in the circulation. The level of inflammation is highly predictive for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Physical activity has been shown to improve dialysis efficacy by improving the elimination of retention solutes. In healthy individuals, sports activity influences inflammatory immune parameters. The study will observe the influence of moderate physical activity (using a bed mounted cycle for 30min during dialysis thrice weekly) on circulating monocyte subpopulations and inflammatory proteins over a 9 month period in 16 chronic hemodialysis patients.</detailed_description>
