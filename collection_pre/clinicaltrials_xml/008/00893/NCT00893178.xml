	<brief_summary>Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) is a disease that is characterized by vasoconstriction of small vessels of the lung. Many cases do have proliferation of endothelial cells within these vessels. A possible influence of polymorphisms of genes relevant for inflammatory and endothelial processes is suspected. Especially patients with chronic heart failure can develope PH. The reasons therefore are lacking. The researchers investigate different polymorphism and the influence of these on pulmonary artery pressure (measured invasively) in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and patients with primary pulmonary hypertension.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Polymorphism on Pulmonary Pressure in Subjects With Pulmonary Hypertension of Different Cause</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consists of 3 arms-patients with CHF and PH, patients with CHF without PH and patients without CHF and PH. The PH measurement is due to routine catheterization, thereafter we measure different vasoactive polymorphism.</detailed_description>
