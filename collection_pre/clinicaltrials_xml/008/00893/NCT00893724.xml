	<brief_summary>Nutritional supplements have an augmentative effect on the outcomes of standard treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME) and Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration (NAMD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Supplemental Adjuvants for Intracellular Nutrition and Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It has been shown that in chronic diseases, oxidative stress results from Nitric acid reacting with oxygen to form toxins that damage both somatic and mitochondrial DNA. The potential for protecting the DNA and promoting repair by using nutritional supplements will be tested by augmenting standard treatments for DME and NAMD with such supplements. The patients will be randomized to treatment group and placebo group and followed up for a year in a double masked fashion. Anatomic and visual outcomes, as well as side effects will be assessed and analyzed. If the results are promising, this pilot study can be used to design alternative (cheaper, better and longer lasting) treatments for DME, NAMD and perhaps other chronic illnesses.</detailed_description>
