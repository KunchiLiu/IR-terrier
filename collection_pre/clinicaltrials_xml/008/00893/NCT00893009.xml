	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic progressive respiratory disorder causing disability with an increasing burden to the patient, his family and to the health services. Treatment of COPD patients depends on the stage of the disease. COPD responds poorly to corticosteroids, in spite of inflammation is a major component in its pathogenesis. A major barrier to therapy of COPD is resistance to the anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids. The molecular mechanisms for this corticosteroid resistance are now being elucidated, particularly as the molecular basis for the anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids is better understood (12). An important mechanism of corticosteroid resistance in COPD, which is also linked to amplification of the inflammatory process, is a reduction in the critical nuclear enzyme histone deacetylase (HDAC)2 . Since the major changes are at the level of small airways. We will examine the effect of addition of theophylline product to stable COPD patients treated with combined inhaler of inhaled corticosteroids.</brief_summary>
