	<brief_summary>Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor which is acting on various cellular pathways involved in the genesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Sorafenib is therefore a promising candidate for improvement of chemotherapy results in AML. This clinical trial evaluates the efficacy of sorafenib added to standard chemotherapy for AML in patients between 18 and 60 years of age. Patients are randomised to receive either sorafenib capsules or placebo in addition to their chemotherapy. The placebo and the sorafenib group will be compared regarding event-free survival and other clinical outcomes. An event is either treatment failure or relapse or death. According to the study hypothesis, the sorafenib group will have less events than the placebo group.</brief_summary>
