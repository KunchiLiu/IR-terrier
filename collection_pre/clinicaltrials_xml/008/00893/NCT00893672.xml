	<brief_summary>Current guidelines recommend Routine daily chest radiographs (CXRs) for mechanically ventilated patients in intensive care units (ICUs). However, some ICUs have shifted to an On-demand strategy, in which this CXR is only prescribed if warranted by the patient's status at the morning physical examination. Here the investigators compared Routine and On-demand strategies in 21 French ICUs. The working hypothesis was that CXR prescriptions would fall by at least 20% with the On-demand strategy, with no reduction in quality of care.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Two Chest Radiograph Prescription Strategies in Intensive Care Unit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based on a cluster-randomized two-period two-strategies cross-over design, respectively 11 and 10 participating ICUs applied the Routine and On-demand strategies during the first period, each enrolling 20 consecutive patients requiring mechanical ventilation for at least two days. Each ICUs applied then applied the alternative strategy during the second period, again enrolling 20 consecutive patients.</detailed_description>
