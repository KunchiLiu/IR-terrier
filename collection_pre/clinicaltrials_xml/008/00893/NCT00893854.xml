	<brief_summary>Cystoids macular edema (CME) is one of the most common causes of low vision due to uveitis. The treatment for reducing the intra-ocular inflammation can decrease the macular edema. In some patients, CME persists even after inflammation control, and additional treatment is needed for better vision. Oral steroid, periocular and intravitreal Triamcinolone are the principles in treatment, but some complications like cataracts and increased ocular pressure have been seen. Diclophenac is a non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug that improves the vision and decreases the macular thickness by slowing down the prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) ending in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition. In this study, the investigators are going to compare the therapeutic affect of intravitreal Diclophenac and Triamcinolone in persistent uveitic cystoids macular edema. Since diclophenac is a cheap and accessible drug in all curative centers it could be applied instead of Triamcinolone.</brief_summary>
