	<criteria>Positive clinical findings (moderate to severe, indicated by a CSSS ≥ 6) for interdigital or bullous tinea pedis as determined by clinical examination (subjects with moccasin symptoms in addition to above may also be included at the discretion of the investigator). Written informed consent must be obtained from the subject. Must ≥ 18 years of age, unless local laws dictate otherwise.

Has a visual diagnosis, by the investigator, of onychomycosis at a level, which in the opinion of the investigator would compromise the integrity of the study. Use of topical antifungals e.g. (clotrimazole, ketoconazole,miconazole, oxiconazole (Oxistat®, Glaxo Smith Kline), sulconazole, naftifine (Naftin®, Merz), terconazole, econazole nitrate (Spectazole®, OrthoMcNeil), butoconazole ,Fluconazole, ciclopirox olamine(Loprox®, Medicis), tolnaftate, haloprogin), ZeasorbAF , antibacterials and corticosteroids in the preceding 14 days of screening visit (Day 1), on or immediately around the area under evaluation. Use of oral or injectable systemic corticosteroids in the preceding 7 or 30 days respectively, of screening visit (Day 1) Use of systemic antifungals in the preceding 30 days of screening visit (Day1) including (terbinafine (Lamisil®, Novartis), Itraconazole (Sporanox®, Janssen), fluconazole (Diflucan®, Pfizer), ketoconazole, miconazole, griseofulvin (GrisPEG®, Pedinol), butoconazole, terconazole, Potassium iodide) Has used any investigational drug(s) within 30 days preceding screening visit (Day 1) Is pregnant or is a nursing mother Is a woman of child bearing potential who is not using an adequate form of contraception (or abstinence) Is &lt; 18 years of age, unless local laws dictate otherwise. Is immunosuppressed (undergoing chemotherapy, neutropenia (PMNs , &lt; 500/mm3), HIV with CD4+ &lt; 200/mm3. Suffers from a condition, which, in the opinion of the medical investigator, would compromise his/her safety and / or the quality of the data. Such conditions may include collagen vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, Cushing's Disease, hematological malignancy, chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis or atopy STATISTICS This clinical evaluation is intended to demonstrate</criteria>
