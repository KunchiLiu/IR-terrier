	<brief_summary>In this study the investigators will assess the tolerance of Nebivolol (Bystolic) in cardiovascular patients who are not able to tolerate conventional beta blockers. A side effect profile will be tracked and compared with previous beta blocker use. The investigators hypothesize that Bystolic will be tolerated by many patients who are intolerant of conventional blockers.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients who have been prescribed standard beta blockers but were unable to tolerate them due to side effects will be studied. They will take a new beta blocker, Nebivolol (Bystolic) for 30 days, if tolerated. Side effects will be tracked and compared to previous.</detailed_description>
