	<brief_title>Evaluation of an Apoptotic Test for Predicting Late Toxicities After Radiotherapy in Breast and Prostate Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The two cancer sites concerned by this trial are intermediate risk prostate cancer treated with conformational radiotherapy with or without intensity modulation, and breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant radiotherapy after breast conservative surgery for patients aged under 60 years of age. The identification of 5% of patients at risk of severe toxicity should allow to deliver high dose radiotherapy among 95% of patients with a lower risk of severe late complications.</detailed_description>
