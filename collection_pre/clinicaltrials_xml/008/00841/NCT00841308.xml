	<brief_summary>This is a prospective randomized study with two arms: the Conventional and Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring arm and the Home blood pressure monitoring arm. The study will include both previously treated and untreated individuals. Before randomization and in the end of the study, measurements will be performed using all three blood pressure monitoring methods (Conventional, Ambulatory and Home) as well as assessment of target organ damage (microalbuminuria, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity and central blood pressure). The participants will be randomized into one of the two arms. Diagnosis and titration will be decided according to either Conventional and Ambulatory blood pressure measurements or according to Home blood pressure measurements. Subjects will be followed up for one year.</brief_summary>
