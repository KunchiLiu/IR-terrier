	<brief_summary>Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD or Whipple procedure) involves the removal of the head of the pancreas and is the primary modality for treatment of peri-ampullary cancers (arising from the common bile duct, Ampulla of Vater, duodenum, neuroendocrine cells of the pancreas, and most commonly the exocrine pancreas). In Canada, cancer of the pancreas is the 11th cancer in terms of new cases/year, and the 5th leading cause of cancer related deaths/year. Following PD the remaining pancreas is re-connected to a portion of the gastrointestinal tract; the pancreas is very soft and difficult to sew and connect safely. The primary cause of complications following PD is related to leak occurring at this connection. Of patients that develop a leak, over half need a second operation, and up to 40% will die. The two main organs that the pancreas may be re-connected to are the jejunum or the stomach. The investigators will compare the rates of pancreatic leakage in two groups of patients randomized to reconnection to either the jejunum or stomach following PD. The goal of this study is to determine which of these methods is safer. The results may change practice patterns across North America and the world. It may in the future prevent many cases of avoidable leakage and the resulting morbidity of this including death. This will therefore reduce the morbidity and mortality of this group of cancer patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Suspected pancreatic or periampullary neoplasm that appears to be resectable based on preoperative imaging (CT scan and/or MRI) and are deemed medically fit to undergo PD. Patients less than 18 years of age will be excluded. As well, patients with distant metastasis, local unresectability, and/or gastric involvement will be excluded. Other exclusion criteria include: female subjects who are pregnant or nursing current use of an investigational drug currently receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy.</criteria>
