	<brief_title>Multicenter Trial of Sublingual Immunotherapy With a Solution of Grass Pollen Allergen Extract in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although highly effective, subcutaneous administration of allergens may cause inconvenience in some patients. Alternative routes, e.g. nasal and oral, have therefore been investigated to find an immunotherapy regimen largely accepted by all groups of patients, including children. Sublingual specific immunotherapy (SLIT) may represent a more acceptable route of immunotherapy. It may be an optimal therapy option especially for children because they often fear injections. In this study children are to be treated with a preparation of a grass pollen allergen extract in a water/glycerol solution with phosphate buffered saline in comparison to a symptomatic standard treatment with add on placebo, in order to investigate efficacy and safety of the study drug.</detailed_description>
