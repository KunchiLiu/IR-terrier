	<brief_title>Regulation of Lipoprotein Transport in Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The metabolic syndrome (MetS) portends diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Dyslipoproteinaemia, reflected by elevated plasma triglyceride and reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations, is a cardinal feature of MetS that independently predicts CVD and is accordingly a therapeutic target for risk reduction. GW5015156 is a new PPAR-delta agonist that could be used to treat dyslipidemia in insulin resistance and obesity. However, the precise mechanisms of action of this agent on lipoprotein kinetics in MetS subjects have not yet fully been investigated. We therefore carried out a study to study the effect of GW5015156 on lipoprotein transport in subject with metabolic syndrome.</detailed_description>
