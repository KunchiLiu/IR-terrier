	<brief_summary>Magnesium iron hydroxycarbonate is a phosphate binder that absorbs phosphate from food, reducing the amount that the body can absorb. The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of magnesium iron hydroxycarbonate in subjects requiring hemodialysis, compared with a marketed phosphate binder, lanthanum carbonate and placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase III Study to Investigate the Safety and Efficacy of Fermagate and Lanthanum Carbonate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High levels of phosphate in the blood are linked with serious effects, due to calcium imbalances (high levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), bone disease, formation of calcium deposites in the body and blood-vessel disease. Current guidelines indicate that blood phosphorous levels should be maintained between 1.13 to 1.78 mmol/L in patients who receive hemodialysis. This is a 2-stage re-randomization design where Stage 1 is a randomized, open label comparison between fermagate and lanthanum carbonate (in a non-inferiority design) and Stage 2 is a randomized double blind comparison between fermagate and placebo (in a superiority design). Objectives at Stage 1: Primary Objective: The primary objective is to establish the efficacy of fermagate by demonstrating the noninferiority (with possible assessment of superiority) of fermagate to lanthanum carbonate in lowering serum phosphate in hemodialysis patients. Secondary objectives: The secondary objectives are to: 1. Determine the safety of fermagate in hemodialysis patients. 2. Compare the effects of fermagate and lanthanum carbonate on measures of mineral metabolism, albumin, pre-albumin and iron status. Objectives at Stage 2: Stage 2 will use patients who complete the 3-month maintenance period of Stage 1 and who were originally randomized to fermagate. Primary Objective: The primary objective is to establish efficacy of fermagate by demonstrating the superiority of fermagate over placebo in lowering serum phosphate in hemodialysis patients. Secondary objectives: The secondary objectives are to: 1. Determine the safety of fermagate in hemodialysis patients. 2. Compare the effects of fermagate and placebo on measures of mineral metabolism, albumin, pre-albumin and iron status.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion: Subjects will be considered eligible for entry in the study if they meet all of the following criteria. 1. Male or female, aged ≥18 years. 2. Able to comply with the study procedures and medication. 3. Written informed consent given. 4. On a stable hemodialysis regimen (at least 3x per week) for ≥12 weeks prior to screening. 5. (a) Subject receiving phosphate binder medication(s) at screening, must have been on a stable regimen (dose and medication) for at least 1 month prior to screening and will remain on this regimen until entry into the washout period OR(b) Subjects (i) is not currently receiving any phosphate binding medication at screening (or medication likely to act as a phosphate binder) and (ii) must not have done so for at least one month and (iii) has sustained hyperphosphatemia. 6. Willing to abstain from taking any phosphate binder or oral magnesium, oral aluminum or oral ironcontaining products and preparations other than the study medication. 7. If required to take &gt;6000 mg/day of fermagate, the subject will be willing to have at least three meals per day. Specifically, for randomization and inclusion into the treatment period, one of the following criteria must be fulfilled: 8. (a) Is not receiving phosphate binding medication at screen and has a screen serum phosphate value above 3.0 mmol/L (9.3 mg/dL)OR(b) Has a serum phosphate value of ≥1.94 mmol/L (≥6.0 mg/dL) at Washout Visit 2 to 4 or above 3.0 mmol/L (9.3 mg/dL) at visit 1 during washout. Exclusion: Subjects will not be considered eligible for entry in the study if they meet one or more of the following criteria. 1. Participation in any clinical trial using an investigational product or device during the 30 days preceding the Screening Visit. 2. Previous experience of fermagate treatment. 3. A significant history of alcohol, drug or solvent abuse in the opinion of the investigator. 4. Any disease or condition, physical or psychological that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the safety of the subject or the likelihood of achieving reliable results or increase the likelihood of the subject being withdrawn. 5. Laboratory findings at screening which, in the opinion of the investigator, are clinically significant for this subject population. 6. A screen serum magnesium concentration of &gt;3.0 mg/dL (&gt;1.25 mmol/L). 7. A known history of hemochromatosis. 8. Subjects receiving either tetracycline or lithium treatment. 9. Subjects receiving nicotinamide (niacinamide) or niacin (nicotinic acid) alone (i.e. not as a constituent of a multivitamin supplementation). 10. A serum ferritin level of ≥1500 ng/mL (≥3370 pmol/L). 11. Nonelective hospitalization in the 4 weeks prior to screening. 12. Female subjects who are of childbearing potential and who are neither surgically sterilized nor using reliable contraceptive methods (hormonal, barrier methods or intrauterine device) or who are lactating or pregnant. 13. Current hypophosphatemia at screening (last 2 consecutive phosphate values of &lt;2.2 mg/dL [&lt;0.7 mmol/L]). 14. Known history of colorectal malignancy, familial polyposis coli and/or strong family history (in 2 or more first degree relatives) of these terms 15. A QTcF interval of &gt;560 ms at screen. 16. Known persistent (&gt;1 month) non compliance (&lt;70%) with prescribed medication regimens at screen. 17. Current clinically significant intestinal motility disorder. 18. Intestinal motility disorder with current or previous use of lanthanum carbonate. 19. Known intolerance to lanthanum carbonate or any excipients of fermagate or Fosrenol medication. 20. Subjects with inflammatory bowel disease that, in the investigator's opinion, is poorly controlled. 21. Subjects placed under guardianship or tutelage. 22. Subjects previously withdrawn from the study. The above inclusion and exclusion criteria would be the same for all countries except the exclusion criteria of the QTc interval would be different for Germany (QTc interval of &gt;470ms at screen).</criteria>
