	<brief_summary>This study will compare the blood pressure (BP) lowering effect of the combination of aliskiren/amlodipine 300/10 mg versus amlodipine 10 mg monotherapy in patients with moderate to severe hypertension by testing the hypothesis that the combination of aliskiren/amlodipine produces a superior reduction from baseline in mean sitting systolic blood pressure (msSBP) after 8 weeks of treatment.</brief_summary>
