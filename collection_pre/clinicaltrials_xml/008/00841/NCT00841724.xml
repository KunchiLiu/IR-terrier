	<brief_summary>The goal of this prospective study is to assess the overall mortality (whether related to relapse/progression or toxicity - TRM-) at one year after allogeneic stem cell transplantation prepared by a so-called reduced-toxicity "submyeloablative" conditioning regimen in patients with hematological malignancies.</brief_summary>
