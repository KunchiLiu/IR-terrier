	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Japan. The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the safety (with emphasis on hypoglycaemia) after switching from long-acting insulin analogue or intermediate-acting insulin to insulin degludec (NN1250, SIBA) on a basal-bolus regimen in subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus.</brief_summary>
