	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to examine whether a specific spice is capable of affecting energy metabolism. Since chili and other spices have been shown to increase energy expenditure and in some cases also affect energy intake/appetite compared to placebo, the investigators expect that the specific spice may actually increase energy expenditure and potentially also decrease appetite - although not to a large degree.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of a Specific Spice on Energy Metabolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several pungent food ingredients, such as chili, and also other bioactive food ingredients, e.g. green tea, have been shown to be able to increase energy expenditure and fat oxidation during the hours following a meal containing the bioactive ingredient. Furthermore, we will also look at the subjects own feelings of appetite and thereby examine whether the appetite is affected by the spicy food, since a few studies have suggested an effect of bioactive ingredients on appetite/energy intake. We expect to see some small effects on these parameters.</detailed_description>
