	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of collagen cross-linking in the cornea in halting the progression and possibly partially reversing the effects of keratoconus. Keratoconus is a progressive weakening in the cornea that causes irregular astigmatism and thinning of the cornea. The overall effect is reduction of vision, and in more advanced cases, scarring of the cornea that may lead to the need for corneal transplantation. Cross-linking has been shown increase the rigidity of the cornea. The patients would be treated once and then followed over 24 months. .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal is for two groups of approximately 66 patients to be included in the study. One eye from the first group will undergo treatment, while the second group of age matched individuals will serve as a control. It will be a prospective, randomized, blinded study. Each patient will be randomized at the beginning of enrollment in the study and will receive a randomization number. The following parameters will be followed: 1. Best corrected spectacle acuity (BCSA) 2. The steepest keratometry measurement (KMax) as measured by computerized corneal topography 3. Apical corneal thickness 4. Corneal mechanical resistance. These measurements will be repeated at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12, 18, and 24 months following treatment.</detailed_description>
