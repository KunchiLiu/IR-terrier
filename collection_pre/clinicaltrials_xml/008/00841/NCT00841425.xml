	<brief_summary>Previously the investigators have found that adolescent elite swimmers, who have been involved in competitive swimming for only a few years, have not developed respiratory symptoms, signs of airway inflammation or airway hyperresponsiveness exept for a slight increase in airway responsiveness to eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea. In the current study, the investigators will be doing a 3-year follow-up study on the swimmers studied previously.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Airway Responsiveness and Inflammation in Adolescent Elite Swimmers: a 3-Year Prospective Follow-up Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Even though studies suggest that elite sport can cause AHR and airway inflammation, more studies are needed to elucidate how and when AHR and airway inflammation develop; and there is a lack of follow-up studies. The present study will give us a chance to do a follow-up study to register changes in AHR and airway inflammation in athletes without any significant airway changes at baseline.</detailed_description>
