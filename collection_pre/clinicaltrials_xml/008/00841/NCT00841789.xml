	<brief_title>Etanercept in Kawasaki Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Kawasaki Disease (KD) is a potentially life threatening acute vasculitis in children with a predilection for involvement of the coronary arteries. Aspirin and Intravenous gamma globulin (IVIG) are principally used for the treatment of the symptoms of Kawasaki Disease. Aspirin reduces inflammation and platelet formation, but has no effect in attenuating the development of coronary abnormalities. Although IVIG reduces inflammation and the prevalence of coronary artery abnormalities, it has a relatively high failure rate of 23-30%, warranting new treatment methods for Kawasaki Disease. We propose a placebo controlled double blinded randomized study to determine if etanercept 0.8 mg/kg subcutaneously (max 25 mg) given three times at weekly intervals starting at initial diagnosis is safe in this patient population and if it is a successful adjunct therapy with IVIG in reducing the incidence of persistent or recurrent fever.</detailed_description>
