	<brief_summary>At present, triple therapy are recommended by various guidelines for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. Recent studies have shown worldwide high treatment failure rates with one week first line clarithromycin based triple therapy necessitating salvage strategy to eradicate H. pylori in primary treatment failure. However, the exact duration of bismuth based second line treatment is not determined. Therefore, the investigators performed this study to evaluate the eradication rate of 1 or 2-week quadruple regimen as a second-line therapy.</brief_summary>
