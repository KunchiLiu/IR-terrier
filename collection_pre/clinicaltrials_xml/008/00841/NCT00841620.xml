	<brief_summary>Background: In an international randomised controlled trial we studied how patient self-reported symptoms improved after either a stapled anopexy operation or a diathermy excision of the haemorrhoids. Methods: The study involved 18 hospitals in Sweden, Denmark and the UK. Two hundred and seven patients were randomised. After exclusion of 27 patients, 90 in both groups were operated and followed one year. Patients provided self-reported symptoms before surgery and after 1 year. A patient diary obtained daily self-reported postoperative pain scores (VAS). Surgeons evaluated the anal anatomy before surgery and after 1 year.</brief_summary>
