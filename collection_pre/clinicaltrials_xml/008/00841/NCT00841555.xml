	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving chemotherapy together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of temozolomide when given together with radiation therapy in treating patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme or Anaplastic Astrocytoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the maximum tolerated dose of temozolomide when given in combination with hypofractionated intensity-modulated conformal stereotactic radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed de novo glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma. Secondary - To determine the time to neuroradiological evidence of tumor recurrence or progression in patients treated with this regimen. - To determine the survival time of patients treated with this regimen. - To determine the time spent in a Karnofsky performance status of 60-100%. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of temozolomide. Beginning 1-3 weeks following surgery or biopsy, patients receive oral temozolomide once daily for 5 weeks. Beginning 1 week after starting temozolomide, patients also undergo hypofractionated intensity-modulated conformal stereotactic radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 3 weeks. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months, and then every 3 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
