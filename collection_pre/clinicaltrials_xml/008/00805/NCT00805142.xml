	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics (how the drug is absorbed in the body, distributed within the body, and how it is removed from the body over time; explores what the body does to the drug) of tapentadol prolonged release (JNS024PR, PR) in participants with moderate to severe cancer (abnormal tissue that grows and spreads in the body until it kills) pain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study of Tapentadol Prolonged Release in Cancer Pain Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 2 open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-centric (conducted in more than one center), non-comparative, optional dose-titration study of tapentadol PR in Japanese participants with cancer pain. This study will consist of Screening period (3 to 7 days), Dose adjustment period (3 to 14 days), Fixed dose period (5 days) and Follow-up period (7 days). Tapentadol PR will be administered orally (taken by mouth; to be swallowed) twice daily before meal. For participants previously using opioids, the initial dose of tapentadol PR will be selected depending on the daily dose of opioid at the completion of Screening period. For opioid-naive (moderate to severe cancer pain that is not controlled adequately with non-opioid medications) participants, the initial dose of tapentadol PR will be 25 milligram (mg) twice daily. Participants will receive the same dose of tapentadol PR for the first 2 days of the dose adjustment period and from Day 3, the dose can be titrated as per the Investigator's discretion up to Day 14. After that participants will receive fixed dose regimen for 5 days at the same dose as that used at the end of the dose adjustment period. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by sustained pain control for the 5 day fixed dose phase. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Opioid switching participants should meet the following criteria from a to c: a) Participants with cancer pain b) previously were on opioid medications (morphine sustained release preparations [120 milligram per day {mg/day} or less], oxycodone hydrochloride sustained release tablets [80 mg/day or less], fentanyl transdermal [through the skin] application system [4.2 mg or less]) c) had achieved adequate pain control with opioid therapy Opioid naive participants should meet the following criteria from a to b: a) Participants with cancer pain b) should not have received any pain control therapy with opioids (excluding narcotic antagonist analgesics [drug used to control pain]) Definite diagnosis of any type of cancer, which has been notified to the participant Participants who can be hospitalized during the treatment period Participant who can record 11 point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and 100 millimeter (mm) Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores appropriately throughout the study Participants with bradyarrhythmia (slow, irregular heartbeats) History of mild or moderate traumatic (causing damage, like a toll used to crush tissue) encephalopathy, cerebral (having to do with the cerebrum) infarction (death of tissue because of lack of blood supply) or transient ischemic (decreased oxygen in a tissue [usually because of decreased blood flow]) attack within 1 year before informed consent Previous or concurrent epilepsy (seizure disorder) or convulsive diseases accompanied by disturbance of consciousness Previous or concurrent alcohol dependence or narcotic abuse History of active hepatitis (inflammation of the liver) B or C within 3 months before informed consent</criteria>
