	<brief_summary>Songyou Granule is a mixture of 6 herbs. Vitro and vivo studies showed that Songyou Granule can inhibit HCC cells grow, and HCC metastasis. Hypothesis of this study is that TACE plus Songyou Granule will improve outcome in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared with TACE.</brief_summary>
