	<brief_title>Behavioral Activation for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)/ Depression Treatment in Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF) Veterans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A sizable proportion of soldiers involved in the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts are experiencing mental health and adjustment problems on their return, including posttraumatic stress disorder and depression (Hoge et al., 2004). Both PTSD and depression can be chronic and debilitating disorders, associated with impairments in social, occupational, and physical functioning, as well as high health care utilization (Katon, Unutzer, &amp; Simon, 2004; Stein et al., 2005). Although empirically supported treatments exist for established PTSD and depression, much less is known about effective early interventions for these conditions. Exploration of early intervention options is necessary, particularly in the case of the new veteran population, as such interventions could address social, occupational and physical impairments before they become too intractable. Also, successful early interventions could curtail high health care utilization dramatically across time. The development of such early interventions for PTSD and depression must also take into account any specifications of accessibility and acceptability that are particular to the OIF/OEF veteran population. The present study is a randomized, controlled trial that compares Behavioral Activation (BA), to Usual VA Care (UC) as early interventions for OIF/OEF veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or PTSD and major depressive disorder (PTSD/MDD). Participants will be recruited from the primary health care setting (to increase acceptability and accessibility to the veteran population). Both BA and UC treatment groups will be administered by psychotherapists who specialize in the treatment of PTSD. Both groups will be assessed at pre-, mid- and two post-treatment time points to determine maintenance of diagnostic change over time, health care utilization and treatment satisfaction. This is a dual-site study that will be carried out at both the Portland VA Medical Center (PVAMC) and the VA Puget Sound Health Care Center (VA PSHCS) and coordinated at the PVAMC.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ability to comply with assessment and therapy schedule. Ability to comply with study regulations. English fluency. Must meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD (related to trauma experienced during military service). PTSD will be assessed using the ClinicianAdministered PTSD Scale for DSMIV (CAPS; Blake, Weathers, Nagy, Kaloupek, Charney &amp; Keane, 2003). Bipolar disorder. Psychotic disorders. Substance dependence. Because these conditions warrant alternative treatments. Bipolar, psychotic and substance dependence disorders will be assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSMIV Axis I Disorders (SCIDI; First, Spitzer, Gibbon &amp; Williams, 2002). Report active and imminent suicidal intent. If imminent suicidality is present, this would suggest that a treatment specifically targeting this intent is indicated. Suicidal intent will be assessed using The Brief Assessment for Suicidal Ideation or Behavior that was designed for this study.</criteria>
