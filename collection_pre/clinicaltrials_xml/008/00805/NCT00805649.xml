	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of combined intravitreal therapy with or without prior photodynamic therapy in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In patients with wet AMD, a significant improvement in vision was observed after combined intravitreal therapy with or without prior photodynamic therapy. Both the pharmacological effects of the drugs and the physiological effects of the pars plana vitrectomy (posterior vitreous detachment, liquefaction, and oxygen redistribution) may have contributed to the long-term sustainability of the therapeutic benefits.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective study of a case series included eyes with predominantly classic lesions (Group 1; n = 52) and eyes with occult lesions (Group 2; n = 106). Patients with predominantly classic lesions received low fluorescence photodynamic therapy (42 J/cm2 for 72 sec), followed by, 24 hours later, a 1.5 mL core pars plana vitrectomy with intravitreal injection of dexamethasone (0.8 mg) and bevacizumab (1.25 mg). Patients with occult lesions received a 0.4 mL core pars plana vitrectomy with intravitreal injection of triamcinolone (8 mg) and bevacizumab (1.25 mg). At baseline and follow-up examinations, the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA; logMar), central macular thickness (optical coherence tomography), intraocular pressure (IOP; Goldmann tonometry) were determined. In addition, the need for retreatment was assessed, and adverse events were monitored.</detailed_description>
