	<brief_summary>In this phase II trial the investigators plan to incorporate two targeted agents, bevacizumab and everolimus, into the first-line multimodality therapy of glioblastoma. In the first portion of the treatment, bevacizumab will be added to standard concurrent radiation therapy plus temozolomide. After completing radiation therapy, patients will continue treatment with the combination of bevacizumab and everolimus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RT, Temozolomide, and Bevacizumab Followed by Bevacizumab/Everolimus in First-line Treatment of GBM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although this maintenance regimen departs from the standard treatment with single agent temozolomide, we feel this approach may add to the overall efficacy of treatment for the following reasons: 1) results with bevacizumab/everolimus in renal cell carcinoma suggest there is at least an additive efficacy when these drugs are used in combination; 2) the efficacy of single agent temozolomide following standard concurrent radiation therapy/temozolomide has not been proven, 3) the use of the three-drug maintenance program (i.e., bevacizumab/everolimus/temozolomide) would probably not be tolerated well on a chronic basis in this patient population; and 4) the bevacizumab/everolimus combination has potential advantages as a maintenance therapy, since it has been well tolerated for many months in patients with other malignancies.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age &gt;=18 years. Histologically confirmed intracranial glioblastoma multiforme (WHO grade 4). Patients who have had partial or complete surgical debulking are eligible, as are those with inoperable glioblastoma. No previous treatment with radiotherapy or systemic therapy. Local therapy with a Gliadel wafer placed at the time of surgical debulking is permitted. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Adequate bone marrow function Adequate liver function: Serum creatinine &lt;=1.5 x institutional ULN. Ability to swallow whole pills. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test performed within 7 days prior to start of treatment. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (barrier method of birth control) while receiving study treatment and for 6 months after the last study treatment. Hormonal contraceptives are not acceptable as a sole method of contraception. Female patients must not breast feed. INR &lt;1.3 or PT/PTT within normal limits in patients not receiving anticoagulation. However, patients receiving anticoagulation treatment with an agent such as warfarin or heparin are also eligible. For patients on warfarin, the INR should be measured prior to initiation of everolimus and monitored at least weekly, or as defined by the local standard of care, until INR is stable. Fasting serum cholesterol &lt;=300 mg/dL OR &lt;=7.75 mmol/L AND fasting triglycerides &lt;= 2.5 x institutional ULN. New York Heart Association (NYHA) grade II or greater congestive heart failure (see Appendix B) or symptomatic congestive heart failure. Inadequately controlled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure &gt;150 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 mmHg). History of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months prior to beginning study treatment. History of stroke or transient ischemic attack within 6 months prior to beginning study treatment. Significant vascular disease (e.g., aortic aneurysm, requiring surgical repair or recent peripheral arterial thrombosis) within 6 months prior to beginning study treatment. Prior history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy. History of hemoptysis (&gt;=1/2 teaspoon of bright red blood per episode) within 1 month prior to beginning study treatment. Evidence of bleeding diathesis or significant coagulopathy (in the absence of therapeutic anticoagulation). History of abdominal fistula or gastrointestinal perforation within 6 months prior to Day 1. Serious, nonhealing wound, active ulcer, or untreated bone fracture. Proteinuria as demonstrated by urine dipstick for proteinuria &gt;=2+. For patients with &gt;=2+ proteinuria on dipstick urinalysis, a urine protein: creatinine (UPC) ratio will be determined or a 24hour urine collection will be done. Patients with a UPC ratio &lt;1 or a 24hour urine protein &lt;1 gram are eligible. Minor surgical procedures (excluding placement of a vascular access device), fineneedle aspirations, or core biopsies within 7 days prior to starting treatment. Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to starting protocol treatment or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of study treatment. Patients who have not recovered from the side effects of any major surgery are not eligible. Treatment with any investigational agents within 4 weeks of study entry. Chronic, systemic treatment with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents. Topical or inhaled steroids are allowed. Other malignancies within the past 3 years except for adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix or basal cell or superficial squamous (skin cell) carcinomas.</criteria>
