	<brief_summary>The investigators research will examine the safety and efficacy of hepatocyte transplantation in the patient with acute liver failure without history of chronic disease. The investigators will study the effectiveness in providing a bridge of support for patient survival until whole organ transplantation is possible. This support may also be a bridge to recovery; by allowing the native liver to recover so that orthotopic liver transplant is not necessary. The investigators will also study the safety and efficacy of hepatocyte transplantation in the patient with chronic liver disease. Underlying etiologies of chronic disease may arise from cirrhosis, fibrosis or inherited metabolic disorders. The investigators will examine cell transplantation in end-stage patients not eligible for whole organ transplant. These patients may benefit with an amelioration of symptoms that will allow other therapeutic treatments. The investigators study will also examine the ability of transplanted hepatocytes to treat inherited metabolic diseases (ex., Crigler-Najjar Disease, Familial Hypercholesterolemia, Urea Cycle Disorders). Cell transplant may also act as a 'bridge' to whole organ transplant or improve function, permitting easier disease control through traditional therapy.</brief_summary>
