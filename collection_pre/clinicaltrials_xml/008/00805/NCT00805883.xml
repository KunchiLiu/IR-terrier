	<brief_summary>This is a clinical research study designed to measure the effectiveness of focal Interstitial Laser Thermal Therapy (ILTT) at killing prostate tumours. Patients with "low risk" prostate cancer (Trans Rectal US Guided Biopsy positive) will undergo an MRI scan to try to localize the tumour. If the MRI detects the tumour they will then undergo a perineal ablative procedure (ILTT) under general anaesthetic. Seven days following ILTT they will come back to the hospital for a Radical Retoropubic Prostatectomy (RRP) procedure, which is the removal of a prostate gland through a surgical incision. After removal, the prostate will undergo further analysis to determine the exact location of cancer and evaluate the extent of cancer death caused by ILTT.</brief_summary>
