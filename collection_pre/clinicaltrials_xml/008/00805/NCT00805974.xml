	<brief_summary>The primary objectives are to compare the mean levels of the sleep quality parameters of subjects : with a nocturnal fall of the SBP (Systolic blood pressure), DBP (diastolic blood pressure) and MAP (mean arterial pressure) over of egal to 10% (dipping subjects) and of subjects with a nocturnal fall of SBP, DBP and MAP inferior to 10% (non dipper subjects). The secondary objectives are : Establish correlations between: - The quality of sleep parameters - The parameters of BP variations between the diurnal and nocturnal periods and the awake periods of sleep defined in reference to polysomnography. - The glycemia levels on 24h with a glycemic holter. The parameters of the sympathic system activation evaluated in reference to the measure of the baroreflex sensibility during the awake period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Relationship Between Sleep Quality and Daytime-Nighttime Variations of Blood Pressure and Plasma Glucose Type I</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is a prospective monocentric study after a preliminary period of depistage of the sleep abnormalities by oximetry at home. The patient would be hospitalized for two consecutive days (J0, J1). And the following evaluations will be done: - Nocturnal oxymetric + Epworth questionnaire + clinical questionnaire to detect sleep perturbations at home. - Blood pressure + heart rate measure - Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring on 24 hours - Polysomnographic measurements during the J0-J1 night spend at the hospital. - Questionnaire of sleep quality and of quality of life. - Glycemic measurements on 24h (J0-J1). - Measure of the baroreflex sensibility during the awake period at J1. - Electrocardiogram - Biological examinations (blood and urinary).</detailed_description>
