	<brief_summary>The elderly are the fastest growing proportion of the population. Ageism implies a decline of physical functions affecting functional and safe ambulation. Based on the ICF model intervening in walking capacity could have favourable impact on quality of life of frail elders. Over ground walking training is indicated as a possible exercise. However, to achieve positive results on walking capacity, an exercise-dose response is needed. A more intensive way of promoting walking training is to add skiing poles while walking, a technique called Nordic Walking (NW). This study will be the first to compare NW with usual walking training. It aims to estimate for frail elderly the relative efficacy in improving functional walking capacity of two gait training strategies: NW and usual walking training and explore its impact on fear of falling. This study hypothesized that participants receiving Nordic Walking will walk longer, faster and fear less. NW if proven effective will positively impact on the functional capacities and quality of life of frail elders and provide an more intense method of walking training.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a single blind, randomized, pilot trial designed to estimate the amount of change between two programs. Subjects will be randomized and stratified by setting into one of two groups, over ground walking training with poles (Nordic Walking) or traditional over ground walking training (without poles). Randomization will be computer generated using randomization scheme from the website Randomization.com at http://www.randomization.com Basic descriptive statistics will be used to characterize the participants and compare the two groups at baseline. Paired t-test will be used to estimate the efficacy of each intervention. Effects size of each interventions and its ratio will be calculated. Group-specific change score will be calculated to explore the impact of prognostic variables (age, gender, number of comorbities, baseline gait speed) on change of an outcome (with or without poles).</detailed_description>
