	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Prednisolone and Chloroquine Add on Therapy in Osteoarthritis of the Knee</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fixed dose glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate combination is a treatment to osteoarthritis with some controversy about efficacy. it seems that addition of other agents may improve efficacy and decrease the required dose and cost. common oral corticosteroids such as low dose prednisolone and chloroquine are candidate for such add on therapies. nevertheless, add on therapy may expose the patients to new side effects which should followed and addressed. In this investigator blinded controlled trial, 240 patients with diagnosed osteoarthritis of knee will be enrolled to the study. the patients will randomly be assigned to one of four groups of G (glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate ), P (Glucosamine and Chondroitin sulfate plus Prednisolone), C (Glucosamine and Chondroitin sulfate plus Chloroquine) and PC (Glucosamine and Chondroitin sulfate plus Prednisolone and Chloroquine). each group will consist 60 patients. the investigator(s) will be blind to the groups and interventions.</detailed_description>
