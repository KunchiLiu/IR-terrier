	<brief_summary>The HDH device is intended for creating sutureless vascular anastomosis in various blood vessels. The HDH device consists of four parts: an elastic tube (graft), docking head (anastomotic device), inversion device (connects the vascular graft to HDH) and measuring device. This study was design in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of using HDH device and method an innovative anastomotic device for sutureless aortic anastomosis in patient diagnosed with abdominal aneurysm or Aorto-iliac aneurysm.</brief_summary>
