	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to learn what effects, good and/or bad, Everolimus has on advanced urothelial cancer. The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the study drug Everolimus can shrink or slow the growth of urothelial cancer. The safety of this drug will also be studied. The patients physical state, changes in the size of the tumor, and laboratory findings taken while on-study will help us decide if Everolimus is safe and effective.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must have a diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, urethra, ureter, or renal pelvis, with histological confirmation at MSKCC. Patients must have progressive metastatic disease. Progressive disease will be defined as new or progressive lesions on crosssectional imaging. Patients must have at least one measurable site of disease (according to RECIST criteria) that has not been previously irradiated. Patients must have been previously treated, as defined by the following: Treatment with at least one prior cytotoxic agent but not more than four prior cytotoxic agents. Up to four prior chemotherapy agents are allowed, since conventional chemotherapy ranges from just one drug (e.g., gemcitabine) to regimens that contain four agents (e.g., MVAC is a fourdrug regimen containing methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin). The prior therapy must have included at least one of the following: cisplatin, carboplatin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, or gemcitabine. The prior cytotoxic agents may have been administered in the perioperative or metastatic setting and may have been administered sequentially (e.g., firstline treatment followed by secondline treatment at time of progression) or as part of a single regimen. Patients must have pretreatment tumor tissue available for analysis of mTOR pathway markers. One paraffin block or 10 freshlyprepared unstained slides (on positively charged slides for immunohistochemistry) from the most representative single paraffinembedded tumor tissue block. Slides from the primary tumor are preferred. If both the primary and metastatic tumor blocks are available, 10 slides from each of the sites should be submitted. If tissue from the primary tumor is not available, a paraffin block or unstained slides from a metastatic site are acceptable. Fine needle aspirates (FNAs) have insufficient tumor tissue and are not permitted. Age ≥ 18 years Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 60% Adequate bone marrow function as shown by: ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L, Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L, Hb &gt;9 g/dL Adequate liver function as shown by: serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN INR &lt; 1.3 (or &lt; 3 on anticoagulants) ALT and AST ≤ 2.5x ULN (≤ 5x ULN in patients with liver metastases) Adequate renal function: serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Fasting serum cholesterol ≤300 mg/dL OR ≤7.75 mmol/L AND fasting triglycerides ≤ 2.5 x ULN. NOTE: If a patient's lipid values exceed either one of these criteria upon screening, the patient can only become eligible after successful initiation of appropriate lipidlowering medication. After lipidlowering therapy, patients must meet the same criteria i.e. a fasting serum cholesterol ≤300 mg/dL OR ≤7.75 mmol/L AND fasting triglycerides ≤ 2.5 x ULN to be eligible for study treatment Signed informed consent. Testing for hepatitis B viral load and serological markers (HBVDNA, HBsAg, HBsAb, and HBcAb) for the following patients: All patients who currently live in (or have lived in) Asia, Africa, Central and South America, Eastern Europe, Spain, Portugal, or Greece Patients with any of the following risk factors: Known or suspected past hepatitis B infection Blood transfusion(s) prior to 1990 Current or prior IV drug users Current or prior dialysis Household contact with hepatitis B infected person(s) Current or prior highrisk sexual activity Body piercing or tattoos Mother known to have hepatitis B History suggestive of hepatitis B infection, e.g dark urine, jaundice, or right upper quadrant pain Additional patients at the discretion of the investigator Testing for hepatitis C infection (using quantitative RNAPCR) for patients with any of the following risk factors: Known or suspected past hepatitis C infection (including patients with past interferon "curative" treatment) Blood transfusion(s) prior to 1990 Current or prior IV drug users Household contact of hepatitis C infected person(s) Current or prior highrisk sexual activity Body piercing or tattoos Additional patients at the discretion of the investigator Patients currently receiving anticancer therapies or who have received anticancer therapies within 4 weeks of the start of study drug (including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, antibody based therapy, etc.) Patients who have had a major surgery or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks of start of study drug, patients who have not recovered from the side effects of any major surgery (defined as requiring general anesthesia), or patients who may require major surgery during the course of the study. Prior treatment with any investigational drug within the preceding 4 weeks. Patients receiving chronic, systemic treatment with corticosteroids or another immunosuppressive agent, except corticosteroids with a daily dosage equivalent to prednisone ≤ 20 mg. Patients receiving these corticosteroids must have been on a stable dosage regimen for a minimum of 4 weeks prior to the first treatment with Everolimus. Topical or inhaled corticosteroids are allowed. Patients should not receive immunization with attenuated live vaccines within one week of study entry or during study period. Uncontrolled brain or leptomeningeal metastases, including patients who continue to require glucocorticoids for brain or leptomeningeal metastases. Evidence of another active cancer, except for nonmelanoma skin carcinoma, insitu carcinoma of the cervix curatively treated, and adenocarcinoma of the prostate that has been surgically treated with a posttreatment PSA that is nondetectable Patients who have any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other conditions that could affect their participation in the study such as: Symptomatic congestive heart failure of New York Heart Association Class III or IV. Unstable angina pectoris, symptomatic congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within 6 months of start of study drug, serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or any other clinically significant cardiac disease. Severely impaired lung function as evidenced by: (TLC) &lt;50% predicted, OR (FVC) &lt;50% predicted OR, (DLCO) &lt;40% predicted Uncontrolled diabetes as defined by fasting serum glucose &gt;1.5 x ULN. Active (acute or chronic) or uncontrolled severe infections. Liver disease such as cirrhosis, chronic active hepatitis, or chronic persistent hepatitis. A known history of HIV seropositivity. Impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may significantly alter the absorption of Everolimus (e.g. ulcerative disease, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small bowel resection). Patients with an active, bleeding diathesis. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to administration of Everolimus. Adults of reproductive potential who are not using effective birth control methods. Men and women of childbearing potential must be willing to use effective barrier method contraception during the trial and for at least three months thereafter. Patients are encouraged to continue barrier method contraception for two years or longer after treatment. Hormonal contraceptives are not acceptable as a sole method of contraception Patients who have received prior treatment with an mTOR inhibitor (sirolimus, temsirolimus, everolimus). Patients with a known hypersensitivity to Everolimus (RAD001) or other rapamycins (sirolimus, temsirolimus) or to its excipients. History of noncompliance to medical regimens. Patients unwilling to or unable to comply with the protocol.</criteria>
