	<brief_title>Combined Triple Procedure in Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective study of a case series was conducted in 47 patients (n = 47 eyes; f/m: 21/26; mean age: 66.6 years) with ischemic central RVO (CRVO) (n = 15), non-ischemic CRVO (n = 7), or branch RVO (BRVO) (n = 25). A core pars plana vitrectomy with aspiration of 1.5 ml vitreous and infusion of balanced salt solution (BSS; 1 ml), 8 mg (0.4 ml) triamcinolone, and 1.25 mg (0.1 ml) bevacizumab was performed with a single sutureless sclerotomy and a 23 gauge probe tip. At baseline and follow-up, the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA; 6 m Snellen), and intraocular pressure (IOP; Goldmann tonometry), and central macular thickness (optical coherence tomography) were determined. In addition, the need for further treatment and adverse events were monitored.</detailed_description>
