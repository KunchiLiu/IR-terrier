	<brief_summary>The present trial will be performed to evaluate whether BIBF 1120 in combination with standard therapy of docetaxel in patients with stage IIIB/IV or recurrent NSCLC is more effective as compared to placebo in combination with standard therapy of docetaxel. A secondary aim is to obtain safety information as well as information on quality of life of patients treated with BIBF 1120 in combination to standard therapy with docetaxel. In addition, blood will be collected for pharmacokinetic analysis.</brief_summary>
