	<criteria>Patients must give written informed consent by signing an IRB/ECapproved Informed Consent Form (ICF) prior to admission to this study Patients who are being treated in Study C788006X Patients who completed Studies C788010 or C788011 and did not withdraw due to adverse events Patients who withdrew from Study C788010 at Month 4 or Month 5 because of a predefined lack of efficacy Females of childbearing potential must be fully informed of the potential for R788 to adversely affect the fetus and, if sexually active, must agree to use a well established method of birth control during the study (oral contraceptive, mechanical barrier, long acting hormonal agent). These patients must not be lactating and must have a negative pregnancy test at the time of entry and at each laboratory determination. The patient has a history of, or a concurrent, clinically significant illness, medical condition (other than arthritis) or laboratory abnormality that, in the Investigator's opinion, could affect the conduct of the study. Specifically, excluded are patients with the following: 1. unresolved Grade 2 or greater toxicity in a RA protocol studying R788 2. uncontrolled or poorly controlled hypertension; 3. recent (within past 2 months) serious surgery or infectious disease; 4. recent history (since enrollment in prior R788 study) of, or treatment for, a malignancy other than nonmelanomatous skin cancer, or any history of lymphoma; 5. known to be positive for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV or Tuberculosis; 6. interstitial pneumonitis or active pulmonary infection; 7. known laboratory abnormalities: ALT &gt; 1.2 x ULN, creatinine &gt;1.5x ULN, an ANC &lt;2,500/mm3 or 2.5 x 109/L, lymphocyte count &lt; 600/mm3 or 0.6 x 109L, Hgb &lt; 9 g/dL or 5 mmol/L, platelet count &lt;125,000/mm3 or 125 x 109/L are excluded. The patient has a history of substance abuse, drug addiction or alcoholism. Patients may consume up to 4 units of alcohol per week; however, alcohol should be avoided in the 72 hours prior to lab assessments. Patients who cannot reliably comply with this should be excluded. A unit of alcohol is defined as the following: Beer = 12 oz or 355 mL; wine = 5 oz or 148 mL; sweet dessert wine = 3 oz or 89 mL; 80 proof distilled spirits = 1.5 oz or 44 mL. The patient is unable to report for clinical and laboratory monitoring as per protocol.</criteria>
