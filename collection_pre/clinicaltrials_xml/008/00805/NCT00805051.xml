	<brief_summary>Patients with severe aortic stenosis often suffer from an acquired Von Willebrand syndrome by degeneration of the polymers during passage through the narrow valve leading to turbulences. We hypothesized that the diagnosis of acquired von Willebrand syndrome influence perioperative blood loss in patients undergoing open cardiac valve replacement.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acquired Von Willebrand Syndrome in Severe Aortic Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with severe aortic stenosis often suffer from an acquired Von Willebrand syndrome by degeneration of the polymers during passage through the narrow valve leading to turbulences. After written consent and an extended anamnesis of existing coagulopathy, we take three blood samples in these patients: before surgery, on the day after surgery and 4 weeks after surgery. We determine von Willebrand factor in lab and by a point-of-care platelet function analyzer (Multiplate TM). We measure amount of mediastinal drainage after 24 hours and blood product consumption in these patients.</detailed_description>
