	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study to study whether or not the use of direct radiation therapy with Y-90 microspheres (SIR-Spheres) has any effect on treated liver with respect to tumor response in breast cancer patients. Criteria: - Breast cancer - Clinical evidence of metastatic disease in the liver - Performance status (0-2) - Not pregnant - Laboratory values received after any prior chemotherapy - Normal Pt/PTT - recovered from any chemotherapy side-effects - No prior radiation therapy to the liver - No other MAJOR site of cancer such as lungs or brain - No uncontrolled infections - a candidate for surgical resection or ablation therapy</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patient must pass an MAA angiography study to detect abnormal shunting of the vessels to the lungs and stomach. Shunting of the radiation seeds to these areas, if an abnormality exists would be harmful.</detailed_description>
