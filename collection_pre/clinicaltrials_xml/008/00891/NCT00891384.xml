	<brief_summary>This trial is a randomised, parallel-group, multicenter phase III study for maintenance therapy with lenalidomide in patients with multiple myeloma who were treated with high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation as first line therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of 25mg Versus 5 mg Lenalidomide as Maintenance Therapy in Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High-dose therapy will be performed as first line treatment. After high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation the patients will be included and randomised. Three month after high-dose therapy all patients will receive consolidation therapy with 6 cycles of lenalidomide 25 mg daily for 21 days every 28 days. Afterwards patients will receive maintenance therapy according to their assigned treatment arm. Randomisation will be performed in a 1:1 ratio to continuous maintenance therapy with either 25mg or 5mg lenalidomide daily for 21 days every 28 days.Randomisation will be stratified by ISS-stage (1+2 vs 3, age (younger than 66 years versus 66 years or older), response after high-dose therapy (CR+vgPR vs PR vs MR/SD. Patients will be treated until disease progression.</detailed_description>
