	<brief_title>Primary Care iSBIRT to Reduce Serious Teen Health Risks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We have previously developed and tested a computerized substance use screening and feedback program for adolescents. We will expand this program to include other serious health risks, enhance the feedback and health risk information adolescents will receive on the computer, develop Technological Extenders to extend the effect of the intervention, develop a training video and protocol for providers, and pilot test the system among adolescents coming for non-urgent care at a variety of primary care sites.</detailed_description>
