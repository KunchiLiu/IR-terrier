	<brief_title>A Study of Eliglustat Tartrate (Genz-112638) in Patients With Gaucher Disease (ENGAGE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gaucher disease is characterized by lysosomal accumulation of glucosylceramide due to impaired glucosylceramide hydrolysis. Type 1 Gaucher disease, the most common form accounts for greater than (&gt;) 90% of cases and does not involve the central nervous system (CNS). Typical manifestations of Type 1 Gaucher disease include splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, thrombocytopenia, anemia, skeletal pathology and decreased quality of life. The disease manifestations are caused by the accumulations of glucosylceramide (storage material) in Gaucher cells which have infiltrated the spleen and liver as well as other tissue. Eliglustat tartrate is a small molecule developed as an oral therapy which acts to specifically inhibit production of this storage material in Gaucher cells. This study was designed to determine the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of eliglustat tartrate in adult participants (&gt;16 years) with Gaucher disease Type 1. The study consisted of 2 periods: The Double-Blind Primary Analysis Period (PAP [Day 1 to Week 39]) and the Long Term Treatment Period (LTTP/Open-Label Period (post-Week 39 [Day 1 of the Open-Label Period] through study completion).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The participant (and/or their parent/legal guardian) was willing and able to provide signed informed consent prior to any studyrelated procedures to be performed; The participant was at least 16 years old at the time of randomization; The participant had a confirmed diagnosis of Gaucher disease Type 1; Female participants of childbearing potential must had a documented negative pregnancy test prior to dosing. In addition all female participants of childbearing potential must use a medically accepted form of contraception throughout the study. The participant has had a partial or total splenectomy; The participant had received pharmacological chaperones or miglustat within 6 months prior to randomization; The participant had received enzyme replacement therapy within 9 months prior to randomization; The participant had Type 2 or 3 Gaucher disease or was suspected of having Type 3 Gaucher disease; The participant had any clinically significant disease, other than Gaucher disease, including cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal (GI), pulmonary, neurologic, endocrine, metabolic, (for example, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia), or psychiatric disease, other medical conditions, or serious intercurrent illness that might confound the study results, or, on the opinion of the investigator, might preclude participation in the study; The participant had tested positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody, Hepatitis C antibody, or Hepatitis B surface antigen; The participant had received an investigational product within 30 days prior to randomization; The participant was pregnant or lactating.</criteria>
