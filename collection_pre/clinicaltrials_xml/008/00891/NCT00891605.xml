	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1. Subject must be greater than or equal to 18 years of age. 2. Subject must have a histologically and/or cytologically documented cancer for which paclitaxel has been determined an appropriate therapy, per the Investigator. 3. Subjects with brain metastases must have clinically controlled neurologic symptoms, defined as surgical excision and/or radiation therapy followed by 21 days of stable neurologic function and no evidence of CNS disease progression as determined by CT or MRI within 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug. 4. Subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of less than or equal to 1. 5. Subject must have adequate bone marrow, renal and hepatic function per protocol defined local laboratory testing parameters. Exclusion Criteria 1. The subject has an underlying, predisposing condition of bleeding or currently exhibits signs of bleeding. The subject has a recent history of thrombocytopenia associated with bleeding within 1 year prior to first dose of study drug. 2. Subject is currently receiving or requires anticoagulation therapy (e.g., warfarin at any dose) or any drugs or herbal supplements that affect platelet function, with the exception of lowdose anticoagulation medications such as heparin that are used to maintain the patency of a central intravenous catheter. 3. The subject has active peptic ulcer disease or other potentially hemorrhagic esophagitis/gastritis. 4. The subject has active immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), or a history of being refractory to platelet transfusions (within 1 year prior to the first dose of study drug). 5. The subject has a significant history of cardiovascular (e.g., MI, thrombotic or thromboembolic event in the last 6 months), renal, neurologic, psychiatric, endocrinologic, metabolic, immunologic, or hepatic disease that in the opinion of the investigator would adversely affect his/her participating in this study.</criteria>
