	<brief_title>A Trial of One to One Weight Management in Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary care could make a substantial impact on the increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity and their associated adverse impact on health. The lack of a proven intervention may deter health professionals in primary care from providing support to their overweight patients as few obese people recall receiving weight control advice from a health professional. In this study we aim to conduct a large scale randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of a longer-term structured lifestyle support programme provided by a research nurse and the provision of pedometers compared to usual care in overweight/ obese adults who wish to lose weight. We will assess the degree of weight loss over a period of 12 months as well as related factors such as changes in waist circumference, quality of life and cost-effectiveness of the interventions. The research is highly relevant to policy making at both national and local levels.</detailed_description>
