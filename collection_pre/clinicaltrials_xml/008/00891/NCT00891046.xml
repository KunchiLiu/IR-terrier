	<brief_summary>This open-label extension study will permit patients with Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA) who previously were responsive to treatment with canakinumab and canakinumab treatment-naïve patients with active SJIA with and without fever to be retreated with 4 mg/kg s.c. every 4 weeks and assessed for continued efficacy and safety until discontinuation or when study CACZ885G2402 is in place at their study center or around March 2013, whichever occurs first. Patients who are steroid-free will be able to taper their canakinumab dose to 2 mg/kg s.c. every 4 weeks.</brief_summary>
