	<brief_summary>The intraperitoneal repair has been proven safe for the repair of incisional hernia and is accepted, together with the subfascial or retromuscular repair as the "gold-standard" for the repair of incisional hernia. However no studies have convincingly proven that this approach is better than the on-lay repair. The authors believe that the intraperitoneal repair performs better than the on-lay repair for incisional hernia.</brief_summary>
