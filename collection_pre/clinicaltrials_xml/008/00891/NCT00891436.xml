	<brief_summary>Rationale and objectives: Fluticasone furoate nasal spray (Veramyst) has been shown to improve ocular symptoms when used for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis during the ragweed pollen season. Although this is the only published report of an intranasal corticosteroid shown to effectively treat ocular symptoms, the mechanism has not been delineated. Furthermore, the tears of patients with allergic conjunctivitis are known to have increased concentrations of cytokines and allergic mediators. The objective of this study is to determine if the positive effects of Veramyst nasal spray on ocular symptoms is via the inhibition of allergic mediators in the eyes. The investigators will conduct a double blind placebo controlled trial to determine if Veramyst nasal spray decreases the amount of allergic mediators in the tears of subjects randomized to Veramyst nasal spray versus placebo. The investigators will also compare the subjects' symptoms to the amount of allergic mediators detected in their tears.</brief_summary>
