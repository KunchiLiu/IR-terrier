	<brief_title>Treatment Decision Making Between Oncologists and Women With Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer and Their Healthy Companions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the association between women's and physicians' participatory communication behaviors (e.g., patients asking questions, physicians soliciting questions) on treatment decision-making process and health outcomes. Secondary - To capture the language used in the treatment-decision interactions. - To assess the degree of variation in the language used among physicians and patients who are active participants and those who are less inclined to participate in the treatment decision-making interaction. OUTLINE: Patients and their companions undergo consultation with the physician for treatment decision making. The treatment discussion is audio/videotaped for approximately 45 minutes. Patients complete one short survey prior to physician consultation. After the treatment discussion, patients complete two short surveys, one immediately after the visit in the waiting room before leaving for the day, and the second one a week after the visit by a web-based survey or by mail. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 300 women with breast cancer and 600 companions of these women will be accrued for this study.</detailed_description>
