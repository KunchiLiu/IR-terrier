	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving stereotactic body radiation therapy together with cetuximab may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the side effects of radiation therapy given together with cetuximab and to see how well it works in treating patients with recurrent head and neck cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy and Cetuximab in Treating Patients With Recurrent Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To assess the toxicity of stereotactic body radiotherapy delivered concurrently with cetuximab in patients with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Secondary - To assess the feasibility of delivering this regimen in these patients. - To assess the impact of this regimen on local control, distant control, and overall survival of these patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive cetuximab IV over 60-120 minutes once weekly in weeks 1-5. Patients undergo 1 fraction of stereotactic-body radiotherapy (RT) in week 2. At 4 weeks after RT completion, patients may receive additional cetuximab IV combined with a 28-day chemotherapy regimen, per investigator discretion. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 3-4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.</detailed_description>
