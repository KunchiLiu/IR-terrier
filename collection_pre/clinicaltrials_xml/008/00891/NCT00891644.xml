	<brief_summary>This is the second phase of a two-phase, cross-sectional study of linkage to medical care of HIV positive youth. Social, psychological and behavioral factors associated with receipt of care will be evaluated. This study will also compare three methods for recruitment of out-of-care youth using a randomized permuted block list of possible sequences.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Linkage to Care - Part II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ATN 066b consists of a cross-sectional evaluation of three groups of recently diagnosed HIV-infected adolescents including: (1) care non-initiation; (2) care initiation, no maintenance; and (3) care initiation with maintenance. Social, psychological and behavioral factors associated with HIV-related care-seeking will be assessed using an ACASI. Three recruitment strategies using a randomized permuted block list of possible sequences for HIV-infected youth not in care will be also compared. The ACASI instrument will be adapted from previously used instruments intended to retrospectively reconstruct the care-seeking process and to assess quality of life, concerns and expectations for care, satisfaction with care, and social-problem solving. Ideally, the ACASI will be administered during a single session and may take up to 90 minutes to complete. Participants who are unable to complete the ACASI in one session will be allowed up to 7 days after initiation to complete it. Completion of all study data collection, including accrual period, is expected to take approximately 12 months. Outcome measures will be classified as (1) care non-initiation; (2) care initiation, no maintenance; or (3) care initiation and maintenance. The assessment of recruitment strategies most effective for not in care youth will include: use of usual case-management approaches; snowball sampling and venue-based advertisement.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>HIV Infections</mesh_term>
	<criteria>HIV1 infection behaviorallyacquired at age 10 years or older, by the site staff's best determination; HIV1 infection documented by a positive result on any of the following licensed tests at any time: any HIV1 antibody test confirmed by Western blot, HIV1 culture, HIV1 DNA PCR, or plasma HIV1 RNA PCR &gt; 1,000 copies/ml; NOTE: Anonymous HIV1 antibody test results, with confirmation by Western blot, will be considered an acceptable form of documentation for those individuals who do not wish to have their name linked to their HIV diagnosis. The original slip containing the result will need to be presented. If individuals request that their test results remain anonymous, AMTUs are encouraged to retest using an anonymous method. Documented or selfreported receipt of HIV positive diagnosis between 6 18 months, inclusive, prior to the protocol screening date; NOTE: The protocol team will monitor enrollment during the first 3 months of study implementation and may expand this window to 24 months, if necessary. Ages 14 24 years, inclusive at the time of protocol screening; Ability to understand and willingness to provide written informed consent/assent in English or Spanish; Group 1: Never initiated HIVrelated medical care and 6 or more months have elapsed since receipt of an HIV diagnosis. This cohort is not currently considered in care; Group 2: Initiated HIVrelated medical care, but 12 or more months have elapsed since care was initiated, and has not had additional HIVrelated medical care since the initial visit; or Group 2: Initiated and had follow up HIVrelated medical care, but is no longer in care for 12 or more months since the last visit. This cohort is not currently considered in care; and Group 3: Initiated and maintained HIVrelated medical care with at least one maintenance visit within the 12 months prior to the protocol screening date. This cohort is currently considered in care. Psychiatric disorder (untreated) associated with thought disorder, hallucinations, acute substance use withdrawal. Stabilized patients receiving appropriate psychiatric care will not be excluded if informed consent can be reasonably assumed; Visibly distraught and/or visibly emotionally unstable (e.g., depressive mood; exhibiting manic, suicidal, or violent behavior); Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site personnel, would interfere with ability to give true informed consent and to adhere to the study requirements; Known pregnancy; Acute illness that, in the opinion of the treating clinician, would endanger the wellbeing of the individual if treatment was delayed due to study participation; HIV positive adolescents infected through either perinatal transmission or blood products, including those who became aware of their HIV diagnosis within the prior 6 18 months; and Explicit prior refusal of permission by the adolescent for any subsequent contact by site personnel. (Adolescents who wish to participate and provide signed informed consent, but who cannot or will not provide contact information, do not meet this exclusion criterion.)</criteria>
