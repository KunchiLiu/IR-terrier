	<brief_summary>This is a phase III study designed to demonstrate the superiority of single-dose 90 mg intravenous (IV) casopitant over placebo, each in combination with ondansetron and dexamethasone, for the prevention of emesis over the first 0-120 hours (overall phase) following initiation of the cisplatin infusion in the first cycle of highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC). Eligibility is limited to subjects who are scheduled to receive their first cycle of chemotherapy which includes at least 60 mg/m2 of cisplatin administered on Day 1 only of a 21 day or 28 day cycle. All subjects will receive IV ondansetron and oral dexamethasone on Day 1 prior to initiation of the cisplatin infusion, followed by oral dexamethasone on Days 2-4. Additionally, subjects will be randomized to receive single-dose 90 mg IV casopitant or matching placebo prior to initiation of a cisplatin-based HEC regimen.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>A subject will be considered eligible for initial inclusion in this study, and progression into subsequent cycles of therapy within the study, only if all of the following criteria apply: Subject understands the nature and purpose of this study and the study procedures and has signed an informed consent form for this study to indicate this understanding. At least 18 years of age. Is scheduled to receive oxaliplatin at a dose between 85 mg/m2 and 130 mg/m2 in their first cycle of therapy for the treatment of colorectal cancer, administered as a single IV dose over 26 hours on Day 1 only, in combination with 5FU/LV, or in combination with capecitabine. Refer to Section 4.1 for the list of chemotherapy agents that may be added to oxaliplatin. An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2. Hematologic and metabolic status adequate for receiving an oxaliplatinbased moderately emetogenic regimen and meeting the following criteria: Total Neutrophils ≥1500/mm3 (Standard units : ≥1.5 x 109/L) Platelets ≥100,000/mm3 (Standard units: ≥100.0 x 109/L) Bilirubin ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) Serum Creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL (Standard units : ≤132.6 µmol/L) OR Creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min Creatinine clearance must be calculated using the CockcroftGault formula: Clcreat (ml/min) = (140age [yr]) x body wt [kg] / 72 x serum creatinine [mg/dl] For females: multiply creatinine clearance by a factor of 0.85. OR Clcreat (ml/min) = K x (140age [yr]) x body wt [kg] / serum creatinine [µmol/L] K=1.05 for females K=1.23 for males Liver enzymes must be below the following limits: Without known liver metastases: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤2.5 x ULN. With known liver metastases: AST and/or ALT ≤5.0 x ULN. Is willing and able to complete daily components of the Subject Diary for Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 without assistance from others. A female subject is eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is of: nonchildbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant, including any female who is postmenopausal. For purposes of this study, postmenopausal is defined as one year without menses) childbearing potential: must have a negative serum pregnancy test result or negative urine dipstick pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to the first dose of investigational product on Cycle 1 Day 1. Women of childbearing potential must also commit to consistent and correct use of an acceptable method of birth control. GSK acceptable contraceptive methods, when used consistently and in accordance with both the product label and the instructions of the physician, are as follows: male partner who is sterile prior to the female subject's entry into the study and is the sole sexual partner for that female subject; oral contraceptives (e.g., oral, injectable, or implantable) with doublebarrier method of contraception consisting of spermicide with either condom or diaphragm for a period after the trial to account for a potential drug interaction (minimum of six weeks); doublebarrier method of contraception consisting of spermicide with either condom or diaphragm; intrauterine device with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per year; complete abstinence from intercourse for two weeks before exposure to the investigational product throughout the clinical trial, and for a period after the trial to account for elimination of the drug (minimum of 3 days); if subject indicates they will remain abstinent during the period described above, they must agree to follow GSK guidelines for the consistent and correct use of an acceptable method of birth control should they become sexually active. A subject will not be eligible for initial inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria apply, or will not be eligible for subsequent cycles of therapy if any of the following criteria become applicable: Has received cytotoxic chemotherapy prior to the first study cycle of chemotherapy, with the exception that previous adjuvant therapy with 5FU/LV or capecitabine is permitted, provided that the last dose of adjuvant therapy was completed at least 6 months prior to receiving the first dose of study medication or investigational product. Previous biological or hormonal therapy completed at any time is permitted. Scheduled to receive chemotherapy with any cytotoxic agents (e.g., irinotecan, gemcitabine) or biological agents (e.g., cetuximab, panitumimab) other than the protocol allowed chemotherapy described in Inclusion Criterion 3. Is a female subject who is pregnant or lactating. Has received radiation therapy in the 10 days prior to the first dose of study medication or investigational product and/or is scheduled to receive such radiation therapy in the 6 days following the first dose of study medication or investigational product in the first cycle of chemotherapy. Radiation therapy may be added in subsequent cycles of chemotherapy. Has experienced emesis (i.e., vomiting and/or retching) or clinically significant nausea in the 24 hours preceding the first dose of study medication or investigational product for each cycle of chemotherapy.

However, opioid narcotics will be permitted if the subject has been on such medication for at least 7 days at a stable dose prior to the start of each cycle, and has not experienced emesis or nausea from the narcotics. Has taken/received any medication with known or potential antiemetic activity within the 24hour period (unless otherwise stated) prior to receiving the first dose of study medication or investigational product or is expected to require use of such medication during the 120 hour assessment period for Cycle 1 of therapy only.
