	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of Radiofrequency ablation in metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients with primary tumor less than 5 cm before medical treatment. Ablation may allow for reduced morbidity and may increase the likelihood of patients receiving systemic therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Palliative Radiofrequency Ablation in Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nephrectomy has become an integral part of the management of patients with metastatic kidney cancer. Performing nephrectomy in these patients is not without risk, however. The very real chance of significant metastatic disease progression during the postoperative period or complication before or during surgery that may prolong postoperative recovery could potentially delay or prevent the administration of systemic therapy in the postoperative period. Patient selection for surgery remains critical for success. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a medical procedure where tumor is ablated using microwave energy to treat a medical disorder. The benefits of RFA in selected metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients with small primary tumor (&lt;5 cm) will be evaluated in this Phase I/II study.</detailed_description>
