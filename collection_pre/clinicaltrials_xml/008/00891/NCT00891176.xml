	<brief_summary>This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of an extension phase when subjects are aged 3, 4 and 6 years of age. The objectives &amp; outcome measures of the primary phase are presented in a separate protocol posting (NCT number = NCT00334334). The objectives &amp; outcome measures of the booster phase are presented in a separate protocol posting (NCT number = NCT00463437). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the persistence of pneumococcal, meningococcal serogroup C, Hib and Hepatits B antibodies after booster vaccination, when the subjects are aged 3, 4 and 6 years. No vaccine will be administered during this persistence phase of the study.</brief_summary>

Written informed consent obtained from the parent or guardian of the subject. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Subjects who previously participated in the primary and booster studies, who received a full vaccination course with the vaccines corresponding to their group during the primary and booster studies and who were part, in the booster study, of the blood sampling subset. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) within 30 days preceding the first blood sampling. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose. Administration of any additional meningococcal serogroup C, Hib, hepatitis B and pneumococcal vaccine since the end of the booster study History of meningococcal serogroup C, Haemophilus influenzae type b, hepatitis B and invasive pneumococcal diseases since the end of booster study. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition since the end of booster study, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required). Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the first blood sampling.</criteria>
