	<brief_summary>It is a phase 4 study, not randomised and multicentric. Within 2 months after the diagnosis, the patients daily receive imatinib by oral way during at least 1 year (260mg/m² once a day), i.e. until the cytogenetic analysis. Beyond 1 year of treatment, if a haematological relapse or a loss of the cytogenetic response is observed, the nature of the treatment suggested to the patient is left with the appreciation of the investigator. Later on, discontinuation of imatinib is discussed if a molecular remission (negative RT-PCR) is obtained and maintained for at least 2 years.</brief_summary>
