	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to: - evaluate the safety profile of a single intravenous administration of AIGIV (containing either 3.5 mg/kg, 7.0 mg/kg or 14.0 mg/kg anti-PA IgG) as compared with either 90 mg/kg, 180 mg/kg or 360 mg/kg total IgG, GAMUNEX(R)(immune globulin intravenous (human) 10% caprylate/chromatography purified). GAMUNEX is a trademark of Talecris Biotherapeutics. - evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of a single intravenous administration of AIGIV (containing either 3.5 mg/kg, 7.0 mg/kg or 14.0 mg/kg anti-PA IgG) as measured by lethal toxin neutralizing antibody (TNA).</brief_summary>
