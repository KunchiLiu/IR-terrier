	<brief_summary>Depression is one of the leading causes of emotional suffering in later life. It has been estimated that 2-5% of community-dwelling elderly people suffer from major depression, but according to recent studies, as much as 25 % have clinically significant depressive symptoms.Typically, depressive symptoms in the elderly are treated solely with antidepressants. The aim of this project is to study the effects of a comprehensive psychosocial intervention on the psychological well-being, quality of life and use of services in depressed elderly people. In addition, the processes of intervention are studied from the perspective of the participants as well as the service system. The research is conducted in collaboration with the city of Espoo. The design of the study combines clinical trial with qualitative process analysis.</brief_summary>
