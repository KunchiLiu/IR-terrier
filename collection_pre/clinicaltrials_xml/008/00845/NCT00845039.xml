	<brief_title>A Study of Irinotecan and Cetuximab With or Without IMC-A12 for Treatment of People With Colon or Rectum Cancer Who Got Worse After Their First Treatment With Oxaliplatin and Bevacizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to determine the value of adding IMC-A12 to irinotecan + cetuximab in improving PFS at 18 weeks from the date of randomization for patients with metastatic K-RAS wild-type CRC that has progressed on an oxaliplatin/bevacizumab-containing regimen.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must consent to be in the study and must have signed and dated IRBapproved consent forms conforming to federal and institutional guidelines for the preentry tumor sample submission for central KRAS testing and for the study treatment Must have an ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2 Must have metastatic CRC The CRC tumor or metastatic tumor must be KRAS wildtype as determined by central testing Must be documented disease progression during firstline therapy containing both oxaliplatin and bevacizumab Most recent treatment regimen must have ended ≥ 21 days prior to randomization, and clinically significant side effects associated with previous therapy must have resolved to ≤ grade 1 with the exception of neuropathy which must have resolved to ≤ grade 2 Imaging of the chest, abdomen and pelvis with CT scan or MRI must be performed within 3 weeks prior to randomization Must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion outside a previous RT field that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension as ≥ 20mm with conventional techniques or as ≥ 10mm with 5mm cuts using a spiral CT scan Evidence of adequate bone marrow function: ANC ≥ 1200/mm3, hemoglobin ≥ 9g/dL, platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 Evidence of adequate hepatic function. If no liver metastases: AST ≤ 2.5 x ULN, total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN for the lab. In the presence of liver metastases: AST ≤ 5.0 x ULN, total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN for the lab Serum creatinine must be ≤ 1.5 x ULN for the lab Must have a fasting blood glucose &lt; 126mg/dL. Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 hours Life expectancy less than 12 weeks Diagnosis of anal or small bowel carcinoma Tumor that is considered by the surgeon to be amenable to complete resection Previous radiation therapy to &gt; 25% of bone marrow Radiation therapy to sites of measurable disease chosen as target lesions Radiological evidence and/or clinical signs or symptoms of CNS metastases Any of the following conditions and events: uncontrolled hypertension, defined as systolic BP &gt; 150mmHg or diastolic BP &gt; 100 with or without antihypertensive medication (patients with hypertension that is wellcontrolled on medication are eligible); unstable angina within 6 months before randomization; NYHA Class III or IV cardiac disease; myocardial infarction within 6 months before randomization; symptomatic arrhythmia; CNS cerebrovascular ischemia (TIA or stroke) within 6 months before randomization Other malignancies unless the patient is considered to be diseasefree and has completed therapy for the malignancy ≥ 12 months prior to randomization. Patients with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 12 months: carcinoma in situ of the cervix, colon carcinoma in situ, melanoma in situ, and basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin Serious or nonhealing wound, skin ulcers, or bone fracture Any significant bleeding unless the source of bleeding has been resected History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy (patients on stable anticoagulant therapy are eligible) Any evidence of active infection Active inflammatory bowel disease Grade 3 or 4 diabetes mellitus as defined by NCI's CTCAE v 3.0 pancreatic endocrine: glucose intolerance (patients with diabetes controlled with diet and/or oral medications are eligible) Symptomatic interstitial pneumonitis or definitive evidence of interstitial pneumonitis described on CT scan or chest xray in asymptomatic patients Any other serious concomitant medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the safety of the patient or compromise the patient's ability to participate in the study Previous hypersensitivity reaction to monoclonal antibodies Previous treatment with irinotecan, cetuximab, or any agent specifically targeting IGF receptors Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days prior to randomization Pregnancy or lactation at the time of patient entry Psychiatric or addictive disorders or other conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude the patient from meeting the study requirements</criteria>
