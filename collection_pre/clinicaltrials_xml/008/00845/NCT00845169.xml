	<brief_summary>Exposure to air pollution has been linked to increased cardiorespiratory morbidity and mortality. The exact component of air pollution that mediates this effect is unknown, but the link is strongest for fine combustion derived particulate matter derived from traffic sources. Recently, it has been demonstrated that inhalation of diesel exhaust impairs vascular vasomotor tone and endogenous fibrinolysis. The mechanism underlying these detrimental vascular is unclear, but is thought to be via oxidative stress and altered bioavailability of endogenous nitric oxide. In these studies we plan to elucidate the role of endogenous nitric oxide synthase isoforms (NO) in the adverse vascular responses observed following exposure to diesel exhaust.</brief_summary>
