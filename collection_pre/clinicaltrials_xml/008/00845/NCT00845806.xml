	<brief_title>Neuronal Processing of Diacritics: An fMRI Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>fMRI is a well established imaging technique that allows investigators to see regional brain function based off of actions like reading, speaking, playing music, etc. Even the type of language and format of that language can change the area of the brain that is active while performing that action. This study is meant to see the areas of the brain that become active both prior to and during the process of reading diacritic markings in arabic.</detailed_description>
