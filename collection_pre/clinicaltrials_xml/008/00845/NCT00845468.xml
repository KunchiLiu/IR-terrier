	<brief_summary>Diabetes mellitus is a major risk factor for the development of ischemic heart disease, and patients with diabetes mellitus have a worse outcome following an acute myocardial infarction than non-diabetic patients. Furthermore, abnormal glucose metabolism below the diagnostic threshold of diabetes mellitus is also associated with increased risk of death compared to patients with a normal glucose metabolism. The frequency of abnormal glucose metabolism in acute myocardial infarction is high, and approximately 70% of myocardial infarction patients have diabetes mellitus, newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance, leaving only 30% with normal glucose metabolism. The increased mortality among patients with acute myocardial infarction and abnormal glucose metabolism seems mainly related to a higher occurrence of congestive heart failure, suggesting that an abnormal glucose metabolism may play an important role among others in endothelial dysfunction, infarct healing and overall left ventricle function. This raises the question, whether patients with acute myocardial infarction and abnormal glucose metabolism have increased frequency of micro- or macrovascular disease or both. Coronary flow velocity reserve reflects the patency of the epicardial coronary artery in combination with vasodilator capacity of the microcirculation and may therefore offer a tool for assessment of macro- and microcirculation. This study will focus on the relation between coronary flow velocity reserve estimated by transthoracal Doppler echocardiography and mortality, risk for heart failure and left ventricle function after acute myocardial infarction stratified according to glycometabolic state</brief_summary>
