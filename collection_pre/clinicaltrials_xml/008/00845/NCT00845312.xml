	<brief_summary>Pneumonia is a major cause of mortality and morbidity. A large body of evidence concerning the mortality risk factors in elderly patients with pneumonia has been reported; however, less is known about causes of mortality in patients of sixty and less. We noted a relatively substantial rate of short term mortality in this group of patients that were admitted to our institution. Therefore, we aimed to estimate the mortality rate and to identify risk factors for mortality among patients of sixty years old and less that were admitted with community acquired pneumonia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. While there is much data about risk factors for severe outcome in the general population, there is less focus on younger group of patients. Therefore, we aimed to detect simple prognostic factors for severe morbidity and mortality in young patients with CAP. Patients 60 years old or younger, who were diagnosed with CAP (defined as Pneumonia identified 48 hours or less from hospitalization) between March 1, 2005 and December 31, 2008 were retrospectively analyzed for risk factors for severe morbidity or mortality. Complicated hospitalization was defined as at least one of the following parameters: hospitalization longer than ten days, admission to intensive care unit and in- hospital mortality. Otherwise, the hospitalization was defined uncomplicated</detailed_description>
