	<brief_summary>Introduction: Case management (CM) has been proposed as a method for optimizing the course of treatment for complicated cancer patients. However evidence of the effect of CM is limited and methodologically rigorous research is needed. Aim: To analyze effects of Nurse CM in complicated cancer care. Methods: The study is designed as a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) including approximately 280 colorectal cancer patients. Intervention group patients will be offered usual medical treatment plus supportive intervention from a case manager. Control group patients will receive usual medical and supportive treatment. The intervention: Case managers are registered nurses and possess thorough knowledge of cancer treatment and pathways. Core intervention elements: Planned and ad hoc personal and telephone contacts, surveillance of care pathways, coordination and dissemination of care plan (including transfer of patient-specific information to other departments and general practice). Primary outcomes: Patient evaluations of care pathways and "Quality of Life" (questionnaires). Secondary outcomes: Use of health care services and care process measures (The National Health Insurance Service Registry and The National Patient Registry; and GPs' evaluations of continuity of care (questionnaire). Schedule: - "Case management used to optimize cancer care pathways: A systematic Review" has been published in BMC Health Services Research. - The CM manual has been written. Questionnaires are under development and pilot testing. - Two case managers have been appointed 1. January 2009. - After training and pilot testing of the intervention the RCT will begin in March 2009. Inclusion period is 12 months.</brief_summary>
