	<brief_title>The Meal Tray as a Tool and Platform to Change Eating Habits Among Hospitalized Diabetic Patients - An Intervention Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients hospitalized at Hadassah Medical Center who have type 2 diabetes will relieve a focused nutritional intervention using mainly the food tray during the hospitalization. The intervention will be administered by the hospital nutrition team. At baseline (upon admission) - medical data will be collected as well as nutritional and behavioral questionnaires will be administered. The intervention will take place during the hospitalization period. Follow up using the same tools will be performed at 3 and 12 month. We believe that the hospitalization period, even for reasons non related to diabetes, is a window of opportunity to implement lifestyle changes.</detailed_description>
