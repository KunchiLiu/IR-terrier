	<brief_summary>This study will be a qualitative survey to understand the expectations of defibrillator patients with regards to their device. It is unknown what ICD (implantable-cardioverter defibrillator) patients understand about their device and its purpose, thus we will be talking to them about their device. Also, we will be interested in studying their beliefs on how the ICD impacts their life expectancy and quality of life.</brief_summary>
