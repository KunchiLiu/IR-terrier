	<brief_summary>Pioglitazone, a drug used in treatment of type 2 diabetes has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle, liver, and fat cells. Despite the beneficial effects of pioglitazone to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce cardiovascular disease in high risk type 2 diabetic patients, weight gain has been a limiting factor. Exenatide, another agent used for treatment of T2DM, improves glycemic control and promotes moderate weight loss. In this proposal we will examine the effect of combination therapy with pioglitazone plus exenatide on body weight, fat topography, beta cell function, glycemic control, and plasma lipid levels in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared to treatment with each drug separately. Assessment of beta cell function will be performed by measuring the maximal insulin secretory capacity using a maximal hyperglycemic stimulus combined with an intravenous arginine stimulus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Pioglitazone and Exenatide on Body Weight and Beta Cell Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of drugs has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle, liver, and adipocytes and to have anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective effects. The beta cell function, measured by the insulin secretion/insulin resistance index during the OGTT, improves significantly. In the present study, we will perform a more definitive assessment of beta cell function in TZD-treated diabetic patients by measuring the maximal insulin secretory capacity using a maximal hyperglycemic stimulus combined with an intravenous arginine stimulus. Despite the beneficial effects of pioglitazone to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce cardiovascular events in high risk type 2 diabetic patients, weight gain has been a limiting factor for primary care physicians even though pioglitazone treatment leads to a redistribution of fat out of muscle/liver/visceral area to subcutaneous fat. Exenatide (Byetta) is 39 amino acid peptide which exhibits biological actions similar to GLP-1. In clinical trials exenatide reduces HbA1c by 1-1.2% in subjects with type 2 diabetes and promotes moderate weight loss which is sustained for up to 2 years. In this proposal we will examine the effect of combination therapy with pioglitazone plus exenatide on body weight, fat topography, beta cell function, glycemic control, and plasma lipid levels in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared to monotherapy with each agent separately. We postulate that combination therapy will result in significant weight loss (in contrast to the weight gain which accompanies pioglitazone treatment) and have an additive, or even synergistic, effect to improve beta cell function and glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients who are inadequately controlled on oral agent therapy with metformin alone, a sulfonylurea alone, or combination of metformin plus a sulfonylurea. We will also compare the insulin secretion in healthy control subjects (NGT, n=15) and subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT, n=15) to evaluate the relative decline in beta cell function in T2DM compared to NGT and IGT subjects. NGT and IGT subjects will participate only in a OGTT and a Hyperglycemic clamp- they will not receive any medication.</detailed_description>
