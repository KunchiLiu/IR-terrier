	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to explore the effects of darifenacin in patients with multiple sclerosis and neurogenic detrusor overactivity. The efficacy, safety and tolerability of darifenacin are already well established in idiopathic detrusor overactivity. Patients with multiple sclerosis and neurogenic detrusor overactivity without detrusor-sphincter-dyssynergia (DSD) will be allocated to darifenacin therapy.</brief_summary>
