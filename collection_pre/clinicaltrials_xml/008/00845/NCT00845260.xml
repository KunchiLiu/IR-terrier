	<brief_summary>Panic Disorder with or without agoraphobia (PD/A) is a common, and unless it is treated, often chronic psychiatric disorder. The are effective pharmacological as well as psychological treatments for PD/A. Because of the lack of availability of the most effective psychological treatment, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), self-help based CBT treatments have been developed. One of those are Internet-based CBT. The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of Internet and group CBT for PD/A in a regular psychiatric setting. 113 patients are consecutively and randomly assigned to either treatment (both lasting 10 weeks). The main outcome measure is the Panic Disorder Severity Scale(PDSS). The study hypothesis is that treatments will show equal effectiveness.</brief_summary>
