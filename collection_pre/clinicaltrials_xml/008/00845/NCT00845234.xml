	<brief_summary>An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) administers a shock to terminate potentially life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. The device saves lives, but presents psychological challenges for patients. At present, there is a paucity of brief interventions for ICD patients designed for administration in a clinic setting that considers issues of cost, time, and available resources. The present study examined the impact of a brief cognitive behavioral (CBT) educational intervention on primary endpoints of patient acceptance and quality of life and secondary endpoints of depression and anxiety. It was hypothesized that the intervention would result in significant improvements primary and secondary endpoints for participants in the intervention group.</brief_summary>
