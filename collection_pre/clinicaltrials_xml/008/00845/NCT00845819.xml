	<brief_title>Study of Epidermal Growth Factor on Oral Mucositis Induced by Intensive Chemotherapy for Hematologic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oral mucositis is one of the most common adverse events during chemotherapy and affects quality of life of patients receiving chemotherapy in relation to the dose of drugs. However, there is only one drug (palifermin) approved by the US FDA for the prevention of oral mucositis and the other methods to prevent or treat oral mucositis are just empirical and lack evidences. The results of recent study demonstrated promising efficacy and minimal toxicity of recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF) as a preventive drug of oral mucositis in head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy (Wu HG, et al. Cancer 2009;115(16):3699-3708). This clinical trial is a double-blind randomized prospective single-institutional phase II study to evaluate efficacy and toxicity of recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF) as a preventive drug of oral mucositis during intensive chemotherapy with stem cell transplantation in patients with hematologic malignancies.</detailed_description>
