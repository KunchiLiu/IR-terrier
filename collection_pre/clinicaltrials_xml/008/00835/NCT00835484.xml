	<criteria>Screening Demographics: All subjects selected for this study will be healthy men and women 18 years of age or older at the time of dosing. the subject's body mass index (BMI) should be 19 kg/m² 30 kg/m², inclusive. Screening procedures: Each subject will complete the screening process within 28 days prior to Period I dosing. Consent documents for both the screening evaluation and HIV antibody determination will be reviewed, discussed, and signed by each potential participant before full implementation of screening procedures. Screening will include general observations, physical examination, demographics, medical and medication history, an electrocardiogram, sitting blood pressure and heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature. The physical examination will include, but may not be limited to, an evaluation of the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and central nervous systems. The screening clinical laboratory procedures will include: Hematology: hematocrit, hemoglobin, WBC count with differential, RBC count, platelet count; Clinical Chemistry: serum creatinine, BUN, glucose, AST(GOT), ALT(GPT), albumin, total bilirubin, total protein, and alkaline phosphatase; HIV antibody and hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C antibody screens; Urinalysis: by dipstick; full microscopic examination if dipstick positive; and Urine Drug Screen: ethyl alcohol, amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine metabolites, opiates and phencyclidine. Serum Pregnancy Screen (female subjects only) If female and: of childbearing potential, is practicing an acceptable method of birth control for the duration of the study as judged by the investigator(s), such as condom with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, intrauterine device (IUD) or abstinence; or is postmenopausal for at least 1 year; or is surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy). Subjects with a recent history of drug or alcohol addiction or abuse. Subjects with the presence of a clinically significant disorder involving the cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, gastrointestinal, immunologic, hematologic, endocrine, or neurologic system(s) or psychiatric disease (as determined by the clinical investigators). Subjects whose clinical laboratory test values are outside the accepted reference range and when confirmed on reexamination are deemed to be clinically significant. Subjects demonstrating a reactive screen for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody or HIV antibody. Subjects demonstrating a positive drug abuse screen when screened for this study. Female subjects demonstrating a positive pregnancy screening. Female subjects who are currently breastfeeding. Subjects with a history of allergic response(s) to cefdinir or related drugs. Subjects with a history of clinically significant allergies including drug allergies. Subjects with a clinically significant illness during the 4 weeks prior to Period I dosing (as determined by the clinical investigators). Subjects who currently use or report using tobacco products within 3 months of Period I dose administration. Subjects who have taken any drug known to induce or inhibit hepatic drug metabolism in the 28 days prior to Period I dosing. Subjects who report donating greater than 150 mL of blood within 28 days prior to Period I dosing. All subjects will be advised not to donate blood for four weeks after completing the study. Subjects who have donated serum (e.g. serumpheresis) within 14 days prior to Period I dosing. All subjects will be advised not to donate serum for four weeks after completing the study. Subjects who report receiving any investigational drug within 28 days prior to Period I dosing. Subjects who report taking any systemic prescription medication in the 14 days prior to Period I dosing. Subjects who report an intolerance of direct venipuncture. Subjects who report consuming an abnormal diet during the 28 days prior to Period I dosing. Subjects who report having difficulty fasting or consuming standardized meals. Female subjects who report using implanted or injected hormonal contraceptives (birth control) during the 6 months prior to Period I dosing. Female subjects who report using oral hormonal contraceptives (birth control) during the 14 days prior to Period I dosing.</criteria>
