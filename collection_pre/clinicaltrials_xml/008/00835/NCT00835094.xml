	<criteria>Subjects (and their parent/guardian if the subject is &lt;18) must demonstrate their willingness to participate in the study and comply with its procedures by signing a written informed consent. Subjects must be &gt;=12 years of age (unless restricted to an older age by local ethical committees or national health authorities), of either gender and any race. Subjects must have had a history of asthma for &gt;=6 months. If the subject is taking inhaled corticosteroids, the daily dose must be &lt;= the upper limit defined below: budesonide &lt;=800 mcg/day triamcinolone acetonide &lt;=800 mcg/day beclomethasone dipropionate &lt;=1000 mcg/day fluticasone propionate &lt;=500 mcg/day flunisolide &lt;=1000 mcg/day Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine (hCG) pregnancy test on the day of randomization (Baseline visit). Women of childbearing potential (includes women who are &lt;1 year postmenopausal) must be using an acceptable method of birth control (eg, hormonal contraceptive, medically prescribed IUD, condom in combination with spermicide) or be surgically sterilized (eg, hysterectomy or tubal ligation). Subjects must agree to inform their usual treating physician (if other than the study investigator) of their participation in this study. Female subjects who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or are premenarcheal. Subjects who have required daily or alternate day oral corticosteroid treatment for more than a total of 14 days during the 6 months immediately prior to Visit 1, and/or subjects who have required a course of systemic corticosteroids within the previous month. Subjects who have had either an asthma exacerbation or a clinically relevant change in asthma medication within the last 4 weeks. Subjects who have been admitted to the hospital for asthma control within the previous 3 months or more than once within the previous 6 months. Subjects who have required ventilator support for respiratory failure secondary to their asthma within the last 5 years. Subjects who have used any investigational drug in the 30 days prior to Baseline, or subjects who have been treated with any investigational antibody for asthma in the 90 days prior to Baseline. Subjects who are allergic or have had an idiosyncratic reaction to corticosteroids. Subjects with any clinically significant disorder of the cardiovascular, neurologic, hematologic, gastrointestinal, cerebrovascular, or immunologic system, or respiratory disease other than asthma (eg, COPD), or any other disorder which may interfere with the study evaluations or affect subject safety. Subjects with a history of drug abuse, poor motivation, hypochondriasis, or any other emotional or intellectual problems that are likely to limit the validity of consent to participate in the study.</criteria>
