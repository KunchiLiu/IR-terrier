	<brief_summary>Many women come into pregnancy with diabetes that is controlled with either Metformin or diet control; however, the current standard of care for the treatment of preexisting diabetes in pregnancy is insulin. Metformin is widely used in the non-pregnant population for glycemic control, and has been used in pregnancy for other indications without adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. What remains unproven is the ability of Metformin to adequately control glucose in women during pregnancy. Our goal is to randomize 100 women who enter pregnancy with diabetes that is controlled by either diet or an oral agent and women who are found to have an abnormal glucose challenge test at less than 20 weeks to either standard treatment with weight based Regular and neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin or Metformin. Our hypothesis is that Metformin will provide glycemic control that is equivalent to insulin in these women.</brief_summary>
