	<brief_summary>Biomarkers have an interest in clinic diagnostic ,therapeutic and prognosis in pathophysiologic situation including cardiovascular.But interest of biomarkers in diagnostic care of severe acute respiratory insufficiency remains to clear. We propose to determine the more relevant marker combination in this case.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi Marker Approach Interest in Emergency in Acute Respiratory Insufficiency Diagnostic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In urgence of a severe acute respiratory insufficiency,for thanks to an approach diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic we propose to determine the more relevant biomarker combination. An expert committee will compare the biomarker diagnostic and prognostic relevance thanks to all elements clinico-biological and patient monitoring.</detailed_description>
