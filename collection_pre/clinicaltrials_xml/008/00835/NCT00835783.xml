	<brief_summary>The overall aim is to validate the current use of FDG PET/CT for the diagnosis of infection and inflammation and examine the usefulness of PET/CT applying also other tracers. The results should allow us to confirm our primary hypothesis: "FDG-PET/CT is better than established methods to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of infection/inflammation".</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation Study of Combined Positron Emission Tomography/Computer Tomography to Diagnose Infection and Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study include several part projects, each contributing to the evaluation of the value of FDG-PET/CT in the diagnosis of infection and inflammation. The aims are to establish the diagnostic value in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, interobserver and intraobserver variation. Part project A FDG-PET/CT in patients with blood culture positive for staphylococcus aureus and unresolved origin of infection. Part project B FDG-PET/CT in patients with fever of unknown origin. Part project C FDG-PET/CT in patients suspected of vascular graft infection. Additionally, we wish to establish an optimal imaging protocol (necessity of fasting, consequences of antibiotic therapy prior to imaging, and the need of contrast), interpretation criteria, and the value of standard uptake values (SUV).</detailed_description>
