	<detailed_description>This is an open label sudy to examine the effect of exendin-(9-39)on glucose requirements to maintain euglycemia in infants with congenital hyperinsulinism unresponsive to medical therapy and to determine therapeutic plasma levels,plasma half life and pharmacokinetics of exendin-(9-39)</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Confirmed diagnosis of congenital hyperinsulinism (based on clinical criteria: insulin, beta hydroxybutyrate, and/or free fatty acid plasma levels at the time of hypoglycemia, and/or glycemic response to glucagon at the time of hypoglycemia) Age: from birth to 12 months Failure to respond to diazoxide (defined as the failure to maintain blood glucose and octreotide (defined as the failure to maintain blood glucose ≥ 70 mg/dL without supraphysiologic rates of glucose infusion&gt; 45 mg/Kg/min) Evidence of a medical condition that might alter results, including active infection, kidney failure, severe liver dysfunction, severe respiratory or cardiac failure Current therapy at the time of initiation of study procedures with medications that affect glucose metabolism, such as high dose glucocorticoids, ßagonists, glucagon, diazoxide and octreotide. Subjects will be eligible to participate 4 hours after glucagon is discontinued, 24 hours after the last dose of octreotide and 72 hours after last dose of diazoxide, Subjects with suspected BeckwithWiedemann syndrome or other syndromic forms of congenital hyperinsulinism.</criteria>
