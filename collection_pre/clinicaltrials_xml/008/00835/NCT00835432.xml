	<brief_summary>Prospective randomized assessment of alveolar ridge alterations after augmenting dehisced areas by applying principles of guided bone regeneration (GBR) subsequently to implant installation. Ossix as cross-linked and BioGide as non cross-linked degradable collagen membranes, both used in combination with biphasic Calcium-Phosphate (BoneCeramic) as bone substitute. Clinical measurements and impressions from the sites of interest are to be taken at the stage of augmentation and 6 months after. At six months re-entry non-standardized biopsies from augmented sites will be taken to determine newly grown tissue in quality and quantity. Due to different degradation characteristics of the two collagen membranes used as barrier, amount of newly formed mineralized tissue is suspected to vary in tests and controls, respectively.</brief_summary>
