	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to explore the concept of GnRH-agonist triggering in combination with elective cryopreservation of all 2PN oocytes at larger scale in a pragmatic clinical setting. The question asked is: "Does GnRH-agonist triggering and cryopreservation work", in terms of efficacy and safety, when applied to a larger cohort of patients, and by a number of different centres with different clinical routines.</brief_summary>
