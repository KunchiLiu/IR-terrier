	<brief_title>Study of IMC-11F8 in Participants With Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the anti-tumor activity (best overall response) of the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody IMC-11F8 administered in combination with mFOLFOX-6 chemotherapy regimen in treatment-naive, locally-advanced or metastatic CRC participants.</detailed_description>

Participants must notify the principal investigator if they themselves or their partner becomes pregnant. Participant has provided signed Informed Consent Has received prior systemic chemotherapy for locallyadvanced unresectable or metastatic CRC. Has received prior radiotherapy to &gt;25% of bone marrow Has documented and/or symptomatic brain metastases Has participated in clinical studies of nonapproved experimental agents or procedures within 12 weeks of study entry Has received previous therapy with monoclonal antibodies Has received previous therapy with any agent that targets the EGFR Has serious concomitant medical conditions including active uncontrolled infection or cardiac disease, which in the opinion of the investigator, could compromise the participant or study. On chronic nontopical corticosteroid treatment for &gt;6 months at doses &gt;10 milligrams per day (mg/day) of prednisolone or equivalent before study entry, which in the opinion of the investigator could compromise the participant or the study Has a known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency Has a known allergy to any of the treatment components Has an acute or subacute intestinal occlusion Has peripheral neuropathy ≥Grade 2 Has a history of other malignancies, with the exception of curatively treated nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix If female, is pregnant (confirmed by urine or serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin test) or breastfeeding Has received a prior autologous or allogeneic organ or tissue transplantation Has interstitial pneumonia or interstitial fibrosis of the lung Has pleural effusion or ascites that causes ≥Grade 2 dyspnea Has psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions which do not permit adequate study followup, compliance with the protocol, or signature of Informed Consent</criteria>
