Drug at a dose of 8 mg/kg would be administered IV every 2 weeks, with close safety and monitoring studies. Treatment would be monitored every 2 weeks. Efficacy will be measured using the ACR Pedi 30, 50 and 90 definitions as previously published, based on: 1) physician global assessment of disease activity; 2) parent/patient assessment of overall well-being; 3) functional ability; 4) number of joints with active arthritis; 5) number of joints with limited range of motion; and 6) erythrocyte sedimentation rate.</detailed_description>
