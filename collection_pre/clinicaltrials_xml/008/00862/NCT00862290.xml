	<brief_summary>MicroRNA has been demonstrated to play a crucial role in regulating cell processes. Recently, microRNA was identified to exist in human serum or plasma, and it might be related to certain diseases. Several microRNAs are involved in sepsis, such as miR-146, miR-155, and so on. But whether serum miR-146 is present in serum of septic patients remains unknown. The present study was designed to identify the existence of specific microRNAs, which might be new markers for sepsis and its prognosis.</brief_summary>
