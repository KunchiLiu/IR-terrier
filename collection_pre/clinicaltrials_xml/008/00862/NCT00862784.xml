	<brief_title>A Study of IMC-1121B (Ramucirumab) in Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) in participants with metastatic colorectal cancer when treated with the monoclonal antibody IMC-1121B (ramucirumab) in combination with the modified FOLFOX-6 [folinic acid (FA) + fluorouracil (5-FU) + oxaliplatin, mFOLFOX-6] chemotherapy regimen as first-line therapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The participant must have histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum that is locallyadvanced or metastatic and unresectable The participant has at least one unidimensionallymeasurable target lesion [≥ 2 centimeters (cm) with conventional techniques or ≥ 1 cm with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)]; target lesion(s) must not lie within an irradiated area. Participants with locally advanced rectal carcinoma who have undergone previous radiation must have documented evidence of disease progression in the pelvis in order to participate The participant is age ≥ 18 years The participant has a life expectancy of ≥ 6 months The participant has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) 01 at study entry The participant has adequate hematologic function, as evidenced by an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500/microliter (μL), hemoglobin ≥ 10 grams/deciliter (g/dL), and platelets ≥ 100,000/μL The participant has adequate hepatic function as defined by: total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 3.0 x ULN (or 5.0 x ULN in the case of liver metastases), and serum albumin ≥ lower limit of normal (LLN) institutional range or (if &lt; LLN) within 10% of the LLN The participant has adequate renal function as defined by a serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN, or creatinine clearance (measured via 24hour urine collection) ≥ 60 milliliters/minute (mL/min) The participant's urinary protein ≤ 1+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis [(UA); if urine dipstick or routine analysis is ≥ 2+, a 24hour urine for protein must demonstrate &lt; 1000 milligrams (mg) of protein in 24 hours to allow participation in the study] The participant must have adequate coagulation function as defined by International Normalized Ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5 and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) ≤ 5 seconds above the ULN. Participants on fulldose anticoagulation must be on a stable dose of oral anticoagulant or low molecular weight (LMW) heparin and if on warfarin, must have an INR between 2 and 3 and no active bleeding or pathological condition present that carries a high risk of bleeding (for example, tumor involving major vessels or known varices) The participant has resolution to Grade ≤ 1 by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 3 (NCICTCAE v 3.0) of all clinically significant toxic effects of prior chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, or hormonal therapy with the exception of peripheral neuropathy which must have resolved to Grade 0 The participant agrees to use adequate contraception during the study period and for 8 weeks after the last dose of study treatment The participant has provided signed informed consent The participant has received prior systemic chemotherapy for locallyadvanced unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). Prior adjuvant chemotherapy is allowed if disease progression has been documented &gt; 6 months after the end of the last cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy or &gt; 12 months after the end of the last cycle of adjuvant oxaliplatincontaining regimens The participant has documented and/or symptomatic brain or leptomeningeal metastases The participant has participated in clinical studies of nonapproved experimental agents or procedures within 12 weeks of study entry The participant has received previous therapy with monoclonal antibodies The participant has received previous therapy with any agent that targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or VEGF receptor2 (VEGFR2) (including multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors) The participant has an ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, symptomatic or poorly controlled cardiac arrhythmia, psychiatric illness/social situations, or any other serious uncontrolled medical disorders in the opinion of the investigator The participant is on chronic nontopical corticosteroid treatment for &gt; 6 months at doses &gt; 10 mg/day of prednisolone or equivalent before study entry, which in the opinion of the investigator could compromise the participant or the study The participant has a known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency The participant has a known allergy to any of the treatment components The participant has an acute or subacute intestinal obstruction The participant has uncontrolled or poorly controlled hypertension on a standard regimen of antihypertensive therapy The participant has a concurrent active malignancy other than adequately treated nonmelanomatous skin cancer, other noninvasive carcinoma, or in situ neoplasm. A participant with previous history of malignancy is eligible, provided that he/she has been disease free for &gt; 3 years The participant, if female, is pregnant Has had prior autologous or allogeneic organ or tissue transplantation Has interstitial pneumonia or interstitial fibrosis of the lung, which in the opinion of the investigator could compromise the participant or the study Has pleural effusion or ascites that causes &gt; Grade 1 dyspnea Has psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions which do not permit adequate study followup, compliance with the protocol, or signature of Informed Consent Has undergone major surgery within 28 days prior to the first dose of study medication, or subcutaneous venous access device placement within 7 days prior to the first dose of study medication</criteria>
