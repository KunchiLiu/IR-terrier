	<brief_title>Efficacy and Tolerability of Beclomethasone Dipropionate/Formoterol Single Inhaler in Patients With Mild to Moderate Persistent Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of Beclomethasone Dipropionate/Formoterol single inhaler in a twice daily regimen in patients with mild to moderate persistent asthma. Patients are randomised to receive either Beclomethasone Dipropionate/ formoterol single inhaler (total daily dose : BDP/FF 400/24 µg) or Beclomethasone CFC (total daily dose : BDP 1000 µg) during 12 weeks of treatment.</detailed_description>
