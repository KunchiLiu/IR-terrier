	<brief_summary>Primary objective: - To evaluate whether 12 weeks of clopidogrel is superior to ticlopidine in terms of lower risk of the safety events of interests in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) Secondary objectives: - To compare the risk of bleeding adverse events, serious adverse events and overall safety of clopidogrel with ticlopidine - To compare the risk of vascular events of clopidogrel with ticlopidine - To document the long-term safety of clopidogrel for a total of 52 weeks - To document the vascular events of clopidogrel for a total of 52 weeks</brief_summary>
