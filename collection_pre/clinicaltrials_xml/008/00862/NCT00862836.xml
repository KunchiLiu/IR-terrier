	<criteria>Histopathologically documented invasive epithelial ovarian carcinoma, cancer of the fallopian tube or the peritoneum refractory to platinumbased chemotherapy or with partially platinum sensitive disease. Planned therapy with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin 50 mg/mÂ² for recurrent platinumrefractory ovarian cancer. Patients with a progressionfreeinterval of 6 to 12 months after platinumbased chemotherapy are only eligible if a further course of platinumbased combination chemotherapy is not possible as judged by the investigator(s). Patients must have received at least one previous platinum and taxanebased chemotherapy regimen. Brain metastases or spinal cord compression, unless treated at least 4 weeks before first dose and stable without steroid treatment for 10 days Any concomitant medications that may cause QTc prolongation or induce Torsades de Pointes or induce CYP3A4 function Treatment with mouseantibodies in patients with evaluable disease and CA125 progressive disease in the last 3 months. These patients are only eligible in case of measurable disease according to RECIST or cytological/histological proven relapse More than two prior lines of chemotherapy. Any chemotherapy or other systemic anticancer therapy within four weeks prior to randomization. Radiation therapy within the last 4 weeks prior to randomization (with the exception of palliative radiotherapy</criteria>
