	<brief_title>Oxford Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty With and Without Navigational Unit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ability to use a computerized navigational unit during knee arthroplasty can be a major benefit to surgeons that perform a small amount of knee arthroplasties. Navigational assistance can decrease surgery and anesthesia time as well as decreasing variation in posterior tibial slope and improved range of motion.</detailed_description>
