	<brief_summary>All metal implants release metal ions because of corrosion. Total knee arthroplasty implants have large metal surface areas and therefore substantial potential for corrosion. It is planned to compare changes in serum levels of metal ions in patients after implantation of cemented unconstrained total knee arthroplasty covered with or without a passivating surface. Serum concentrations of chromium, cobalt, molybdenum and nickel will be analyzed and compared between the two groups, as well as with those of 130 control patients without implants.</brief_summary>
