	<brief_title>Medical Therapies for Chronic Post-Traumatic Headaches</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 240 patients meeting International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) diagnostic criteria for chronic post-traumatic headaches will be enrolled. Subjects will be recruited from the Neurology Clinic at Madigan Army Medical Center. Study participants will be U.S. Army soldiers who sustained a mild traumatic head injury while deployed to a combat theater resulting in chronic post-traumatic headaches. Subjects will be randomized to placebo, propranolol (target dose 80 mg a day), amitriptyline (target dose 50 mg a day), or topiramate (target dose 100 mg a day) for 3 months. The primary outcome measure will be the mean number of headache days per month on the third month of treatment. Secondary outcome measures will include the proportion of subjects with at least a 25% reduction in headache frequency, headache severity (0-10 scale), headache duration (hours), headache-related disability (measured by the Headache Impact Test and Migraine Disability Assessment Scale), PTSD symptom checklist score, and medication side effects and tolerability.</detailed_description>
