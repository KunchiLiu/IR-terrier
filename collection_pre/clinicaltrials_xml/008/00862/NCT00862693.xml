	<brief_summary>Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy is the common primary glomerulonephritis in the world. Much literature suggests that vitamin D and its analogs have profound effects on immune system function and glomerular mesangial cell proliferation. Therefore, the investigators plan to conduct a randomized clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of Calcitriol in the treatment of IgA nephropathy. Forty patients with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy will be recruited. They will be randomized to Calcitriol for six months or no treatment. Proteinuria, renal function, serum and urinary inflammatory markers will be monitored. This study will explore the potential anti-proteinuric and anti-inflammatory effects of Calcitriol in the treatment of IgA nephropathy, which has no specific treatment at present.</brief_summary>
