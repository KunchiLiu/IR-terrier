	<brief_summary>Babies in the newborn intensive care unit who are dependent upon intravenous nutrition for a long period of time frequently develop liver damage. The fat used is called intralipid and is made from soybean oil. There is a suggestion in the literature that using fishoil based fats called omega-3 fat emulsions can decrease or even reverse this liver damage. We will offer babies with evidence of liver damage and no ability to eat,the Omegaven and see if the liver damage reverses.</brief_summary>
