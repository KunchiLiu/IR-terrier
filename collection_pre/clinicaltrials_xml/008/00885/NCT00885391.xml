	<brief_title>QT Variability Pre and Post Cardioversion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial Fibrillation variably activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, generates oxidant stress, produces natriuretic peptides, and increases ventricular rate. These are interrelated responses and the extent to which these or other pathophysiologic responses determine QT interval during and after Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is unknown. In this study, the QT variability is related to those potential markers in patients with AF undergoing elective DC-cardioversion.</detailed_description>
