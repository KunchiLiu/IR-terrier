	<brief_summary>This is a phase I, open-label, controlled drug interaction study to determine the effects of darunavir plus ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of the hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, rosuvastatin, in HIV-1-seronegative subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Darunavir/Ritonavir and Rosuvastatin Pharmacokinetic Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twelve HIV-negative healthy volunteers will be randomized to one of two groups. Group 1 would receive rosuvastatin 10mg daily (Treatment A) in interval 1 for 7 days, followed by a washout period of at least 7 days. In interval 2, darunavir/ritonavir 600/100mg bid (Treatment B) would be administered for 7 days, followed by another 7 day washout period. Lastly, in interval 3 subjects will administer darunavir/ritonavir and rosuvastatin (Treatment C) for total of 7 days. Group 2 will administer Treatment B in interval 1 for 7 days, followed by a washout period of 7 days, then treatment A in interval 2 for 7 days followed by another 7 day washout period. Group 2 would then co-administer rosuvastatin and darunavir/ritonavir for the last 7 days. Intensive PK sampling will be performed on day 7, 21 and 35 following a meal.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Absence of HIV1/HIV2 infection as documented by a licensed ELISA test kit within 21 days prior to study entry. 2. Male or female subjects, aged ≥ 18 and ≤ 60 years 3. Weight ≥50 kg and a Body Mass Index ([BMI], weight in kg divided by the square of height in meters) ≥18.0 and ≤ 35.0 kg/m2. Refer to Appendix I. 4. Informed Consent Form (ICF) signed voluntarily before the first trialrelated activity. 5. Able to comply with protocol requirements. 6. Healthy on the basis of a medical evaluation that reveals the absence of any clinically relevant abnormality and includes a physical examination, medical history, vital signs, and the results of blood tests and a urinalysis carried out at screening. 1. History or evidence of current use of alcohol, barbiturate, amphetamine, recreational or narcotic drug use, which in the investigator's opinion would compromise subject's safety and/or compliance with the trial procedures. 2. Currently active significant gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, neurologic, psychiatric, metabolic, renal, hepatic, respiratory, inflammatory, or infectious disease, that in the opinion of the investigator would represent a contraindication to study enrollment. 3. Creatinine clearance of ≤ 60mL/min. 4. Currently significant diarrhea, gastric stasis, or constipation that in the investigator's opinion could influence drug absorption or bioavailability. 5. eruptions, drug allergies, food allergy, dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, or urticaria, that in the opinion of the investigator would represent a contraindication to study enrollment. 6. Previously demonstrated clinically significant allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the excipients of the medications administered in the trial. 7. History of significant drug allergy such as, but not limited to, sulphonamides and penicillins. Prezista is a sulphonamide. The potential for crosssensitivity between drugs in the sulphonamide class and Prezista in HIVnegative subjects is unknown. 8. Use of concomitant medication, including investigational, prescription, and overthecounter products and dietary supplements with the following exceptions: aspirin, acetaminophen, antihistamines such as diphenhydramine, inhalers for asthma, daily multivitamins, mineral supplements and hormonal oral contraceptives. Concomitant medication other than those listed above must have been discontinued at least 7 days before study entry. 9. Female subjects of childbearing potential without use of effective nonhormonal birth control methods, or not willing to continue practicing these birth control methods for at least 30 days after the end of the treatment period; Note: Estrogenbased hormonal contraception may not be reliable when taking Prezista, therefore to be eligible for this trial, women of childbearing potential should either: use a double barrier method to prevent pregnancy (i.e., using a condom with either diaphragm or cervical cap); use nonestrogen hormonal based contraceptives in combination with a barrier contraceptive (i.e., male condom, diaphragm or cervical cap, or female condom); use a intrauterine device in combination with a barrier contraceptive (i.e., male condom, diaphragm or cervical cap, or female condom); be not sexually active, or have a vasectomized partner (confirmed sterile). Women with tubal ligation are required to use one nonhormonal contraceptive method. Women who are postmenopausal for at least 2 years, and women with total hysterectomy are considered of nonchildbearing potential. 10. A positive pregnancy test or breast feeding at screening. 11. Participation in an investigational drug trial within 90 days prior to the first intake of trial medication. 12. Donation of blood or plasma within 60 days preceding the first trialrelated blood drawing. 13. Subjects with the following laboratory abnormalities at screening as defined by the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events ("DAIDS grading table") and in accordance with the normal ranges of the trial clinical laboratory: serum creatinine grade 1 or greater (≥ 1.1 x upper limit of laboratory normal range [ULN]); lipase or pancreatic amylase grade 1 or greater (≥ 1.1 x ULN); hemoglobin grade 1 or greater (≤ 10.9 g/dL) platelet count grade 1 or greater (≤ 124.999 x 109/L); absolute neutrophil count grade 1 or greater (≤ 1.3 x 109/L); aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) grade 1 or greater (≥ 1.25 x ULN); total bilirubin grade 1 or greater (≥ 1.1 x ULN), any other laboratory abnormality of grade 2 or above</criteria>
