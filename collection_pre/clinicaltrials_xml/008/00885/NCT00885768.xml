	<brief_title>Prevalence of Renal Artery Stenosis in Patients Referred for Cardiac Catheterization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Renal Artery Stenosis (RAS) is a common finding in patients with generalized atherosclerosis. It is the cause of 15-20% of end stage renal disease in elderly patients. The prevalence of asymptomatic RAS in general population is unknown but it estimated to be 18% in 7th decade and more than 50% in the 8th. It is critical to find and manage the RAS before it's symptoms appear. The Gold standard for diagnosis of atherosclerotic arterial stenosis is angiography. In this study we will evaluate the prevalence, severity, location and related factors to renal artery stenosis in patients whom referred for coronary angiography in period of July-September in one of the most referral heart center in Iran, "The Tehran heart center" which is doing more than 50 coronary angiography daily.</detailed_description>
