	<brief_summary>Pico-Salax is an osmotic and stimulant bowel cleansing agent used prior to colonoscopy. It is unknown whether splitting the doses (i.e. taking the second dose the morning of the colonoscopy) results in a better bowel cleansing, as research with other agents suggests this may be the case. This study aims to assess whether splitting the dose of Pico-Salax results in a better bowel cleansing than traditional dosing.</brief_summary>
