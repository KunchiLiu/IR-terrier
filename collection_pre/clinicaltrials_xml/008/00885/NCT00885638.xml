	<brief_summary>The regulation by DPP-4 inhibition after ingested of different individual macronutrients is not known. Therefore, this study examines the influence of ingestion of fat, protein, glucose or mixed meal on the concentrations of incretin hormones and insulin secretion with or without concomitant administration of a DPP-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP-4) Inhibition on Hormonal Responses to Macronutrient Ingestion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Meal ingestion releases gut hormones which stimulate insulin secretion. A most important gut hormone is the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). GLP-1 is rapidly degraded and inactivated after its release by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). Inhibition of DPP-4 therefore increases the concentration of active GLP-1 after meal ingestion, which augments insulin secretion. How this process is regulated after ingested of different individual macronutrients is not known. Therefore, this study examines the influence of ingestion of fat, protein, glucose or mixed meal on the concentrations of incretin hormones and insulin secretion with or without concomitant administration of a DPP-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin).</detailed_description>
