	<brief_summary>The study is to compare the 2 Groups with respect to antibody responses to inactivated influenza vaccine. Observational Objectives: - To describe the percentage of participants with protective Hemagglutinin (HAI) antibody titers to each of the 3 vaccine antigens in both study groups following each vaccination. - To describe the HAI geometric mean titer (GMTs) to each of the 3 vaccine antigens in both study groups following each vaccination. - To describe the safety of the 2005-2006 pediatric formulation of Fluzone® vaccine in both study groups.</brief_summary>
