	<brief_summary>The objective of the Program of Rehabilitative Exercise and Education to avert Vascular Events after Non-disabling stroke and Transient ischemic attack (PREVENT) Trial is to determine whether the timely delivery of secondary stroke prevention strategies will reduce modifiable vascular risk factors in two groups of people who have survived NDS or TIA. One group will receive a comprehensive education and exercise program (PREVENT); the other group will receive usual care (USUAL CARE). We will measure modifiable vascular risk factors in both groups. We will also compare the effects of PREVENT vs USUAL CARE on exercise capacity, walking endurance, and daily physical activity. In addition, we will compare thinking ability, depression, achievement of personal goals for healthy behavior, and health-related goal attainment and health-related quality of life. Finally, we will compare outcomes in urban and rural settings as well as costs of the PREVENT program and USUAL CARE in order to assess sustainability of the PREVENT program.</brief_summary>
