	<criteria>18 years of age or older. Must be successfully wearing assigned study lens brand (either ACUVUE® OASYS™ or PureVision® contact lenses) for at least 710 days, minimum 8 hours a day, prior to Visit 1 (screening). Vision correctable to 20/30 (Snellen) or better in each eye at distance with study lenses at Visit 1 (screening). Must have discontinued contact lens wear for at least two consecutive days before Visit 2 (baseline). Other protocoldefined inclusion criteria may apply. Any medical condition (systemic or ophthalmic) that may, in the opinion of the investigator, preclude safe administration of test article or safe participation in the study. Known sensitivity or intolerance to any protocolspecified contact lens solutions, eye drops, or products containing similar ingredients (e.g., generic products). Monocular vision (only one eye with functional vision) or fit with only one contact lens. Use of topical ocular overthecounter or prescribed topical ocular medication, with the exception of rewetting drops, within 7 days prior to screening visit. Current or history of ocular infection, inflammation, disease, structural abnormality or conditions within the last 6 months that could affect study participation or may preclude safe administration of the investigational lens care solution, in the opinion of the investigator. Any corneal surgery, cataract surgery, intraocular lens implants or glaucoma filtering surgery within the last 12 months. Any slitlamp finding score of 1 (or rated 3 or 4 for limbal and bulbar conjunctival injection) at screening or baseline visits. Corneal staining area assessment ≥ 20% in any corneal region in either eye at screening or baseline visit. Corneal staining graded as 2 (macropunctate) or greater in any corneal region in either eye at baseline visit. Participation in any investigational clinical study within 30 days of baseline visit. Other protocoldefined exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
