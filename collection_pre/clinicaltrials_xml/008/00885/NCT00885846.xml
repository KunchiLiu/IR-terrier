	<brief_summary>Qigong therapy is a subtle energy-based methodology for preventing and healing diseases that has been practiced with remarkable results in China for about five thousand years. Recently, preliminary studies showed that Qigong exercises improve insulin resistance and glucose metabolism in people with type 2 diabetes. These studies suggest that Qigong therapy might be an effective and valuable complementary modality for treating type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease marked by abnormally high levels of sugar in the blood. Diabetes is a serious disease, which, if not controlled, can be life threatening. The purpose of this project is to conduct a randomized, controlled pilot clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of Qigong therapy to mild exercise and conventional treatment in type 2 diabetes and to identify biological and psychological characteristics associated with subjects' responses to Qigong therapy. Aim 1: To compare the effects on blood sugar and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level between a Qigong therapy group and non-treated control group as well as between Qigong group and a progressive resistance training (PRT) group before, during and after and 12-week intervention. Hypothesis 1: Both Qigong therapy and PRT will help type 2 diabetic patients reduce blood sugar levels to different degrees through improving insulin resistance. But the levels of reduction of blood sugar will be greater by Qigong therapy than by PRT due to enhanced insulin secretion. Aim 2: To compare the effects on fasting C-peptide and insulin levels between a Qigong therapy group, a PRT group and a non-treated control group before and after the intervention. Hypothesis 2: Qigong therapy will increase the endogenous insulin and C-peptide levels by restoring the functions of the pancreas, while PRT will not alter either insulin or C-peptide levels. Aim 3: To compare the effects of Qigong therapy and PRT on blood cortisol levels and psychological stress levels before, during and after the intervention. Hypothesis 3: Perceived stress and depression will be improved by Qigong therapy to a greater extent than by PRT, and blood cortisol levels will be reduced to a greater extent with Qigong therapy.</brief_summary>
