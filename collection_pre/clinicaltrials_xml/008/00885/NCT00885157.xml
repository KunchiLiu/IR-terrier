	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of a fourth fractional booster dose of sanofi pasteur's IMOVAX Polio injected intradermally (using the Mantoux technique) as booster dose between 15 to 18 months of age, in terms of immunogenicity and safety. Objectives: - To describe in each group the immunogenicity of IMOVAX Polio administered intradermally or intramuscularly, one month after the booster dose given at 15-18 months of age in toddlers previously primed with three doses of IMOVAX Polio vaccine during the IPV25 study. - To describe in each group the safety of the booster dose of IMOVAX Polio vaccine administered intradermally or intramuscularly.</brief_summary>
