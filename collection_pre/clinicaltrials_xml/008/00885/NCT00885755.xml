	<brief_summary>This single arm study will evaluate alterations in molecular marker expression in HER2-positive targeted therapy, and will evaluate the effect of continued treatment with Herceptin and Xeloda beyond progression following initial Herceptin-taxane chemotherapy. Patients who develop progressive disease will receive first-line Herceptin (8mg/kg iv loading dose and 6mg/kg iv every 3 weeks) + taxane therapy. patients who develop progressive disease within 9 weeks of treatment will continue treatment with Herceptin in combination with Xeloda (1000mg/m2 po bid on days 1-14 of each 3-week cycle).Biopsies of tumor tissue will be taken for biomarker and gene profiling evaluation. The anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression, intolerable side effects or patient choice, and the target sample size is 100 individuals.</brief_summary>
