	<brief_summary>Gingivitis, defined as inflammation of the gingival tissues, has long been associated with bacterial accumulation [plaque] on the tooth surface adjacent to the gingiva, causing an inflammatory reaction. Experimental gingivitis in health adults can be induced by abstension from brushing teeth for 9 to 21 days, and can test the effects of numerous chemotherapeutic agents, rinses and toothpastes. Effective prevention of plaque accumulation can prevent destructive forms of periodontal disease. A recent link has been established between localized gingival inflammation and systemic inflammation and a number of disease processes. Periodontal disease may lead to elevated C-reactive protein [CRP], considered a potential risk factor for cardiovascular disease and stroke. It has been shown that reducing gingival inflammation is accompanied with a significant decrease in serum CRP levels. Naturopathic remedies for treating oral disease have been well documented in the medical and dental literature since early civilization, and have become more and more popular in recent years. We propose to study one such remedy, PERIORINSE. This remedy consists of a number of herbs, and has been shown to exhibit antibacterial and anti—inflammatory effects. Specifically, it has been shown to block the proteolytic effects seen in gingival inflammation . This study will evaluate the efficacy of this formulation, using currently accepted clinical testing protocols. A Random sample of 100 healthy volunteers who fulfill all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria, will be included in the study. Patients will randomly selected to one of 4 treatment groups: PERIORINSE (n=25), CPC (Cepacol) mouthwash (25 patients), Listerine mouthwash (n=25), and placebo (colored water) mouthrinse. Patients will be examined at baseline, and Gingival Index taken for all teeth. A blood specimen will be taken to measure CRP levels as well. Patients will be given a full dental prophylaxis which includes scaling and tooth polishing, and given rinsing instructions and reminded to cease all other oral hygiene methods including brushing, flossing, and rinsing with any other rinse for a period of 14 days. On day 14, patients will be re-examined and Gingival Index taken for all teeth. Patients will be given a full dental prophylaxis which includes scaling and tooth polishing and required to reinstitute their original oral hygiene regimen. CRP levels will be measured again, as well.</brief_summary>
