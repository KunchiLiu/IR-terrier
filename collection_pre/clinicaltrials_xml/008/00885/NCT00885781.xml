	<brief_summary>Comparison of efficacy and safety of two lipid emulsion products will be performed on gastrectomy patients postsurgically.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Comparison Between SMOFlipid and Lipovenoes MCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The comparison of two lipid emulsion product will be performed. Patients who plan to accept gastrectomy will be consider for trial and signed content will be obtained. If the patient needs total parenteral nutrition (TPN) treatment after surgery for at least 5 days and meets all criteria, then he/she will be enrolled and randomized to ether of the groups, SMOFlipid or Lipovenoes MCT. During the treatment period, efficacy variables and safety variables will be measured. Life quality evaluation will also be performed through questionnaires collection.</detailed_description>
