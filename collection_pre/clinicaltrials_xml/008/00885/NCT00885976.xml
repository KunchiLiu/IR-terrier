	<brief_summary>This study is intended to provide additional insight into the factors affecting health-related quality of life with pediatric chronic pain as perceived by the patient versus his or her parents.In doing so, additional insight into the subjective interpretation the pediatric chronic pain experience will be gained. The four objectives of this study will be (a) to examine further the relationship between patient self-reported health-related quality of life and parent proxy-reported health-related quality; (b) to identify what biological, psychological, and/or social factors are the strongest predictors of a pediatric chronic pain patient's self-reported pain intensity and self-reported health-related quality of life, in a diverse cohort of patients referred to and subsequently treated by an anesthesiology-based yet interdisciplinary pediatric chronic pain medicine program; (c) to assess the effect of patient-specific, pain-focused biopsychosocial treatment regimen on pain intensity and health-related quality of life; and (d) to determine the effect of patient/parental satisfaction with on-going health care on their compliance with and uptake of the pain treatment regimen.</brief_summary>
