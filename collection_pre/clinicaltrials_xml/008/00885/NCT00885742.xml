	<brief_summary>Congenital deficiency of factor XIII (FXIII) is an extremely rare inherited disorder associated with potentially life-threatening bleeding. Factor XIII Concentrate is given to patients whose blood is lacking factor XIII. Factor XIII Concentrate works by assisting blood in the usual clotting process, thereby preventing bleeding. In this study, patients will be treated with FXIII Concentrate (Human) and followed closely to determine that they receive the dose that will best minimize the chance of bruising and bleeding.</brief_summary>
