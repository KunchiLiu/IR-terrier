	<brief_title>Effects of Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) on Children With Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sixty children or adolescents (4-16 years) with liver biopsy proven NAFLD will be enrolled. They will be randomized to treatment with DHA 250 mg/kg/d (n=20), DHA 500 mg/kg/d (n=20), or an identical placebo (n=20) given orally for a period of 24 months. All patients will be included in a lifestyle intervention program consisting of a diet tailored on the individual requirements and physical exercise. Patients will undergo a medical evaluation every three months during the 24-month study period. Liver biopsy will be performed only at baseline and at the end of treatment. Anthropometric analysis, laboratory tests, including liver enzymes and lipids will be repeated at 3-month intervals during the 24-month study duration. Ultrasonography and Fibroscan of the liver will be repeated at the end of the study period.</detailed_description>
