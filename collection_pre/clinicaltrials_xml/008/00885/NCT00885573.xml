	<brief_summary>Pharyngeal sensitivity is a determinant parameter of pharyngeal functioning, particularly regarding protective dilator reflexes of upper airway. Preliminary results have suggested that the use of this parameter in diagnosis algorithm such as linear discriminant analysis and random forest could predict the presence of sleep apnea syndrome in almost 98% of patients. Our study aims at validating a new diagnosis method of sleep disordered breathing which will be compared with nocturnal polysomnography, the reference method to diagnose sleep disordered breathing. Pharyngeal sensitivity will be measured using the SENSITEST device which allows an automatic measurement of the pharyngeal sensation. The use of this parameter in diagnosis algorithm will be compared with polysomnographic results.</brief_summary>
