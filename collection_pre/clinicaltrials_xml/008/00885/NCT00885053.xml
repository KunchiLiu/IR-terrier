	<brief_title>Fish Oil and Inflammation in Overweight Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Being overweight is associated with metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus (type 2). Adipose tissue can be regarded as an active organ, which produces an array of inflammatory mediators. This creates a state of chronic low-grade inflammation. Inflammation has been proven to be a key element in the development of atherosclerotic plaques. The marine n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease. These effects are partly attributed to the anti-inflammatory effect of the n-3 PUFAs. Previous studies have shown an anti-inflammatory effect of n-3 PUFAs in overweight subjects, but the studies have been conducted with a high daily dose of n-3 PUFA. We want to examine the effect of a lower dose of 1 g n-3 PUFA/day (the dose recommended by the Danish Heart Foundation). The study is randomized, placebo-controlled and double blinded. Fifty subjects aged 30 - 75 years (postmenopausal women; waist circumference &gt; 80 cm and men; waist circumference &gt; 94 cm) will be included. Blood samples and fatty tissue biopsies will be collected at baseline, after 1 day and after 6 weeks.</detailed_description>
