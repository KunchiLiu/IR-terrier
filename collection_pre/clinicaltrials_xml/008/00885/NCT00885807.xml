	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the psychometric validation of the Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale and the Weiss Symptom Record. It is hypothesized that the Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale has strong psychometric properties and good convergent validity with other measures of functioning and discriminant validity from symptoms and quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Chart Review to Validate the WFIRS (Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The measures for this rating scale were developed at the request of the Canadian Attention Deficit Disorder Resource Alliance to provide clinician friendly tools free of charge as a way of improving screening for ADHD and comorbidity. Patients are consented during clinic visits and agree to allow use of clinic data for the purpose of this research. They complete additional measure(s) for the purpose of the study. The data is then entered. Internal consistency will be measured using Cronbach's alpha. Convergent, concurrent and discriminant validity will be measured using Pearson correlations. Domain reliability is determined with factor analysis. Up to 220 patients will be enrolled in the study.</detailed_description>
