	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Epoetin beta may cause the body to make more red blood cells and may prevent or reduce side effects in patients undergoing chemotherapy for solid tumors. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well epoetin beta works in patients undergoing chemotherapy for solid tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epoetin Beta in Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy for Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - Identify factors predictive of treatment failure in patients with solid tumors treated with epoetin beta while undergoing chemotherapy. Secondary - Evaluate the impact of achieving target hemoglobin levels (i.e., hemoglobin &gt; 11 g/dL) after 8 weeks of treatment with epoetin beta. - Evaluate changes in hemoglobin levels from baseline to after 8 weeks of treatment with epoetin beta. - Evaluate the tolerability of epoetin beta in these patients. - Evaluate the quality of life of these patients. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive epoetin beta subcutaneously once a week for ≥ 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients complete a quality-of-life questionnaire (FACT-An) at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment.</detailed_description>
