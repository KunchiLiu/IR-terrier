	<brief_title>Eye Movement Recordings in the Diagnosis of Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eye movements are recorded for Operations Enduring Freedom or Iraqi Freedom (OIF/OEF) veterans with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and compared to the eye movements of those without mTBI. By analyzing and characterizing the differences between the two groups, a diagnostic measure of mTBI through the use of eye movements can be developed.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>OIF/OEF Veteran; Neuropsych diagnosis of MTBI chronically abusing alcohol or illicit drugs. uncorrected vision prevents subject from effectively viewing the stimuli, unless they can wear contact lenses during the recording session. inability to make normal eye movements (i.e.: saccades, smooth pursuit) required by study paradigms. Note: Deficit can be caused by taking medications that can potentially affect eye movements or any neurological condition that can interfere with making normal eye movement. psychological or psychiatric conditions that preclude sustained concentration or ability to perform the tasks.</criteria>
