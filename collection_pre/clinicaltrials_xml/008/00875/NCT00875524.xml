	<brief_summary>This trial will evaluate the use of a tetravalent vaccine against dengue. Primary objectives: - To describe the immune response to dengue before and after each vaccination with tetravalent dengue vaccine in adults, adolescents, and children. - To evaluate the safety of each vaccination with sanofi pasteur's tetravalent dengue vaccine in 4 age cohorts. - To evaluate the persistence of antibodies against dengue during 5 years after the first vaccination with sanofi pasteur's tetravalent dengue vaccine in the four age cohorts.</brief_summary>
