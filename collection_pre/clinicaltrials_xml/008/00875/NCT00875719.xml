	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare differences in oxygen delivery between portable oxygen concentrators (POCs) and liquid oxygen (LOs) portable units, pose a question if POCs are equally effective as LOs in reducing exercise-induced hypoxaemia. DESIGN: Randomized, single-blind clinical trial.</brief_summary>
