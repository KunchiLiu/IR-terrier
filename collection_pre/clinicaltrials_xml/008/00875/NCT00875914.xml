	<brief_summary>The MAGMA-AVNRT study compares two different methods of handling the ablation catheters for av-node-reentry-tachycardia with regard to x-ray dose, safety and success: manually guided vs magnetically navigated RF-catheter.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnetically Navigated vs. Manually Guided Radiofrequency in Atrioventricular-node-reentry-tachycardia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AV-node reentry tachycardia can be treated by radiofrequency ablation or modulation of the slow pathway of the av node. The success rate is 90 to 95%. There are different options to navigate the ablation catheter: manually guided vs magnetically guided. For magnetic guidance two magnets are positioned beneath the patient. A mangetic field is induced and a catheter with a ferromagnetic tip can be navigated from outside with a joystick by modifying the vectors of the magnetic field. We hypothesized that a magnetic guidance of the RF-ablation catheter results in lower x-ray time and dose for the patient and the physician with comparable safety und success rates.</detailed_description>
