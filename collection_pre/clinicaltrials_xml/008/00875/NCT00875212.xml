	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to investigate the buffering effect of a calcium glycerophosphate-fluoride (CaGP-F) dentifrice on in vivo dental biofilm after a cariogenic challenge and evaluate its probable 12-hour protective effect. Twelve young adults took part in this randomized, double blind, 14-day 4-phase crossover study. Between each phase, the volunteers had a 1-week wash-out period. Coded dentifrices were randomly assigned to the volunteers: A) no F and no CaGP; B) CaGP-only (0.13%); C) F-only (1500 ppm (ppm= parts per million of fluoride which is equivalent to mg/kg)); D) CaGP-F (0.13%, 1500 ppm, respectively). The pH measurements were taken from a single-site using a microelectrode, with salt bridge established by a 1M KCl (one molar potassium chloride) solution with a reference electrode. pH measurements were taken at 0 (baseline), 1, 7, 14 and 21 min (minutes) after a cariogenic challenge (10% w/v sucrose solution, %w/v = percent weight per volume). Four sets of measurements were carried out: (D0BS) before test dentifrice usage; (D01min) 1-min after test dentifrice usage; and (D712h) 7 days and (D1412h) 14 days using the test dentifrice, 12 hours (h)after brushing. Stephen curves and mean AUC (area under the curve) were obtained.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Calcium Glycerophosphate (CaGP) - Fluoride Dentifrice on Dental Biofilm pH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although the mechanisms of action of fluoride are reasonably understood, the mechanism of calcium phosphate and calcium glycerophosphate (CaGP) are still a matter of debate. It has been suggested that CaGP increases the phosphorus content in the biofilm and, as a result, the buffering capacity of the biofilm is intensified. The pH levels of the biofilm are maintained above the 5.0-5.5 range. This is above the critical range for enamel demineralization.</detailed_description>
