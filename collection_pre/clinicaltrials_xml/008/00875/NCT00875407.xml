	<brief_summary>Context. Nuclear imaging plays a central role in management of chromaffin-tissue derived tumors because tumor cells exhibit peptide receptors and proteins involved in metabolism that can be targeted with specific radiopharmaceutics. Recently, over expression dopamine-receptor D2 isoforms has been found in endocrine tumors. Objective. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the feasibility of 123I-IBZM (a D2 agonist radiolabelled with 123I) in patients with PHEO and/or PGL. Diagnostic accuracy will be also compared to traditional SPECT imaging procedures.</brief_summary>
