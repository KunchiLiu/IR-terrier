	<brief_summary>Phytopharm plc is developing Cogane™ which is a new medicine for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). The purpose of the study is to find out if Cogane is safe and well tolerated in both healthy volunteers and Parkinson's disease patients and to determine if there is a difference in the way that the body deals with Cogane (pharmacokinetics) between these two groups. It is expected that the study will prove that Cogane™ is safe and well tolerated and will provide us with a pharmacokinetic profile for both subject groups.</brief_summary>
