	<brief_summary>In many cases, the existing locking bolts and screws in intramedullary nails do not provide sufficient stability. The play between screw and nail can result in loss of reduction and the instability due to the interfragmentary movement can result in malunions or nonunions. Therefore, an Angular Stable Locking System for Intramedullary Nails (ASLS) was developed to enhance axial and angular fracture stability. ASLS provides angular-stable fixation between nails and screws with resorbable sleeves used as dowels in the nail locking holes. Preliminary results of a pre-study show a trend towards reduced time to pain-free full weight bearing in patients being treated with ASLS. This hypothesis will be tested in the present randomized controlled study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Angular Stable Locking System (ASLS) in Patients With Distal Tibial Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Angular Stable Locking System (ASLS) in patients with distal tibial fractures treated with Expert Tibial Nails (ETN). In many cases, the existing locking bolts and screws in intramedullary nails do not provide sufficient stability. The play between screw and nail can result in loss of reduction and the instability due to the interfragmentary movement can result in malunions or nonunions. Therefore, an Angular Stable Locking System for Intramedullary Nails (ASLS) was developed to enhance axial and angular fracture stability.
