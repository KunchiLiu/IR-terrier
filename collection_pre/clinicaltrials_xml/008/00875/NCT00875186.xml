	<brief_title>The Influence of Aerobic Endurance Training After Roux-en-Y-Gastric Bypass</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The only effective treatment for patients with morbid obesity is bariatric surgery. Sudden weight loss following bariatric operations for morbid obesity, such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) can result in a concurrent decrease in lean body mass. However the long-time results (weight reduction, elimination co-morbidities) are depending on the post operative treatment. Aerobic physical exercising (APE) is well accepted in conservative treatment of obesity as well as of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM). The aim of this study was to assess the efficiency of APE on weight loss, body composition and co-morbidities in patients after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric bypass (RYGBP).</detailed_description>
