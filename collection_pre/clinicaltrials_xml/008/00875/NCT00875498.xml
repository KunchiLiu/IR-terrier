	<brief_title>Intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (iTBS) for the Treatment of Negative Symptoms in Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate whether the intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (iTBS), a new high frequency TMS protocol is efficient in the treatment of the Negative Symptoms of schizophrenia. Neuroimaging studies demonstrate that hypoactivity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (LDLPFC) was associated with negative symptoms. The investigators hypothesize that iTBS applied to LDLPFC will improve negative symptoms and will improve activity of the LDLPFC measured with Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS).</detailed_description>
