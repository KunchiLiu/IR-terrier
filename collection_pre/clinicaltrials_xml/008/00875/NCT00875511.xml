	<brief_summary>The study seeks to discover whether peer rejection increases the value of food relative to peer interaction in overweight individuals. After playing a computer game that randomly simulates peer rejection or peer acceptance, participants will play another computer game that will assess the value of food and social interactions. Overweight individuals may be more likely to resort to food in moments of distress and less likely to choose to interact with a peer to reestablish their sense of belongingness.</brief_summary>
