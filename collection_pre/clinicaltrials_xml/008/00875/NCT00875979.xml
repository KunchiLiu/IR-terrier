	<brief_summary>This was a multi-institutional, multinational, open-label, single-arm Phase Ib/II study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of trastuzumab emtansine (trastuzumab-MCC-DM1) administered by intravenous (IV) infusion in combination with pertuzumab in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who had previously received trastuzumab.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Trastuzumab Emtansine (Trastuzumab-MCC-DM1, T-DM1) in Combination With Pertuzumab Administered to Patients With Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-2 (HER2)-Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer Who Have Previously Received Trastuzumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There were 2 phases in the study, a Dose Escalation phase (Phase 1b) and a Dose Expansion phase (Phase 2a). In the Dose Escalation phase, 3 patients were enrolled at the first dose level (3.0 mg/kg trastuzumab emtansine) and and 6 patients were enrolled at the second dose level (3.6 mg/kg trastuzumab emtansine). An additional 58 patients were enrolled at the 3.6 mg/kg trastuzumab emtansine dose level in the Dose Expansion phase (Phase 2a) of the study.</detailed_description>
