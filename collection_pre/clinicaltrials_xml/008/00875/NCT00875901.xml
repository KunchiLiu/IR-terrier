	<brief_summary>This is a research study to determine if hypofractionated image guided radiation therapy (hypoIGRT) with proton therapy is a good way to treat early stage lung tumors for patients who will not have surgery. HypoIGRT delivers higher daily doses of radiation over a shorter period of time compared with conventional radiation. This is thought to deliver a more lethal dose of radiation to the tumor and is more convenient with treatment being completed within 2-3 weeks compared to the typical 7-8 week course of conventional radiotherapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Pathologically confirmed, by biopsy or cytology, nonsmall cell lung carcinoma diagnosed within 3 months prior to study enrollment. T1, N0, M0 or T2, N0, M0. At least 18 years old at the time of consent. Adequate bone marrow function. Medically inoperable. Medically operable candidates are allowed if they refuse surgical resection. If the patient has a large pleural effusion, it must be biopsy negative. Evidence of distant metastasis (M1) and/or nodal involvement (N1, N2, N3). Synchronous primary. T2 tumors &gt; 5 cm; T3, T4 primary tumor. Previous radiotherapy for lung cancer. Concomitant local, regional, and/or systemic therapy during radiotherapy. Active systemic, pulmonary, and/or pericardial infection.</criteria>
