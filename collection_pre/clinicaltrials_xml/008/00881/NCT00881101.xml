	<brief_title>Clinical Study of Liposomal Paclitaxel in Chinese Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are clinical trials show that paclitaxel is common option for the treatment of solid tumors. Liposomal paclitaxel has different pharmacokinetic features comparing with conventional paclitaxel. However,the tolerance of this new dosage form of paclitaxel (liposomal paclitaxel) has never been studied in Chinese cancer patients. This study is designed to find the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicities of liposomal paclitaxel in Chinese cancer patients.</detailed_description>
