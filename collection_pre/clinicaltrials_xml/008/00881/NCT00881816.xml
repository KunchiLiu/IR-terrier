	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Study of Liposomal Paclitaxel Plus Capecitabine in Chinese Patients With Advanced Gastric Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are clinical trials showed that taxane is optional for the treatment of gastric cancer. Liposomal paclitaxel has different pharmacokinetic features comparing with conventional taxane. This study is designed to find the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicity of liposomal paclitaxel combined with capecitabine in Chinese patients with advanced gastric carcinoma.</detailed_description>
