	<brief_summary>Influenza (flu) viruses change continuously, therefore also the parts of viruses used in influenza vaccines can vary from year to year. In Europe, manufacturers/marketing holders of these vaccines are required to be involved in ongoing clinical trials and to present the results to the competent authorities each year. The current study is a phase IIIa clinical trial with a commercially available vaccine (Influvac®) supplied in pre filled syringes. It is part of the ongoing clinical trial program for Influvac® and will be done to assess the immunogenicity and safety and tolerability of next season's trivalent influenza subunit vaccine in two groups of subjects in good health: subjects aged &gt;= 18 and &lt;= 60 years and subjects &gt;= 61 years of age (elderly).</brief_summary>
