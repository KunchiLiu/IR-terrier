	<brief_summary>Adenosine has been proved to be an important mediator of myocardial protection induced by ischemic preconditioning. The hypothesis of this study is that adenosine preconditioning can provide additional myocardial protection in the setting of pediatric open heart surgery with cardioplegia and cardiopulmonary bypass.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Myocardial Protection With Adenosine Preconditioning</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adenosine has been used for diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases for many years. New progresses in myocardial protection in the settings of acute myocardial infarction treatment put forward the its clinical use to a broader field. But the safety and effectiveness of its use in myocardial protection in the setting of open heart surgery has not been investigated intensively. Our primary results suggested that adenosine preconditioning could decrease the release of myocardial serum markers, such as cTnI. This study will focus on the safety and effectiveness of adenosine in the field of pediatric myocardial protection during surgery repair of congenital heart defects with CPB and cardioplegia.</detailed_description>
