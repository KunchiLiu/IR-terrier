	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and potential effectiveness of a new surgical procedure for treating heart failure. The experimental treatment is performed during standard coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, and applies radiofrequency energy to heat a portion of the damaged heart muscle. The tissue heating reduces the enlarged heart of patients suffering from ischemic heart failure, and may result in the heart pumping blood more efficiently, thereby improving the functional status of the patient.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Study of Radiofrequency Heating of Cardiac Infarction Scar to Treat Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure is an important health-care problem, resulting in significant numbers of patients, hospitalizations, and economic costs. The etiology of heart failure is coronary artery disease in approximately two-thirds of cases, and the majority of these patients have experienced prior myocardial infarction. As a consequence of the myocardial infarction, the ventricle undergoes changes in volume and shape, a process referred to as "ventricular remodeling". As the left ventricle enlarges, global systolic function worsens, resulting in heart failure. There are a number of treatment options available to minimize symptoms and somewhat slow disease progression. Unfortunately, even with best conventional drug and device therapies, heart failure patients continue to have high morbidity and mortality rates. The experimental therapy investigated in this study uses a surgical device which employs radiofrequency energy to heat epicardial tissue. The application of heat to a myocardial infarction scar causes it to shrink in size, and correspondingly reduces ventricular volume. The volume reduction may "reverse remodel" the enlarged and dysfunctioning left ventricle to a more normal size and shape. The intent of this clinical study is to evaluate whether radiofrequency heating of the myocardial infarct scar is safe, and determine if the resulting ventricular volume reduction translates into improved clinical and functional outcomes in patients suffering from ischemic heart failure.</detailed_description>
