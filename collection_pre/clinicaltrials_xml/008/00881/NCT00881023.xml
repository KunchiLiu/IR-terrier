	<brief_summary>The Cartilage Autograft Implantation System (CAIS) is designed as a single surgical treatment of damaged knee cartilage using the subject's own healthy cartilage obtained from a non-weight or low weight-bearing region. CAIS is indicated for the repair of articular cartilage lesions and osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the knee through cartilage regeneration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cartilage Autograft Implantation System (CAIS) for the Repair of Knee Cartilage Through Cartilage Regeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Cartilage Autograft Implantation System (CAIS) is a kit of devices that utilizes morselized autologous hyaline cartilage harvested arthroscopically, affixed onto a synthetic, resorbable implant using a fibrin sealant and implanted in a single surgical procedure. The system is designed as a surgical treatment of damaged knee cartilage using the subject's own healthy cartilage obtained from a non-weight or low weight-bearing region.</detailed_description>
