	<brief_summary>Although cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most effective intervention for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), many people do receive CBT initially. Given this, alternative ways of providing CBT need to be identified and tested. With this in mind, the proposed study examines the efficacy of a videophone based cognitive-behavioral intervention for youth with OCD. A total of 30 youth will be randomly assigned to either videophone administered CBT or an abbreviated wait-list control arm. Comprehensive assessments will be conducted by trained clinicians at relevant time-points to assess symptom severity and impairment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most effective intervention for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), many people do receive CBT initially due, in part, to the lack of trained providers and geographic barriers (e.g., distance to such providers). Rather, the majority of youth with OCD receive psychiatric medication alone or together with unproven forms of psychotherapy. While some serotonergic medications have demonstrated utility in pediatric OCD, side effects can be common, response rates are modest at best, and symptom remission is rare. Given this, alternative ways of providing CBT need to be identified and tested to increase the number of people with access to this form of treatment. With this in mind, the proposed study examines the efficacy of a videophone based cognitive-behavioral intervention for youth with OCD. A total of 30 youth will be randomly assigned to either videophone administered CBT or an abbreviated wait-list control arm. Cognitive-behavioral therapy will be based on a demonstrated effective treatment protocol, and adapted for videophone administration. Comprehensive assessments will be conducted by trained clinicians at relevant time-points (e.g., baseline, post-treatment, follow-up) to assess symptom severity and impairment. Should supporting data be found, videophone-administered CBT would have the potential to help many more families who would otherwise remain untreated or inadequately treated. On a societal level, evaluation and dissemination of telehealth interventions such as this will lessen costs related to sustained treatment and OCD related impairment.</detailed_description>
