	<brief_title>Esomeprazole Versus Pantoprazole to Prevent Peptic Ulcer Rebleeding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endoscopic hemostasis and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) constitute the cornerstone in the management of peptic ulcer bleeding (PUB), which remains a prevalent disorder associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Clinical effectiveness of PPI in the management of patients with PUB has been established by compelling evidence derived from a number of randomized trials. However, whether different PPIs are equally effective has not been investigated. Esomeprazole, the S-isomer of omeprazole, may achieve faster, more profound and steady acid suppression than other PPIs, but it remains undetermined whether the superiority of pharmacologic efficacy may be translated into advantages in clinical outcomes.</detailed_description>
