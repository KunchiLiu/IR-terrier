	<brief_summary>Adult subjects with malignant disease appropriate for treatment with carboplatin/paclitaxel, carboplatin/etoposide, topotecan, docetaxel or erlotinib according to the standard dosing regimen will be enrolled in each treatment arm. Primary objective: Determine the MTD. Secondary objectives: Response rates, PK, quantify MP-470 on PK of SOC, and collect pharmacodynamic information. Evaluate the overall safety of MP-470 when co-administered with specific SOC treatments.</brief_summary>
