	<brief_summary>This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of 10 cm² rivastigmine patch vs. placebo in cognitively impaired Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients. Primary objective was the assessment of cognition by the Selective Reminding Test (SRT) -a subtest of the brief repeatable battery (BRB) - after titration of 4 weeks and maintenance of 12 weeks. This double-blind period was followed by a 52-week open-label treatment phase to assess long-term safety of rivastigmine patch in these patients.</brief_summary>
