	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) Hyperimmune Globulin to Prevent Congenital HCMV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HCMV is the leading infectious cause of mental retardation and deafness in infants with congenital HCMV infection. Primary HCMV infections during pregnancy carry the highest risk of fetal infection and disease. No intervention of proven efficacy is available in case of primary HCMV infection in pregnancy. However, a study published in 2005 (Nigro et al., NEJM 353:1350-62, 2005) reported that in pregnant women with primary HCMV infection treated with HCMV-specific hyperimmune globulin (Cytotect®, Biotest) the risk of transmitting the infection to the fetus was reduced from 40% to 16%. Unfortunately, since the study was conducted with inadequate controls, the actual efficacy of hyperimmune globulin could not be properly assessed. In the present randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial pregnant women with ascertained primary HCMV infection at 4-26 weeks of gestation will be randomized to receive Cytotect® or placebo intravenously within 6 weeks after the presumed onset of infection. Primary efficacy parameter will be the number of HCMV-infected newborns or fetuses.</detailed_description>
