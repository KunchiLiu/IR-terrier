	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this clinical research trial was to compare the ongoing pregnancy rate between two gonadotrophins for controlled ovarian stimulation (MENOPUR and recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)), in cycles where a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist was used for prevention of premature luteinizing hormone (LH) surge and where a single embryo was transferred at the blastocyst stage.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MENOPUR in Gonadotrophin-releasing Hormone (GnRH) Antagonist Cycles With Single Embryo Transfer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a randomized, open-label, assessor-blind, parallel groups, multicentre trial comparing the efficacy of highly purified menotrophin (MENOPUR; Ferring) and recombinant FSH (PUREGON/FOLLISTIM; MSD/Merck) in women undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation following a GnRH antagonist protocol. The use of oral contraceptives for programming of the trial cycle was prohibited. On day 2-3 of the menstrual cycle, participants were randomized in a 1:1 fashion to treatment with either highly purified menotrophin (MENOPUR) or recombinant FSH, and stimulation was initiated. The gonadotrophin starting dose was 150 international units (IU) daily for the first 5 days. Hereafter, the participants were seen on stimulation day 6 and subsequently at least every 2 days when a transvaginal ultrasound was made to monitor response to stimulation. From stimulation day 6 and onwards, dosing could be adjusted according to individual patient response with the purpose of achieving 8-10 oocytes at the time of oocyte retrieval. The dose adjustment could be by 75 IU per adjustment and could not be done more frequently than every 4 days. The maximum allowed gonadotrophin dose was 375 IU daily and participants could be treated with gonadotrophin for a maximum of 20 days. Coasting was prohibited. The GnRH antagonist (ORGALUTRAN/GANIRELIX ACETATE INJECTION; MSD/Merck) was initiated on stimulation day 6 at a daily dose of 0.25 mg and continued throughout the gonadotrophin treatment period. A single injection of recombinant human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) 250 µg (OVITRELLE/OVIDREL; Merck Serono/EMD Serono) was administered to induce final follicular maturation as soon as 3 follicles of ≥ 17 mm were observed; i.e., the day of reaching the hCG criterion or the next day. Oocyte retrieval took place 36h (± 2h) after hCG administration. Oocytes were inseminated using partner sperm by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) 4h (± 1h) after retrieval. Oocyte, embryo and blastocyst quality was assessed daily from oocyte retrieval till 5 days after. On day 5 after oocyte retrieval, a single blastocyst of the best quality available was transferred and all remaining blastocysts were frozen. Vaginal progesterone capsules (UTROGESTAN; Seid) 600 mg/day were provided for luteal phase support from the day after oocyte retrieval till the day of the beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (βhCG) test (13-15 days after embryo transfer); prolonged luteal phase support beyond this time point was not allowed. Clinical pregnancy was confirmed by transvaginal ultrasound 5-6 weeks after embryo transfer and ongoing pregnancy was confirmed by transvaginal ultrasound 10-11 weeks after embryo transfer. Post-trial follow-up included pregnancy outcome (e.g. live birth) and neonatal health from the fresh trial cycle. Additional post-trial activities included follow-up of frozen embryo replacement cycles initiated within 1 year after the participant's randomization date.</detailed_description>
