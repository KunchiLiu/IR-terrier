	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: The total costs of laparoscopic colorectal surgery are less than those of open surgery. Secondary hypothesis: Patients quality of life is higher following laparoscopic surgery, as compared to open colorectal surgery. Research objectives: 1. To estimate the cost implications and clinical benefits of incorporating laparoscopic colorectal surgery into routine clinical practice. 2. To examine whether the increased operative costs of laparoscopic surgery are compensated for by a faster recovery, shorter duration of hospital stay, and a reduction in late complications, as compared to open surgery. 3. To investigate whether there are differences in quality of life following laparoscopic colorectal surgery as compared to open surgery. Lay summary: Patients needing an operation for a bowel problem have traditionally had an open operation with an incision on the abdomen, and this is the type of operation that is currently performed in the majority of cases in the United Kingdom today (over 90%). Laparoscopic (or keyhole) surgery has been introduced into bowel surgery, but is currently not widely performed. This is because thus far there have been no clear-cut benefits demonstrated with this technique and the perceived costs are higher than an open operation. The investigators aim to evaluate both of these issues.</brief_summary>
