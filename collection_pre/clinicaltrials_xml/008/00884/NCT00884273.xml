	<brief_summary>This was a Phase 3b clinical study in prostate cancer patients which aimed to compare the current standard therapy of a gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, goserelin (3.6 mg; plus anti-androgen flare protection, bicalutamide), to a novel GnRH antagonist, degarelix (240 mg starting dose/80 mg maintenance dose) with respect to mean percentage reduction in prostate volume. The hypothesis was that degarelix could decrease prostate size at least as effectively as the combination of a GnRH agonist with an anti-androgen for flare protection.</brief_summary>
