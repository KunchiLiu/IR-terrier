	<brief_summary>While Diacutaneous fibrolysis (DF) has achieved promising results empirically, its effectiveness has not been tested in clinical trials. The investigators hypothesized that the use of DF in patients suffering from painful shoulder would increase the active mobility and reduce the pain during movement. To test the hypothesis a double blind (patient and investigator) randomized clinical trial was carried out in two public Primary Health Care Centres. Fifty patients were randomly allocated to two groups: the intervention group, who received a real DF session, and the control group, who received a placebo DF session.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background and objectives: Diacutaneous fibrolysis (DF) is a manual technique to treat the mechanical pain of the musculoskeletal system. While this technique has achieved promising results empirically, its effectiveness has not been tested in clinical trials. We aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of a single session of DF on pain and mobility in patients suffering from painful shoulder. Subjects and methods: This clinical trial took place in two public Primary Health Care Centres. Fifty patients were randomly allocated to two groups: the intervention group, who received a real DF session, and the control group, who received a placebo DF session. The degree of active mobility (flexion, abduction, extension, external and internal rotation), the pain in the hand behind back position and the participant's perception of the technique in terms of comfort and results obtained were measured.</detailed_description>
