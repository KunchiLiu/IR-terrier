	<brief_title>New York City (NYC) Health eHearts Pay for Quality Pilot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The NYC DOHMH received a private donation from the Robin Hood Foundation to provide monetary incentives to small practices for improving their delivery of preventive services in neighborhoods experiencing health disparities. Practices recruited by NYC DOHMH to adopt an electronic health record will be randomized to receive monetary incentives for improving both patient outcomes and delivery of care on: aspirin therapy, blood pressure control, cholesterol control, and smoking cessation intervention. The set of quality measures are referred to the ABCS. The NYC DOHMH will be collecting provider surveys on their experience on quality measurement and participation in other pay-for-performance programs, as well as transmit aggregated information on their performance on the ABCS to DOHMH on a monthly basis.</detailed_description>
