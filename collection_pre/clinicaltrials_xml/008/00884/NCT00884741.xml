	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial studies temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation therapy (RT) to compare how well they work with or without bevacizumab in treating patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma or gliosarcoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may find tumor cells and help kill them. It is not yet known whether temozolomide and radiation therapy are more effective when given together with or without bevacizumab in treating glioblastoma or gliosarcoma.</brief_summary>

(ACRIN 6686) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the differential acute effects associated with the addition of bevacizumab to temozolomide and radiation, as compared to the conventional arm, on measures of neurocognitive function, health-related quality of life, and symptoms during radiation and across the longitudinal progression-free interval. II. To determine the relationship of neurocognitive function, health-related quality of life, and symptoms, with progression-free and overall survival. III. To determine the association between tumor molecular profile (i.e., mesenchymal/angiogenic phenotype and proneural phenotype) and neurocognitive function, health-related quality of life, and symptoms. IV. To describe the association between health-related quality of life as measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30/Brain Cancer Module-20 (EORTC-QL30/BCM20) and mean symptom severity as measured by the M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory Brain Tumor Module (MDASI-BT) in patients enrolled in this study. V. To evaluate the relationship between self-reported neurocognitive function and objectively measured tests of neurocognitive function (NCF). VI. To assess the association between measures of change in enhancing tumor size at week 22 and overall survival in participants with glioma receiving chemoradiotherapy with and without bevacizumab. VII. To assess the association between measures of change in T2-based tumor size at week 22 and overall survival in participants with glioma receiving chemoradiotherapy with and without bevacizumab. VIII. To assess the association between changes in ADC values and overall survival in participants with glioma receiving chemoradiotherapy with and without bevacizumab. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms (there are also two registration steps prior to randomization which are labeled as "arms" in ClinicalTrials.gov to facilitate entry of results into the website). ARM I: Patients undergo intensity-modulated radiation therapy or 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks and receive temozolomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) for up to 7 weeks. Beginning 4 weeks after completion of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, patients receive temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5. Treatment with temozolomide repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive placebo IV over 30-90 minutes once every 2 weeks beginning in week 4 of chemotherapy and radiation therapy and continuing until the completion of temozolomide. ARM II: Patients undergo radiation therapy and receive temozolomide as in Arm I. Patients also receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes once every 2 weeks beginning in week 4 of chemoradiotherapy and continuing until the completion of adjuvant temozolomide. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
