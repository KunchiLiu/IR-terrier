	<brief_title>Managing Post-operative Pain in Children With Cerebral Palsy Using a Pain Pump</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective randomized controlled trial will be performed on up to 150 subjects who will undergo a tendoachilles lengthening, Strayer's procedure, epiphysiodesis of the femur or femoral osteotomy metal work removal. Subjects will be randomized into two groups: the first group will have an anesthetic pain pump device supplemented with oral analgesia and the second group will only receive oral analgesia. The anesthetic continuous device will be used continuously for 48 hours and with a flow rate of 2ml/hour of 0.25% bupivacaine diluted in accordance to patient weight. Subjects in both groups will receive oral analgesia according to their pain requirements. The amount of oral analgesia used will be documented over 12-hour intervals in a patient diary over a 4 day period. Subjects will have their pain score assessed daily with the use of the Non-Communicating Children's Pain Checklist-Postoperative Version. Their overall satisfaction with post-operative pain management will be assessed at the end of the study with the use of the Parent Total Quality Pain Management questionnaire.</detailed_description>
