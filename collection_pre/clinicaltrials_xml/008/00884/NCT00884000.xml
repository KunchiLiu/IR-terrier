	<brief_summary>This trial is set up to compare Zomacton to Genotropin for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency in children. The children will be treated for 1 year. Half of the patients will be treated with Genotropin and half with Zomacton. During this time they will be dosed every day by themselves or their parents at home in the evening. There will be 138 patients in the trial from age 3 to age 11. The patients cannot have been treated before with growth hormone and the patients must have a proven growth hormone deficiency, this will be shown by a specific test that will be performed before the trial in the local clinic and once during the trial. During the time of the treatment the patients will come to visit the clinic every 3 months. At these visits their heights will be measured, blood samples will be taken, physical examinations will be performed and questions about their health will be asked. At 2 times in the trial they will have a hand x-ray taken to measure the bone age. At the end of the trial the patients will stop the treatment and continue on one of the marketed products available to treat growth hormone deficiency.</brief_summary>
