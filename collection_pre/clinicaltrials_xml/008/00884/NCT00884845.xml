	<brief_summary>Phase I multicenter, open-label, dose-escalating clinical and pharmacokinetic trial of PM02734 administered in combination with erlotinib to determine the safety and tolerability and to identify the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and the recommended dose (RD) of the combination of PM02734 and erlotinib, in patients with advanced malignant solid tumors.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Phase I multicenter, open-label, dose-escalating clinical and pharmacokinetic trial of PM02734 administered in combination with erlotinib to determine the safety and tolerability and to identify the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and the recommended dose (RD) of the combination of PM02734 and erlotinib, determine the preliminary pharmacokinetics (PK) of the combination, evaluate the preliminary PK/pharmacodynamic correlation, evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity, perform a preliminary pharmacogenomic (PGx) study to explore molecular predictors of response to ErbB receptor antagonists and PM02734 in patient with advanced malignant solid tumors.</detailed_description>
