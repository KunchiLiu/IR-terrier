	<brief_summary>Fecal incontinence is the involuntary leakage of stool from the anus. Doctors at Mayo Clinic are doing a research study to assess the effects of a medication, clonidine, on fecal incontinence and rectal functions in women. Clonidine has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating high blood pressure, but not for treating incontinence and rectal functions. The hypothesis of this study is clonidine will improve fecal incontinence, increase rectal capacity and reduce rectal sensation to a greater extent than placebo in women.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Placebo-Controlled Study of Clonidine for Fecal Incontinence.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Available therapeutic options for idiopathic fecal incontinence (FI) are limited and unsatisfactory. In addition to weak anal sphincters, our data suggest that reduced rectal capacity may contribute to rectal hypersensitivity and the symptom of rectal urgency in FI. During a 4 week study, oral clonidine restored rectal capacity and improved fecal continence in women with urge-predominant FI. Clonidine improves fecal continence and stool consistency in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Therefore, we now propose a placebo-controlled study of clonidine for FI. Our aims are to (i) compare the effects of clonidine and placebo, to be given for 4 weeks, on symptoms, anal pressures, rectal compliance and sensation in women with FI. Forty four women (18-75 y) with urge predominant "idiopathic" FI and â‰¥ 4 episodes of FI during a 4 week screening period will be recruited to this study. Thereafter, patients will be treated with clonidine or placebo for 4 weeks. Bowel symptoms will be recorded in a diary. Anal sphincter pressures, rectal compliance and sensation will be evaluated before and during treatment with clonidine.</detailed_description>
