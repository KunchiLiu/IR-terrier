	<brief_summary>This study will investigate the use of anecortave acetate injection to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) in corneal transplant recipients who are experiencing steroid-associated pressure control problems. Alternative methods of IOP control have been shown to entail serious risks. For example, reduction of topical steroids increases the risk of graft rejection, and use of glaucoma medications or glaucoma surgery increases the risk of graft failure. This study is designed to have sufficient power to detect whether a single injection can induce a clinically significant IOP reduction.</brief_summary>
