	<brief_title>QTc Study of Rosi XR in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An extended release (XR) formulation of rosiglitazone maleate (RSG), a new formulation of rosiglitazone, is being investigated as a treatment for patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study is a randomised double blind, parallel group, and will evaluate the effects of repeat oral doses of RSG- XR for 21 days (due to the long half-life of the main metabolite M10) on the QTc interval compared to placebo in a population of healthy adult males and females between 18 and 45 years of age. Moxifloxacin, a drug with well-quantified QTc prolongation, will be included as a positive control in order to validate the ability of the study to detect small changes in QTc.</detailed_description>
