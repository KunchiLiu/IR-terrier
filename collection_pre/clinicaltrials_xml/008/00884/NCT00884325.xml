	<brief_summary>It is historically well known that the management of pruritus in atopic dermatitis is very difficult. Most of the patients are not controlled with traditional antihistamines such as Clarinex, Claritin, and Allegra. It will be a welcome addition to our treatment armamentarium if a drug such as Xyzal can control pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis.</brief_summary>
