	<brief_summary>Ghrelin, a hormone produced in the stomach that stimulates hunger and food intake, declines immediately after weight loss surgery. Some studies suggest that ghrelin may worsen an individual's ability to respond to insulin. The purpose of this study is to determine if the decline in ghrelin levels after weight loss surgery contributes to the improvement of insulin sensitivity.</brief_summary>
