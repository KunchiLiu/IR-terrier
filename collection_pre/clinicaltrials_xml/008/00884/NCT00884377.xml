	<brief_title>Local Heat Therapy Versus Sodium Stibogluconate for the Treatment of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 60 Department of Defense health care beneficiaries, 18 years of age or older and diagnosed with cutaneous leishmaniasis, were planned to be treated with either intravenous sodium stibogluconate (Pentostam-TM) or the ThermoMed-TM device of Thermosurgery Technologies, Inc. at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Pentostam is the standard of care for this disease, but the i.v. administration and the many known side effects prompt the search for an improved method of treating this disease, especially for milder cases. This study compares the safety and efficacy of these two treatment approached.</detailed_description>
