	<brief_summary>The study aims to confirm that, in Peruvian infants, the investigational DTaP-IPV Hep B-PRP~T vaccine has immunological and safety profiles that are comparable to those of the control vaccine that is already marketed (Infanrix®Hexa) Primary Objective: To demonstrate that the hexavalent DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP~T combined vaccine induces an immune response that is at least as good as the response following Infanrix®Hexa in terms of seroprotection rates to HB, one month after a three-dose primary series (2, 4 and 6 months) Secondary Objectives: - To describe in each group the immunogenicity to vaccine components (for DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP~T and Infanrix®Hexa) one month after the third dose of the primary series. - To assess the overall safety in each group one month after each dose of the primary series and through the entire study.</brief_summary>
