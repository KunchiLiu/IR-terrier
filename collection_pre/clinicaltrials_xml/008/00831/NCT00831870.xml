	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to collect and compare EndoSure and EndoSure s2 Wireless AAA Pressure Sensor measurements with measurements from CT scan imaging, ultrasound, and other tests used to measure your AAA sac size and endoleaks following AAA repair, and during follow-up visits with your physician. An antenna is held over the patient's abdomen to measure pressure inside the aneurysm sac. The reading does not cause any discomfort, and dye or radiation is not needed to take the pressure measurement. To qualify, the patient must have a previously implanted EndoSure Sensor.</brief_summary>
