	<criteria>Outpatients who have completed doubleblind therapy in shortterm study for the indication of major depressive disorder (MDD), including scheduled evaluations, with no major protocol violations and no study events that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude the subject's entry into the longterm, openlabel study. Clinically important abnormalities on baseline (day 56 of the shortterm study) physical examination, or any unresolved clinically significant abnormalities on electrocardiogram (ECG), laboratory test results, or vital signs recorded before day 56 in the previous shortterm study for the indication of MDD.</criteria>
