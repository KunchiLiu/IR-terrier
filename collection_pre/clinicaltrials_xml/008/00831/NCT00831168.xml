	<brief_summary>BEADI is a dissemination trial, on standards of care of premature babies. The main objective of BEADI is to assess whether an innovative 'active' strategy for the dissemination of neonatal information (evidence reviews, interactive training workshop, benchmarking and feedback, and ongoing support) is more likely to lead to changes in policy and practice than the traditional (more passive) forms of dissemination in English neonatal units. BEADI will focus on three areas of neonatal care for premature (22+0 to 26+6 weeks' gestation) babies born in England: timing of surfactant therapy, staffing for resuscitation at delivery, and temperature control (in line with the main Project 27/28 findings ). However, the approach is applicable to a wide variety of clinical policies and practice. The BEADI study has been granted ethical approval by MREC to use a subset of data collected by EPICure2 up until 31st December 2006 (pre-intervention data). For the post-intervention data, ethical approval has been granted for CEMACH to continue data collection against the three clinical areas using a subset of data items captured in the PN:E2 form, for the three month period between 1st January - 31st March 2007. Local research and development departments of each trust have also been contacted.</brief_summary>
