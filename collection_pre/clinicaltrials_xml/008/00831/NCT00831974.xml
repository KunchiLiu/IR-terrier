	<brief_summary>This is a 12 weeks study aimed at assessing the safety and efficacy of 2 doses of AB1010 in patients suffering from indolent systemic mastocytosis with handicap.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of AB1010 in Patients With Systemic Indolent Mastocytosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Efficacy will be assessed based on: Pruritus score Number of flush per day Pollakyuria (on a daily basis) Number of stools per day QLQ-C30 score Hamilton Rating Scale for depression</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Mastocytosis</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. Patients with documented Indolent systemic mastocytosis with handicap (ISMwh) having at least 2 infiltrated* organs (skin and /or bonemarrow and/or internal organ). 2. Bonemarrow, or skin or internal biopsydocumented mastocytosis and evaluable disease. 3. The absence of an activating point mutation in the phosphotransferase domain of cKit such as D816V cKit mutation in at least one of the two infiltrated organs: bone marrow and/or skin and/or other tissue. 4. Handicap defined as at least one of the following handicaps: a number of flush per day ≥ 1 , a pruritus score ≥ 9 , a number of stools per day ≥ 4 , a Pollakyuria (on a per day basis) ≥ 8 , a QLQC30 score ≥ 83 , a Hamilton rating scale for depression ≥ 12 1. Performance status &gt; 2 (ECOG). 2. Inadequate organ function, except if the abnormalities are due to involvement by mast cells</criteria>
