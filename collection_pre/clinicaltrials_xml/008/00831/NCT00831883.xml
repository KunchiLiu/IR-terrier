	<brief_title>Partner-Specific HIV Risk Reduction Intervention for Drug-Using Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Incarcerated adolescents represent a group at high risk for health consequences associated with risky sexual behaviors. Condom use is more common with non-main than main sex partners and substance use in conjunction with sexual risk also appears to vary by partner type. The research team will conduct a small randomized trial to pilot test a partner-specific HIV risk reduction intervention for currently or recently incarcerated adolescents who report problematic substance use. Participants will be randomized to a 5 session HIV risk reduction group intervention based on the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills model, or a 5 session healthy lifestyles psychoeducation intervention, and then reassessed 3 months after their access to the general community is reinstated. The main hypothesis is that participants in the HIV risk reduction intervention condition will have lower levels of sex-related HIV risk behavior and of substance use in conjunction with sexual risk, relative to those in a healthy lifestyles psychoeducation intervention.</detailed_description>
