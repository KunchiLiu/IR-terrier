	<brief_title>Screening of Psycho-cognitive Troubles in Elderly Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It also aims to assess this rate among patients 1) when the geriatrics mobile unit is involved in the screening of these troubles and 2) when it is not. All the patients (75 and older) hospitalised in the internal medicine department of a suburban Parisian hospital are included in the study and their psycho-cognitive functions assessed by a geriatrics physician, using 3 validated tests. The result of this screening provides the rate of psycho-cognitive troubles among patients that would not have been tested by a geriatrics physician in usual care. It assesses the interest of a systematic evaluation of elderly patients by the geriatric mobile unit.</detailed_description>
