	<brief_summary>In April 2008, a coronary catheter based imaging system, LipiScan, was cleared by the FDA for use in detecting lipid core containing containing plaques of interest (LCP). These plaques are rich in cholesterol. The way that cholesterol and other lipids deposit with the coronary artery is unique to each patient. This study is an organized attempt to observe the LCP and the variety of ways that it presents in patients as detected by this recently approved device. This information will be used for physician training and to observe the behavior of the LCP in response to no therapy and currently approved therapies. The purpose of this project is further medical knowledge of the LCP and its treatment.</brief_summary>
