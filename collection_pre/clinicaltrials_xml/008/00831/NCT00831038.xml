	<brief_summary>Infants less than 2 years old who have been newly diagnosed with problems swallowing will have pulmonary function tests performed to try to detect the presence of chronic lung disease. Six months later after the infants have received appropriate therapy for their swallowing problems, pulmonary function tests will be performed again to see if there has been any change in their chronic lung disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study of Pulmonary Function in Dysphagic Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty-five infants between the ages of 1 month and 24 months who have just been diagnosed with dysphagia via a modified barium feeding study will be recruited into the study. The infants will be sedated with chloral hydrate and have pulmonary functions measured (pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry and lung volume) using the infant pulmonary laboratory. Treatment for the infants' dysphagia/chronic aspiration will be treated as determined by the primary care physicians. Six months later the infants will again be sedated and have pulmonary functions measured. Results of the two sets of tests will be compared statistically.</detailed_description>
