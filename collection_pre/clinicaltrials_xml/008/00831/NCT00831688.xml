	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study to date, is that no causal therapy for Meniere's disease has been discovered. Local overpressure treatment for Meniere's disease is a new treatment form that has been shown in animal and human experiments to reduce the endolymphatic hydrops, a condition that is generally believed to be the pathologic hallmark of Meniere's disease. This study analyzes the efficacy of local overpressure treatment by measuring subjective vertigo severity and objective audiovestibular function parameters.</brief_summary>
