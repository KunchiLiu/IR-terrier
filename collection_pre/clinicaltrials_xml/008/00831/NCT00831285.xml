	<brief_summary>The variation in starch and fibre composition of prepared barley tortillas will have a significant effect on glycemic response.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Barley Tortillas Study in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specifically, we wish to examine the glycemic response of barley tortillas containing different ratios of amylose and amylopectin and different amounts of soluble and insoluble fibre with an appropriate control during acute phase testing in healthy volunteers. Possible relationships between composition of the barley tortillas and the degree of physiological response will also be investigated as the secondary objective.</detailed_description>
