	<brief_summary>The hypothesis for the present study was that patients receiving a minimally invasive total hip arthroplasty will show a faster improvement on walking ability and mobilization in the immediate postoperative period compared to patients with the standard Hardinge approach. Therefore, the main goal was to evaluate the differences in early rehabilitation of these two different surgical approaches by gait analysis and electromyographical examination as objective methods.</brief_summary>
