	<brief_summary>The study implies a 2 step study design. Patients are enrolled into 3 separate groups for melanoma, breast, and non-small cell lung cancer. In the first step, 21 patients per disease group are enrolled. If &gt;=2 objective responses (SD, PR, or CR) out of 21 evaluable patients are observed, enrollment continues for other 45 patients as a whole, where response will be positively evaluated if &gt;=10 patients will respond. If &lt;2 objective responses out of 21 evaluable patients per disease group are observed, this(ese) group(s) will no longer be treated with temozolomide.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Cytological/histological diagnosis of either melanoma, nonsmall cell lung cancer and breast; Brain metastases &gt;=1 cm presenting or in progression following &gt;=4 weeks time interval free from previous malignancyspecific chemotherapy, hormone therapy, or other medical therapies; Magnetic resonance imaging suspected brain metastases; patients with brain lesion(s) not univocal as brain metastases must have negative radiolabeled leukocyte brain scan to rule out infectious nonmalignant disease; all neuroradiological studies (baseline and treatment outcome evaluation), except for emergency exams must be performed after 10 days of unchanged schedule of dexamethasone, and obtained in the axialcoronalsagittal planes in T1 and T2 before and after gadolinium enhancement. Presence of al least one bidimensionally measurable and not previously irradiated metastasis. Age &lt;=70 years. Performance status 02 (ECOGWHO scale). Blood leukocytes &gt;=3.5 x 10^9/L and platelets &gt;=100 x 10^9/L. Bilirubin &lt;=25 M/L. Seric transaminases &lt;=2 x upper limit of normal values. Creatinine &lt;=150 M/L, creatinine clearance &gt;=60 mL/min. Signed written informed consent. Diabetes not allowing administration of adequate doses of dexamethasone at least during the first 2 months of treatment. Previous whole brain irradiation. Brain metastases eligible to neurosurgery or stereotactic radiation therapy. Previous or current malignancies at other sites with the exception of adequately treated in situ carcinoma of the cervix or basal and squamous carcinoma of the skin. Pregnant or nursing women. Acute infection requiring intravenous antibiotics. Severe vomiting or medical condition which could interfere with oral medication intake. Anticonvulsant chronic therapy.</criteria>
