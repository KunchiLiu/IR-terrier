	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to compare the relative bronchoprotection (at trough) conferred by 2-week chronic dosing with levosalbutamol and racemic salbutamol in mild to moderate asthmatics. Patients will be preselected into two groups on the basis of their beta-2 adrenoreceptor polymorphisms. The investigators will evaluate if this has a differential effect on the bronchoprotection conferred by both formulations of salbutamol, as evidenced by a rebound in airway hyper-responsiveness, in order to determine whether any effect can be explained by the S enantiomer in the racemic formulation.</brief_summary>

Male or female 1865 4. Informed Consent 5. Ability to comply with the requirements of the protocol 1. Severe asthmatics as defined by an FEV1≤ 60% or PEF variability &gt; 30% or with continual daytime or nocturnal symptoms. 2. The use of oral corticosteroids within the last 3 months. 3.

Any significant abnormal laboratory result as deemed by the investigators 7. Pregnancy, planned pregnancy or lactation 8. Known or suspected contraindication to any of the IMP's 9. Concomitant use of medicines (prescribed, over the counter or herbal) that may interfere with the trial.</criteria>
