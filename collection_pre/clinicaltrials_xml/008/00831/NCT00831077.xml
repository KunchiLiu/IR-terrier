	<brief_title>Early Phase I Microdosing Study of ORM-14540 and ORM-12741</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Written informed consent (IC) obtained. Good general health ascertained by detailed medical history and physical examinations. Males between 18 and 45 years (inclusive). Body Mass Index (BMI) between 1830 kg/m2 (inclusive, BMI = weight/height2). Weight 55100 kg (inclusive). A predictable poor compliance or inability to communicate well with the investigator or study centre personnel. Veins unsuitable for repeated venipuncture Evidence of clinically significant cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, haematological, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, metabolicendocrine, neurological, urogenital or psychiatric diseases as judged by the investigator. Any condition requiring regular concomitant medication including herbal products or likely to need any concomitant treatment during the study. Susceptibility to severe allergic reactions. Intake of any medication that could affect the outcome of the study, within 2 weeks prior to the first study treatment or less than 5 times a halflife of the medication. Possible enzyme inducing drugs will be discussed casebycase with the sponsor. Regular consumption of more than 21 units of alcohol per week (1 unit = 4 cl spirits, about 13 g of alcohol). Current use of nicotinecontaining products more than 5 cigarettes or equivalent/day. Inability to refrain from using nicotinecontaining products during the stay at the study centre. Inability to refrain from consuming caffeinecontaining beverages during the stay in the study centre, e.g. propensity in getting headache when refraining from caffeinecontaining beverages. Blood donation or loss of significant amount of blood within 2 months prior to the screening visit. Abnormal 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) finding of clinical relevance in supine position after resting for 10 minutes at the screening visit, for example: QTc (calculated through the Bazett's formula) &gt; 450msec, PR &lt; 120 msec or &gt; 210 msec, QRS &lt; 70 msec or &gt; 120 msec. Heart rate (HR) &lt; 45 beats/minute or &gt; 100 beats/minute in supine position after resting for 10 minutes at the screening visit. At the screening visit, systolic blood pressure (BP) &lt; 90 mmHg or &gt; 140 mmHg in supine position after resting for 10 minutes, diastolic BP &lt; 50 mmHg or &gt; 90 mmHg in supine position after resting for 10 minutes. Any abnormal value of laboratory, vital signs, or physical examination, which may in the opinion of the investigator interfere with the interpretation of the test results or cause a health risk for the subject if he takes part into the study. History of drug abuse or positive result in drug abuse test. Positive serology to human immunodeficiency virus antigen/antibodies (HIVAgAb), hepatitis C virus antibodies (HCVAb) or hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Any other condition that in the opinion of the investigator would interfere with the evaluation of the results or constitute a health risk for the subject. Participation in a clinical drug study within 3 months prior to the screening visit in this study, or earlier participation in a clinical study with ORM12741. Exposure to 14Clabelled drugs or diagnostics within 12 months prior to the screening visit. Men who are not practising clinically accepted method of contraception during the study and next 3 months after the study treatment administration.</criteria>
