	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of 89Zr-bevacizumab PET imaging as a biomarker before and during treatment with sunitinib or bevacizumab plus interferon in patients with RCC. 89Zr-bevacizumab PET imaging will be regarded a promising biomarker if the target for treatment (VEGF) can be visualised and if uptake changes after institution of treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- To explore if 89Zr-bevacizumab PET imaging can differentiate RCC patients with progressive disease from patients with non-progressive disease during treatment with sunitinib or bevacizumab plus interferon. - To explore relationships between VEGF pathway related biomarkers and 89Zr-bevacizumab PET response. - To explore effect of 2 weeks off treatment in the sunitinib arm on pharmacodynamic biomarkers and 89Zr-bevacizumab PET response.</detailed_description>
