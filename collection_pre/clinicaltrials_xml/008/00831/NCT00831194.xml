	<brief_summary>A clinical trial that uses personal digital assistants (PDAs) to assist in examining the relationship between self reported stress, an objective biochemical indicator of stress (salivary alpha amylase) and self-reported dietary lapse among type 2 diabetic adults who are interested/undergoing in weight loss.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stress, Dietary Lapse and Weight Loss Among Adults With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the study, all participants will be provided with a personalized ADA-based diet plan and a pre-programmed PDA. They will be required to record their mood and activities into the PDA whenever PDA prompts, they break their diet plan, and/or and face significant stress. They will also be required to collect saliva samples periodically. In addition to this they will be administered the Trier Social Stress Test once during the study, where they will perform certain stress inducing tasks like delivering a speech and solving maths problems. Salivary samples will be collected before and after these tasks. They will also take various questionnaires during each of the 15 to 16 visits. The completed questionnaires, PDA records and reports of salivary alpha amylase levels will be analyzed to examine the corelation between stress, dietary lapse and weight loss.</detailed_description>
