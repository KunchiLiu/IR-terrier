	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Study of the Hippocampus After Infarction in the Territory of the Middle Cerebral Artery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>40 patients with middle cerebral artery infarction and 40 healthy volunteers will be observed. All of them will receive MRI scan and the assessment of the neuropsychological function (MMSE, AVLT, HAMD) intending to observe delayed neuronal death of hippocampus after middle cerebral artery infarction in human beings.</detailed_description>
