	<brief_summary>This is a single center open label phase II study of lenalidomide in IPSS Int-1 with increased blasts or hematologic needs with 5q31.1 deletions who have failed to respond to standard dose lenalidomide., IPSS Int-1 with increased blasts or hematologic needs without 5q31.1 deletions, and Int-2 and high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients with or without 5q31.1 deletions, regardless of whether they have received lenalidomide previously or not. Patients will receive two cycles of 50 mg daily lenalidomide given on days 1-28 out of a 42 day cycle. Within each of the two cycles of lenalidomide, patients will be given up to three weeks with no drug treatment to recover. Patients who fail to respond after two cycles of treatment may receive two additional cycles if stable. Patients who develop clinical response may continue to receive drug until disease progression.</brief_summary>
