	<brief_summary>The intent of the proposed study is to assess the potential of oral insulin to mitigate diabetic instability and reduce the frequency and severity of hypoglycemic episodes in patients with type 1 diabetes. Restoring hepatic glycogen stores is critical for the normalization of counter-regulation to hypoglycemia in these patients. Oral insulin can provide a means to increase portal insulin levels, shift the ratio of insulin/glucagon in favor of glycogenesis while sparing the patient the risk of hypoglycemia due to peripheral hyperinsulinemia</brief_summary>
