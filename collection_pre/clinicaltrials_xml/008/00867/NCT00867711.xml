	<brief_title>Molecular Predictors of Pemetrexed and Carboplatin Response in Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive tumor that usually has a poor prognosis. The combination of cisplatin and pemetrexed has recently become the standard of care in the first-line treatment of MPM. For patients who are unfit to receive a cisplatin-based chemotherapy, pemetrexed alone [7] or combined with carboplatin [8] has been proposed as an alternative treatment choice. The identification of molecular predictors of effective therapy is important for maximizing therapeutic efficacy and minimizing useless treatment in cancer patients.</detailed_description>
