	<brief_summary>This laboratory-based sub-study of ATN 061 and ATN 071 will examine the effect of early treatment followed by treatment de-intensification to atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) monotherapy on steady-state frequencies of replication-competent CD4+ T cell Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 reservoirs or cell-associated infectivity (CAI) and persistent low-level viremia (LLV), and their contribution to successful long-term control of HIV-1 replication among HIV-1 infected adolescents and young adults.</brief_summary>
