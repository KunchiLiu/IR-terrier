	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of imatinib mesylate in combination with panitumumab for the treatment of stage IV colorectal cancer that has spread to the liver. It will also assess the whether imatinib mesylate, either alone or in combination with panitumumab, is effective in treating this type of cancer. In addition, the study will evaluate the feasibility of a predefined lab score and whether it can predict which patients will respond to treatment with imatinib mesylate.</brief_summary>
