	<brief_summary>Medical center personnel were screened organoleptically for bad breath by 2 investigators using Rosenberg scale 0-5, and measurement of breath sample in portable gas chromatograph. With a threshold score of 2 or more, or 75parts per billion(ppb) hydrogen sulfide(H2S), subjects invited to enter clinical trial of the mechanical effect of daily tongue scraping with the adjunctive use of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash or 0.1% stabilized chlorine dioxide mouthwash. Subjects randomly assigned in double-blind trial for one week. The null hypothesis is there will be no difference between the two rinses as adjuncts to tongue scraping.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bad Breath Response to Tongue Scraper and Rinses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects in trial had oral and periodontal exam and scored the Ramfjord teeth(#3, 9, 12, 19, 25, 28) for Plaque Index(PlI), Gingival Index(GI), probing depth (PD), recession. A tongue coating index is scored and sample of coating on dorsum taken for culture of total viable count and percentage of black sulfide-producing colonies on anaerobe agar with lead acetate added. Subjects given hygiene instruction and instruction on use of scraper, then rinse with 20ml assigned mouthwash 30sec. Breath assessed by organoleptic means and mouth air sample concentration of hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan in portable gas chromatograph at 0, 1, 2, and 4 hours. Subjects use scraper and mouthwash twice daily for one week and return for final exam.</detailed_description>
