	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Virtual Lifestyle Management (VLM) as a behavior modification tool to promote weight loss, healthy eating and physical activity patterns, in the interest of reducing risk and adverse outcomes for individuals at high risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a military population. Specific Aim: To evaluate the effect of VLM on cardiovascular risk status in participants at high risk or individuals with T2D enrolled in the pilot study. The investigators hypothesize that participants will show greater improvement in weight as well as glucose, blood pressure, lipids, and self-reported diet and physical activity than will similar patients who are not enrolled in VLM.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Translating the Diabetes Prevention Program Into a Virtual Lifestyle Management Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As the epidemic of obesity continues to grow in both the United States and military populations, innovative lifestyle interventions that fit into the schedules of a busy population are critical. The rising costs of obesity (direct medical costs as well as societal costs) are staggering, and left unaddressed, they will overwhelm the budgets of many employers. Additionally, the costs in terms of military readiness are critical. As more career soldiers choose separation over weight reduction, the loss of institutional knowledge and intellectual capital are consequences that will continue to be felt. A program that is successful, scaleable, and transferable to remote locations could help stem this tide. VLM will begin the process of allowing the internet to be used not only as an informational and communication tool, but also as a means of accessing a comprehensive and well-validated lifestyle program from the internet-access point of greatest convenience. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) affects 18 million Americans(2) and costs $132 billion in expenditures and lost productivity.(3) Treatment and prevention are essential, yet current recommendations,(4) combining medical care with self-care, are difficult to implement. Furthermore, strong evidence supports the use of comprehensive, intensive lifestyle interventions for obesity among primary care patients. While such programs may help reduce the risk of T2D onset, assist with glucose management among individuals who have T2D, and benefit other obesity-related health problems, such programs are commonly lacking in clinical practice. This pilot study will test a model for the implementation of a VLM program that utilizes the internet to address good nutrition, safe weight loss methods and the importance of physical activity with the "virtual" support of a lifestyle coaching team to sustain participants in their weight loss and physical activity efforts. The focus of this initiative is to promote weight loss and healthy diet and exercise patterns, in the interest of preventing and treating T2D, and minimizing the risk of CVD in the military community. The study will be open to individuals who receive medical care through Wilford Hall Medical Center (WHMC) clinics.</detailed_description>
