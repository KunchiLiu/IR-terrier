	<brief_summary>The primary purpose is to determine if high dose vitamin D3 reduces the incidence of musculoskeletal symptoms associated with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole in women with early stage breast cancer and low serum vitamin D levels. The primary hypothesis is that high dose vitamin D3 prevents the worsening of musculoskeletal symptoms when compared to a standard dose vitamin D3 treatment.</brief_summary>
