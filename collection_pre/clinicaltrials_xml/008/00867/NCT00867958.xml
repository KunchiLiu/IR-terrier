	<brief_summary>Purpose: Evaluation of the CAR™ 27 for the creation of compression anastomoses. Indication: Compression Anastomosis Ring (CAR™ 27) device for creation of circular anastomoses during colonic or colorectal resection. Study Design: Prospective, open labeled study. Patient Population: Male or female subjects 18 years of age or older who are scheduled for non emergency laparoscopic or open colonic or colorectal resections. A temporary loop ileostomy/colostomy can be preformed up to the discretion of the surgeon. No. of Subjects: 15 patients estimated up to three months to enroll. Duration of Treatment: During the operation - creation of the anastomosis. Duration of Follow-up: Follow-up evaluation will be performed daily while hospitalized, during a post-op clinic visit at approximately 1 month (30 days ± 5 days) including a proctoscopic exam and by phone after 3 months. Endpoints: To evaluate the creation of a safe and functioning anastomosis and the occurrence of adverse events related to the use of the CAR™ 27 device.</brief_summary>
