	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to: 1. To investigate the wrist joint synovial blood flow intensity and model by quantitative three-dimensional (3D) power Doppler ultrasonography (PDUS) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis before and after initiation of a new medicine and compare these data with routinely used clinical data and laboratory findings, such as pain score, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) 2. To investigate the intra-observer and inter-observer agreement of quantitative 3D PDUS assessment of the vascularity in wrist joints and knee joints using automatic volume scan.</brief_summary>
