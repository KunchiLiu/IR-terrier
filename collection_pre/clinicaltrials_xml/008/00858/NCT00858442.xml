	<brief_summary>Does the addition of Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) to release of burn contractures and skin graft on the limbs of children with retractable burn sequelae reduce the initial time of the compressive treatment and maintain or lower the graft's retraction?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) in Reconstructive Surgery on Children With Retractable Burn Sequelae on Extremities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis: 1. The use of PRP will allow to initiate sooner the compressive treatment during the post graft surgery evolution, in fewer days on average than the traditional method (18 ds). 2. The use of PRP will maintain the same initial size of the graft. The study's domain corresponds to burn sequelae on children in treatment with reconstructive surgery due to retractile sequelae located on their upper and lower limbs, with functional compromise during their growth process. One of the treatments used for this problem is the surgical technique of with release of burn contractures and skin graft. Split skin grafts are at risk of suboptimal "take" due to bleeding and infection which would, on the one hand, delay the initiation of the rehabilitation with preventive compression to avoid the retraction of the grafted area. 20% of the children that arrive in COANIQUEM (approximately 7,000 annually), require rehabilitation. Of these, 32% have surgery and 9% of those are release of burn contractures and skin graft mainly on extremities.</detailed_description>
