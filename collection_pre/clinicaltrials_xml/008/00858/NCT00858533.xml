	<brief_title>Trial of Health at Work Workplace Health Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this pilot study is to examine the impact of H@W intervention(s) on job retention and return to work and compare outcomes with those from normal GP care. The target population for this study is people still at work but experiencing a work-related health problem as well as those off work. For the purpose of the study, short term sickness absence is defined as a period of 4 weeks or less and long term sickness absence defined as a period of 4 weeks or longer. Hypothesis That H@W intervention in comparison to standard care: - promotes work retention - enables a quick and sustained return to work for those on short term sick leave (4 weeks or less) - achieves sustained return to work for those on long term sick leave of 4 weeks or more. This could include a phased return to work. - achieves positive outcomes which could mean leaving one job and starting another.</detailed_description>
