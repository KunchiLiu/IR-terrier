	<brief_summary>Previous studies have indicated that menaquinone-7 (MK-7) is the most effective form of vitamin K. The Japanese soya product natto is one of the richest food sources of MK-7, but its taste is not appreciated by the Western society. For this reason, the active biological compound has been manufactured as enriched oil or casein (â‰ˆ80% of proteins in cow's milk)-enriched powder. However, cow's milk allergy is the most common cause of food allergy affecting a minimum of 2-3% of infants. The investigators will therefore compare this protein-delivery system to an alternative delivery system (Arabic gum; 98% polysaccharides). To compare the difference between powder and oil as MK-7 delivery vehicle, the investigators will also test the efficacy of enriched linseed oil.</brief_summary>
