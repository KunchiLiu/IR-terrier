	<brief_summary>The overall goal of this study is to determine whether variations in the perilipin, and several other, genes would be a useful tool for physicians who are caring for morbidly obese patients to guide therapy. The main hypotheses to be tested is that sequence variations (polymorphisms) in the perilipin gene and several other obesity-related genes are associated with resistance to weight loss for obese individuals on energy restricted diets, potentially playing a role in the development of obesity related complications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Association of Genes to Resistance to Weight Loss in Obese Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The PRIMARY goal of this study is to investigate the association of perilipin gene polymorphisms, with obese subjects who are "resistant" to weight loss in a defined program. The SECONDARY goal of this study is to investigate if additional candidate obesity genes that have previously been associated with obesity or energy metabolism show association with resistance to weight loss in subjects on an energy restricted diet. Additionally, we would like to investigate if any metabolic syndrome parameters, such as dyslipidemia or abnormal fasting glucose are associated with perilipin or variations in other obesity-related genes.</detailed_description>
