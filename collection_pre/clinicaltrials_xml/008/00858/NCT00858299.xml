	<brief_summary>This study is a multicenter, prospective, interventional study. It does not have a control group. All participants will receive 160 mg valsartan for 8 weeks. Among them, the patients with persistent proteinuria (defined as proteinuria more than 1 g/g after 8 weeks treatment of valsartan) will receive 320 mg valsartan for further 16 weeks. Participants who did not receive any ACEI or ARB previously will have a titration period for 4 weeks (80 mg for 4 weeks, 160 mg for 4 weeks, and then 320 mg for 16 weeks). The investigators will evaluate the change of urinary angiotensinogen excretion between at baseline, at 8 weeks, and 24 weeks.</brief_summary>
