	<brief_summary>The objective of this trial is to investigate the effect of early treatment of glucose toxicity with acarbose, a drug to control postprandial hyperglycemia, on the occurence of cardiovascular events and the inhibition of atherosclerosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Acarbose on Abnormal Glucose Regulation in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease (AAA Trial)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acarbose suppresses the postprandial increase in plasma glucose levels by inhibiting the activities of alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase involved in digestion and absorption of carbohydrates in the intestine. A clinical study involving patients with type 2 diabetes demonstrated that acarbose decreased the post-load glucose level and improved glycosylated hemoglobin control. A prospective study involving patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) demonstrated that acarbose inhibited progression to type 2 diabetes and significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular diseases. It has also been reported that acarbose slows increase in the intima-media thickness and inhibits the progression of atherosclerosis. A significant proportion of patients with acute coronary syndrome and those with stable angina pectoris suffer from diabetes or IGT, and their prognosis is poor.</detailed_description>
