	<brief_title>Study of the Durability of Glycemic Control With Nateglinide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Selected patients will be randomly assigned to receive nateglinide or glimepiride. Previous treatment with oral antidiabetic drugs (metformin, a-glucosidase inhibitor, nateglinide or sulfonylurea) will be discontinued. After a 1 month wash-out period (if 6.5 ≤ HbA1c ≤ 8.5), patients will take randomly assigned drugs for 24 months. Patients will be met by the trial investigator every 3 months following randomization. At each visit, patients whose HbA1c is &gt; 8.0% will be retested 2 weeks later, and if the retested HbA1c is also above 8.0%, those patients will be withdrawn considering monotherapy failure. We will evaluate the durability of nateglinide in comparison with that of glimepiride based on the withdrawal rate.</detailed_description>
