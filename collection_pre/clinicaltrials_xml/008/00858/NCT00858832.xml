	<brief_summary>Endomyometritis is an "infection in the uterus". It can occur in up to 1 out of 5 women having unplanned cesarean deliveries. Antibiotics are routinely given at the time of Cesarean delivery, but the infection in the uterus can still occur. When endomyometritis occurs it can prolong the woman's stay in the hospital after birth, slow down her recovery time at home, and increase medical costs. Methergine is a medication that is routinely used to stop uterine hemorrhage (excessive bleeding from the uterus) that sometimes happens after delivery. Methergine works by contracting (tightening) the uterus. These contractions also help the uterus to expel or remove parts of the placenta that increase the chance of developing a uterine infection. This research study is being done to learn if routine use of Methergine can lower the chances of developing a uterine infection after cesarean delivery. Half of the women in this study will receive Methergine for a few days during their hospitalization after cesarean delivery. The other half of the women will not routinely receive Methergine.</brief_summary>
