	<brief_summary>Patient stem cells will be mobilized with induction chemotherapy (R)-ICE and G-CSF. If sufficient cells can be mobilized, patients will be treated with high-dose chemotherapy and a transplant of autologous CD34+ cells transduced with an antiviral vector (M87o). If autologous CD34+ yield is insufficient, allogeneic gene-modified cells will be given, if a compatible donor is available. To minimize risk of transplant failure, a second unmodified CD34+ cell transplant will be given one week after the first transplant.</brief_summary>
