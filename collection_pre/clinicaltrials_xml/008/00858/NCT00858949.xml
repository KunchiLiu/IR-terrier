	<brief_title>Costs of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting in Ambulatory Surgery Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The direct cost between the end of outpatient surgery and discharge from the hospital will include costs of labors and supplies for any outpatient care, physician visits, laboratory tests, and prescribed medications, which may be used to treat operation side effects. Based on the time and motion study design, the timing of these healthcare activities will be collected. The study coordinator will observe the actual time taken for each activity for each patient. The observation period will begin after completion of the outpatient surgery. The start and end times for each activity performed will be recorded. Therefore, each activity and its duration will be concurrently recorded. We will also query patients daily to determine additional costs associated with PONV until the third postoperative morning.</detailed_description>
