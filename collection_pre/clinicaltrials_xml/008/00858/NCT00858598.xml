	<criteria>Inclusion criteria will be the same as the stated indications stated in the summary of the FDA approved 510(k) K063346, K980817, and K990131 application. These indications are stated below: PRO OSTEON® 500R Resorbable Bone Graft Substitute is indicated only for bony voids or gaps that are not intrinsic to the stability of the bony structure. PRO OSTEON® 500R is indicated to be gently packed into bony voids or gaps of the skeletal system (i.e, the extremities, spine and pelvis). These defects may be surgically created osseous defects or osseous defects created from traumatic injury to the bone. PRO OSTEON® 500R can be combined with autogenous blood, and/or sterile fluids (saline or Ringer's solution). The product provides a bone void filler that resorbs and is replaced with bone during the healing process.

All patients must sign an IRBapproved Informed Consent to be enrolled into the study.
