	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma is an aggressive disease with limited therapeutic options. Therefore, new approaches to treat this type of cancer are needed with immunotherapy potentially being one of these. As a first step in the development of novel therapies, expression analysis of specific markers, including tumor antigens will be carried out. This will be done retrospectively using available hepatocellular carcinoma tissue samples.</brief_summary>
