	<brief_summary>Thyroid nodule pathologies occur frequently and represent a clinical issue for the endocrinologists, surgeons, nuclear physicians as well as the general practitioners. The incidence of this pathology has been further highlighted by the introduction of the ultrasound examination into the clinical practice as 20% with impalpable thyroid nodules is now detected through ultrasound. The majority of nodules are benign and characterized by slow growth, and therefore treated with suppressive doses of levothyroxine. Long-term levothyroxine treatment has, however, several well-known side effects and limitations. During the last years, number of controlled studies have demonstrated that ultrasound guided percutaneous laser treatment (PLA) is able to reach the target lesion within the thyroid with a high level of precision, and to destroy the thyroid tissue in a predictable and repeatable fashion, without side effects. Aim of the study: 1. to assess 1-year and 3-year effect of laser ablation therapy on the volume of benign thyroid nodules and on nodule-related symptoms, and to compare these effects with findings in control group without active therapy; 2. to assess the eventual re-occurence of thyroid lesions (observed after other types of ablation treatment, like percutaneous ethanol injection) during a 3-year follow-up; 3. to demonstrate reproducibility of results within different environments and under different operators; 4. to validate eventual presence of major or minor side effects. To this aim we shall randomized 200 patients either for PLA (100 pts) or standard follow-up. Patients will be recruited, treated and followed in 4 italian centers (Ospedale Regina Apostolorum - Roma, Arcispedale S. Maria Nuova - Reggio Emilia, Ospedale S. Maria della Misericordia - Perugia, Ospedale di Cisanello - Pisa) by physicians with experience in PLA.The scientific coordinator of this multicentre study is dr. Claudio Maurizio Pacella.</brief_summary>
