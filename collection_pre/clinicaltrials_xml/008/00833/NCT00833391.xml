	<brief_title>Relative Bioavailability Study for GSK1838262 (Gabapentin Enacarbil)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, randomized, single-dose, five-period, crossover study to evaluate the relative drug concentrations with different formulations of GSK1838262 in healthy volunteers. Four new formulations will be tested against the current formulation to identify the most promising new formulations for further development. Each subject will participate in five dosing periods and each period will be separated by at least seven days. Blood and urine samples will be collected over the 36 hour period following each dose administration to measure the drug concentrations.</detailed_description>
