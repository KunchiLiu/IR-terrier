	<brief_summary>This study is the extension of the CLARINET study [NCT00396877 -EFC5314] in neonates or infants with cyanotic congenital heart disease palliated with a systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt. The primary objective was to assess the safety up to 18 months of age of the extended use of Clopidogrel 0.2 mg/kg/day in patients for whom the shunt was still in place at one year of age. The secondary objective was to assess the efficacy on the occurrence of shunt thrombosis requiring intervention or any death.</brief_summary>
