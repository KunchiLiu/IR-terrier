	<brief_summary>To describe the response of etanercept after adalimumab has failed to produce a satisfactory response in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. A total of 10 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis who are currently using adalimumab for at least 12 weeks but have a PGA of mild or worse will be transitioned to etanercept 50 mg twice weekly (BIW) for 12 wks followed by a dose reduction to 50mg once weekly (OW) for an additional 12 weeks.</brief_summary>

Subject has had a diagnosis of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis for at least 6 months Subject has had a suboptimal response to continuous treatment with adalimumab administered for at least 3 consecutive months prior to screening, with no treatment interruptions exceeding 14 days, at doses of 40 mg every other week (eow) after a loading of 80mg sc. The last dose of adalimumab must be greater than 11 days and less than 17 days before the first dose of etanercept. PGA of mild or worse If female, subject is either not of childbearing potential, defined as postmenopausal for at least 1 year or surgically sterile or is of childbearing potential and is practicing an approved method of birth control throughout the study. The results of a urine pregnancy test performed at the screening visit must be negative.

Subject must be able to selfadminister or has a qualified designee who can reliably administer SC injections. Subject must be able and willing to give written informed consent and to comply with the requirements of this study protocol. Subject has a negative PPD test at within 6 months of screening.

PUVA phototherapy within 14 days prior to Baseline visit. Systemic nonbiologic therapies for psoriasis within 30 days prior to Baseline visit. Biologic therapies (excluding adalimumab) for psoriasis within 30 days prior to Baseline visit. High potentcy topical steroids during the study period Received any investigational agent within 30 days or 5 half lives prior to Baseline (whichever is longer), or within a duration of its known pharmacological activity. Subject has other active skin diseases or skin infections (bacterial, fungal, viral or parasitic) that may interfere with evaluation of psoriasis. Infection(s) requiring treatment with intravenous (IV) antibiotics, IV antivirals, or IV antifungals within 30 days prior to Baseline or oral antibiotics, oral antivirals, or oral antifungals within 14 days prior to Baseline. History of moderate to severe congestive heart failure (NYHA class III or IV), recent cerebrovascular accident and any other condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the subject at risk by participation in the protocol. History of CNS demyelinating disease or neurologic symptoms suggestive of CNS demyelinating disease. History of listeriosis, histoplasmosis, chronic or active Hepatitis B infection, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, immunodeficiency syndrome, chronic recurring infections or active TB. Known hypersensitivity to the excipients of etanercept as stated in the label.

Evidence of dysplasia or history of malignancy (including lymphoma and leukemia) other than a successfully treated nonmetastatic cutaneous squamous cell, basal cell carcinoma or localized carcinoma in situ of the cervix.
