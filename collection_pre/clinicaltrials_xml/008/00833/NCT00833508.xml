	<brief_title>Effect of Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy on Exercise Capacity as Measured by Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chemoradiotherapy is associated with adverse effects. Patients with certain colorectal cancers undergo chemoradiotherapy prior to surgical resection. We intend to assess patient exercise capacity before and after chemoradiotherapy to assess whether this deteriorates. If there is a deleterious effect, this may affect operative outcome.</detailed_description>
