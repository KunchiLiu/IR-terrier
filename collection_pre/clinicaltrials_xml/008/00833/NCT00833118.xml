	<brief_summary>This protocol seeks to determine the efficacy and reliability of a simple maneuver, the jaw thrust maneuver, in addition to cricoid pressure, in improving visualization of airway anatomy during video laryngoscopy. Hypothesis: The grade of view of the glottis as determined by the modified Cormack and Lehane grading system in anesthetized patients will improve by performing a jaw thrust maneuver during video laryngoscopy with compared with video laryngoscopy alone. Similarly, the grade of the view during cricoid pressure will also improve with a jaw thrust maneuver.</brief_summary>
