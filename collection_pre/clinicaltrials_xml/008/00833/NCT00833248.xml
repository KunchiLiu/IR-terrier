	<brief_summary>The purpose of this phase 3B trial was to see how well a new trial drug (degarelix) works in terms of reducing the size of the prostate volume in prostate cancer patients who were scheduled to undergo subsequent radiotherapy for treatment of their prostate cancer. Prior to receiving radiotherapy, it is recommended that patients with intermediate to high risk prostate cancer are pre-treated with hormone therapy (so-called neoadjuvant therapy) which is known to reduce the size of the prostate and thereby decrease the required radiation field and enable a more safe and effective treatment. In this trial, participants were randomly selected (like flipping a coin) to receive either degarelix given alone or a standard hormone therapy (combination of goserelin and bicalutamide. The treatment was given for three months and the prostate size was measured by ultra sound at the beginning and at the end of the trial. The participants were required to come to the clinic for 5 or 6 visits during the three months.</brief_summary>
