	<detailed_description>1. To assess the feasibility of measuring body fat deposition by ADP in medically stable late gestation (32-35 weeks), premature infants during a period of rapid postnatal growth. 2. To test the relationship between %BF by ADP to %BF by DXA, as well as characterize the relationship between these fat measures with bone measures by quantitative ultrasound and serum levels of insulin, IGF-1, IGF binding proteins, adiponectin and leptin. 3. To perform inter- and intra-rater testing of anthropometric, ultrasound, and ADP measurements. 4. Compare growth, body composition and bone strength between infants born preterm to infants born full term.</detailed_description>
