	<brief_title>Safety Escalating Repeat IV, in Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GSK249320 is a humanised monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds with high specificity to myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) and antagonises or neutralises MAG-mediated inhibition and has been shown to improve functional recovery after stroke in pre-clinical models, possibly by promoting neuroregeneration and plasticity. The present study is the first in patients with stroke. The main aim of this study is to select tolerated doses of GSK249320 that can be used in future trials to evaluate its efficacy in improving clinical function in patients recovering from stroke. This clinical trial is designed as a placebo-controlled, single-blind, multicenter study to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of escalating repeat IV doses of GSK249320. Three sequential dose escalation cohorts (1, 5 and 15 mg/kg) are planned, with 8 patients on placebo and 8 on active in cohort 1 and 4 patients on placebo and 8 on active in cohorts 2 and 3. Each patient will receive 2 repeat IV doses 9 Â± 1 days apart and assessments will extend to at least 16 weeks.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Ischemic Attack, Transient</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Have a confirmed diagnosis of stroke Stroke onset must be within the last 2472 hours. Have a stroke that is either: radiologically confirmed to be ischaemic and supratentorial. The diameter of the ischemic lesion is &gt;15mm in any singlle direction or the volume is &gt;4cc. OR radiologically confirmed to be an intracerebral hemorrhage that is supratentorial, deep (i.e., blood must not directly contact cerebral cortex) and with minimal or no intraventricular extension. The Intracerebral Hemorrahage (CH) score must be 02 and is calculated based on age, Galsgow coma Scale score ad the initial CT or MRI findings for the index stroke. See the SOM for the full calculation procedure. Have a total NIHSS score of 321. Have an upper and/or lower limb deficit defined as: Score of 13 on the NIHSS Motor Arm question, and palpable and observable voluntary extension or flexion of the fingers. AND/OR b. Score of 13 on the NIHSS Motor Leg question Aged 1890, inclusive. Male subjects and females of nonchildbearing potential are allowed to participate in this study. Females of childbearing potential are also allowed to participate in this study provided they are using a contraceptive method with a failure rate of &lt;1%. History of a previous symptomatic stroke within 3 months prior to study entry. Presence of significant disability prior to the current stroke. Significant disability is defined as having a prestroke Rankin score of &gt;2. Presence of depression that is active and not adequately controlled such that it interferred with major activities of daily living immediately prior to the current stroke. Subjects who are not alert or are unresponsive as defined by a score of 2 or 3 on the NIHSS Level of Consciousness question (question #1a). Presence of significant aphasia as likely to confound or interfere with completion of the study assessments. Presence of peripheral neuropathy, including diabetic neuropathy, which is clinically active and symptomatic at time of screening. Presence of neurological or psychiatric disease, such as dementia or mild cognitive impairment, prior to study entry that is likely to confound clinical evaluations. Presence of a demyelinating disease, such as multiple sclerosis. Evidence of other chronic comorbid conditions or unstable acute systemic illnesses which, in the opinion of the investigator, could shorten the subject's survival or limit his/her ability to complete the study. History of sensitivity to heparin or heparininduced thrombocytopenia. Presence of QTcB &gt; 500 msec; or uncorrected QT &gt;600msec (machine or manual overread) on baseline ECG. Contraindication to TMS, such as: have metal present, such as hardware or plate on the scalp in the area to which TMS will be applied, implanted cardiac pacemaker, implanted prosthetic heart valve, medication pump or line, metallic implant or clip in the head/neck, electrical, mechanical or magnetic implants, neurostimulation device, or orthodontic work involving ferromagnetic materials occupation or activity that may cause accidental lodging of ferromagnetic materials or embedded metal fragments in the head. Subjects can be cleared by a head computed tomography scan. concomitant use of drugs that substantially lower seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants and neuroleptics) known history of seizures or epilepsy brain tumor, recent brain injury (within 5 years) associated with definite loss of consciousness, or any history of brain surgery Contraindication to MRI, such as: have metal present, such as implanted cardiac pacemaker, implanted prosthetic heart valve, medication pump or line, metallic implant or clip in the head/neck, electrical, mechanical or magnetic implants, neurostimulation device, or orthodontic work involving ferromagnetic materials, permanent tattooed metallic eyeliner occupation or activity that may cause accidental lodging of ferromagnetic materials or embedded metal fragments in the head. Subjects can be cleared by a head computed tomography scan. claustrophobia Participation in any investigational rehabilitation paradigm targeting stroke recovery during the duration of this study. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current study: 30 days, 5 halflives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer). Pregnant or lactating females. Subjects considered unwilling or unable to comply with the procedures and study visit schedule outlined in the protocol.</criteria>
