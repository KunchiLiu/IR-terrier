	<brief_summary>The proposed project is part of a program of research to improve management of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) through a community-academic partnership that addresses cultural factors in disease management. Specific aims are to: 1. Strengthen a community-academic partnership with the immigrant Chinese community in San Francisco to improve diabetes management; 2. Adapt and test a behavioral diabetes intervention, Coping Skills Training, to addresses family and cultural issues in immigrant Chinese patients with T2DM; and 3. Disseminate the adapted Coping Skills Training Program findings via the community-academic partnership to the immigrant Chinese American community through service programs, ethnic media, and professional/scientific publications. A mixed-methods CBPR approach will be used to interpretively adapt a behavioral intervention to be culturally appropriate, and test its efficacy using a repeated measures design. Two historically significant social service and health agencies serving immigrant Chinese in San Francisco are collaborating with this nurse-led interdisciplinary research team.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal of the culturally adapted Chinese Coping Skills Training (CCST) is to increase immigrant Chinese patients' skills and mastery in diabetes management by identifying and diminishing non-constructive coping responses to difficult social situations, while expanding the repertoire of positive coping responses and disease management behaviors. The CCST comprises a series of six small-group sessions focused on the topics of social problem solving, communication skills, cognitive behavior modification and conflict resolution. It also includes a review of basic diabetes management information.</detailed_description>
