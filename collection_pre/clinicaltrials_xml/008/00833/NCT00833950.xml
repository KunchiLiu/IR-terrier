	<brief_summary>Phase shift treatment is a new tinnitus therapy that aims at sound cancelling via complete or partial residual inhibition. This technique is based on the theory by Choy advocating that the induction of a sound wave with a 180 degree phase shift compared to the sound experienced by the patient could result in sound cancelling, likely by negation of the cortical perception of tinnitus. The aim is to determine the efficacy of the Phase Out treatment in pure tone and narrow band noise tinnitus patients.</brief_summary>
