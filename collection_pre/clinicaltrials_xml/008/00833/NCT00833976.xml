	<brief_summary>This is an open-label pilot study of omega-3 fatty acids (Lovaza) for hypertriglyceridemia in subjects who have been on an atypical (second-generation) antipsychotic medication. The investigators hypotheses are that patients who receive Lovaza will experience a significant decrease in triglycerides from baseline. Secondary hypotheses include: Patients will experience a significant decrease in total cholesterol, and Lovaza will be well tolerated.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is an open-label pilot study of omega-3 fatty acids (Lovaza) for hypertriglyceridemia in subjects who have been on an atypical (second generation) antipsychotic medication. Eligible subjects include men and women, ages 18-75, who have been taking an atypical antipsychotic for at least three months prior to enrollment. Atypical antipsychotics include: clozapine (Clozaril), olanzapine (Zyprexa), risperidone (Risperdal), aripiprazole (Abilify), ziprasidone (Geodon), quetiapine (Seroquel), paliperidone (Invega), asenapine (Saphris), iloperidone (Fanapt), and lurasidone (Latuda). Eligible subjects must also have serum triglycerides &gt;200 mg/dl or high cholesterol &gt;250 mg/dl at baseline.</detailed_description>
