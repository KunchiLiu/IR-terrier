	<brief_summary>Mosquito bites commonly result in redness, swelling and itching. This study will determine if a device that emits a small piezo-electrical impulse can provide relief from these symptoms. Volunteers entering the study will have a mosquito bite on one forearm. Redness and irritation will be recorded periodically for 24 hours. Comparing data from subjects randomised to the treatment or a placebo device will be analysed to determine effectiveness of the product. We will also ask the subjects their view on how easy the product is to use and clarity of instructions provided.</brief_summary>
