	<brief_summary>Presently,the diagnostic method of small hepatocellular carcinoma has been greatly elevated in China.The treatment is being from simplification to diversification,from entirety to individualization.Confronting small hepatocellular carcinoma,we not select simple operation treatment but select a treatment that have more predominance and more fitting with patients in various kinds of treatment methods;including operation ,TACE,PEI,et al.which is better ? There are many arguments.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Randomized Trial Comparing Partial Hepatectomy and TACE Plus PEI for Small Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>randomly put in group standard: 1. via clinical diagnosis and confirm it is primary liver cancer, and not accept any anticancer treatment. 2. age: 18-70 years. 3. early hepatocyte cancer，which is single focus of infection diameter ≤ 3 cm. 4. estimate tumor can gain treatment of curing operation or TACE plus PEI. 5. better liver function (Child-Pugh，class A or B). Case loads: 160 residents with small hepatocellular carcinoma in China Therapeutic regimen: under normal rules, the operation group open abdomen to perform operation through subtotal incision while the patient has been general anesthesia with trachea cannula. The operation range on hepatic tissue of un-tumor tissue around tumor should maintain at least 1cm. As for the micro-create treatment combination group, taking TACE all through arteria cruralies super-elect arteria hepatica and injecting MITO、FUDR、iodipin. By B transonogram guiding to nyxis liver biopsy,and perform per cutem absolute alcohol injection treatment. Research end-point: 1. ensemble life span.To compare 1、2 and 3 year overall survival rate in hepatectomy and TACE plus PEI for small hepatocellular carcinoma 2. intraliver recurrence rate; distant metastasis rate; non-tumor life span; band tumor life span Telephone call at any time</detailed_description>
