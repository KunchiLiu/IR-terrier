	<detailed_description>Severe Mood Dysregulation(SMD) is a new construct in children and adolescents characterized by persistent and non episodic irritability, hyperarousal and emotional reactivity. This is an open label trial using Risperidone in children and adolescents( 7-17 years old) diagnosed with SMD. We hypothesized that Risperidone would improve externalizing symptoms as well as depressive and/or maniac symptomatology. We also consider the effect of the pharmacological intervention in the co-morbid disorders especially ADHD.</detailed_description>
