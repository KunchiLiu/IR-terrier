	<brief_title>Effect of Smoking, Abstention and Nicotine Replacement Therapy on Wound Healing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two wound healing models were applied: the excisional skin biopsy model to study wound histology and the suction blister model to study epidermal regeneration and skin transudate. In addition blood sampling was made to validate compliance to the study arms and to study systemic markers of collagen metabolism and oxidative stress. In addition, wound infections and wound ruptures were recorded post hoc as complications to the excisional skin biopsy model were not expected to occur.</detailed_description>
