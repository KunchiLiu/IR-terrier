	<brief_summary>This open-label, randomized, phase Ib study will assess the safety and efficacy of obinutuzumab given in combination with FC (fludarabine and cyclophosphamide) or CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone) or bendamustine induction chemotherapy in participants with Cluster of Differentiation (CD) 20+ B-cell Follicular Lymphoma (FL). Participants with complete response or partial response after induction therapy may receive maintenance therapy every 3 months for 2 years or until disease progression, whichever comes first. All participants in the induction period of the study will have a safety follow-up visit 28 days after completing the last dose of obinutuzumab + chemotherapy, and will be followed for at least 2 years, unless they are being treated in maintenance or discontinue from the study prior to this time point. Participants who complete/discontinue maintenance therapy will also be followed for a period of 2 years after receiving the last dose of obinutuzumab or until progression/new antilymphoma treatment.</brief_summary>
