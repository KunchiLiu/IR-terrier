	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to, in patients with stable angina pectoris, assess the additional benefit of PCI on top of optimized medical treatment, physical training and smoking cessation with regard to quality of life, achievement of target of treatment and clinical events such as death, acute myocardial infarction, stroke and revascularization.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quality of Life and Target Achievement After Treatment of Patients With Stable Angina Pectoris</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with stable angina pectoris with a significant coronary stenosis will be randomized to optimized medical treatment, physical training and smoking cessation or to optimized medical treatment, physical training, smoking cessation and complimentary treatment with PCI. All patients will be followed up at six months and at one and five years regarding symptoms, blood lipids, systemic blood pressure, physical training status, smoking habits, and maximal exercise ECG. Achievement of target of treatment will be measured by questions regarding the patients' expectation of the treatment at baseline and at a 6 month follow-up. The questions at 6 months will be based on the interviews at inclusion. Furthermore quality of life will be measured with three different measuring instrument; SF-36 short form, Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ), and EQ-5D. These instruments will be given to the patients at baseline, at six months and at the five year follow up.</detailed_description>
