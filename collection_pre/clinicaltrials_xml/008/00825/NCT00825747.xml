	<brief_summary>Senile cataract is managed by cataract extraction and intra-ocular lens (IOL) implantation. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the SeeLens AF, an acrylic hydrophilic aspheric IOL. This lens was designed to reduce vision aberrations and secondary cataract formation rate. Preoperative evaluation: Best corrected visual acuity, refraction, comprehensive slit lamp examination and biometry. Surgical procedure: Cataract surgery using a clear corneal incision (1.8mm to2.4mm), phacoemulsification and implantation of the SeeLens AF to the capsular bag. IOL implantation parameters will be evaluated by the surgeon. Postoperative follow up: Best corrected visual acuity, uncorrected visual acuity, refraction and comprehensive slit lamp examinations up to 3 months after surgery.</brief_summary>
