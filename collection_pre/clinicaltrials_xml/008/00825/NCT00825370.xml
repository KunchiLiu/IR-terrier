C02 measurement greater than 46: In accordance with a number of similar studies that we have performed, four subsets of patients will have their CO2 measured using a handheld capnometer prior to enrollment in the study. If the CO2 measurement is greater than 46, then the patient will be excluded from the study. The 4 subsets are as follows: 1. All patients who have a history of COPD 2. All patients who have a history of sleep apnea 3. All patients who report a history of asthma together with greater than a 20 packyear smoking history 4. All patients reporting less than a 20 packyear smoking history who are having an asthma exacerbation</criteria>
