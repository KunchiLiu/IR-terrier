	<detailed_description>Reflexology (foot massage) is a complementary medicine technique which is performed by manual pressure on specific areas of the feet. Reflexology is based on a system of zones and reflex areas that are believed to reflect an image of the body on the feet with a premise that such work effects a physical change to the body. The effect of reflexology on fatigue, quality of life, and quality of sleep of 20 breast cancer patients during and after radiation therapy will be compared to age-matched control group of 20 breast cancer patients treated by radiation therapy.</detailed_description>
