	<brief_summary>Due to the potential for pregnancy-induced changes in the pharmacokinetics of medication, one cannot assume that the currently licensed doses of the medication to be tested under this protocol lead to adequate exposure in an HIV-infected pregnant woman. For the agents under study no or limited pharmacokinetic data during pregnancy are available. As the changes in pharmacokinetics during pregnancy are most prominent in the third trimester a pharmacokinetic curve will be recorded in the third trimester after attaining steady state.</brief_summary>
