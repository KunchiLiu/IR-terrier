	<brief_summary>Patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) are treated with platelet inhibitors to reduce myocardial infarction and mortality.However, this can increase perioperative bleeding. A retrospective analysis of the data in our institution has revealed a significant increase in transfusion requirements after elective CABG since 5 years. The aim of our study is to observe if this increase in transfusion requirements is due to platelet inhibitors or due to other coagulation abnormalities resulting from other anticoagulants.</brief_summary>
