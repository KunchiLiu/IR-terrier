	<brief_title>Improvement of Periprocedural Guidewire Management for Cardiac Catheterization (PTCA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Before elective cardiac catheterization, patients undergo an ultrasound-guided marking of the bifurcation of the common femoral artery in order to access the vascular complication rate compared tho those of non-marked patients. Concerning the removal of the guided wire, patients will be treated due to a graduated scheme taking care of different risk levels. This procedure should improve clinical routine, but the efficacy and safety have to be assessed. Depending on the risk level, the guide wire will be removed either by an ambulance officer or emergency medical technician, assistant personal of the cardiac catheterization operating room or by a physician specialist in intensive care. Both methods should lead to quality assurance.</detailed_description>
