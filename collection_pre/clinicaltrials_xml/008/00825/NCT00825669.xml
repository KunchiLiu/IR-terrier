	<brief_summary>Hepatectomy is still the treatment of choice for hepatocellular carcinoma. Part of the patients may present portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) after resection. PVTT might lead to upper gastrointestinal bleeding and worsening of hypersplenism which will endanger the life of the patients. PVTT also plays the centre role of recurrence and metastasis of HCC. There is no standard treatment for PVTT yet. We aim to compare the effects of TACE and TACE plus laser ablation for treating patients with PVTT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment of Portal Vein Tumor Thrombus After Hepatocellular Carcinoma Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatectomy is still the treatment of choice for hepatocellular carcinoma, but the prognosis is not agreeable. Part of the patients may present portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) after resection. PVTT might further increase the pressure of portal vein and lead to upper gastrointestinal bleeding and worsening of hypersplenism which will endanger the life of the patients. PVTT also plays the centre role of recurrence and metastasis of HCC. There is no standard treatment available now for PVTT yet. TACE is mostly often used to treat the PVTT. We aim to compare the effects of TACE and TACE plus laser ablation for treating patients with PVTT.</detailed_description>
