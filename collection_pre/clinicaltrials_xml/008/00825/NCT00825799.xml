	<brief_summary>The goal of the study is to validate a biomarker assay for unipolar depression based on serum proteins involved in inflammation, metabolism, and stress response. The study will compare patients with a current major depressive episode to individuals with no history of depression. The hypothesis is that the assay can serve as a diagnostic tool that would be more objective than standard diagnostic questionnaires.</brief_summary>
