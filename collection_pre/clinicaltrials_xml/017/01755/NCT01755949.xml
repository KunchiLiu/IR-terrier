	<brief_summary>Colchicine will lower C-reactive protein (CRP) in chronic atrial fibrillation and reduce the rise in CRP which occurs following atrial fibrillation ablation</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Colchicine and CRP in Atrial Fibrillation and AF Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Three groups of patients will be randomized to colchicine 0.6 mg PO BID or matching placebo: 1. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, pre-ablation 2. Persistent atrial fibrillation, pre-ablation 3. Chronic persistent atrial fibrillation</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Atrial Fibrillation</mesh_term>
	<mesh_term>Colchicine</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Group 1: Persistent or chronic AF presenting for evaluation in cardiology offices. Diagnosis of AF will be made based on the 12 lead surface ECG. Group 2: Paroxysmal AF scheduled to go AF ablation presenting to the electrophysiology laboratory for the procedure in sinus rhythm.. Group 3:Chronic AF scheduled to go clinically indicated AF ablation, and presenting in the electrophysiology laboratory in atrial fibrillation . 1. Abnormal liver function with elevated enzymes&gt; 1.5 times the normal. 2. Abnormal kidney function with glomerular filtration rate &lt; 50 ml/min 3. Increased levels of creatine kinase or known myopathy 4. Neutropenia 5. Known GI disorders 6. Women of childbearing age who have not had surgical sterilization and are not using oral contraceptives, or who's spouse has not had surgical sterilization will be excluded due to the length of the trial and the possibility that they could become pregnant after entry. 7. Pregnant and lactating women 8. Lactose intolerance 9. Known sensitivity, allergy, or contraindication to colchicine use</criteria>
