	<criteria>Subjects and subjects' parent(s)/Legally Acceptable Representative(s) [LAR(s)] who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply, with the requirements of the protocol. A female between, and including, 9 and 25 years of age at the time of the first vaccination. Written informed consent obtained from parents/guardian of the subject and written informed assent obtained from the subject if the subject is less than legal age, or written informed consent obtained from the subject if the subject has achieved legal age. The legal age will be determined according to local regulations in each participating country. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Female subjects of nonchildbearing potential may be enrolled in the study. Nonchildbearing potential is defined as premenarche, current tubal ligation, hysterectomy, ovariectomy or postmenopause. Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the subject: has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period and for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series. Child in care. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product other than the study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose. For corticosteroids, this will be ≥10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed. Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within the period starting 30 days before and ending 30 days after each study dose of vaccine(s), with the exception of licensed inactivated influenza vaccine. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational product or a noninvestigational vaccine/product. Previous vaccination with a meningococcal polysaccharide or conjugate vaccine within the last 10 years. History of meningococcal disease since birth. History of serious allergic reaction following any other DTPcontaining vaccine or any component of the study vaccines. History of encephalopathy within seven days of administration of a previous pertussis antigencontaining vaccine that is not attributable to another identifiable cause. Persons who experienced an Arthustype hypersensitivity reaction following a prior dose of tetanustoxoid containing vaccine should not receive Boostrix unless at least 10 years have elapsed since the last dose of tetanustoxoid containing vaccine. Previous vaccination with a tetanustoxoid containing vaccine within the previous five years. Temperature of ≥ 40.5°C (105°F) within 48 hours of receipt of a previous dose of DTP vaccine (diphtheriatetanuswhole cell pertussis [DTPw] and/or diphtheriatetanusacellular pertussis [DTaP]), not due to another identifiable cause. Collapse or shocklike state within 48 hours of receipt of a previous dose of DTP vaccine. Seizures with or without fever within three days of a previous dose of DTP vaccine. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, based on medical history and history directed physical examination. A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency, until the immune competence of the potential vaccine recipient is demonstrated. History of any allergic disease/reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine(s). Progressive neurologic disorder, unstable neurologic conditions, uncontrolled epilepsy or progressive encephalopathy. History of any neurologic disorders or seizures. A history of ADHD or depression or a history of a single, simple febrile seizure does not exclude a subject. Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness. Previous history of GuillainBarré Syndrome. Bleeding disorders, such as hemophilia or thrombocytopenia, or subjects on anticoagulant therapy. Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period. Previous vaccination against HPV, or planned administration of any HPV vaccine other than that foreseen by the study protocol during the study period. Previous administration of MPL or AS04 adjuvant. History of chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse. Pregnant or lactating female. A subject planning to become pregnant, likely to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions during the study period and up to two months after the last vaccine dose. Subjects must be at least three months postpregnancy and not breastfeeding to enter the study.</criteria>
