	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of consolidation chemotherapy with paclitaxel plus cisplatin (2 cycles per 3 weeks) following radical hysterectomy and adjuvant chemoradiation (2 cycles per 4 weeks) for high risk early stage cervical cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Postoperative Chemoradiotherapy With or Without Consolidation Chemotherapy for Cervical Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cervical carcinoma is one of the most common gynecologic cancers worldwide. Early stage cervical cancer can be treated effectively with either radiotherapy or radical hysterectomy plus pelvic lymph node dissection. However, several pathological risk factors, such as lymph node metastasis, the involvement of vaginal resection margin, and the parametrial invasion, have been identified to compromise the patient prognosis. Concurrent radiotherapy with cisplatin-based chemotherapy has become the standard treatment for patients with cervical cancer. However, many patients with pathological risk factors treated with concurrent radiotherapy plus single agent cisplatin still suffered from the local or distant relapse. How to improve the treatment outcome of these patients is a very important issue and requires further clinical investigation. Paclitaxel has been demonstrated to be a good radiosensitizer. In addition, paclitaxel/cisplatin combination chemotherapy was demonstrated to have superior progression-free survival than platinum alone in some phase Ⅱ studies. In addition, it is not yet known whether chemotherapy and radiation therapy are more effective when given with consolidation chemotherapy in treating cervical cancer. Therefore, the investigators are going to perform the efficacy and safety study of postoperative concurrent paclitaxel/cisplatin chemotherapy and radiotherapy with consolidation chemotherapy in high-risk patients with early-stage cervical cancer following radical hysterectomy.</detailed_description>
