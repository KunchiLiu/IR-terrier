	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies light-scattering spectroscopy in finding disease in patients with stage II-III breast cancer. Diagnostic procedures, such as light-scattering spectroscopy, may help find and diagnose breast cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Light-Scattering Spectroscopy for Detection of Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate whether light-scattering spectroscopy can reliably distinguish between two subject groups: those with clinical stage II or stage III breast cancer and those without breast cancer. OUTLINE: Patients undergo light-scattering spectroscopy of the breast in addition to standard of care as it relates to screening for breast cancer or treatment of breast cancer.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants who are breast cancer free (mammogram "negative" within 1 month of testing) with the absence of clinical suspicion of breast cancer on physical exam or with clinical stage II or stage III breast cancer. PLEASE NOTE: Recruitment for this study is only limited to patients who are scheduled for a mammogram at USC. There is no compensation to participants.
