Arterial oxygen saturation &lt; 75% for &gt; 5% of sleep period time on screening PSG; Occupation or life situation that may impart risk by study participation (e.g. commercial driver, pilot, police officer, fireman); Motor vehicle accident or "nearmiss" related to sleepiness (selfreport) within 2 years of the first dose of study drug (Day 8); Body mass index &gt; 45 kg/m2 Severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) that, based on the clinical judgment of the Investigator, precludes delaying positive airway pressure treatment; History of shift work or rotating shifts within the month prior to the first dose of study drug (Day 8); Prior upper airway surgery for snoring or OSAS as an adult (≥ 18 years of age); Prior noninvasive treatment for OSAS within 6 months prior to the first dose of study drug (Day 8); Major surgery within 6 months prior to the first dose of study drug (Day 8); Bariatric surgery within 2 years prior to the first dose of study drug (Day 8). If postbariatric surgery, weight must be stable ±5% (selfreport) for at least 6 months prior to first dose of study drug (Day 8). Any form of medically managed weight loss program within 6 months prior to the first dose of study drug (Day 8); Significant defect in nasal patency due to anatomical abnormalities or uncontrolled or recurrent episodes of rhinitis; Any clinically significant unstable or progressive medical condition; Any primary sleep disorder other than OSAS as determined by history, physical examination, or Visit 2 PSG (after 7day screening runin period); Clinically significant or uncontrolled: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal, respiratory, pancreatic, hepatic, renal, hematologic, endocrine [including insulindependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM)], neurological, urogenital, connective tissue, dermatological, thyroid, or other medical disorder; Any clinically significant psychiatric disorder; History of seizure disorder; Treatment with any prescription antidepressant medication within 1 month prior to the first dose of study drug (Day 8); Treatment with sedatives, hypnotics or other psychoactive drugs within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug (Day 8); Any complete blood count (CBC) or liver function test (LFT) laboratory value outside the normal range which, in the clinical judgment of the Investigator renders a subject inappropriate for randomization to treatment; Pregnancy [as demonstrated by positive urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test] or lactation; Allergic to cannabinoids or sesame oil; History of substance abuse (including alcohol abuse or dependence) or laboratory evidence of drug abuse on the Visit 1 drugscreening panel; Use of dietary supplements which in the judgment of the Investigator may impact sleep or breathing behaviors; Average daily caffeine consumption &gt; 500 mg/day (~5 cups of coffee); Average weekly alcohol consumption &gt; 10 units; Unwillingness to abstain from caffeine and alcohol on all days when overnight or daytime testing will be performed; Participation in any other investigational protocol within the 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug (Day 8); Any condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, places the patient at unacceptable risk if he or she were to participate in the study.</criteria>
