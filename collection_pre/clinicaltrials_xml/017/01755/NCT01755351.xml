	<brief_summary>An effective treatment adherence was a key to make the treatment success, some reports had shown that psychologicl factors impact patients adherence seriously,however, in China, the researches were only limited to depression and diabetes,diabetes distress was neglected. Some western studies had demonstrated the impact of diabetes distress on diabetes. Thus, we hypothesized that: 1.perhaps our present depression-oriented health education was inadequate to promote patients' adherence, diabetes distress might played a more important part than depression in patients' treatment adherence. 2. there might be a high prevalence of diabetes distress in Chinese type 2 diabetes; so, the comparative study between diabetes distress and depresion was conducted. Objectives: to explore the relationship of diabetes-related distress and depressionï¼Œand to compare the influence of diabetes distress and depression on treatment adherence in Chinese type 2 diabetes . Research design and method:we surveyed 200 type 2 diabetic patients from 2 third-class hospitals using the Diabetes Distress Scale, Zung Self-rating Depression Scale, and Revised Treatment Adherence in Diabetes Questionnaire (RADQ)simultaneously.</brief_summary>
