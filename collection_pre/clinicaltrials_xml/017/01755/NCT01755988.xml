	<brief_summary>The number of people with heart failure is increasing in the western world. Mainly due to better treatment of myocardial infarctions and ageing of the population. The amount of health care workers is unfortunately not increasing. We want to investigate how two electronic devices (a website and an interactive web-based platform) influence the self-care, quality of life, hospitalizations and mortality by delivering care from a distance. We also want to investigate if a higher quality of care is delivered despite of less frequent visits to a nurse and/or doctor. The study takes place in the Netherlands and is a randomized trial. Patients with heart failure, registered by an outpatient heart failure clinic or general practitioner can take part. They will be randomized to 3 groups: group 1 receives standard care, group 2 receives standard care with the website, group 3 receives an adjusted care pathway, with both the website and the interactive web-based platform connected to a telemonitoring system. In this group all routine consultations with heart failure nurses and general practitioner will be substituted by this device.</brief_summary>
