	<brief_summary>This is an open study of the use of AdimFlu-V (2012-2013 season) vaccine in young healthy subjects. Subjects aged equal to or over 9 years old and less than 18 years old will receive one dose of vaccine (0.5 mL) by intramuscular injection into the upper arm. Subjects aged equal to or over 3 years old and less than 9 years old will received two doses of vaccine (0.5 mL) by intramuscular injection into the upper arm separated by 4 weeks (28 days). Safety outcomes included immediate reactions at the time of vaccination, solicited local and systemic reactions within 7 days after each vaccination, unsolicited adverse events observed since first vaccination to 28 days after the last dose of vaccination, and serious adverse events during the observation. Sera prepared from blood samples will be collected from each subject immediately prior to, and 4 weeks after each vaccination. Anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody titers will be determined using the WHO hemagglutination inhibition reference technique. The central laboratory who is responsible for antibody titrations will not be aware of the background of blood samples (e.g., pre- or post-serum), it is also called observer-blinded. All subjects will be followed, either by clinical visit or by telephone contact, for 8 weeks after the last vaccination for safety reasons.</brief_summary>

Treatment with an investigational drug or device, or participation in a clinical study, within 3 months before study vaccination; 9. Immunodeficiency, or under immunosuppressive treatment; 10. Receipt of live virus vaccine within 1 month prior to study vaccination or expect receipt within 1 month of study vaccination; receipt of any inactivated vaccine within 2 weeks prior to study vaccination or expected receipt within 1 month of study vaccination; 11. Receipt of any blood products, including immunoglobulin in the prior 3 months; 12. Underlying condition in the investigators' opinion may interfere with evaluation of the vaccine; 13.
