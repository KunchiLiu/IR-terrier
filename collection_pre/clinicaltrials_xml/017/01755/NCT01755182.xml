	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to verify if adding a locoregional treatment of liver metastasis (with trans-arterial embolization-TAE) to medical treatments of proven efficacy can prolong the progression free survival of patients affected by neuroendocrine tumors (NET) with inoperable liver metastases</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of NET of gastroenteropancreatic (GEP), pulmonary or unknown primary site origin Unresectable liver metastases, according the judgment of surgeon, (the reasons for the opinion of surgeon should be made explicit) Hepatic involvement ≤50% volume of the organ Radiological evidence of hepatic lesions (contemporaneous progression or appearance of extrahepatic lesions are allowed if not critical sites) that require change or initiation of systemic pharmacotherapy Patients undergoing , previously treated , or never treated with systemic medical therapy are eligible Patients with or without carcinoid syndrome are eligible Well (G1) or medium (G2) differentiated histology (according to WHO 2010 classification) Ki67 ≤ 20% (G1G2) Life expectancy &gt; 6 months Age ≥ 18 and &lt; 80 years Previous locoregional postsurgical treatment Poorly differentiated histology Severe concomitant morbidities such as: severe coagulopathy, severe liver failure (to be detailed), renal failure (creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dl) and heart failure (NYHA 34 or unstable ischemic heart disease), contraindicating the interventional procedure or influencing the general prognosis (Investigator to provide details of exclusion) Extrahepatic metastasis in critical locations as: brain, spinal cord, lung with respiratory impairment, symptomatic vertebral lesions Patients with only extrahepatic lesions</criteria>
