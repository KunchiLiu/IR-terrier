	<brief_title>Effect of Steroids on Cerebral Inflammation and Neuronal Damage After Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In a previous study we found that patients undergoing aortic valve surgery had elevated cerebrospinal inflammatory markers. In this study we aim to investigate if this inflammatory response can be reduced after treatment with steroids. 20 patients will be randomized to intraoperative treatment with either placebo or methylprednisolone 15mg/kg. CSF and blood will be collected the day before and the day after surgery, analyzed for markers of inflammation (IL-6, IL-8), neuronal damage (S-100) and blood brain barrier function (alb).</detailed_description>
