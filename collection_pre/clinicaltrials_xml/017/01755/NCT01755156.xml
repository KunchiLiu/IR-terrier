	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of omarigliptin compared to placebo in participants with inadequate glycemic control on metformin monotherapy. The primary hypothesis is that after 24 weeks, the addition of treatment with omarigliptin provides greater reduction in hemoglobin A1c (A1C) than placebo.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of the Addition of Omarigliptin (MK-3102) to Participants With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Who Have Inadequate Glycemic Control on Metformin Therapy (MK-3102-024)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants received blinded omarigliptin or matching placebo to omarigliptin for 104 weeks. During the first 24 weeks (Phase A) they did not receive any other blinded study medication. In Phase B (subsequent 80 weeks), participants who did not initiate glycemic rescue in Phase A received additional blinded study medication: participants in the omarigliptin group received placebo to glimepiride and participants in the placebo group received glimepiride.</detailed_description>
