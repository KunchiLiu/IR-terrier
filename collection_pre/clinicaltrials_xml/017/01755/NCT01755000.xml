	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test how practical it is to use the Ultrasonic Cardiac Output Monitor (USCOM), an FDA-approved device, on oncology patients (specifically those with blood cancers). Additionally, the researchers will learn if the USCOM gives additional information about patients' conditions when their blood pressures drop and they are treated with intravenous fluids.</brief_summary>
