	<brief_title>Anticoagulation With Rivaroxaban in Cardioversion -The ARC Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient who are electrically cardioverted require 1 month of anticoagulation (blood thinner). Rivaroxaban a Xa-inhibitor has been shown to be non-inferior to Warfarin (Vit K antagonist) the current standard of care in many treatment areas. Rivaroxaban will be compared to Warfarin historical control group studying the safety and efficacy in electrically cardioverted patients.</detailed_description>
