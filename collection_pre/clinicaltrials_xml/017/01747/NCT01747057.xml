	<brief_summary>Our hypothesis is that hemodynamic fluid resuscitation guided by dynamic parameters will improve outcome in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, by limiting the deleterious effects of fluid overload.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monitoring Resuscitation in Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate the efficacy of dynamic parameters versus static measures to guide fluid resuscitation we pretend to detect a 10% relative reduction in mortality. In addition, we pretend to observe an improvement on the length of resuscitation time, mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support-free days, ICU and hospital length of stay, organ failure and renal function.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age &gt; 18 years Clinical evidence of sepsis (microbiology confirmation, radiological or direct view pus in biological fluid or surgical direct view). ≥ 2 SIRS criteria: Temperature &lt; 36.0°C or &gt; 38.0°C Heart rate &gt; 90 bpm Respiratory rate &gt; 20 rpm or PaCO2 &lt; 32 mmHg or need of mechanical ventilation. Leukocytes &gt; 12.0 x109/L or &lt; 4.0 x109/L Hemodynamic insufficiency defined as (at least one of the following): Sustained systemic hypotension (systolic arterial pressure ≤ 90 mmHg or MAP &lt; 65 mmHg) or a decrease in MAP of &gt; 30 mm Hg in a hypertensive patient. Need of vasopressors. Tachycardia (HR &gt; 110 bpm) or bradycardia (HR &lt; 55 bpm) Acute onset of oliguria, defined as a decreased urine output &lt; 0.5 ml/kg/hr for ≥ 2 hours Serum lactate &gt; 2 mmol/l Peripheral cyanosis, mottled skin, prolonged capillary refill Mechanical ventilation without any kind of inspiratory effort and Vt 710 mL/Kg, Pplateau &lt; 30 mmH2O. Those patients with ARDS under mechanical ventilation will need to tolerate a tidal volume of at least 7 mL/Kg during 30 seconds while the plateau pressure remains &lt; 30 mmH2O.
