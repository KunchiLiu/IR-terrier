	<brief_summary>The iFRCT study is a prospective, multicenter study to evaluate the diagnostic performance of iFRCT with the use of ≥64-detector row CT scanners for the detection and exclusion of significant obstructive coronary artery disease, defined by invasive fractiona flow reserve (FFR) as the reference standard.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Determination of Instantaneous Wave-Free Ratio by Computed Tomography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Noninvasive fractional flow reserve (FFR) computed from CT (FFRCT) is a novel method for determining the physiologic significance of coronary artery disease (CAD), and several clinical trials have revealed that the FFRCT has a good correlation with invasive FFR, also use of noninvasive FFRCT plus Computed Tomography (CT ) among stable patients with suspected or known CAD was associated with improved diagnostic accuracy and discrimination vs CT alone for the diagnosis of hemodynamically significant CAD. The cornerstone of FFR is the linear relationship between pressure and flow under conditions of constant (and minimized) intracoronary resistance, so is FFRCT. Under such conditions, pressure and flow are assumed to be directly proportional, and a decrease in pressure across a stenosis reflects a decrease in blood flow to the dependent myocardium. However, even after administration of potent pharmacologic agents such as adenosine, intracoronary resistance is not static, but instead fluctuates in a phasic pattern throughout the cardiac cycle. In addition, for patients who are allergic to pharmacologic agents or with sever lesions which response little to pharmacologic agents, the measurement of FFR is challenging and the lesion are always underestimated. The ADVISE trial revealed that intracoronary resistance is naturally constant and minimized during the wave-free period. The instantaneous wave-free ratio calculated over this period produces a drug-free index of stenosis severity comparable to FFR. But whether iFR calculated from Computed Tomography(iFRCT) is comparable to FFRCT or FFR, and its diagnostic performance remains unknown. Thus the investigators conduct this trial to assess the diagnostic performance of Instantaneous Wave-Free Ratio for diagnosis of hemodynamically significant coronary stenosis. Instantaneous Wave-Free Ratio calculated from reconstructed heart model.Wave-intensity analysis identified a wave-free period in which intracoronary resistance at rest is similar in variability and magnitude.The investigators define the resting distal-to-proximal pressure ratio during this period as the instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR).</detailed_description>
