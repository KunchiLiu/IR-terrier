	<brief_summary>Doctors at the Cross Cancer Institute have developed a new method of producing 99mTc Pertechnetate in a cyclotron unit. A study done at the Cross Cancer Institute in 2011 with ten patients using this imaging agent showed that it was safe and produced images with the same pattern as generator produced Pertechnetate. This study is now being done in larger numbers of patients to again show that the imaging pattern of both agents is the same, and to again demonstrate its safety.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To demonstrate the efficacy of cyclotron-produced Tc-99m pertechnetate (C-PERT; manufactured by the Edmonton PET Centre/ERC) in comparison to generator-produced Tc-99m pertechnetate (G-PERT; from approved commercial source; using qualitative and quantitative clinical imaging biodistribution data.</detailed_description>
