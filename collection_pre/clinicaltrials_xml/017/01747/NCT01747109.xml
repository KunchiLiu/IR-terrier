	<brief_summary>Oro-tracheal intubation in intensive unit care(ICU) in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure after crash induction remains a critical event. The aim of this study is to determine whether Nasal High Flow Therapy (HFT) Optiflow ® is more efficient than the face mask for preoxygenation before orotracheal intubation after crash induction in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Benefits of Optiflow® Device for Preoxygenation Before Intubation in Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure : The PREOXYFLOW Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be designed as followed : Patients will be randomized in 2 groups :"PREOXYFLOW" or "STANDARD FACE MASK". Patients randomized in "PREOXYFLOW" group will received a four minutes preoxygenation period with Nasal High Flow Therapy (HFT) (60 l/mn FIO2 = 1) before orotracheal intubation under laryngoscopy after crash induction. Patients randomized in "STANDARD FACE MASK" group will received a four minutes preoxygenation period with standard face mask (15 l/mn) before orotracheal intubation under laryngoscopy after crash induction</detailed_description>
