	<brief_summary>Use of sedation is often required in endoscopic procedures such as ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography). However, assessment of the level of sedation during these procedures is not investigated in detail. The purpose of this study is to compare different sedation scales and bispectral index during sedation in endoscopic procedures in order to find the best suited assessment method for sedation under these conditions.</brief_summary>
