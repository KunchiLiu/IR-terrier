	<brief_summary>DXA scanners are routinely used to assess bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture risk in osteoporosis patients. They provide detailed bone imaging in a low radiation setting. Hologic manufactures scanners that are able to perform high definition instant vertebral fracture assessment (HD-IVA) used to screen at-risk patients for asymptomatic spine fractures instantly and reliably at the same time they are having their yearly BMD. We wish to investigate whether this same proven technology (HD-IVA scan mode) used on femurs (the scan mode is now called SE Femur scans) can be used to screen for atypical fractures of the femur in patients at risk for these debilitating fractures. In this proof of concept study, we propose to examine whether DXA scanners can provide a sensitive low radiation screening method to identify incomplete AFFs in patients with known incomplete AFFs and in patients at risk.</brief_summary>
