	<brief_summary>Evaluation of the diagnostic performance of PET / CT with 68Ga-DOTANOC in Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors with comparison with other techniques used in routine clinical practice (octreoscan ® ; multiphase SPECT / CT, MRI or endoscopy). Therapeutic impact and safety of PET / CT with 68Ga-DOTANOC will also be assessed. Expected results are a confirmation of the superiority of 68Ga-PET DOTANOC versus scintigraphy octreoscan ®, with a potential impact on the therapeutic management of patients.</brief_summary>

However, a shorter period may be observed to avoid to do again the initial assessment exams. malignancy except basal cell cancers and cancer in situ of the cervix Contraindication of injection of a contrast agent necessary for the production of multiphase scanner.
