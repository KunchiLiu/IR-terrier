	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to estimate the burden of disease due to pneumococci, other bacteria and viruses in the African meningitis belt prior to pneumococcal conjugate vaccine introduction and to estimate the population impact of the vaccine after its implementation in 2014. In a defined population of a sanitary district in northern Togo, during the period 2010 to 2017, investigators enroll patients of all ages with suspected pneumonia requiring hospitalization or suspected bacterial meningitis. Patients are evaluated by bacteriology and molecular biology techniques on blood, cerebro-spinal fluid, nasal aspirates and by chest X-ray.</brief_summary>
