	<brief_summary>Light-emitting diode Therapy (LEDT) has been used to improve human muscle performance in experimental models and human researches. Now, the investigators used LEDT to increase muscle performance of professional athletes with high performance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Phototherapy by Light-emitting Diode Therapy (LEDT) on Clinical, Biochemical and Biomechanical of Muscle Performance in Athletes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study assessed muscle performance by vertical jump (height of jump and muscle power); creatine kinase; lactate; metabolism by resonance nuclear magnetic in urine; oxygen uptake (VO2) and its onset kinetic response.</detailed_description>
