	<brief_summary>The novel urine LAM point-of-care strip test offers potential clinical utility to improve TB diagnosis in HIV co-infected patients. Urine LAM strip test performance improves with increasing illness severity and more advanced immunosuppression, thus offering the greatest potential utility in hospitalised HIV-infected patients with advanced immunosuppression (CD4 cell count less than 200). However, in the context of high rates of empiric treatment and the availability of other novel TB diagnostics, the clinical impact of the urine LAM strip test is unknown. This study will investigate the impact of the urine LAM strip test. The study hypothesis is that the urine LAM strip test, when combined with standard TB diagnostics (smear microscopy and culture) will significantly improve TB treatment-related outcomes (TB-related mortality, morbidity and length of hospital stay) in HIV-infected hospitalized patients when compared to standard TB diagnostics alone.</brief_summary>
