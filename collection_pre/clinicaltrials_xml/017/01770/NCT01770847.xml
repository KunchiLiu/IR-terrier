	<brief_summary>Diurnal variations in the cardiovascular system apparent in healthy individuals, are different in chronic kidney disease patients. Therefore, diurnal variations in arterial stiffness may also differ in chronic kidney disease patients. This study aims to identify and evaluate diurnal variations in arterial stiffness in chronic kidney disease patients and compare them to those in age matched healthy controls.</brief_summary>
