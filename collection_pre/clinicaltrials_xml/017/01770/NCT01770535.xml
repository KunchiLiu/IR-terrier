	<brief_title>Oxford Ovarian Cancer Predict Chemotherapy Response 01</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While paclitaxel is very effective in killing cancer cells in a proportion of patients, some patients don't respond to this treatment. As with any chemotherapy, paclitaxel is associated with unpleasant side effects. We are doing this study to try and understand what is happening in cancer cells in different individuals after paclitaxel treatment that make them respond differently to the same treatment. We hope that this study will enable us to develop a method to identify women who are suitable for this form of treatment. We also want to understand why some cancer cells don't get killed with paclitaxel. This information will help us to select treatment to suit an individual patient, and thus improve the outcome of treatment and avoid giving treatment that will not benefit the patient.</detailed_description>
