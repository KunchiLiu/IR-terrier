	<detailed_description>This study will be conducted in two phases. During the Feasibility Phase, specimens from any tumor will be sent to the central DiaTech MiCK assay laboratory to determine the ease of sample acquisition, processing, transport, and assay interpretation. Once DiaTech has completed analyses for the feasibility phase specimens and has confirmed that the sample acquisition, processing, transport, and assay interpretation are appropriate, we will proceed with the Demonstration Phase. During the Mesothelioma Demonstration Phase, 20 mesothelioma samples will be assayed and the results will be correlated with prior patient therapy, performance status, and extent of disease.</detailed_description>
