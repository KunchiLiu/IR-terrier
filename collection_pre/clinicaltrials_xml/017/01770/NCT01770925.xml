	<brief_title>Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (n-CPAP) Versus Nasal Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (n-BiPAP) for RDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim of this study is to compare the impact of early extubation to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (n-CPAP) versus nasal Bilevel positive airway pressure (n-BiPAP) on the need for mechanical ventilation via endotracheal tube (MVET) to 7 days of age or less in preterm infants &lt;34 weeks' gestation requiring intubation and surfactant if indicated for respiratory distress syndrome within 60 min of delivery . Second aim is to compare different outcomes of post-extubation n-CPAP and n-BiPAP.</detailed_description>
