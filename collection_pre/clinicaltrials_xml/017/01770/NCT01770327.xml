	<brief_title>Influence of Different Sugary Beverages on Thirst Sensation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants should be in the laboratory at 8.00 in order to collect the values of weight, height, total body water, intracellular water and extracellular water in a Segmental Multi Frequency Body Composition Monitor (TANITA MC 180 MAÂ®). Then, a blood sample will be collected for analysis of blood glucose, osmolality and plasmatic sodium. They will sit at individual tables for the duration of the session and were allowed to read, listen to music with earphones, or use their portable computers with the exception of internet access to minimize visual cues (e.g., unwanted publicity for beverages or visiting Web sites showing pictures of food and drinks), which may have effect on thirst. Breakfast will be served at 9.30 on every occasion and preload stimuli will be offered exactly 60 minutes after breakfast (at 10.30). Lunch will be provided at 13.00. Motivational ratings will be first obtained at the end of collection of blood sample (baseline or time 0) and every 30 minutes thereafter until the lunch time (times 1 through 7). After lunch (time 8), participants will complete the last set of ratings and will bring a food diary to record all food and fluid intake until 00.00 that day.</detailed_description>
