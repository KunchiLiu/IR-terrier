	<brief_summary>The time window for intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator treatment in ischemic stroke patients has been extended to 4.5h. Little is known about intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator use in the 3-4.5 hour time window among Chinese stroke patients. This exploratory study was to describe the feasibility and outcome of treatment with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in the expanded time window, and to offer suggestions for future clinical work in China.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outcome of Intravenous Thrombolysis for Stroke Patients in the 3-4.5 Hour Time Window</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Favorable clinical outcome of intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator was assessed by absolute changes in the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score at 24 hours and by the improvement of modified Rankin Scale score at discharge or 6-month follow-up. The safety of intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator was assessed by the rate of mortality, intracerebral hemorrhage and other common complications. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate factors associated with favorable clinical outcome.</detailed_description>
