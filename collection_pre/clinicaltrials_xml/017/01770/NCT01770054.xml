	<brief_title>Prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome in Atahualpa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several studies have shown that the occurrence of the metabolic syndrome is a risk factor for the development of cerebrovascular and ischemic heart disease. To evaluate the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome, we will invite all Atahualpa residents aged 40 years or more to participate in this study. For the purposes of this study we will obtain the waist circumference of all individuals, will measure their blood pressure using a standard protocol, and will take a blood sample to determine fasting glucose levels, HDL cholesterol levels, triglyceride levels, and plasma insulin levels.</detailed_description>
