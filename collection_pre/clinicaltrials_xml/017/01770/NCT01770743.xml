	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Safety and Immunogenicity Study for an Anthrax Vaccine Using 3 Schedules and Two Dose Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The safety and immunogenicity of AV7909 for post-exposure prophylaxis of anthrax will be evaluated using a randomized, parallel-group, active-controlled, double-blind design with three immunization schedules and two dose levels in healthy adult volunteers. Safety will be assessed by clinical laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis), monitoring of adverse events, vital signs, and physical examinations. Reactogenicity (systemic and injection site reactions) will be assessed by the subjects using subject e-diaries for 7 days after each immunization and by the investigator at in-clinic visits 7 and 14 days after each immunization, and at other visits, if applicable. Immunogenicity will be measured as toxin neutralizing antibody (TNA) response and seroconversion rates.</detailed_description>
