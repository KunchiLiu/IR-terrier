	<brief_summary>This is a non-interventional multi-center study (NIS) in adult patients with AML in first complete remission with measurable minimal residual disease (MRD). Patients are eligible when gene status was already determined for previous induction and consolidation therapy of AML and showed carrier of NPM1, CBFÎ²-MYH11, or MLL-AF9 mutation. The study objective is to observe the impact of pre-emptive therapy with histamine dihydrochloride (HDC) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) with regard to assess leukemia-free survival/time to relapse and to monitor MRD level trend over time. HDC and IL-2 are approved drugs for AML patients in first complete remission. Therapy is administered for 10 treatment cycles as outlined in the Summary of Product Characteristics.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient eligibility criteria in accordance to the summary of Product Characteristics: Patients with confirmed diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification (including de novo AML, tAML and sAML) in first complete remission (defined as less than 5% blasts in a normocellular bone marrow assessed prior to the treatment start) AMLSG BiO participation incl. favourable opinion Presence of NPM1 mutation, CBFBMYH11 or MLLAF9 fusion genes as assessed in one of the central AMLSG reference laboratories. Measurable MRD values (nonnegative values after consolidation therapy or increase in values over the threshold during followup in complete remission) The patient must be informed of the observation and written informed consent regarding data privacy obtained. Consent for registration, storage and processing of the individual diseasecharacteristics and course as well as information of the family physician and all other treating physicians about observation participation No continuing systemic treatment with clonidine, steroids, and/or H2 receptor blocking agents.</criteria>
