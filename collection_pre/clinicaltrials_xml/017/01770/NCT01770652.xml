	<brief_summary>Multi-center, non-randomized, open-label, single-dose, parallel group study to determine the effect of impaired renal function on the PK of deferiprone and its 3-O-glucuronide metabolite following a single oral dose of 33mg/kg Ferriprox®.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open-label, Non-randomized, Parallel Group Study in Subjects With Mild, Moderate, Severe, or No Renal Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-marketing study to evaluate the effect of impaired renal function on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of deferiprone and its 3-O-glucuronide metabolite and on the safety of Ferriprox® in subjects with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment as compared to healthy volunteers.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Main All subjects: 1. Adult males or females, 18 75 years of age (inclusive); 2. Body weight ≥ 45 kg; 3. Body mass index (BMI) range of approximately 18.532 kg/m^2 (inclusive); 4. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of &gt;1.5x10^9/L; Healthy volunteers: 1. Medically healthy with clinically insignificant screening results (e.g., laboratory profiles, medical history, vital signs, physical examination); 2. eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73m^2; Renally impaired subjects: 1. Considered clinically stable in the opinion of the Investigator; 2. Subjects with mild renal impairment (eGFR 6089 mL/min/1.73m^E2) OR moderate renal impairment (eGFR 3059 mL/min/1.73m^2) OR severe renal impairment (eGFR 1529 mL/min/1.73m^2). Main 1. History of renal transplant; 2. Subjects undergoing any method of dialysis; 3. History or presence of clinically unstable significant respiratory, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal (except for subjects assigned to one of the renally impaired groups), hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, neurologic, or psychiatric disease; 4. Disorders or surgery of the gastrointestinal tract which may interfere with drug absorption or may otherwise influence the PK of the investigational medicinal product (e.g. cholecystectomy, resections of the small or large intestine, febrile conditions, chronic diarrhea, chronic vomiting, endocrine disease, severe infections, acute inflammations, etc.); 5. Clinically significant abnormalities on 12lead ECG (e.g., QTcF≥430 ms in males or ≥450 ms in females); 6. Evidence of liver damage: hepatitis B and C; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) that is considered clinically significant by the Investigator; 7. Participation in another clinical trial within 28 days prior to the study drug administration;</criteria>
