	<brief_title>A Study to Determine if Aquamin (as AquaCal and AquaPT) Improves Digestive Discomfort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Digestive discomfort includes gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, altered bowel habit, flatulence and bloating and can sometimes result from slower intestinal transit and other digestive irregularities. Digestive discomfort may lead to health issues in the long-term. In a recent survey of over 1,000 women in the UK, 88% reported having experienced digestive discomfort from time to time, but the majority of them (70%) had never consulted a doctor or nurse. Digestive discomfort is often a source of embarrassment for people; they therefore may be reluctant to address these issues with a healthcare professional. Aquamin is a seaweed-derived mineral source, which is rich in calcium, magnesium and 74 other trace minerals including zinc, iron and selenium. It is produced from the red algae, Lithothamnion Calcareum, which is found in just three locations in the world, including the south-west coast of Ireland and Iceland. During a five-year life span, these algae absorb essential minerals from the sea - this gives Aquamin its unique multimineral content. The algae then break down naturally and settle on the sea bed. These calcified skeletal remains are harvested, washed, dried and milled and provided in a capsule formulation. Aquamin is proven to deliver digestive health benefits. In a recent study, mice feed on a high-fat 'Western-style' diet (HFWD) and Aquamin, suppressed colon polyp formation and a reduction in systemic inflammatory changes in comparison to those not receiving Aquamin. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of consuming Aquamin (as AquaCal and AquaPT) on digestive discomfort and symptoms amongst adults without diagnosed gastrointestinal disorders.</detailed_description>

Be a nonpregnant female. 4. Be in generally good health as determined by the investigator. 5. Have no evidence of gastrointestinal disease or of a functional gastrointestinal disorder as determined by the Bowel Disease Questionnaire. 6. Experience occasional bloating and stomach discomfort, defined as 12 times/weeks, but not greater that 2 times/week over the last 3 months. Subjects will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the below criteria; 1. Are less than 18 and greater than 65 years of age. 2. Are pregnant females. 3. Are currently taking probiotics, vitamin supplements or plant sterols ester supplements or have taken them in the past 14 days. 4. Have received a diagnosis or attending a doctor for Irritable Bowel Syndrome or a functional bowel disorder. 5. Experience bloating, flatulence and stomach discomfort greater that 2 times/week, over the last 3 months. 6. Have a significant acute or chronic coexisting illness (cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, endocrinological, immunological, metabolic or any condition which contraindicates, in the investigators judgement, entry to the study). 7. Prior gastrointestinal surgery (apart from appendicectomy and hernia repair) or recent unexplained bleeding. 8. Having a condition or taking a medication that the investigator believes would interfere with the objectives of the study, pose a safety risk or confound the interpretation of the study results; to include antiinflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, laxatives, enemas, antibiotics (within 1 month), probiotics, anticoagulants, vitamin supplements and overthe counter nonsteroidal analgesics. 9. Be a smoker 10. Suffer from alcohol abuse. 11. Suffer from psychiatric disease. 12. Subjects are lactose intolerant or have dietary habits (slimming or vegetarian diet) which could interfere with the assessment of the study product. 13. Individuals who, in the opinion of the investigator, are considered to be poor attendees or unlikely for any reason to be able to comply with the trial. 14. Subjects may not be receiving treatment involving experimental drugs. 15. If the subject has been in a recent experimental trial, these must have been completed not less than 30 days prior to this study. 16. Have a malignant disease or any concomitant endstage organ disease</criteria>
