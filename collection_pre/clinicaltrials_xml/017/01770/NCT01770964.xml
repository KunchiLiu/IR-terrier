	<brief_summary>The difference between active treatment and placebo in a clinical trial of an analgesic appears to depend on a variety of factors other than the actual efficacy of the drug itself, including various aspects of study design and conduct. One potential such factor is how information about the study is presented to research staff and patients. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of different presentations of information on the difference between pregabalin and placebo observed in a clinical trial in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy.</brief_summary>
