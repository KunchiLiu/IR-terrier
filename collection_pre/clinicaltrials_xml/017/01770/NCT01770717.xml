	<brief_summary>Pressure ulcers are a significant problem in institutionalized, elderly, and critically ill patients. Pressure ulcers result in significant pain, changing quality of life, and often leading to significant morbidity and prolonged hospital stays, and ultimately increased the healthcare cost. According to the International Pressure Ulcer Prevalence Survey, the prevalence of hospital acquired pressure ulcers in the United States was 13.5% in 2008 and 12.8% in 2009. This survey also indicated that the highest rate of pressure ulcers is in the long term acute care population (22%).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of the Potential for Pressure Ulcer Formation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Researchers developed a non-contact optical imaging technology call Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging which can identify the tissue regions that are at risk of developing pressure ulcers prior to development of irreversible tissue damage. The Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging can identify metabolic and biochemical differences in the tissues near bony prominences which are at risk for developing pressure ulcers.</detailed_description>
