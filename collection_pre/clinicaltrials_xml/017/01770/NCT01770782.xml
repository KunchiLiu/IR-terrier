	<brief_title>Orthodontic Retention on the Maxillary Stability After SARME Using Laser Scanner</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods: Ninety digitized dental casts of 30 adult patients (18 males and 12 females) submitted to SARME using the Hyrax expansion appliance were evaluated. Patients were distributed into two groups: Group Without Retention (GSC) n = 15; and Group With Retention (GCC) n = 15. In the GCC group, a Transpalatal Arch (TPA) was installed for retention soon after removal of the expander. The dental casts were scanned using a Vivid 9i 3D laser scanner (Konica Minolta, Wayne, NJ). The plaster models were performed preoperatively (T1), 4 months after the expander was removed (T2), and 10 months after the end of the expansion (T3). The distances measured were Inter-Cusps of Premolars and Molars (Inter-Cusp PM) (Inter-Cusp M), Inter-Cervicals of Premolars and Molars (Inter-Cervical PM) (Inter-Cervical M), Inter-WALA edges of Premolars and Molars (PM Inter-BW) (BW Inter-M), palatal height at the molar, and palatal area and volume at T1, T2, and T3.</detailed_description>
