	<brief_summary>Individuals who have a mild stroke have a 44% risk of dying from a second stroke within 10 years which is in large part due to the cyclical relationship of chronic disease, poor health, and mild stroke which has gone largely unnoticed in the United States. Self-management intervention has been proven to be an effective intervention to increase healthy behaviors, improve overall health status, decrease healthcare utilization/cost, decrease depressive symptoms, and improve participation in people with a variety of chronic conditions; however, it has never be used with individuals with mild stroke. The critical next step and goal of this study is to evaluate if self-management intervention will improve health outcomes for persons with mild stroke. The overall hypothesis of this study is that self-management intervention will improve outcomes in the mild-stroke population.</brief_summary>
