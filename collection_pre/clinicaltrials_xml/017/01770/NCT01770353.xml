	<brief_title>Pilot Study to Determine Biodistribution of MM-398 and Feasibility of Ferumoxytol as a Tumor Imaging Agent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is conducted over two phases. The pilot phase of this trial is closed. The expansion phase of this trial is currently open to enrollment. Pilot Phase: This study will enroll approximately 12 patients, up to 20 in total in the Pilot Phase and 30 patients in the Expansion Phase. The first three patients that are enrolled can have any solid tumor type; however subsequent patients must have NSCLC, CRC, TNBC, ER/PR positive breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma or head and neck cancer. No more than three patients with ER/PR positive breast cancer can be enrolled in the Pilot Phase and similar restrictions may be placed on other tumor types to ensure a heterogeneous population. Expansion Phase: The expansion will enroll patients with advanced metastatic breast cancer into three cohorts: Cohort 1: ER and/or PR-positive breast cancer Cohort 2: TNBC Cohort 3: BC with active brain metastasis</detailed_description>
