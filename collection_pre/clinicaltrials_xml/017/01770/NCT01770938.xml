	<brief_summary>Muscle performance is largely influenced by modulations in gene expressions of muscle tissue. In this context, light-emitting diode therapy (LEDT) has been used to improve muscle performance in experimental models and human researches. Thereby, the investigators examined modulations in gene expression of muscle tissue as well as biochemical, biomechanic and histologic adaptations influenced by exercise associated to LEDT.</brief_summary>
