	<brief_summary>The Investigators decided to examine whether the Paula method is more effective than Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT) in terms of urinary leakage amount, as it measured by pad test in menopause women without an hormonal therapy. In addition to the pad test and two urinary incontinence questionnaires, we will use other assessment tools such as; quality of life and sexual function which have been found to correlate significantly with pad test results. These results may indicate that menopausal women with Stress Urinary Incontinence may be more successful controlling incontinence if they will practice the Paula method as compared to PFMT.</brief_summary>
