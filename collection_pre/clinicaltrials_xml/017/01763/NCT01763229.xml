	<brief_title>The Practical Use of Transthoracic Echocardiography for Obtaining an Optimal Depth of Internal Jugular Venous Catheters in Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients scheduled for surgery for congenital heart disease younger than 12 months were studied. Following successful catheter insertion, the insertion depth was determined using transthoracic echocardiography.
