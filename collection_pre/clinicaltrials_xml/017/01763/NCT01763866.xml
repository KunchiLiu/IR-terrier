	<brief_summary>The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of 12 weeks of evolocumab administered subcutaneously every 2 weeks (Q2W) and monthly (QM) when used in combination with a statin, compared with placebo, on percent change from baseline in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prior to the first randomization, participants entered a screening period to determine eligibility. During screening, all participants received subcutaneous placebo corresponding to the once monthly dose volume. Participants who completed the screening period and met eligibility criteria were randomized to 1 of 5 open-label statin cohorts (atorvastatin 10 mg or 80 mg, rosuvastatin 5 mg or 40 mg, or simvastatin 40 mg) for a 4 week lipid stabilization period based on statin therapy at the time of study entry (no statin use vs non-intensive statin use vs intensive statin use). After the 4-week lipid-stabilization period, eligible patients taking rosuvastatin or simvastatin during the lipid-stabilization phase were then randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups: evolocumab (140 mg, subcutaneous, every 2 weeks) or matching placebo (subcutaneous, every 2 weeks), or evolocumab (420 mg, subcutaneous, monthly) or matching placebo (subcutaneous, monthly). Patients taking atorvastatin during the lipid-stabilization phase were then randomized to 1 of 6 treatment groups: evolocumab (140 mg, subcutaneous, every 2 weeks) and placebo (oral, daily), evolocumab (420 mg, subcutaneous, monthly) and placebo (oral, daily), placebo (subcutaneous, every 2 weeks) and placebo (oral, daily) or ezetimibe (10 mg, oral, daily), or placebo (subcutaneous, monthly) and placebo (oral, daily) or ezetimibe (10 mg, oral, daily). A participant was considered randomized into the study after successfully completing the screening period, meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria, and undergoing both randomization procedures. Participants randomized to simvastatin who were taking verapamil or diltiazem prior to randomization received simvastatin 10 mg once daily (QD) while participants who were taking amlodipine, amiodarone or ranolazine prior to randomization received simvastatin 20 mg QD. All other participants randomized to simvastatin received simvastatin 40 mg QD.</detailed_description>
