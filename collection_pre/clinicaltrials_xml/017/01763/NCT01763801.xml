	<brief_summary>Intravenous electrocardiographic guidance (IVECG) is a safe, reliable and accurate technique to correctly position the catheter tip. The investigators sought to evaluate the superiority of the P-maximal (P-max) wave compared to the P-submaximal (P-submax) wave in obtaining a more correct, safer and longer lasting device placement, with a lower incidence of complications and secondary misplacement.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimization of EKG Method for Long Term Central Venous Catheter Tip Placement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective randomized trial was designed to observe the placement of long term iv catheters obtained with the IVECG method. Patients were randomised into 2 groups: in group A the catheter tip was placed in correspondence to the P-max, in group B in correspondence to the P-submax. We followed up the tip position by measuring the variation of its distances from the tracheal carina on multiplanar reconstructions of volumetric CT scans taken within a month (T0) and a year (T1) from the port implant.</detailed_description>
