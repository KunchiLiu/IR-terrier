	<brief_summary>Title of study / project: Influence of training with whole body vibration device on Quality of Life (QoL), exercise capacity, as well as on the effects of muscle power and muscle function in patients with pulmonal arterial hypertension (PAH). Background and rationale for the proposal:Capacity and the ability to exercise, in patients with PAH is limited. There is a few investigations evaluating the effects of the training with whole body vibration (wbv) in adults. It was shown that wbv-training could improve muscle power, QoL, body balance and had positive effects on the neuromuscular system. Primary scientific question addressed:Changes in muscle power, changes in 6-Minute Walk Distance (6MWD) and changes in QoL are to be evaluated.</brief_summary>
