	<brief_summary>No treatments have been shown to slow prostate cancer progression after radical prostatectomy. We hypothesize that a carbohydrate restricted diet will slow prostate cancer growth. A total of 60 men with a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after failed primary treatment will be recruited and randomized to either a low-carbohydrate diet (&lt;20 grams carbohydrates/day) or a no-diet control (standard of care) for 6 months. The primary outcome is PSA doubling time.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Received prior radical prostatectomy or definitive local radiation for prostate cancer (either external beam radiation, brachytherapy, or combination) PSA within the past 3 months is between 0.4 and 20 if prior radical prostatectomy, or between 3 and 20 ng/ml if prior radiation therapy. PSA doubling time (PSADT) &gt;3 months and &lt;36 months 1. Calculated based at least 2 values (at least 0.2) in the prior 2 years with the first and last PSA separated by at least 3 months 2. Use all values in the last 2 years to calculate PSADT 3. PSADT calculated while NOT on hormonal therapy 4. If prior medication usage that alters testosterone level, then documented normal testosterone is required before starting to calculate PSADT BMI &gt;=24 kg/m2 Willing to be randomized to a nodiet control or a lowcarbohydrate diet Reads, writes, and understands English Anticipate needing secondary prostate cancer therapy within the next 6 months (i.e. radiation, or hormonal therapy) Current use of weight loss medications including herbal weight loss supplements or enrolled in a diet/weight loss program Currently on therapy aimed at altering testosterone levels (includes gonadotropinreleasing hormone (GnRH) agonist/antagonist, prior bilateral orchiectomy, oral antiandrogens, or 5alpha reductase inhibitors) Known distant metastatic disease Already consuming a carbohydraterestricted or vegetarian diet Unable or unwilling to adhere to a carbohydraterestricted dietary intervention Weight loss &gt;5% of body weight in the last 6 months Medical comorbidities that in the opinion of the investigator limits the patient's ability to complete this study</criteria>
