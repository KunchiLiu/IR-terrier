	<criteria>patients who have been diagnosed with initial or relapsed primary minimalchange nephrotic syndrome patients whose urine proteincreatinine ratio (UPCR) is more than 3.0 patients whose eGFR is less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 patients who were treated with immunosuppressants, such as tacrolimus, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), mizoribine (Bredinin), levamisole, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or rituximab, within two weeks before the study patients to whom more than 10 mg prednisolone or an equivalent dose of steroid was administered daily within two weeks before the study patients who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to be pregnant or to breastfeed within six months after the study completion, or who cannot or do not want to use any contraceptive method patients who are hypersensitive to the investigational drug or to macrolide, such as azithromycin, clarithromycin, or roxithromycin patients who were treated with a live vaccine within four weeks before the study patients whose liver panel laboratory test result is three times the normal range, or acute hepatitis patients whose serum bilirubin has been clinically significantly higher than 3.6 mg/dL for more than 1 month patients who have a significant general disease that makes it inappropriate for them to participate in this study as adjudged by the investigator (e.g., cardiovascularacute myocardial infarction, heart failure [classified as more than New York Heart Association {NYHA} class III], hepatic/gastrointestinal/neurologic disease, blood disorder, cancer, infection, renal disorder other than minimalchange nephrotic syndrome, rheumatic arthritis with pneumonia interstitials) patients who have genetic problems such as galactose intolerance, Lapp lactose deficiency, or glucosegalactose malabsorption patients to whom another investigational drug was administered within 30 days from the enrollment in the study patients who participated in the past phases of this study</criteria>
