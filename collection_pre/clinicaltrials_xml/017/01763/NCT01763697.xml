	<brief_summary>This study will investigate the effects of acute morphine administration on taste acuity and how much a person eats. It is hypothesized that there will be a dose dependent decrease in taste acuity and dose dependent increase in food intake associated with acute morphine administration. Knowledge from this study will impact the future of feeding behavior and obesity research in the general population. Results will also promote exploration of the long-term effect of opioid abuse on taste acuity and feeding behavior in substance abusing populations.</brief_summary>
