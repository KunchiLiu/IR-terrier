	<brief_summary>BCD-021-02 is a double-blind randomized clinical trial comparing efficacy of BCD-021 (INN: bevacizumab) and paclitaxel + carboplatin to Avastin and paclitaxel + carboplatin in inoperable or advanced non-squamous NSCLC patients with pharmacokinetics substudy. The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of efficacy and safety of BCD-021 compared to Avastin. Also study includes pharmacokinetics assessment.</brief_summary>
