	<brief_title>High Protein Weight Loss Diet, High Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein and Cardiovascular Risks Among Obese Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Studies regarding the effects of high protein (HP) diet on cardiovascular (CVD) risk factors have reported contradictory results. Objective: In present study, we aimed to determine the effects of HP diet on CVD risk factors and hs-CRP among overweight and obese women. Design: In this randomized controlled trial, we recruited 60 overweight and obese women, aged 20-65 years into HP or control energy restricted diets for three months (protein, carbohydrate, fat: 25%, 45%, 30% vs. 15%, 55%, 30%, respectively). Total protein amount, divided to animal and plant sources in 50%-50% and animal sources distributed (half/half) between meats and dairy products. Fasting blood samples, hs-CRP, lipid profile, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and anthropometric measurements were measured based on the standard guidelines.</detailed_description>
