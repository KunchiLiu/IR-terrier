	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Effect of Rifampin on the Pharmacokinetics of PCI-32765 in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single center (study conducted at one site), sequential study (it is a design in a single group of participants are administered one or more study medication in a sequence) to evaluate the potential effects of rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of PCI-32765 in healthy participants.The study consists of 3 phases: screening phase (21 days prior to first dose of study medication), treatment phase (14 days), and a follow up phase (10 to 12 days after the last dose of study medication). In the treatment phase, a single dose of PCI-32765 560 mg will be administered orally on Day 1 and Day 11. Rifampin 600 mg (2 X 300 mg) will be administered orally on Days 4 to 13; followed by a single dose of PCI-32765 on Day 11. Follow up will be continued until Day 14. Safety evaluations for adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examination will be monitored throughout the study. The duration of the study will be approximately for 45 days.</detailed_description>
