	<brief_title>A Study of the Safety and Effectiveness of Doripenem in Filipino Patients With Nosocomial Pneumonia, Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections and Complicated Urinary Tract Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label study (all people know the identity of the treatment assigned), multi-center (conducted at multiple sites), and observational (study in which the investigators/physicians observe the patients and measure their outcomes) study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of doripenem for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia, complicated intra-abdominal infections and complicated urinary tract infection among Filipino patients. Safety evaluations for adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, physical examination, and concomitant medications will be monitored throughout the study. The total duration of study for each patient will be approximately for 3 years.</detailed_description>
