	<brief_summary>A multi-center, non-random, open study ,to observe efficacy and safety of bevacizumab plus Oxaliplatin based multidrug chemotherapy as conversion therapy for patients with previously untreated unresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Therapy Untreated Unresectable Liver Metastases From Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES：To assess the objective response rate(ORR)（8 weeks after chemotherapy） SECONDARY OBJECTIVES： 1. To assess the R0 resection rate of liver metastases（8 weeks after chemotherapy、every three months follow-up 1 time in R0 postoperative 1-2 years、Every six months follow-up 1 time in R0 postoperative 2-5 years） 2. To assess the incidence of adverse events of level 3-4 （Bleeding、Gastrointestinal Perforation、Anastomotic Fistula、Hypertension、Wound Healing Delay）（8 weeks after chemotherapy）</detailed_description>
