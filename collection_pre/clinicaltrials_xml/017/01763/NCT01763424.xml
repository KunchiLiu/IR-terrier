	<brief_title>Nicotinamide in the Treatment of Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current treatment strategies of psoriasis are not completely satisfactorily. By inhibiting inflammatory cytokines, nicotinamide may enhance the effects of current topical treatments. Preliminary studies have shown that nicotinamide, which is a vitamin B derivative, is effective in the treatment of psoriasis. According to lack of data, we will investigate the beneficial effects of adding nicotinamide to calcipotriol for patients with mild to moderate psoriasis.</detailed_description>
