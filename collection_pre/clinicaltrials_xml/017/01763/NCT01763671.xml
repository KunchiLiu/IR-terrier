	<brief_summary>The study objective is to evaluate the efficacy of paclitaxel-bevacizumab comparing to docetaxel. Docetaxel is a standard treatment of 2nd or 3rd line in lung cancer. It was validated by numerous clinical trials but sometimes toxicities are difficult to manage. Bevacizumab is an antiangiogenic treatment which was validated by numerous clinical trials in association with platinum in first ligne. Different clinical and preclinical data suggest that there could exist a synergy between paclitaxel and bevacizumab. This association is already used in metastatic breast cancer, it permits almost to double the response rate and progression free survival. In lung cancer, the association was evaluated by two retrospective studies which demonstrated a benefit with a favourable safety profile.</brief_summary>
