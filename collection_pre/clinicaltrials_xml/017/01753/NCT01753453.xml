	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate tumor cell mobilization (TCM) with non-pegylated G-CSF alone compared with non-pegylated G-CSF plus plerixafor in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who are potentially poor mobilizers of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Second objectives are to evaluate survival and disease status of G-CSF alone compared with GCSF plus plerixafor, and the efficacy and safety of G-CSF plus plerixafor when used to mobilize stem cells for autologous transplantation.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients with a diagnosis of MM in partial response or complete response, who are undergo an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and could be considered potentially poor mobilizers. Does not have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1. Has a history of any acute or chronic leukemia (including myelodysplastic syndrome). Had prior allogeneic or autologous transplantation. Less than 3 to 6 weeks since last anticancer therapy. Chemotherapy for mobilization is not allowed. Has bone marrow involvement &gt;10% assessed based on the most recent bone marrow aspirate or biopsy performed prior to first dose of GCSF. Was treated with GCSF or other cytokine within 14 days prior to the first dose of GCSF for mobilization. Has previously received plerixafor. Is known to be HIV positive. Has active hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Has an acute infection within 24 hours prior to dosing or antibiotic therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of GCSF. Has hypercalcaemia as evidenced by &gt;1 mg/dL above upper limit of normal (ULN). Previously received investigational therapy within 4 weeks of screening in this protocol or currently enrolled in another investigational protocol during the mobilization phase. Has central nervous system involvement including brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease. Has an electrocardiogram (ECG) or study result indicative of cardiac ischemia or a history of clinically significant rhythm disturbance(arrhythmias), or other conduction abnormality. Has comorbid condition(s), which may render the patient at high risk from treatment complications or impairs his/her ability to comply with the study treatment and protocol. Has a white blood cell (WBC) count &lt;2.5 x 10^9/L. Has an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;1.5 x 10^9/L. Has a platelet count &lt;100 x 10^9/L. Has an estimated creatine clearance ≤50 mL/min. Has aspartate aminotransferase/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (AST/SGOT), alanine aminotransferase/serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (ALT/SGPT), and total bilirubin ≥2.5 x ULN. Does not have adequate cardiac, and pulmonary function sufficient to undergo apheresis and transplantation. Pregnant or breastfeeding women. Does not agree to use a highly effective method of contraception while on study treatment and for at least 3 months following study treatment.</criteria>
