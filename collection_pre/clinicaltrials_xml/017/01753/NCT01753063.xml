	<brief_summary>As part of Children's Hospital Association's Focus on a Fitter Future III Obesity Task Force, this project will target patient and family expectations across the domains of nutrition, physical activity and behavior change/family support as a means of patient engagement and retention in pediatric weight management. This will be a prospective, non-randomized, uncontrolled, single-arm trial for children between 2 and 18 years of age and a parent/guardian, who are starting a pediatric weight management program/clinic in one of the participating centers. The parent/guardian and child if 12 years of age or older receive a survey at the first visit, which asks about their expectations and goals for the visit. This information will then be used as part of clinical care to tailor treatment. After 3 months, the parent/guardian and adolescent, if applicable, will receive a follow up survey asking about their progress in these areas.</brief_summary>
