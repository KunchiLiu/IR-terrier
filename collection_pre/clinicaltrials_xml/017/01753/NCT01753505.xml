	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical usefulness of 64-slice multidetector coronary CT angiography (MDCTA) in renal transplant recipients who had no previous coronary artery disease (CAD). Primary endpoint is to assess the prevalence and severity of coronary artery disease in patients post-transplant 6 to 12 months. CAD can be diagnosed noninvasively with similar accuracy of coronary angiography using MDCTA. Early detection and intervention of CAD may provide survival benefit in renal transplant recipients.</brief_summary>
