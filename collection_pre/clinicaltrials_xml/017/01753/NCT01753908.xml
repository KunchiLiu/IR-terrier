	<brief_summary>This randomized pilot trial studies broccoli sprout extract in treating patients with breast cancer. Broccoli sprout extract contains ingredients that may prevent or slow the growth of certain cancers. Studying samples of tissue from patients receiving broccoli sprout extract may help determine if it can enter breast tumor cells and how it affects certain biomarkers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Broccoli Sprout Extract in Treating Patients With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether isothiocyanate-rich broccoli sprout extract (ITC-BSE) modifies biomarkers in breast tumor cells. II. To determine whether the intervention alters proliferative and apoptotic markers (Ki-67 and cleaved caspase-3). III. To determine whether the intervention down-regulates the expression of estrogen receptor (ER) including both ERalpha and ERbeta. IV. To determine whether the intervention induces NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone) 1 (NQO1) expression. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine tolerability of ITC-BSE and compliance in breast cancer patients. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive broccoli sprout extract orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-14 immediately prior to surgery. ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD on days 1-14 immediately prior to surgery. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.</detailed_description>
