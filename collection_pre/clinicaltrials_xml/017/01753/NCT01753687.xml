	<brief_summary>Dry eye syndrome (DES) is a highly prevalent ocular condition inducing an inflammatory response of the ocular surface. Common symptoms include ocular discomfort, visual impairment and instability of the tear film with potential damage to the ocular surface. The rationale of the present study is to compare signs as assessed with new methods such as measurement of tear film thickness, tear film osmolarity and scattering of the tear film with well established methods for assessment of the severity of DES (Break up time, staining of the cornea with fluorescein). Additionally, impression cytology and determination of tear cytokines/chemokines will be performed to obtain information about inflammatory processes on the ocular surface.</brief_summary>
