	<brief_summary>This is a Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the safety and clinical activity of multiple intravenous doses of MCMV5322A/MCMV3068A in cytomegalovirus (CMV)-seronegative recipients of a renal transplant from a CMV-seropositive donor, with use of a preemptive approach for prevention of CMV disease. Participants will be randomized into two treatment groups: active or placebo control; both arms will be followed preemptively. The study has a planned enrollment of approximately 120 participants (60 active and 60 placebo).</brief_summary>
