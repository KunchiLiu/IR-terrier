	<brief_summary>Study Objectives The study is to identify prevalence, demography and clinical characteristics of patients with resistant hypertension among hypertensive patients who have been treated in general hospitals in Korea from Jan 2012 to Jun 2012. - Diagnosis of resistant hypertension: In case of clinic blood pressure exceeding the boundary of systolic blood pressure at 140mmHg and diastolic blood pressure at 90mmHg (hereinafter refer to as 140/90mmHg) (130/80mmHg for patients with diabetes mellitus or chronic renal disease) despite triple antihypertensive therapy at optimal dose may be diagnosed as resistant hypertension. Antihypertensive medications used include diuretics. Resistant hypertension may also be diagnosed when clinic blood pressure has reached the target value but quadruple or more of antihypertensives are used. - Diagnosis of controlled hypertension: Patients whose clinic blood pressure equals to 140/90mmHg (130/80mmHg for patients with diabetes mellitus or chronic renal disease) or less with the administration of antihypertensives at optimal dose may be diagnosed as controlled hypertension.</brief_summary>
