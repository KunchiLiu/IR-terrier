	<criteria>Patient from 18 to 85 years old A symptomatic unruptured saccular intracranial aneurysm with a neck â‰¥4mm (or a dome to neck ratio &lt;2) and a parent vessel diameter between 2.5 to 5.0 mm (inclusive) in both the anterior and posterior circulation of the brain, that is amenable to stentassisted coiling. "Symptomatic" is defined as any neurological symptoms attributed to the target aneurysm. Life expectancy &gt;6 months Signed Informed Consent Aneurysm with branches from the aneurysm base Rapidly growing aneurysm Daughter aneurysm Aneurysm with partial or complex calcifications Females who are nursing, pregnant or intend to become pregnant during the study. Females of childbearing potential must have a urinary pregnancy test within 7 days of enrollment and use an approved highly efficient contraceptive method during the study Multiple untreated cerebral aneurysms at study entry Recent history of stroke, TIA, subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracranial hemorrhage, or major surgery within one month of enrollment Previous brain surgery or irradiation of the target treatment territory that would, in the opinion of the investigator, interfere with the treatment of the target aneurysm Admission platelet &lt;150,000 or any known hemorrhagic diathesis, coagulation deficiency, or on oral anticoagulant therapy Underlying unstable Coronary Artery Disease, cardiac insufficiency or Myocardial Infarction Contraindication to angiography such as elevated creatinine or known allergy to angiographic contrast Contraindication to CT and/or MRI scans Known allergy to the metal component of the Penumbra Liberty Stent System Evidence of active infection (WBC &gt;10x109/L) Any medical conditions that will not allow the necessary followup for this study (e.g., preexisting neurological or psychiatric diseases) Current substanceabuse/illicit drug use Angiographic evidence of an arterial stenosis proximal to the target lesion that could prevent device deployment Contraindications to study medications (heparin, aspirin, clopidogrel, and radiographic contrasts) Patients unable to sign Informed Consent due to the emergency conditions of the intervention</criteria>
