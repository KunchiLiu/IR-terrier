	<brief_summary>Several studies have demonstrated that goal-directed fluid therapy during high- risk-surgery reduces morbidity and length of hospital stay. This quality improvement is design to evaluate the implementation of an intraoperative goal-directed therapy, using a pulse contour analysis monitor to optimize the stroke volume, in patients undergoing redo-hip-surgery. The primary combined endpoints will be the incidence of postoperative complications and the secondary endpoints will be the decrease of hospital length of stay, length of ICU stay and hospital postoperative mortality.</brief_summary>
