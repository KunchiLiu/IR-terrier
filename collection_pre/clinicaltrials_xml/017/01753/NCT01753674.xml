	<brief_title>The Effects of the Telomerase Activator TA-65 on Insulin Resistance, Inflammation, and Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is double blind cross over randomized clinical trial. The supplement and placebo will be provided by TA Science, Inc. and prepared as described below. Subjects will be randomly allocated to consume either a daily serving of TA-65 (two capsules per day of 8 mg each) (please see attached label) or a placebo for 12 weeks. Randomization will be done in a sequential manner; the first subject will be allocated to supplement A and the next one to supplement B and so on. After a 3-week washout, they will be allocated to the alternate treatment for additional 12 weeks. Supplements (TA-65 or placebo) will be taken twice daily with a meal. Participants will be advised not to change their diet or exercise protocols during the 27 week intervention. Volunteers will be required to provide a 5-day dietary record before starting the study, at the end of each supplement period (TA-65 or placebo) and at the end of the washout period. Subjects will have to fill an exercise questionnaire during the same times to ensure that there are no changes in physical activity. Participants will be asked to report to the department every 4 weeks for checking compliance on supplement intake and to assess weight and blood pressure.</detailed_description>

However, subjects may not participate if they begin taking a new supplement during the 27wk study period. Subjects will also be asked to refrain from taking any additional supplements, including fish oil, herb and concentrated antioxidant sources.</criteria>
