	<brief_summary>This is a 48-week, randomised, multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group investigation of the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) ozanezumab (GSK1223249) compared to placebo in subjects with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Following a screening period of up to four weeks, eligible subjects will be randomised (1:1) to receive IV placebo or 15 milligram (mg)/ kilogram (kg) IV ozanezumab every 2 weeks for a period of 48 weeks with a follow-up visit around 14 weeks after the last infusion. A total of approximately 294 eligible subjects will be randomised from approximately 37 centers worldwide. The primary objective is to assess the effect of ozanezumab on the physical function and survival of ALS subjects over a treatment period of 48 weeks. Function will be measured using the ALS Functional Rating Scale - Revised (ALSFRS-R). Secondary objectives include the evaluation of other clinical outcomes associated with ALS (respiratory function, muscle strength, progression free survival and overall survival) in support of the primary objective. Quality of life, safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics (ozanezumab and riluzole) will also be assessed.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients with diagnosis of familial or sporadic ALS Onset of muscle weakness no more than 30 months before screening visit. Slow Vital Capacity (SVC) of at least 65% predicted for gender, age, ethnicity and height at Screening. If on riluzole, the dose must have been stable for at least 28 days prior to Baseline visit. Age 18 80 years inclusive. Female subjects may participate if they are of nonchildbearing potential or if they are of childbearing potential they must agree to use the approved contraceptive methods Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;=2x upper limit of normal (ULN); alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt;=1.5xULN. QTc (both QTcB and QTcF) &lt;450 milliseconds (msec) or &lt;480 msec for subjects with Bundle Branch Block at Screening and Baseline (average from triplicate ECGs). Patients with other neuromuscular disorders (including a history of polio) which in the opinion of the investigator could have contributed to the muscular atrophy or weakness caused by ALS Patients with primary lateral sclerosis, monomelic ALS, ALS Parkinsonism dementia complex. Patients requiring noninvasive or mechanical ventilation (noninvasive ventilation for sleep apnoea is allowed subject to discussion with Medical Monitor) Patients on diaphragmatic pacing. Presence of any of the following clinical conditions: Drug abuse or alcoholism, uncontrolled hypertension, active major infectious disease, unstable psychiatric illness within 90 days of the Screening visit Subjects, who in the investigator's judgement, pose a significant suicide risk. Current or chronic history of liver disease, known hepatic or biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones), positive Hepatitis B surface antigen or Hepatitis C antibody test. Subjects who have participated in a clinical trial involving receipt of a biopharmaceutical product within 6 months prior to the first dosing day. Exposure to nonbiological experimental agents 1 month or 5 halflives prior to Baseline visit (whichever is longer). History of sensitivity to ozanezumab, or components thereof, or a history of other allergies that, in the opinion of the investigator, contraindicates participation in the study.</criteria>
