	<brief_title>Dovitinib in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: Arm 1: To determine 6 month progression-free survival (PFS6) in anti-angiogenic therapy (including anti-VEGF therapy or bevacizumab) naive patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) in patients treated with dovitinib Arm 2: To estimate time to progression in patients with recurrent or progressive Glioblastoma who have progressed on anti-angiogenic therapy (including anti-VEGF therapy). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: 1. To evaluate the side effect profile of dovitinib in both patient populations. 2. To evaluate the efficacy of dovitinib as measured by objective response rate (ORR) in both patient populations. 3. To estimate time to percentage of patients free from progression at 6 months (PFS-6)in patients with recurrent or progressive Glioblastoma who have progressed on antiangiogenic therapy (including anti-VEGF therapy). 4. To estimate time to progression in anti-angiogenic therapy (including anti-VEGF therapy or bevacizumab) naiVe patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) in patients treated with dovitinib, 5. To evaluate the overall survival (OS) in both patient populations. EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES: To explore association between clinical outcome and potential biomarkers that may include microparticles, PlGF, PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB, SDF-1a, thrombospondin-1, Ang1, and Il-6, IL-8 and FGF. OUTLINE: Patients receive dovitinib orally (PO) 5 days a week. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.</detailed_description>

the antiproliferative activity of this experimental drug may be harmful to the developing fetus or nursing infant; female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test Patients must have no concurrent malignancy except curatively treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix and breast, adequately treated stage I or II cancer from which the patient is in complete remission; patients with other prior malignancies must be diseasefree for &gt;= three years Patients must be maintained on a stable corticosteroid regimen from the time of their baseline scan until the start of treatment and/or for at least 5 days before starting treatment Patients who have undergone major surgery (e.g. intrathoracic, intraabdominal or intrapelvic), open biopsy or significant traumatic injury =&lt; 4 weeks prior to starting study drug, or patients who have had minor procedures, percutaneous biopsies or placement of vascular access device =&lt; 1 week prior to starting study drug, or who have not recovered from side effects of such procedure or injury Patients with a history of pulmonary embolism (PE), or untreated deep venous thrombosis (DVT) within the past 6 months Patients with any of the following concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions which could compromise participation in the study: Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac diseases, including any of the following: History or presence of serious uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias Clinically significant resting bradycardia Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessed by 2dimensional (2D) echocardiogram (ECHO) &lt; 50% or lower limit of normal (whichever is higher) or multi gated acquisition scan (MUGA) &lt; 45% or lower limit of normal (whichever is higher) Any of the following within 6 months prior to starting study drug: myocardial infarction (MI), severe/unstable angina, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and transient ischemic attack (TIA) Uncontrolled hypertension defined by a systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt;= 160 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &gt;= 100 mm Hg, with or without antihypertensive medication(s) Impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of dovitinib (e.g. ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small bowel resection) Cirrhosis, chronic active hepatitis or chronic persistent hepatitis Known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (HIV testing is not mandatory) Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled concomitant medical conditions (e.g. active or uncontrolled infection, uncontrolled diabetes) that could cause unacceptable safety risks or compromise compliance with the protocol Women of childbearing potential, who are biologically able to conceive, not employing two forms of highly effective contraception; highly effective contraception (e.g. male condom with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, intrauterine device) must be used by both sexes during the study and must be continued for 8 weeks after the end of study treatment; oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives may be affected by cytochrome P450 interactions, and are therefore not considered effective for this study; women of childbearing potential, defined as sexually mature women who have not undergone a hysterectomy or who have not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (e.g., who has had menses any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months), must have a negative serum pregnancy test =&lt;
