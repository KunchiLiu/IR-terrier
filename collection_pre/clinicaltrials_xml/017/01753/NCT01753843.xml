	<brief_summary>RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS Brief delay(&gt;30 sec to &lt;60 sec ) in cord clamping as compared to early cord clamping (&lt; 20 sec) leads to a better short term neurobehavioural outcome in preterm (34-36 wks) neonates when assessed by neurobehavioral assessment of preterm infants (n.a.p.i.) at 37 weeks of post conceptional age</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Delayed cord clamping (DCC) : Well described phenomenon in term infants . - The optimal timing of clamping of umbilical cord in preterm infants : A subject of debate. - Even a brief delay in cord clamping leads to an additional transfer of iron amounting to 40-50 mg/kg which may prevent iron deficiency.ยน - This low cost intervention can have significant public health importance in resource constrained settings. - The effect of this intervention on neurobehaviour of preterm neonates has not been assessed. - This aspect has been identified by WHO and Cochrane as a potentially researchable area</detailed_description>
