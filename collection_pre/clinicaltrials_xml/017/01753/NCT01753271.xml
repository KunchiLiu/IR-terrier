	<brief_summary>Specific Aims and Hypotheses Aims To investigate the incremental benefits of cervicothoracic spinal manipulation in addition to shoulder mobilization and exercise for improving range of motion, pain, physical function and fear avoidance beliefs in patients with subacromial shoulder impingement. Hypotheses It is hypothesized that those subjects who receive spinal manipulation in addition to shoulder mobilization and exercise will achieve greater improvements in range of motion, pain, function and fear avoidance beliefs at two weeks following treatment conclusion, at 4 weeks following treatment conclusion, and at discharge when compared to the subjects who did not receive the spinal manipulation.</brief_summary>
