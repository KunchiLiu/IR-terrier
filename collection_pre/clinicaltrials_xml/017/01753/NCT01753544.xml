	<brief_title>Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection Using a Thulium Laser</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Instead of endoscopic knives, a thin, flexible fiber is inserted through the working channel of the endoscope. Acetic acid (1.5%) and indigo carmine dye are sprayed onto the lesion to clarify the margin. Markings are made 10 mm outside the tumor margin using a laser fiber with a power setting at 30 W. After marking, a mixture of sodium hyaluronate with indigo carmine and epinephrine (1:25000) is injected into the submucosa outside the marking dots. A circumferential mucosal incision and submucosal dissection are performed by a thulium laser fiber with a power setting at 30 to 40 W. Activation of the laser beam is controlled by stepping on a foot pedal. Hemostasis during procedure is also attempted using the thulium laser. When hemostasis is not achieved properly, additional use of hemostatic forceps or a hemoclip will be considered.</detailed_description>
