	<brief_summary>The clinical performance of the Ultra Influenza A&amp;B Test will be demonstrated during a clinical trial in which prospectively collected nasal swabs are used in identifying subjects who are infected with the influenza virus strain type A or type B. The Ultra Influenza A&amp;B Test qualitative results will be compared to "Gold Standard" viral culture with Direct Fluorescent Antibody (DFA) confirmation techniques using nasal swabs collected from symptomatic subjects. The Ultra Influenza A&amp;B Test will be performed at Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) waived sites by untrained intended users (e.g. nurses, physician assistants, medical assistants, etc.). For viral culture testing with DFA confirmation testing, nasal swab specimen testing will be performed by a designated reference laboratory.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The subject may be of any age and either gender. Preliminary assessment of the subject by the Investigator/designee should be suggestive of influenza virus infection. Subject should present with an influenzalike febrile respiratory illness defined as (1) presentation within the last 48 hours of developing a subjective feeling of being feverish and/or a temperature recorded at the clinic within the last 48 hours of greater than or equal to 100.5 F and (2) at least two of the following symptoms: cough, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore throat, headache, myalgia. Written informed consent must be obtained prior to study enrollment. 1. A subject who is 18 years or older must be willing to give written informed consent and must agree to comply with study procedures. 2. The legal authorized representative of a subject who is under the age of 18 must give written informed consent and agree to comply with study procedures. Active written assent should be obtained from children of appropriate intellectual age (as defined by the IRB). The subject underwent a nasal wash/aspirate as part of standardofcare testing during this study visit. The subject is undergoing treatment currently and/or within the past 7 days of the study visit with a nasally administered influenza vaccine (FluMist) or with antiviral medication, which may include but is not limited to Amantadine (Symmetrel), Rimantadine (Flumadine), Zanamivir (Relenza), Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or Ribavirin. The subject is currently receiving or has received within the past thirty (30) days of the study visit an experimental biologic, drug or device, including either treatment or therapy. The subject has previously participated in this research study.</criteria>
