	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine how teriparatide or denosumab affects the bone of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis after 3 months of treatment, as determined by a bone biopsy sample taken from the iliac crest (upper part of the pelvis).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Ambulatory, postmenopausal women (no vaginal bleeding for at least 2 years prior to screening) with osteoporosis Bone mineral density (BMD) Tscore of at least 2.5 at femoral neck (FN), total hip (TH), or lumbar spine (LS) (Lumbar vertebrae L1L4, with at least 2 evaluable vertebrae), with or without atraumatic fracture after menopause, OR BMD Tscore of at least 1.5 at FN, TH, or LS (L1L4, with at least 2 evaluable vertebrae), and 1 or more atraumatic fractures after menopause (vertebral or nonvertebral). Nonvertebral fracture sites allowed are wrist, hip, pelvis, rib, humerus, clavicle, leg (femur, tibia, and fibula, excluding ankle) Laboratory values for serum calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and alkaline phosphatase must be within the normal reference range Has an increased risk of osteosarcoma (bone tumor); this includes Paget's disease of bone, a previous bone tumor, or radiation involving the skeleton Has an allergy or intolerance to teriparatide or denosumab and/or is a poor candidate for teriparatide or denosumab treatment (investigator should refer to local product prescribing information) Has a history of exposure to DEM or TET therapy in the 12 months prior to screening or a known allergy to DEM or TET Has a condition that could put the participant at additional risk of an adverse event (AE) due to the bone biopsy procedure (for example, bleeding disorder) Has undergone 2 previous iliac crest bone biopsies (1 in each iliac crest) Has a 25hydroxyvitamin D concentration of &lt;10 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) Has currently active or suspected (within 1 year prior to enrollment) diseases that affect bone metabolism, other than osteoporosis (such as renal osteodystrophy, hyperthyroidism, osteomalacia, or hyperparathyroidism) Has a history of certain cancers within 5 years prior to trial entry Current or recent (within 1 year prior to enrollment) celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, gastric bypass, or other malabsorption syndrome Has significantly impaired hepatic or renal function Has had treatment with systemic glucocorticoids in doses â‰¥5 mg/day prednisone/day or equivalent in the 6 calendar months prior to screening Has taken any intravenous osteoporosis medication Has had prior treatment with other bisphosphonates and not been off of them for a specific period of time before trial entry Has participated in any other clinical trial studying teriparatide, PTH, PTH analog, or denosumab, or prior or current treatment with teriparatide, PTH, PTH analog, or denosumab</criteria>
