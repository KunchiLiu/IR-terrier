	<brief_summary>The focus of this pilot study is to determine if a woman who experiences pain during sexual intercourse has a higher risk of complications during labor and delivery secondary to pelvic floor dysfunction, anxiety and intolerance towards pelvic examinations. Furthermore, it is unclear whether women with prepartum dyspareunia experience an improvement following vaginal delivery. While physicians may expect that vaginal birth improves dyspareunia due to the stretching effect on pelvic floor, to date, there is insufficient evidence to support this claim. The Investigators plan to prospectively study 200 patients at our Institution, collect information regarding birth and follow them, via questionnaires, regarding their dyspareunia postpartum.</brief_summary>
