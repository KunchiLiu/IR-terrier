	<brief_summary>Corneal lesions such as corneal abrasions and corneal infiltrates are common in clinical practice. The current study seeks to investigate whether high-resolution OCT is suitable for imaging of these corneal lesions. The present study has the character of a pilot study and the results are intended to be used to develop a standardized protocol for imaging and analysis of these corneal lesions. Based on this protocol, further studies investigating the pathophysiology of corneal lesions or evaluating therapeutic success can be planned.</brief_summary>
