	<brief_summary>This Phase 4 study is being performed to examine the effects of Acthar for the indicated use of treatment of SLE. This study will enroll patients with steroid-dependent, persistently active SLE with arthritic and/or cutaneous involvement. The study will involve two phases: a double-blind phase, to provide placebo-controlled safety, efficacy, and pharmacodynamic data, and an optional open-label phase, to examine the prolonged effects of Acthar maintenance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acthar for the Treatment of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus in Patients With a History of Persistently Active Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first phase of the study is an 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group add-on pilot study exploring the efficacy, safety, and pharmacodynamics of Acthar in SLE patients with a history of persistently active disease with arthritic and/or cutaneous involvement despite standard of care, which includes chronic/stable prednisone use for a minimum of 4 weeks prior to screening. Patients will be randomized to one of four possible treatment groups (Acthar [low dose (40 U [0.5 mL]) or high dose (80 U [1.0 mL])] or equivalent volumes of Placebo [low or high 'dose']) in a 2:1:2:1 ratio (Acthar:Placebo:Acthar:Placebo). In Weeks 1-4, patients will administer study medication via subcutaneous (SC) injection 0.5 mL daily or 1.0 mL every other day based on randomization. In Weeks 5-8, patients will taper the study medication. Patients will continue on their stable steroid regimen during this phase of the study. After completion of Week 8 in the double-blind phase, patients may choose to participate in the optional open-label phase where they will receive an Acthar maintenance regimen for 44 weeks. The initial Acthar regimen will be assigned based on the study medication regimen the patient received at the completion of the double-blind phase (Visit 6, Week 8). Acthar regimen may be adjusted based on the Investigator's judgment with the goal of achieving a stable Acthar regimen no later than Week 28. Once the stable Acthar regimen is achieved, the Investigator should consider tapering the steroid regimen to a low daily dose or completely discontinue.</detailed_description>
