	<brief_summary>We hypothesized that the local control for both arms were not statistically significant, when irradiation to the post-induction chemotherapy tumor volume is compared with irradiation to the pre-induction chemotherapy tumor volume.While elective nodal irradiation will be omitted for both arms.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients were eligible if they had histologic or cytologic verification of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and were radiographically confirmed limitedstage Patients with contralateral mediastinal and ipsilateral supraclavicular lymphadenopathy were also included. The patients should be between 18 and 75 years old without previous thoracic radiotherapy, chemotherapy or biotherapy. Karnofsky performance status was ≥ 80. Forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1) ≥ 1 L. Had measurable or assessable disease. Neutrophilic granulocyte ≥ 1.5×109/L, haemoglobin ≥ 100 g/L, platelet count ≥ 100×109/L. Serum creatine and bilirubin &lt; 1.5 × the upper normal limit (UNL), aminotransferase &lt; 2 × UNL. Weight loss was less than 10% within 6 months before diagnosis. Written informed consent was required from all patients. Patients were ineligible if they had a history of other malignant diseases except for nonmelanomatous skin cancer and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or any contraindications for chemoradiotherapy, malignant pleural and/or pericardial effusion.</criteria>
