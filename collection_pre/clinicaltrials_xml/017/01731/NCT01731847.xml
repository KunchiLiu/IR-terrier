	<brief_title>Combined NMES,FEES and Traditional Swallowing Rehabilitation in the Treatment of Stroke-related Dysphagia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES)and Fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) are both promising approaches to enhance swallowing recovery for dysphagic patients. However, there is no literature on the effectiveness of combined application of these modalities in the treatment of patients with poststroke dysphagia. The purpose of this study was to prospectively investigate whether combined NMES, FEES and traditional swallowing rehabilitation can improve swallowing functions in patients with moderate-to-severe dysphagia after stroke.</detailed_description>
