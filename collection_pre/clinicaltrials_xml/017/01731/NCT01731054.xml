	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of the study are as follows: To develop and optimize a renal functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol consisting of Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DW-MRI), Blood-Oxygen- Level-Dependent MRI (BOLD-MRI), Arterial Spin Labeling MRI (ASL-MRI), Phase Contrast MRI (PC-MRI), and T1rho-MRI; To compare renal functional MRI cross-sectional readouts between normal healthy volunteers (NHV) and lupus nephritis (LN) participants. The secondary objectives of this study are as follows: Explore whether renal functional MRI techniques discriminate between renal inflammatory activity and damage in lupus nephritis (LN); To examine whether renal functional MRI measurements correlate with laboratory features of renal involvement and renal function in participants with lupus nephritis (LN).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Must have a documented diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) according to current American Academy of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. At least 4 American Academy of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria must be documented, 1 of which must be a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA), antiSm, or antidouble stranded DNA antibody. Must have a standard of care renal biopsy for lupus nephritis performed or scheduled within +/7 days of Day 1. Key Has a metal device affected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI )(e.g., any type of electronic, mechanical, or magnetic implant; cardiac pacemaker; aneurysm clips; implanted cardiac defibrillator), or has potential ferromagnetic foreign body (metal slivers, metal shavings, other metal objects) that would be a contraindication for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). History of renal transplant. Subjects with uncontrolled diabetes or other condition that may result in significant renal disease. NOTE: Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
