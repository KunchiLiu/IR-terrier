	<brief_summary>Proteins are known to be more satiating than the other macronutrients; however, the type and amount of protein needed to induce a significant effect on satiety (fullness between meals) is sometimes difficult to determine. In this study, 2 differentially processed isolated soy proteins will be tested for satiety using subjective visual analogue scales. The amount of food consumed following intake of the isolated soy proteins will be measured 3 hours after consuming the proteins. The hypothesis is that differentially processed isolated soy proteins will show unique satiety responses.</brief_summary>
