	<brief_summary>Phase Ib study investigating whether liposome BLP25 mucin-1 (MUC1) peptide-specific immunotherapy (L-BLP25) administered as weekly subcutaneous doses over 8 weeks following a single dose of intravenous cyclophosphamide (CPA) induces a reproducible cytokine pattern measured in the serum of unresected Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) subjects after first-line chemo-radiation therapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically documented unresectable Stage III NSCLC, as defined by American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control (AJCC/UICC) 7th edition (2009) criteria. All histological subtypes are acceptable, including bronchioalveolar carcinomas Documented stable disease or objective response, according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.0, after primary chemoradiotherapy (either sequential or concomitant) for unresected Stage III disease, within 4 weeks (28 days) prior to enrollment Receipt of concomitant or sequential chemoradiotherapy, consisting of a minimum of two cycles of platinumbased chemotherapy and a minimum radiation dose of greater than equal to 50 Gray. Subjects must have completed the primary thoracic chemoradiotherapy at least 4 weeks (28 days) and no later than 84 days prior to enrollment. Subjects who received prophylactic brain irradiation as part of primary chemoradiotherapy are eligible Platelet count greater than or equal to 140 * 10^9 per liter, white blood cell (WBC) greater than or equal to 2.5 * 10^9 per liter, and hemoglobin greater than or equal to 90 gram per liter Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 01 Additional Inclusion Criteria apply Pretherapies: Previous lung cancer specific therapy (including surgery) other than primary chemoradiotherapy Receipt of immunotherapy within 4 weeks (28 days) prior to enrollment. Note: Subjects who have received monoclonal antibodies for imaging are acceptable Receipt of investigational systemic drugs (including offlabel use of approved products) within 4 weeks (28 days) prior to enrollment Disease status: Metastatic disease Malignant pleural effusion at initial diagnosis and/or at trial entry Past or current history of neoplasm other than lung carcinoma, except for curatively treated nonmelanoma skin cancer, in situ carcinoma of the cervix or other cancer curatively treated and with no evidence of disease for at least 5 years Autoimmune disease A recognized immunodeficiency disease including cellular immunodeficiencies, hypogammaglobulinemia or dysgammaglobulinemia; subjects who have hereditary or congenital immunodeficiencies Any preexisting medical condition requiring systemic chronic steroid or immunosuppressive therapy (steroids for the treatment of radiation pneumonitis are allowed) Known Hepatitis B and/or C Active infection at enrollment, including but not limited to, flulike infections, urinary tract infections, bronchopulmonary infections, etc Physiological functions: Clinically significant hepatic dysfunction (that is, alanine aminotransferase [ALT] greater than 2.5 times normal upper limit [ULN]; or aspartate aminotransferase [AST] greater than 2.5 times ULN; or bilirubin greater than or equal to 1.5 * ULN) Clinically significant renal dysfunction (that is, serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 * ULN) Clinically significant cardiac disease, for example, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classes IIIIV; uncontrolled angina, uncontrolled arrhythmia or uncontrolled hypertension, myocardial infarction in the previous 6 months as confirmed by an electrocardiogram (ECG) Splenectomy Infectious process that in the opinion of the investigator could compromise the subject's ability to mount an immune response Additional Exclusion Criteria apply</criteria>
