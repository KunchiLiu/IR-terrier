	<brief_summary>The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is routinely recommended for both adolescent girls and boys starting at age 11, although it can be offered as young as 9 years of age. This is a 3-dose series and many adolescents do not complete it after getting the first dose. This study will study how effective it will be to send reminders to parents to schedule an appointment when their child is due for the next dose of HPV. Parents can chose whether they would like a phone call or text message reminder. This study will determine if the reminders work, and if one method is better than another (phone message vs. text message).</brief_summary>
