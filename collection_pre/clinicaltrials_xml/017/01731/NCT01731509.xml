	<brief_summary>Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is associated high mortality and morbidity, mainly in those cases with severe forms where there are extremely reduced lung volumes, liver herniation and decreased abnormal pulmonary vascularization. Fetal endoscopic tracheal occlusion performed between 26 and 30 weeks (standard FETO) has been shown to increase fetal pulmonary size and vascularity, and to improve infant survival in isolated severe CDH. Fetal pulmonary response followed FETO can be used to predict outcome and is dependent on the size of the fetal lung prior to the procedure. We hypothesize that performing an earlier FETO, between 22-24 weeks, fetuses with severe form of CDH will have a better fetal pulmonary response and higher chance of surviving.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early FETO for Severe Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We pretend to investigate if "early FETO" will improve the survival rate and the fetal pulmonary response, by conducting a randomized controlled trial comparing the results with those fetuses that undergo to "standard FETO" (between 26-28 weeks).</detailed_description>
