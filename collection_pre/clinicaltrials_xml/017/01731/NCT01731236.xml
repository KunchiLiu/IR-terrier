	<brief_title>CARNIVAL Study: Gut Flora Dependent Metabolism of Dietary CARNItine and Phosphatidylcholine and cardioVAscuLar Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The principal goal for the study is to examine the role gut flora plays in modulating metabolism of dietary trimethylamine nutrients in humans. We have recently shown that dietary intake of two trimethylamines abundant in animal products, carnitine and the choline group of phosphatidylcholine (PC), are mechanistically linked to cardiovascular disease risk. We wish to further explore the metabolism of these nutrients in humans, and to test the hypothesis that the intestinal micro flora (gut flora) plays a critical role in generation of metabolites from dietary carnitine and choline/PC linked to cardiometabolic disease. We further hypothesize that the production of specific metabolites of carnitine and choline/PC are influenced by the composition of gut flora, and these may be altered by the preceding dietary patterns of the subjects. We therefore wish to test whether dietary supplementation with carnitine and/or choline alters the metabolism of carnitine and choline/PC in subjects. We also hypothesize that transient suppression or modulation of gut flora via short-term broad spectrum antibiotic therapy, or by reconstitution of micro flora composition via probiotic therapy, in healthy subjects, can alter the metabolism of carnitine and choline/PC. We will also examine the impact of low dose aspirin on these pathways by examining subjects before versus after taking aspirin.</detailed_description>
