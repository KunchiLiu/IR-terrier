	<brief_title>Arterial Wall Calcium Load in Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In a previous work we have observed that patients suffering from PXE, a soft-tissue calcifying inherited autosomal disease, exhibited specific structural and functionnal features within the peripheral arteries. We now want to quantify and determine the preferential sites of the arterial wall calcification (Agatston score) between these patients compared to diabetics and patients with chronic renal insufficiency with mediacalcosis. All variables will be collected from a cohort of PXE monitored in our PXE Health and Care centre at the university hospital of Angers. Quantification of the arterial wall calcium load will be performed using helicoidal CT-scan. These variables will be compared to the same measurements performed in type 2 diabetic and chronic kidney disease patients paired by age and gender.</detailed_description>
