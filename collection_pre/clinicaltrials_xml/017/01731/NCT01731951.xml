	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies how well imetelstat sodium works in treating patients with primary or secondary myelofibrosis and other myeloid malignancies. Imetelstat sodium may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imetelstat Sodium in Treating Patients With Primary or Secondary Myelofibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate overall response rate. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of imetelstat (imetelstat sodium) in myelofibrosis (MF). II. To evaluate the efficacy of imetelstat in the reduction of spleen size, as measured by physical examination (palpable distance from the left costal margin). III. To evaluate the efficacy of imetelstat in improving anemia or inducing red blood cell transfusion-independence in previously transfusion-dependent patients (per International Working Group for Myelofibrosis Research and Treatment [IWG-MRT] criteria). IV. To evaluate onset and durability of response as defined in primary and secondary endpoints EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the effect of imetelstat on bone marrow histology, karyotype and JAK2V617F allele burden II. To evaluate the effect of imetelstat on leukocytosis, circulating blast count, circulating immature myeloid cell count and thrombocytosis. OUTLINE: Patients receive imetelstat sodium intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on day 1. Patients may continue to receive imetelstat study treatment for as long as they derive clinical benefit or until study end. The study will end when all patients have discontinued study drug, the last patient enrolled has been treated for 5 years, or imetelstat is commercially available in the United States, whichever occurs first. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years.</detailed_description>
