	<brief_summary>The objective of this registry is to broaden the knowledge on epidemiology, diagnostic procedures and clinical course of emerging invasive fungal infections.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fungiscope - A Global Emerging Fungal Infection Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific objectives are: 1. To determine the fungal species causing invasive fungal infection in different parts of the world. 2. To determine the clinical pattern of disease and document procedures performed for confirmation of the diagnosis. 3. To describe the therapeutic regimens used and their efficacy. 4. To share clinical isolates among the contributors of Fungiscope. 5. To develop molecular biology tools for identification of strains in histopathologically proven invasive fungal infection.</detailed_description>
