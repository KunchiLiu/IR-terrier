	<brief_title>Safety and Effectiveness Study of Endovascular Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair Using the Nellix® System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Nellix System among a wide range of physicians and in consecutively enrolled subjects to assess outcomes generalizability. Following appropriate government and ethics committee/IRB approval the Nellix® EndoVascular Sealing System will be implanted into eligible patients who are adequately informed and have consented to join the study. Enrolled patients will undergo a high resolution, contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiography (CT) scan of the relevant aortic and aortoiliac vasculature within three months of the scheduled procedure and at specified follow-up intervals post-implantation. Follow-up visits will occur at 30 days, 6 months, and annually to 5 years to assess aneurysm morphology, the status of the implanted devices, and relevant laboratory test results.</detailed_description>
