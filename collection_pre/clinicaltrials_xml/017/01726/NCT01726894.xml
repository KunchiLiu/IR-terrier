	<criteria>Histologically proven prostate cancer, Gleason Score &lt;/=7 An anterior visible lesion on mpMRI, that is accessible to IRE treatment Transperineal prostate biopsies (template mapping and/or limited targeted) correlating with clinically significant lesion in the area of the MRvisible lesion (within 2 Barzell zones) Absence of clinically significant disease outside of the planned treatment zone, from histopathology and/or mpMRI findings Stage radiologicalT1T2cN0M0 disease, as determined by local guidelines Serum PSA &lt;/=15 ng/ml Life expectancy of &gt;/= 10 years Signed informed consent by patient An understanding of the English language sufficient to understand written and verbal information about the trial and consent process Men who have had previous radiation therapy Men who have had androgen suppression/hormone treatment within the previous 12 months for their prostate cancer Men with evidence of metastatic disease or nodal disease outside the prostate on bone scan or crosssectional imaging Men with a nonvisible tumour on mpMRI Men with an inability to tolerate a transrectal ultrasound Men with latex allergies Men who have undergone prior significant rectal surgery preventing insertion of the TRUS probe (decided on the type of surgery in individual cases) Men who have had previous IRE, HIFU, cryosurgery, thermal or microwave therapy to the prostate. Men who have undergone a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) for symptomatic lower urinary tract symptoms within 6 months. These patients may be included within the trial if deferred from consenting and screening until at least 6 months following the TURP. Men not fit for major surgery as assessed by a Consultant Anaesthetist Men unable to have pelvic MRI scanning (severe claustrophobia, permanent cardiac pacemaker, metallic implant etc likely to contribute significant artefact to images) Presence of metal implants/stents in the urethra Men with renal impairment with a GFR of &lt;35ml/min (unable to tolerate Gadolinium dynamic contrast enhanced MRI).</criteria>
