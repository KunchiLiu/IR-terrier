	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to report a new method of flexor tendon repair in zone II with combined standard modified Kessler technique and vascularized finger dorsal fascial flap pedicled with dorsal cutaneous branch of proper digital artery ,which is transported to finger volar for placement of a mechanical barrier between flexor digitorum superficialis /profundus tendons. The function outcomes of 14 patients (Group A) with flexor tendon repair in zone II with this new technique were compared with those of 32 patients (Group B) with flexor tendon repair in zone II with standard modified Kessler technique. This new technique may prevent serious adhesions between flexor digitorum superficialis /profundus tendons.</brief_summary>
