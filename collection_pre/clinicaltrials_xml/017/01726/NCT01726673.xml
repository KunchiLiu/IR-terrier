	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate if multiple therapy sessions of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS non-invasive brain stimulation) combined with robotic arm therapy lead to a greater functional recovery in upper limb mobility after stroke than that provided by robotic arm therapy alone.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>18 years of age or older First single focal unilateral lesion with diagnosis verified by brain imaging, which occurred at least 6 months prior Cognitive function sufficient enough to understand experiments and follow instructions FuglMeyer assessment of 7 to 58 out of 66 (neither hemiplegic nor fully recovered motor function in the muscles of the shoulder, elbow, and wrist) Botox treatment within 6 weeks of enrollment Fixed contraction of the affected limb Complete flaccid paralysis of the affected limb History of hemorrhagic stroke Ongoing use of CNS active medications Ongoing use of psychoactive medications Presence of additional potential tDCS/TMS risk factors including damaged skin at site of stimulation, presence of a magnetically/mechanically active implant, metal in the head, family history of epilepsy, and personal history of seizures</criteria>
