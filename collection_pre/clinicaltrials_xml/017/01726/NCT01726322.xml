	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : To determine whether pre-treatment levels of anti-mullerian hormone predicts ovarian follicular reserve post adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer and chemotherapy induced amenorrhea (CIA). Secondary Objective - To evaluate the comparative ovarian toxicity of differing neo-adjuvant/ adjuvant chemotherapy regimens. - To assess the correlation between CIA and depletion of ovarian follicular reserve. - To partly externally validate preceding studies of anti-mullerian hormone levels in patients receiving neo-adjuvant/ adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. - To determine the efficacy of GNRH agonists in preservation of ovarian follicles in premenopausal women treated with adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. Administration of GNRH agonists is dependent on the treating oncologist's judgment of the patient's case and practices and is not to be influenced by study participation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Type of Study: Translational Study Sample Type: A 10mL blood sample will be collected in red vacutainer tubes (no anticoagulant, no gel) from each patient at the designated time points +/- 7days. Blood should preferably be collected in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Time of Sample procurement: - 1st Sample: Pre-Chemotherapy (â‰¤ 14 days pre-treatment) - 2nd Sample: e.g. before cycle 3, if undergoing a 4 cycle regimen or before cycle 4 in a 6 cycle regimen. (If the chemotherapy regimen changes following the commencement of chemotherapy &amp;/or after surgery, then blood samples will be taken at the time points determined by the original plan i.e. if a patient was to have 6 cycles of chemotherapy and this was then changed to 4 cycles samples will be taken before cycle 4) - 3rd sample: 3 weeks following the last dose of chemotherapy - 4th sample: 3 months following the last dose of chemotherapy - 5th sample: 6 months following the last dose of chemotherapy - 6th sample: 1 year following the last dose of chemotherapy - 7th sample: 2 years following the last dose of chemotherapy - 8th sample: 3 years following the last dose of chemotherapy Patient's menstrual status including the commencement date of last menstrual period or the use of Intra Uterine Devices (IUD) and FSH, LH and E2 levels will be documented on the Baseline Assessment CRF. FSH, LH and E2 levels will also be measured at each time point and documented on the Follow-up Assessment CRF.</detailed_description>
