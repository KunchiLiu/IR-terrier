	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if tailoring multiple sessions of upper extremity robotic therapy to focus on a particular aspect of movement (e.g smoothness vs. aiming; active range of motion vs. functional practice)can optimize therapeutic results and lead to greater functional returns in arm mobility after stroke.</brief_summary>
