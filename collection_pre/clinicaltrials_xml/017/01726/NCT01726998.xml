	<brief_summary>The investigators aimed in this study to investigate the effects of 4 weeks robot-assisted locomotor training on motor recovery of lower extremities and walking ability compared with the conventional gait training in subacute post-stroke non-ambulatory hemiplegic patients. 72 first-ever stroke patients who could not walk independently (FAC &lt; 2), and suffered within 6 months were enrolled and randomly assigned into 2 groups. The subjects with congestive heart failure, malignancies, cardiopulmonary dysfunctions, and who could not walk independently before stroke attack were excluded. Two groups received 30 minutes conventional gait training including Neurodevelopmental Treatment (NDT) basically. The robotic assisted locomotor training group received additional robotic-assisted gait therapy for 30minutes with Lokomat® (Hocoma, Zurich, Switzerland) daily for 4 weeks, and the conventional gait training group received additional daily conventional gait training with NDT for the same periods. The independent walking ability(FAC ≥ 3), Functional Ambulation Category (FAC), Motricity index (MI), Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA), Modified Barthel Index (MBI), Medical Research Council (MRC) for each lower extremity muscles were assessed before, during (2weeks) and after training. And the independent walking ability were followed until 3 months.</brief_summary>
