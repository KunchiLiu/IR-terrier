	<brief_summary>Rigid thoracoscopy is an established procedure for the performance of pleural biopsies for undiagnosed pleural effusions. The semirigid thoracoscope is a relatively new instrument designed for the same purpose which is claimed to be more user-friendly. The two devices have not been compared in a head-to-head trial in published literature. The investigators attempt to conduct a randomised comparative trial between the two devices.</brief_summary>
