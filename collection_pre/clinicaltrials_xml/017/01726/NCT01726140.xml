	<brief_title>CPAP Reduces Hypoxemia After Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We want to test the hypothesis that the application of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) after extubation in patients undergoing cardiac surgery can reduce hypoxemia and re-intubation rate. Primary end point: to reduce the rate of re-intubation. Secondary end point: to reduce the incidence of atelectasis, pneumonia, sepsis, the mortality rate, the intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay.</detailed_description>
