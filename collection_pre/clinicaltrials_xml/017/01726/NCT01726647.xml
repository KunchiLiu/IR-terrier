	<brief_summary>Objectives: The primary objective of this clinical trial is to characterize metabolic signatures associated with abdominal fat distribution in 40 women with different BMI 29-40 and different abdominal distribution of fat (visceral vs. sub-cutaneous fat). No intervention with a product is planned. The subjects will be given one high fat meal with commercial products (eggs, milk, cream, bread, fruits, cheese and cheese) on one test day to test the post-prandial metabolic response.</brief_summary>
