	<brief_summary>The proposed study aims to objectively assess 2-year clinical and radiographic results for the rate of glenoid component loosening in total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA). This retrospective radiographic review will provide evidence for equivalence or superiority in curtailing loosening, a known complication in arthroplasty, when a hemostatic agent is utilized in conjunction with cement at the glenoid.</brief_summary>
