	<brief_summary>This six center international study will include two United Kingdom National Health Service centers, two centers in Melbourne, Australia and one center each in Denmark and Spain. The objective of the study is to evaluate subject acceptance of the a new insulin pump and transmitter together with the accompanying training materials. Descriptive data from participant questionnaires and device uploads will be evaluated. Pediatric subjects between the ages of 7 - 18 years and adults from the age of 19 years of age upwards, who currently use an insulin pump in the management of their type 1 or type 2 diabetes, will be invited to participate. Each subject will be trained on the study device and then use it for approximately six weeks. During this time there will be three in-clinic visits and four follow-up phone calls, scheduled at the subjects' convenience. At the end of this period, they will revert back to their original insulin pump and complete a questionnaire on the study pump training materials, features and usability.</brief_summary>
