	<detailed_description>Glaucoma is the leading cause irreversible blindness worldwide, but only less than 10% glaucoma patients were diagnosed in the country of Asia areas. In the country of China, patients who are low educational level and less known acknowledgement and information have less known glaucoma. In the help of the government and some international non-governmental organizations(NGOs), a lot of people in the country know the cataract, and the operability of cataract is increase. Because vision loss usually development after operation for glaucoma. If patients did not understand this, they may be not only do not accept operation, but also affect operability of cataract. We hope the educational intervention for glaucoma can increase the degree of satisfaction in glaucoma patients.</detailed_description>
