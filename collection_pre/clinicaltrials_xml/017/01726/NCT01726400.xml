	<brief_summary>The standard treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection is pegylated interferon alpha combined with ribavirin. Anaemia is a common complication occurring in up to 30% of subjects. Unfortunately, side effects of interferon and ribavirin therapy can require dose reductions, reducing the likelihood of sustained viral response. Recent data shows that interferon alpha may increase hepcidin (a key iron regulator) production, resulting in impaired iron availability for production of red blood cells. In this study, we will evaluate hepcidin levels in 30 patients with Hepatitis C who are treated with interferon containing regimes. If hepcidin plays a role in interferon-induced anaemia, cheap and readily available oral hepcidin inhibitors could be trialled to potentially reduce the impact of interferon alpha induced anaemia.</brief_summary>
