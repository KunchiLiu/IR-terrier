	<brief_title>Modafinil in the Treatment of PTSD (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a high rate of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in soldiers exposed to combat in Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF). Unfortunately, currently available treatments for combat-related PTSD have produced modest treatment gains at best. New treatment strategies that can be directed toward objectively measured correlates of PTSD are urgently needed. Specific Aims: 1) To determine if there is evidence for the effectiveness and tolerability of adjunctive modafinil in the treatment of combat-related PTSD. We hypothesize that OEF/OIF veterans with PTSD randomized to modafinil 100mg/day for four weeks will experience more improvement in PTSD symptoms than OEF/OIF veterans with PTSD randomized to placebo treatment for four weeks. 2) To determine if PTSD symptom severity is associated with electrophysiological and neuropsychological measures of pre-attention and attention and if these measures change to a greater degree in participants randomized to modafinil versus those randomized to placebo. We hypothesize modafinil treatment will result in greater changes in electrophysiological and neuropsychological measures of pre-attention and attention than placebo treatment.</detailed_description>
