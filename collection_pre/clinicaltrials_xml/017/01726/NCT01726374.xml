	<brief_summary>High-risk stage 1 NSGCTTs are curable with careful surveillance followed by 3 cycles of BEP (bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin with 500mg/m2 of etoposide per cycle) chemotherapy for the 40-50% of cases experiencing recurrence. Alternatively, adjuvant chemotherapy with 2 cycles of BEP(at a lower dose than that used for advanced disease - etoposide 360mg/m2) for these patients achieves the same outcome and avoids intensive surveillance, but delivers 33% more chemotherapy cycles on a population basis. If a single cycle of BEP at the dose used in advanced disease had a similar high rate of relapse-free survival (cure) to that seen with two lower dose cycles, this would reduce the overall burden of chemotherapy and healthcare resource usage and would be likely to lead to a change in practice globally.</brief_summary>
