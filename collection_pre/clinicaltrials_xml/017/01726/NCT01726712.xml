	<brief_summary>The Network Supported Engagement in Care (NSEC) intervention is a brief, theory based and culturally sensitive intervention designed to capitalize on organic yet underutilized social support networks in the lives of young black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) who have been recently diagnosed with HIV. The intervention has been developed with input from clients and their support network members, case managers, social workers, HIV primary care providers and pastoral care at a Federally Qualified Health Center. The goal of the intervention is to improve retention in care for newly diagnosed YBMSM who present for their first HIV primary care clinic appointment.</brief_summary>
