	<brief_title>Efficacy of Proximal Caries Infiltration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to test the clinical efficacy of caries infiltration to arrest proximal caries lesions in primary molars. It was hypothesized that infiltrated lesions (test lesions) will progress significantly less than non infiltrated lesions (control lesions). Additionally, it was hypothesized that dental anxiety and stress related to caries infiltration will be significantly less than dental anxiety related to a conventional restorative procedure. The study will be a controlled clinical trial with a split mouth design and blind evaluation of the outcome (caries progression). Caries progression will be evaluated annually, 12, 24, and 36 months after treatment.</detailed_description>
