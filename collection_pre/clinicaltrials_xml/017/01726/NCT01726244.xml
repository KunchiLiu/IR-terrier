	<brief_summary>One of the most cost effective intervention is to avoid unnecessary hospitalizations in the national health system. These unnecessary admissions are increasing for several years, reaching rates of over 30% in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or heart failure at two months of hospital discharge. There is scientific evidence suggesting that a multidisciplinary intervention consisting in controling disease and stress associated with disease, and modifying eating habits could reduce the number of hospitalizations due to disease decompensation. The main objective of the study is to assess the rate of readmissions at year of multidisciplinary intervention in patients with COPD and / or heart failure. We will select 144 patients who will be randomized to two groups (control and intervention group) and they will be followed for 12 months through 4 visits (1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months of hospital discharge). Patients assigned to the intervention group will be receive three educational sessions (one of them will be imparted by nursing, another by the nutritionist and the last one by the psychologist). In addition, patients with a BMI &lt;20 and / or&gt; 30 will receive a closer monitoring by the nutritionist). Patients assigned to the control group will receive usual care in clinical practice.</brief_summary>
