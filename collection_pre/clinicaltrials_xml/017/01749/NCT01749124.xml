	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study for a novel, automated telephone system called "My Coach Connect". The purpose of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of this telephone tool while engaging clients and providers in discussion groups and surveys to better understand how this tool impacts the care provided and their overall experience in healthcare. Clients will use this tool to leave voice messages and survey answers which their providers will have access to by logging in to a secure website. Providers will also be able to indicate using the website whether they found a particular narrative helpful or not. Providers will have access to audio recordings of the voice responses, transcribed text of the responses, as well as "word clouds" generated from the text. Word clouds are a method of displaying the content of text such that words that are used more frequently are displayed in a larger size than words used less frequently. Clients will call in to the system approximately twice a week for a period of four months.</brief_summary>
