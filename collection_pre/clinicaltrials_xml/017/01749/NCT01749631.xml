	<brief_title>Investigation of the Effectiveness of Sevoflurane Anaesthesia in Difficult to Intubate Egyptian Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, open-label, multicenter, post marketing, observational study to investigate the effectiveness of sevoflurane anaesthesia in difficult to intubate (DTI; Mallampati Score III or IV) Egyptian patients who had been prescribed sevoflurane for anaesthesia by their treating physician.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or nonpregnant female over 18 years who are undergoing surgery and using sevoflurane as the anesthetic agent and with Mallampati score III or IV 2.

Rheumatoid arthritis temporomandibular joint (TMJ) immobility 7. Diabetes mellitus 8. Waxy skin palm test 9. Decreased functional residual capacity (FRC) rapid desaturation (due to displaced diaphragm, increased closing capacity and small airway closure, increased oxygen consumption) 10. airway closure in supine position 11. Morbid obesity (body mass index [BMI] &gt;35) 12. Airway edema 13. Laryngospasm 14. Edentulous patients indent cheeks. 3. Patients willing to sign informed consent 1.
