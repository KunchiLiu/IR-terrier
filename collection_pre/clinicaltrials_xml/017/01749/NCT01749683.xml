	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to use MCE (myocardial contrast/perfusion echocardiography) to study and compare short/long term change of myocardial perfusion abnormality and cardiac outcome in diabetic patients after nonfatal MI (heart attack), who are treated with different glucose control agents.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diabetic and nondiabetic patients will be initially recruited and studied after acute nonfatal MI and revascularization with either PCI or CABG Patients are excluded if they are older than 70 year old, require mechanical ventilation, are receiving intravenous pressors or hemodynamic support, or if the motion of segments associated with infarctrelated artery can not be accurately determined.</criteria>
