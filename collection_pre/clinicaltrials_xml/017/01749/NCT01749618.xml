	<brief_summary>Rheumatologists treating patients with seronegative arthritis will be randomized to treat their patients to a target or to treat their patients under their usual standard of care. All physicians will perform an initial chart audit. Following the initial chart audit, all physicians in the treat-to-target group will receive accredited educational training. Six months after the initial chart audit, all physicians will perform a repeat audit to see if patients are assessed more systematically and treated to a target of low disease state.</brief_summary>
