	<brief_summary>In participants with a diagnosis of open angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT), the primary objective is to demonstrate that the mean IOP reduction after 3 months of treatment with BOL-303259-X once daily (QD) is non-inferior to timolol maleate 0.5% twice daily (BID). The secondary objective is to demonstrate the superiority of BOL-303259-X QD to timolol maleate 0.5% BID. This assessment will be performed if the non-inferiority of BOL-303259-X QD to timolol maleate 0.5% BID is determined. An open label safety phase will be conducted at the end of Visit 6 (3 months) where all participants will receive BOL-303259-X QD for an additional 3 months.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participants must have a diagnosis of OAG (including pigmentary or pseudoexfoliative) or OHT in 1 or both eyes. Participants must meet the following IOP requirements at Visit 3 mean/median IOP ≥ 24 mmHg at a minimum of 2 time points in the same eye IOP ≤ 36 mmHg at all 3 measurement time points in both eyes. Participants with a bestcorrected visual acuity (BCVA), using the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol, of +0.7 logMAR units (Snellen equivalent of approximately 20/100) or better in either eye. Participants with known hypersensitivity or contraindications to latanoprost, NO treatment, timolol maleate, other betaadrenergic receptor antagonists or any of the ingredients in the study drugs. Participants with a central corneal thickness greater than 600 μm in either eye. Participants with advanced glaucoma and participants with a cup/disc ratio greater than 0.8 or a history of split fixation, or a field loss threatening fixation in either eye. Participants who do not have an intact posterior capsule in either eye . Participants with aphakia in either eye. Participants with previous or active corneal disease in either eye. Participants with current or a history of severe dry eye in either eye. Participants with current or a history of optic disc hemorrhage in either eye. Participants with current or a history of central/branch retinal vein or artery occlusion in either eye. Participants with current or a history of macular edema in either eye. Participants with very narrow angles (3 quadrants with less than Grade 2 according to Shaffer's anterior chamber angle grading system) and participants with angle closure,congenital, and secondary glaucoma, and participants with history of angle closure in either eye. Participants with a diagnosis of a clinically significant or progressive retinal disease in either eye. Participants with any intraocular infection or inflammation in either eye within 3 months(90 days) prior to Visit 1 (Screening). Participants with a history of ocular laser surgery in either eye within the 3 months(90 days) prior to Visit 1 (Screening). Participants with a history of incisional ocular surgery or severe trauma in either eye within 3 months (90 days) prior to Visit 1 (Screening).</criteria>
