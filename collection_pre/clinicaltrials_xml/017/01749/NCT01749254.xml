	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in Scotland and the Western World. Approaches to improve the identification of vulnerable or ruptured coronary atherosclerotic plaques are urgently needed to help risk stratification, to identify patients for intensive therapies, and to provide novel biomarkers for the development of anti-atherosclerotic drug interventions. Using positron emission tomography, we have recently shown that sodium 18-fluoride uptake holds major promise as a novel marker of plaque vulnerability and rupture. Here we wish to characterise coronary atherosclerotic plaque using 128-multidetector computed tomography combined with 18-fluorodeoxyglucose and sodium 18-fluoride positron emission tomography and Virtual histology-intravascular ultrasound in 80 patients with stable and unstable coronary artery disease. This has the potential to provide an innovative and highly valuable translational model with which to test novel therapeutic interventions targeted at reducing atheroma and plaque rupture. This could have major implications for the future treatment of cardiovascular disease.</brief_summary>
