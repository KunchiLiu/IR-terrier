	<brief_summary>The purpose of the current study was to examine the impact of macronutrient intake (PRO, 15% vs. 35%) and meal frequency (3 vs. 6 meals/day) on body composition, postprandial thermogenesis and plasma adipokines before and after 28days each of EB (28days) and ED (25%; 28days) in overweight individuals. We hypothesize that HP will elicit more favorable body composition, thermogenic, and cardiometabolic changes than HC intakes and the magnitude of change will be greatest in those consuming HP meals more frequently.</brief_summary>
