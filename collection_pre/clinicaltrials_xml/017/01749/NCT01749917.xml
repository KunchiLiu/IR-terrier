	<brief_title>Exercise Intervention and Dexterity in Parkinson</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Motor symptoms in Parkinson frequently affect upper extremities. This has been associated in previous studies with limitation in the performance of activities of daily living and, consequently, with a decrease in quality of life. The possibility that a brief intervention improves eye-hand dexterity in Parkinson's, may be a therapeutic option to improve the performance of activities of daily living. The investigators also conducted an intervention based in proprioceptive exercises and balance tasks to improve functionality.</detailed_description>
