	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ABH001 in the treatment of patients with epidermolysis bullosa who have wounds that are not healing. It is hypothesized that ABH001 may initiate and continue wound healing in patients with epidermolysis bullosa.</brief_summary>
