	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of PRTX-100 when various doses are given 5 times at weekly intervals to patients with active rheumatoid arthritis that are taking methotrexate or leflunomide. The drug is administered in a physician's office via an intravenous infusion. PRTX-100 may be effective in rheumatoid arthritis by suppressing the immune responses. PRTX-100 is a highly-purified bacterial protein called Staphylococcal Protein A. In this study, cohorts of patients with active RA will receive sequentially higher doses of PRTX-100. There will be an inactive placebo cohort for comparison. Patients who do not attain low RA disease activity, by a commonly used measure, will leave the study at 3 months after their first dose of study drug.</brief_summary>
