	<criteria>Key 1. Documented diagnosis of idiopathic/de novo MDS or nonproliferative chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), according to WHO criteria (white blood count, 13,000/uL), that meets International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) classification of low or intermediate1 risk disease as determined by microscopic and standard cytogenetic analyses of the bone marrow and peripheral complete blood count (CBC) obtained during screening. 2. Anemia defined as: 1. Mean hemoglobin concentration &lt; 10.0 g/dL of 2 measurements (one performed within one day prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 and the other performed 728 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1, not influenced by RBC transfusion within 7 days of measurement) for nontransfusion dependent patients (defined as having received &lt; 4 units of RBCs within 8 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1), OR 2. Transfusion dependent, defined as having received ≥ 4 units of RBCs within 8 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. 3. Serum erythropoietin levels and prior erythropoiesisstimulating agent (ESA) treatment: Dose escalation cohorts and expansion cohort 1 patients: Serum erythropoietin level &gt; 500 U/L, OR, if ≤ 500 U/L, patient is nonresponsive, refractory, or intolerant to erythropoiesisstimulating agents (ESAs), or ESAs are contraindicated or unavailable. Expansion cohort 2 patients: If patient is RS+ (defined as having ≥ 15% ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow), no prior ESA treatment and serum erythropoietin level ≤ 200 U/L. If a patient is RS (defined as having &lt; 15% ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow), prior ESA treatment and any serum erythropoietin level is allowed. 4. No alternative treatment options, per applicable MDS guidelines, are available and/or appropriate for the patient, at the discretion of the investigator. 5. ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2 (if related to anemia). 6. Adequate renal (creatinine ≤ 2 x upper limit of normal [ULN]) and hepatic (total bilirubin &lt; 2 x ULN and AST and ALT &lt; 3 x ULN) function. 7. Adequate transferrin saturation (≥ 15%), ferritin (≥ 50 µg/L), folate (≥ 4.5 nmol/L [≥ 2.0 µg/L]) and vitamin B12 (≥ 148 pmol/L [≥ 200 pg/mL]) during screening (supplementation and retest during screening is acceptable). 8. Females of child bearing potential (defined as sexually mature women who have not undergone hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or are not naturally postmenopausal ≥ 24 consecutive months) must have negative urine or blood pregnancy test prior to enrollment and use adequate birth control methods (abstinence, oral contraceptives, barrier method with spermicide, or surgical sterilization) during study participation and for 12 weeks following the last dose of ACE536. Males must agree to use a latex condom during any sexual contact with females of childbearing potential while participating in the study and for 12 weeks following the last dose of ACE 536, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy. Patients must be counseled concerning measures to be used to prevent pregnancy and potential toxicities prior to the first dose of ACE536. 9. Patients are able to adhere to the study visit schedule, understand and comply with all protocol requirements. 10. Patients understand and are able to provide written informed consent. Key 1. Prior treatment with azacitidine or decitabine. 2. Treatment within 28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 with: i) Erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA), ii) Granulocyte colonystimulating factor (GCSF) and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GMCSF), iii) Lenalidomide. 3. Iron chelation therapy if initiated within 56 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. 4. Treatment with another investigational drug or device, or approved therapy for investigational use ≤ 28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1, or if the halflife of the previous product is known, within 5 times the halflife prior to Cycle 1 Day 1, whichever is longer. 5. Major surgery within 28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. Patients must have completely recovered from any previous surgery prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. 6. Platelet count &lt; 30 x 109/L. 7. Any active infection requiring parenteral antibiotic therapy within 28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 or oral antibiotics within 14 days of Cycle 1 Day 1. 8. History of stroke, deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or arterial embolism within 6 months prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. 9. Known positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active infectious hepatitis B (HBV) or active infectious hepatitis C (HCV). 10. Any malignancy other than MDS which has not been in remission and/or has required systemic therapy including radiation, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy or surgery, within the last year prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. 11. Uncontrolled hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥ 150 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥ 100 mm Hg. 12. Pregnant or lactating females. 13. History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions or hypersensitivity to recombinant proteins or excipients in the investigational drug. 14. Any other condition not specifically noted above which, in the judgment of the investigator, would preclude the patient from participating in the study. 15. Transfusion event within 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. 16. Prior treatment with sotatercept (ACE011) or ACE536.</criteria>
