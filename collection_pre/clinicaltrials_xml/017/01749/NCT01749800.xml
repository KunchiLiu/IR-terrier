	<brief_summary>The overall goal of the proposed project is: (1) to perform a preliminary study to determine optimal galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) settings based on performance of one cognitive test of attention, and (2) to gather preliminary evidence of the effects of GVS in combination with computer-based attention training and motor training performed using a robotic system designed for rehabilitation, in a small cohort of TBI survivors (20 subjects).</brief_summary>
