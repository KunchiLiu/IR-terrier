	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Effects of ACE-536 in Patients With Beta-thalassemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate the proportion of β-thalassemia patients who have an erythroid response, defined as: 1. a hemoglobin increase of ≥ 1.5 g/dL from baseline for ≥ 14 days (in the absence of red blood cell [RBC] transfusions) in non-transfusion dependent patients, or 2. ≥ 20% reduction in RBC transfusion burden compared to pretreatment in transfusion dependent patients.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key Men or women &gt;=18 years of age For the dose escalation phase of the study: documented diagnosis of βthalassemia intermedia (transfusion dependent patients must not have begun regular transfusions at age &lt; 4.0 years). For the expansion cohort: documented diagnosis of βthalassemia (including βthalassemia major or βthalassemia intermedia). Prior splenectomy or spleen size &lt; 18 cm in the longest diameter by abdominal ultrasound (dose escalation cohorts only). Anemia, defined as: (i) mean hemoglobin concentration &lt; 10.0 g/dL of 2 measurements (one performed within one day prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 and the other performed during the screening period [Day 28 to Day 1]) in nontransfusion dependent patients, defined as having received &lt; 4 units of RBCs within 8 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1, or (ii) transfusion dependent, defined as requiring ≥ 4 units of RBCs every 8 weeks (confirmed over 6 months prior to Cycle 1 Day 1). Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN). Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN. Adequate pregnancy avoidance measures. Patients are able to adhere to the study visit schedule, understand and comply with all protocol requirements. Understand and able to provide written informed consent. Key Any clinically significant pulmonary (including pulmonary hypertension), cardiovascular, endocrine, neurologic, hepatic, gastrointestinal, infectious, immunological (including clinically significant allo or autoimmunization) or genitourinary disease considered by the investigator as not adequately controlled prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. Folate deficiency. Symptomatic splenomegaly. Known positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active infectious hepatitis B (HBV) or active infectious hepatitis C (HCV). Known history of thromboembolic events ≥ grade 3 according to the National Cancer InstituteCommon Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCICTCAE) v.4.0 (current active minor version). Ejection fraction &lt; 50% by echocardiogram, MUGA or cardiac MRI. Uncontrolled hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥ 150 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥ 95 mm Hg. Heart failure class 3 or higher (New York Heart Association, NYHA). QTc &gt; 450 msec on screening ECG. Platelet count &lt; 100 x10(9)/L or &gt; 1,000 x10(9)/L. Proteinuria ≥ Grade 2. Any active infection requiring parenteral antibiotic therapy within 28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 or oral antibiotics within 14 days of Cycle 1 Day 1. Treatment with another investigational drug or device, or approved therapy for investigational use ≤ 28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1, or if the halflife of the previous investigational product is known, within 5 times the halflife prior to Cycle 1 Day 1, whichever is longer. Transfusion event within 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. Patients receiving or planning to receive hydroxyurea treatment. Patients must not have had hydroxyurea within 90 days of Cycle 1 Day 1. Splenectomy within 56 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. Major surgery (except splenectomy) within 28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. Patients must have completely recovered from any previous surgery prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. Iron chelation therapy initiated within 56 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. Cytotoxic agents, systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, or anticoagulant therapy such as warfarin or heparin within 28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (prophylactic aspirin up to 100 mg/d is permitted). Pregnant of lactating females. History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions of hypersensitivity to recombinant proteins or excipients in the investigational drug. Prior treatment with sotatercept (ACE011) or ACE536.</criteria>
