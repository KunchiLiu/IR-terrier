	<brief_summary>Telehealth remote patient monitoring is a means of using communications technology - such as telephones, computers, and the Internet - to connect patients remotely with their healthcare team from their homes. The investigators hope to learn more about improving healthy behaviors and blood glucose among persons with diabetes using telehealth remote patient monitoring technology to connect directly with nurse care coordinators. The purpose of this study is to evaluate a process for improving blood glucose and healthy behaviors among people with type 2 diabetes using telehealth remote patient monitoring technology with nurse care coordinators. Some of the people in this study will work with a nurse care coordinator who will review your blood glucose weekly and call you at home every month for 3 months, while some of the people in this study will simply receive their normal care. At the end of the study, every participant will be asked questions about how they feel about their health care.</brief_summary>
