	<brief_summary>The overall purpose of this study is to obtain a better understanding of the biological response of red blood cells to sulforaphane contained in fresh broccoli sprouts that have been put through a blending process. This study will use commercially available fresh broccoli sprouts certified by Brassica Protection Products LLC (BroccoSprouts®). This product can also be purchased at some local grocery stores in the produce section. It is believed that NRF2, a transcription factor encoded by the NFE2L2 gene, plays a role in the regulation of defense against oxidative stress. The detrimental accelerated breakdown of sickle cell disease (SCD) red blood cells (SS RBC) is partially due to reduced anti-oxidative capacity. Previous analysis of SS RBC microRNAs revealed that a reduced level of NRF2, the master regulator of anti-oxidative stress capacity, contributes to reduced resistance to oxidative stress and increased hemolysis; NRF2 also induces fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which is known to prevent SS RBC sickling. First, erythroid progenitors from normal and SCD subjects will be tested ex-vivo to find out how sulforaphane, a natural NRF2 activator, affects the oxidative stress capacity, HbF expression, and microRNA expression of red cells. Second, a pilot clinical trial will be conducted to determine the safety and physiological effects of 3 weeks of daily consumption of broccoli sprout homogenate in a cohort of Hb SS/SB0 thalassemia adult SCD patients. During this study, subjects RBCs will be assayed for changes in anti-oxidative stress capacity and microRNA composition in mature SCD red blood cells.</brief_summary>
