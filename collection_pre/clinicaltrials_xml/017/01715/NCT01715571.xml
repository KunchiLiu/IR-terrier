	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety, acceptability, and satisfaction of penile vibratory stimulation in treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). The secondary objective is to demonstrate subjective physiological response (erection, rigidity, orgasm) after four weeks of frequent device use and the satisfaction of penile erection and sexual intercourse with partner.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment of Penile Vibratory Stimulation Using the Viberect in Men With Mild-Moderate and No Erectile Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ED is the inability to develop and maintain an erection for satisfactory sexual intercourse or activity. ED is a highly prevalent medical condition often associated with multiple causes. It is estimated that more than 50 million American men suffer from mild/moderate to severe ED. Roughly 50% of men in their 50's, 60% of men in their 60's, and 70% of men in their 70's suffer from ED. The economic impact of ED is in the billions of dollars. More than 5 billion dollars a year are spent on the pro-erectile medications currently in the market. Penile vibratory stimulation mimics rapid and repetitive manual/hand stimulation of the penis. Vibratory stimulation of genitalia is considered safe by the medical community with important benefits including treatment of orgasmic dysfunction and stress urinary incontinence. No significant physical or emotional side-effects have been reported in the medical literature. A recent epidemiological study of the use of vibrators by American women and men has shown no complaints, and generally high satisfaction and improvement in sexual response. Penile erection is controlled by spinal autonomic centers, the activity of which is dependent on input from supraspinal centers and the genitalia. From a neurophysiological viewpoint, scientists believe that penile erection is a culmination of multiple successful nerve reflexes that initiate a vascular event. Simultaneous vibratory stimulation of both surfaces of the penis at high frequency (70-110 Hz) for 7-10 minutes can lead to gradual filling of the penis with arterial blood within minutes by activating the pudendo-cavernosal reflex. Additional physiological effects include progressive rhythmic contraction of the perineal muscles via the bulbocavernosus reflex, which helps in strengthening rigidity of erection. This will prepare the user for successful sexual intercourse. Subsequent orgasm and ejaculation can be very strong and amplified due to stronger contraction of the bulbospongiosus muscle and activation of higher ejaculatory centers. This study will assess daily or on-demand ease of use, safety, satisfaction, and efficacy of the home use of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared Viberect device by men with mild to moderate and no ED.</detailed_description>
