	<brief_title>Use of G-CSF Treatment in Recurrent Implantation Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We previously showed that G-CSF may be useful in the treatment of recurrent abortion. The G-CSF is a cytokine promoting leukocyte growth, but also trophoblast development. In this randomized sudy investigators will test this cytokine as a treatment for recurrent implantation failure after IVF, at leat three failed previous IVF attempts. The study will be conducted in 100 women with recurrent implantation failure The inclusion criteria will be, at least three previous failed IVF attempts where at least 8 good embryos were transferred, women less than 40 years old, absence of systemic diseases. These women will undergo IVF cycle and they will randomly divided in two groups: one (50 women) will be treated with subcutaneous G-CSF 60 micrograms/day from the day of transfer to the day of β-hCG test, and if it will be positive the treatment will be continued for other 40 days; the group of control will be treated with subcutaneous saline solution infusion in the same way of the study group. Primary outcomes will be considered: pregnancy rate and the of β-hCG levels at 14/21/28 and 35 days after embryo transfer.</detailed_description>
