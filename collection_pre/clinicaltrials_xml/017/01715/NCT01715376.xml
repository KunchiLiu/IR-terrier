	<brief_summary>Compared with standardized western medical drug therapy, this study is mainly about whether the combination of standardized western medical drug therapy and Chinese medical continued treatment, can further decrease the rate of cardiovascular events for stable angina patients and change the condition of angina.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Integrated Treatment by Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine in Reducing Cardiovascular Events</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will pick 1100 patients who are according with the II、III stage in CHD western medical diagnosis standard, treat them with combination of standardized western medical drug therapy and Chinese medical continued treatment, or only with standardized western medical drug therapy,the treat course will last 6 months. The patients will be separated in two groups: Integrative treatment of Chinese medicine and western medicine group(integrative group) and western medical group according to the exposure factors(whether the patients accept differentiation of TCM ) during the follow-up period, observe the main indexes: Primary Endpoint: all because of death, stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, revascularization. Secondary endpoint: the events needed hospitalization which are because of (acute coronary syndrome)ACS,heart failure, severe arrhythmia, and complications. Secondary indexes: angina symptoms. Including the attack times, lasting time, inducing factors of angina attacks, pain degree of angina, discontinue rate of nitroglycerin, and electrocardiogram.</detailed_description>
