	<brief_summary>The study population will be selected from the "Epidemiological study on the prevalence of Age related Macular Degeneration in Portugal" (Protocol N. CC-01-2009) where retinal photographic grading (current gold standard for AMD assessment) was performed to confirm AMD diagnostic. This study provides a population-based sample in which precise and contemporary information on the frequency of nutritional and lifestyle risk factors will be collected, enabling to evaluate whether the separate and/or joint effects of these factors, if found significant, are likely to have a major public health impact in terms of AMD.</brief_summary>
