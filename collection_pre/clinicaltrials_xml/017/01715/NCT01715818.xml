	<brief_summary>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter study will evaluate the potential of aleglitazar to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with stable cardiovascular disease and glucose abnormalities. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either aleglitazar 150 mcg orally daily or matching placebo.</brief_summary>
