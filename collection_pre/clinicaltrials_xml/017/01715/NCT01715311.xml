Patients with a mMRC dyspnea score ≥1 at Visit 2. Current or exsmokers who have a smoking history of at least 10 pack years. Patients who have not achieved acceptable spirometry results at runin, in accordance with American Thoracic Society (ATS) / European Respiratory Society (ERS) criteria for acceptability and repeatability. Patients who have had 2 or more COPD exacerbations that required treatment with antibiotics, systemic steroids (oral or intravenous) or hospitalization in the 12 months prior to Visit 1. Patients who have had a respiratory tract infection. Patients requiring longterm oxygen therapy (&gt;12 hours a day) on a daily basis. Patients with a) any history of asthma, or b) onset of respiratory symptoms prior to age 40 years. Patients with allergic rhinitis who use a H1antagonist or intranasal corticosteroids intermittently. Treatment with a stable dose is permitted. Patients with concomitant pulmonary disease (e.g., lung fibrosis, sarcoidosis, interstitial lung disorder, pulmonary hypertension) or active pulmonary tuberculosis Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
