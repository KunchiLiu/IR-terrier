	<brief_summary>Women with measured menstrual bleeding &gt;80ml per cycle and no contraindications to combined oral contraceptive use will be assigned to an oestradiol/nomegestrol acetate oral contraceptive for 3 cycles during which they will collect all menstrual blood and send all used sanitary protection to the laboratory at the University of Sydney for estimation of blood loss by the alkaline haematin method. Hypothesis: An estradiol/nomogestrel acetate (E2/NOMAC) combined pill will be effective in controlling HMB in the majority of women without structural pelvic pathology. Main outcome: The primary efficacy end-point will be the proportion of women with a reduction of menstrual blood loss ≥ 50% from baseline.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Women will collect menstrual blood for 3 cycles and will be eligible to enter the treatment phase if in two of the three pre-treatment cycles the measured menstrual blood loss (MBL)is &gt;80ml. The mean of these baseline MBL measurements will be the comparator for the efficacy treatment measurement. Iron studies (serum ferritin, Fe and transferrin) will also be measured pre and post treatment and related to women's assessment of their quality of life measured on a validated questionnaire.</detailed_description>
