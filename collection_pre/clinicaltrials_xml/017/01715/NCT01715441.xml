	<brief_summary>The aim of this multicenter randomized phase II trial is to determine the efficacy of sorafenib and irinotecan combination versus irinotecan monotherapy or versus sorafenib monotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer patients with KRAS mutated tumors after failure of all active drugs known to be effective.</brief_summary>
