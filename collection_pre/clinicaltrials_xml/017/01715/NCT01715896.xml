	<brief_summary>The primary objectives of this study is to explore the efficacy of mavrilimumab compared with golimumab in the treatment of adult subjects 18-80 years of age with moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have an inadequate response to one or more conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and/or one or two anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents (excluding golimumab) for efficacy or safety reasons.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Mavrilimumab Versus Anti Tumor Necrosis Factor in Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite the therapeutic improvements with recent biologic agents approved for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), there is still a significant unmet medical need for the treatment of subjects with this chronic disease to achieve a faster, more complete response, and higher rates of remission. The aim of the current study is to compare the efficacy and safety of a subcutaneous dose of mavrilimumab with a marketed treatment for RA (golimumab) in 120 adult subjects with moderate-to-severe active RA who have had an inadequate response to one or two anti-TNF agents with mavrilimumab. The design of the study was exploratory and not formerly statistically powered.</detailed_description>
