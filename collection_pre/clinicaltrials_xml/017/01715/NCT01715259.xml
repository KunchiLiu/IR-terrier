	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetic (how the drug concentrations change over time) profile of abiraterone acetate 1000 mg when administered as a single dose in male participants with impaired renal function compared to individuals with normal renal function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pharmacokinetic Study of Abiraterone Acetate in Male Participants With Impaired Renal Function Compared to Individuals With Normal Renal Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known) pharmacokinetics study evaluating a single dose of abiraterone acetate 1000 mg administered in male participants with end-stage renal disease compared to matched-control (matched for age and body mass index) participants with normal renal function. There will be approximately 8 participants in each cohort (group). The total study duration for each participant will be 36 days. Abiraterone acetate 1000 mg will be administered orally (by mouth) as a single dose in the fasted state on Day 1. No food will be ingested for 4 hours post-dose. Participants will be confined to the clinical research center from the day prior to dosing (Day -1) to Day 5 and will return to the clinic on Days 8, 15, and 22 for follow up. Serial pharmacokinetic samples will be collected and safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All participants: Nonsmokers or light smokers Body Mass Index of 1838 kg/m2 inclusive Negative drug test, at screening and Day 1, for breathalyzer alcohol and drugs of abuse Negative HIV antibody test at screening Clinical laboratory values within protocoldefined parameters Agrees to protocoldefined use of effective contraception Participants may have concurrent stable medical conditions and may be included if the deemed condition(s) will not introduce an additional risk factor and will not interfere with the study objectives and procedures Patients with renal impairment must additionally meet the following criteria: Must have protocoldefined criteria of endstage renal disease, moderate or mild renal impairment Evidence of stable renal impairment Control participants with normal renal function must additionally meet the following criteria: Must be in good health All participants: Medical history of malignancy except nonmelanoma skin cancer Participation in any other investigational study drug trial in which receipt of an investigational study drug occurred within 5 halflives of that drug or 30 days prior to dosing with abiraterone acetate, whichever is longer History of alcoholism or drug abuse within the past 12 months Significant history or clinical manifestation as determined by the Investigator of any significant metabolic, allergic, dermatological, hepatic, hematological, pulmonary, cardiovascular, immunologic, neurological, psychiatric or gastrointestinal conditions, surgery or resection that would potentially alter absorption and/or excretion of orally administered drugs Clinically significant arrhythmias and/or history or presence of a clinically significantly abnormal electrocardiogram Acute illness, especially any active and uncontrolled infection Not willing to refrain from strenuous exercise from 48hours prior to Day 1 and during the period of confinement at the clinical site Not willing to abstain from consuming: grapefruit or caffeinecontaining foods or beverages for 72 hours prior to Day 1 and alcoholcontaining foods or beverages for 24 hours prior to Day 1 Donation of blood or significant loss of blood within 56 days prior to Day 1 or planned donation of blood or plasma from screening through 30 days after Day 1, inclusive The use of any prescription or overthecounter (OTC) preparation known to significantly inhibit or induce liver enzymes involved in drug metabolism within 30 days prior to Day 1 Use of any prescription medications/products or any OTC, nonprescription preparations unrelated to existing allowable stable medical conditions within 5 halflives of that product or 7 days prior to dosing with abiraterone acetate, whichever is longer Any acute or chronic condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would limit the individual's ability to complete and/or participate in this clinical study Patients with renal impairment who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study: Acute or exacerbating renal disease, fluctuating or rapidly deteriorating renal function as indicated by widely varying or worsening of signs of renal impairment within 2 weeks of Day 1 Hypertension (systolic blood pressure [BP] &gt;180 or diastolic BP &gt;100) Control participants with normal renal function who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study: Hypertension (systolic BP &gt;=160 or diastolic BP &gt;=95) Any significant laboratory results consistent with renal impairment</criteria>
