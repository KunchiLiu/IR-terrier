	<brief_summary>Until recently, there was a lack of understanding and consensus among Chinese anesthesiologists how they should practice general anesthesia with volatile anesthetics, since there was no standard of inhalation practice. In August 2011, the Anesthesiology branch of the Chinese Medical Association launched the first version of Chinese Consensus of Standard Clinical Practice for Inhalation Anesthesia (Consensus) in order to standardize the practice in China. The proposed registry is aimed to evaluate the current inhalation practice one year after the Consensus has been released, and related patient outcome. This registry evaluated sevoflurane anesthesia, including screening, induction, maintenance, emergence, and follow-up within 24 hours post-operation.</brief_summary>
