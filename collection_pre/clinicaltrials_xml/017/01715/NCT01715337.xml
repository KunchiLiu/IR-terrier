	<brief_summary>Pulmonary rehabilitation has been established as an evidence-based and recommended therapy in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The aim of our study is to show a potential change in muscle fibre composition and in the amount of capillaries in quadriceps muscle from pre tob post 3-week rehabilitation. Pulmonary rehabilitation includes standardised exercise training, e.g. cycling and strength training for major muscle groups.</brief_summary>
