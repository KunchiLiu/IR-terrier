	<brief_title>CORRECT: COmmunity RegistRy Study Evaluating Dupuytren's Contracture Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, multi-center, observational study. Patients will be recruited based on the usual care presentation at each investigative site, as regular practice would dictate. Consecutive patients deemed eligible for the study by their physician will be invited to participate during their usual care visit. Enrolled patients will receive evaluations and treatment for Dupuytren's contracture according to the standard of care and clinical practice at each study site. No study-specific visits will be required as part of the study. Treatment and Follow-up Visits will be determined by the treating physician. Treatments received for Dupuytren's contracture will be recorded (ie, XIAFLEX, fasciectomy, or fasciotomy/needle aponeurotomy), including initial treatment and any subsequent therapy. The full prescribing information and medication guide for XIAFLEX is provided in this protocol as reference (Appendix B). Patient data (including treatment outcomes, joint contracture measured by the treating physician, and evidence of recurrence) and health care resource utilization data will be drawn from the patients' medical records, examination, and patient interviews. These data will be recorded via a web-based electronic data collection (EDC) system. PROs will be collected by self-completed questionnaires given to each patient via web-based data collection or telephone interviews. The site will follow up with the patient according to usual practice. Information from the patient's visit may include goniometry and the physician's assessment of treatment outcome and healthcare utilization. Patients will be considered enrolled in the study for a maximum of 4 years post-enrollment or until death, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, or study closure.</detailed_description>
