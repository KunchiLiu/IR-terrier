	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find the answers to the following research question(s): 1. Is the study drug equivalent to the approved drug, Doxil/Caelyx, and does it act the same way in the body as the approved drug? ATI-0918 is believed to be a generic of Doxil/Caelyx and this is what the study is trying to prove. All people who participate in this study will receive the research study medication (ATI-0918) and Doxil/Caelyx in addition to best supportive care (treatment for symptoms). The study drug being tested in this study works the same as the FDA (government) approved drug doxorubicin HCl. ATI-0918 is a generic (the same) formulation of doxorubicin HCl being delivered (given to the patient).</brief_summary>
