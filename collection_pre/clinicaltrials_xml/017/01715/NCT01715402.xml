	<brief_title>Optimization of Health Expenditure in Liver Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>a new dimension of the activity expected of physicians is to improve the safety of care on the one hand and the control of health care costs on the other. key measures to help them are the publication of national recommendations, assessment of actual practices and the incentive to activity. Internationalwide recent and concordant data suggest that - quality and security of care, after an initial improvement, are going to stall - scientific recommendations are rarely validated by an impact analysis and are not applied - clinical data collected within an administrative framework are unreliable and too generalist - the evaluation, especially in the surgical field, is based on indicators sometimes irrelevant and often unclear</detailed_description>
