	<brief_title>Three Methods for Best PEEP Determination Compared With PEEP Determination Guided by Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Network</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The determination of optimal level of Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory pressure remains elusive and controversial. Several approaches with different algorithms exist. Among them, Low PEEP algorithm approach and High PEEP algorithm approach. These approaches are characterized by a generalized application of certain level of PEEP according to a predefined algorithm. However, these algorithms fail to account for inter-individual variations between patients with different diseases and with different severities of the same underlying process. Therefore, we advocate for an individualized application of PEEP. Whereby, PEEP will be determined individually for each patient based on familiar and well established physiological parameters.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>20 Man and women older than 18 years will be recruited. Patients with acute respiratory failure of any cause who are mechanically ventilated according to the ARDS network recommendations will be considered for inclusion to the study. To be included in the study a prerequisite of high peak Inspiratory pressure (plateau pressure of 25 to 30 cmH2O) has to be present, and at least one of the following four severity inclusion criteria has to be met. 1 Low Total Respiratory system compliance (CT), defined as less than 50ml/cmH2O. 2 PaO2 /FIO2 ratio of less than 300. 3 Need for a PEEP greater than 10 cmH2O to maintain arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) of &gt; 90%. 4 carbon dioxide partial pressure (PCO2) over 60 mmHg, or PH less than 7.2 that is attributed to respiratory acidosis. Patients with any of the following will be excluded from the study. Previous lung or chest wall surgery, previous esophageal surgery, known Achalasia or any other esophageal motility or spasm disorder, presence of chest thoracostomy tube, and any significant chest wall abnormality such as kyphoscoliosis.</criteria>
