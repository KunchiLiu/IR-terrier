	<brief_summary>This is a phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study of CUDC-907 in patients with refractory or relapsed lymphoma or multiple myeloma. CUDC-907 is a multi-targeted agent designed to inhibit phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)and histone deacetylase (HDAC). The study is designed to assess the safety, including the maximum tolerated dose, biologically effective dose, the pharmacokinetics, and the anti-cancer activity of CUDC-907.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of CUDC-907 in Patients With Lymphoma or Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I, open-label, multi-center dose-escalation trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of CUDC-907 as a single agent administered orally, once daily, to patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma or multiple myeloma. The following dosing schedules may be examined, all consisting of 21-day cycles and including: (i) continuous once daily (QD), (ii) twice weekly on Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18 (BIW) (iii) thrice weekly on Days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19 (TIW) (iv) four days on/three days off on Days 1-4, 8-11, and 15-18 (4/3), and (v) five days on/two days off on Days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19 (5/2) Sequential dose escalation cohorts of oral CUDC-907 are planned. Subject enrollment and dose escalation will proceed according to a standard 3+3 design. In the absence of DLT, each subject will be treated for a minimum of 21 days, and may continue to receive additional treatment until disease progression has been documented or other treatment discontinuation criteria have been met. MTD or BED expansion cohorts of up to 36 evaluable (e.g., up to 12 subjects in each of 2 or 3 specific tumor types or subtype) to better define the safety, tolerability and preliminary antitumor and pharmacodynamic activity of the study treatment, as well as suitability as an RP2D and schedule. Safety and tolerability will be assessed by the incidence and severity of adverse events as determined by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.03). A Safety Review Committee (SRC) comprised of the Medical Monitor, Principal Investigators, and Sponsor representatives, will be convened to review safety information and to decide upon dose escalation and further subject enrollment. The antitumor activity of study treatment will be assessed according to standard response criteria as appropriate for each individual subject's tumor type (e.g., Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma and the International Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma). Exploratory biological markers of activity will be assessed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), plasma and tissue specimens (skin, tumor and bone marrow samples, where available).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects of ≥ 18 years of age with histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of lymphoma or multiple myeloma that is refractory to or relapsed after at least 2 prior regimens. Measurable or evaluable disease. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2. Recovery to Grade 1 or baseline of any toxicity due to prior systemic treatments (excluding alopecia). Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/µL; platelets ≥ 75,000/µL; creatinine ≤ 1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN); total bilirubin ≤ 1.5x ULN; AST/ALT ≤ 2.5x ULN. For subjects with documented liver metastases, the AST/ALT may be ≤ 5x ULN. Life expectancy of at least 3 months. Women of child bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test. Men and women of child bearing potential must agree to use adequate birth control throughout their participation in the study and for 30 days following the last study treatment. Able to provide written informed consent and to follow protocol requirements. Systemic anticancer therapy within 3 weeks of study entry, except for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C (6 weeks). Graft vs. host disease following prior allogeneic transplant within 3 months prior to study treatment. Other investigational agents within 21 days prior to study treatment. Pregnant or lactating/breastfeeding women. Ongoing treatment with chronic immunosuppressants. Active CNS lymphoma. Known gastrointestinal condition that would interfere with swallowing or the oral absorption or tolerance of CUDC907. Ongoing diarrhea defined as more than 1 watery stools/day. Serious infection requiring systemic antibiotic therapy within 14 days prior to study treatment. Uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular disease, including myocardial infarct or unstable angina within 6 months prior to study treatment, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II or greater congestive heart failure, serious arrhythmias requiring medication for treatment, clinically significant pericardial disease, or cardiac amyloidosis. Unstable or clinically significant concurrent medical condition that would, in the opinion of the investigator, jeopardize the safety of a subject and/or compliance with the protocol. No second primary malignancy within 2 years of study entry other than adequately treated nonmelanoma skin or superficial bladder cancer, curatively treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix or other curatively treated solid tumor deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive, hepatitis B surface antigenpositive status, or known or suspected active hepatitis C infection.</criteria>
