	<brief_summary>The study hypothesis is that lenalidomide and romidepsin (and dexamethasone for patients with myeloma) will have an acceptable toxicity profile and that in combination will have sufficient activity in the target population (including those previously refractory to HDACi monotherapy) to warrant further investigation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open Label, International, Multi-centre, Phase I/IIa Study of Lenalidomide (Revlimid) and Romidepsin (Istodax) for Relapsed /Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma, Mature T-cell Lymphoma and Multiple Myeloma. (RId Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Summary of rationale: 1. As individual agents, both the histone deacetylase inhibitors and lenalidomide have significant activity in each of the diseases in this study; 2. There is potential for the agents to synergize (to improve upon the response rates as there are both overlapping and disparate mechanisms of action.) Both agents may synergize to induce cell death through caspase 8-mediated and other mechanisms; both induce p21 and cell cycle arrest; both agents have anti-angiogenic effects; both are likely to interfere with PI3K/Akt signaling. One particularly attractive aspect of this combination is the potential for synergistic immunological effects, particularly related to T-cell polarization, NK cell activation, STAT signaling and cytokine production, as discussed above; 3. With respect to PTCL, CTCL and HL, there is a clear path for further drug development and registration if this trial proves that this is a safe and efficacious combination; 4. Myeloma is incurable and this is due to the persistence of a drug-resistant sub-clone of tumor-propagating cells that is drug insensitive. Preclinical data suggests that both HDACi and lenalidomide may target these tumor-propagating cells. This argues for examining this combination as part of early treatment in these diseases. This trial is the first step to examine the feasibility of combining an HDACi with what is front-line therapy in myeloma in the USA - lenalidomide. 5. Incorporating three separate arms (as opposed to three separate studies) will allow; i. The investigators to accumulate data on this novel combination across the three groups and evaluate the toxicity profiles to make informed decisions around dose-escalation. Because it is a single study, valid comparisons can be made across the groups, which would not be possible if they were separate studies. ii. combined and simplified collection of correlative tests across the three studies.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. All patients must have a biopsyproven diagnosis of one of the following malignancies that meets the additional diseasespecific inclusion criteria. A. Mature TCell lymphoma. The following entities are eligible. PTCL or CTCL (including MF and SS) but excluding adult Tcell leukemia/lymphoma, primary cutaneous CD30+ lymphoma, lymphomatoid papulosis, and NK or LGL leukemia.(The complete WHO classification of Tcell lymphoma can be found in the appendices). 1. Peripheral Tcell lymphoma: patients must have relapsed or progressed after: at least one prior chemotherapybased treatment, or not suitable for a conventional chemotherapeutic approach as judged by the investigator. 2. Sezary syndrome/ Mycosis Fungoides: patients must have relapsed or progressed after at least one prior systemic therapy. B. Hodgkin lymphoma 1. At least one prior chemotherapybased treatment. 2. Prior autograft in those eligible for autologous transplantation according to institutional guidelines. C. Myeloma 1. Relapsed after at least one prior systemic therapy that includes thalidomide (unless intolerant or contraindicated) or lenalidomide. Those who have received prior lenalidomide must have had a response that exceeded 6 months. 2. Patients who are candidates for autologous stem cell transplant in first remission are not eligible. 3. Patients must have failed/relapsed after bortezomib therapy. 2. ECOG performance status &lt;2 3. Age &gt;18 years. 4. Life expectancy ≥90 days. 5. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below: absolute neutrophil count &gt;1.0 x109/L (or greater than 0.75x109/L if &gt;50% plasma cells or &gt;50% lymphoma in the bone marrow) Neutrophil count must not be supported by GCSF prior to study entry. platelets &gt;100 x109/L (or &gt;75 x 109 if &gt;50% plasma cells or &gt;50% lymphoma in the bone marrow). (Transfusion to achieve these goals would not qualify the patient) total bilirubin &lt;1.5x the institutional upper limit of normal. (&lt;2.5x for Gilbert's disease). AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt;2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal Creatinine clearance &gt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the dose escalation phase, and &gt;30 mL/min/1.73 m2 in phase II. Serum potassium &amp; magnesium Serum potassium ≥3.8 mmol/L Serum magnesium ≥1.8mg/dL /0.75mmol/L (supplementation is allowed) 6. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL within 10 14 days and again within 24 hours prior to prescribing lenalidomide for Cycle 1 and must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth control, one highly effective method and one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28 days before she starts taking lenalidomide. FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing. Men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with a FCBP even if they have had a successful vasectomy. 1.
