	<brief_summary>Bleeding under vitamin K antagonists are a major iatrogenic causes of hospitalization, subject to a fatal outcome in more than one third of cases, mortality is particularly high in cases of serious bleeding, including intracerebral hemorrhage. If the INR measured in these patients are often away from the higher value of the target range, a significant proportion of bleeding were observed for INR between 2 and 3. The study captures the components of the nutritional status of patients on oral anticoagulants, including any micronutrient deficiencies, to determine whether nutritional status is an independent risk factor for bleeding</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nutritional Status of Patients Victims of Haemorragic Accidents With Antivitamins K</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Be included in this study patients under anti-vitamin K supported or followed the emergency department Adults. The inclusion visit will be conducted in the emergency department Adults Clermont-Ferrand by an emergency physician or investigator or co-investigator. The protocol will be explained to patients in detail, the information document and consent will be issued for playback, then they will be asked to sign the consent form and participation agreement. Case-control study: patients under oral anticoagulant with severe hemorrhagic accident compared with patients without hemorrhagic accident. Cases will be matched to controls based on age, sex, and the value of the INR. Patients will be divided into two groups: - Group 1: cases Patient under anti-vitamin K with a serious bleeding event that required treatment in the emergency Adults. Is considered serious accident requiring the use of a reversion by PPSB (Kaskadil ®). - Group 2: contols Patient under anti-vitamin K with no haemorrhagic manifestations admitted for another reason to Emergency Adults Each case will be paired with two controls</detailed_description>
