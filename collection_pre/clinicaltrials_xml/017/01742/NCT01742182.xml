	<brief_summary>Disruption of sleep and alertness is one of the most disabling non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Mechanisms leading to impaired sleep and alertness in PD are not well understood, and treatment options remain limited. The proposed research will examine markers of the circadian system, sleepiness and sleep quality in PD patients and healthy controls. Further, the project will examine effects of bright light exposure on circadin function, sleep and alertness in PD.</brief_summary>
