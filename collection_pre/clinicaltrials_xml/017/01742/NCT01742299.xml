	<criteria>1. Patient is currently enrolled in a Novartissponsored, Oncology Clinical Development &amp; Medical Affairs study receiving imatinib and has fulfilled all their requirements in the parent study. 2.Patient is currently benefiting from the treatment with imatinib, as determined by the investigator. 3. Patient has demonstrated compliance, as assessed by the investigator, with the parent study protocol requirements.4. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans and any other study procedures. 5. Written informed consent obtained prior to enrolling in rollover study. 1. Patient has been permanently discontinued from imatinib treatment in the parent study due to unacceptable toxicity, noncompliance to study procedures, withdrawal of consent or any other reason. 2. Patient has participated in a Novartis sponsored combination trial where imatinib was dispensed in combination with another study medication and patient is still receiving combination therapy. 3. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive hcG laboratory test. 4. Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception during the study and for 30 days after the final dose of imatinib. Male patients must use highly effective contraception during the study and for 30 days after the final dose of imatinib. Highly effective contraception is defined as either: Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment. Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to enrolling). For female patients on the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient. Use of a combination of any two of the following (a+b or a+c, or b+c): 1. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception. 2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) 3. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository Women are considered postmenopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks prior to enrolling. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential. If a study patient becomes pregnant or suspects being pregnant during the study or within 30 days after the final dose of imatinib, the investigator needs to be informed immediately and ongoing study treatment with imatinib has to be stopped</criteria>
