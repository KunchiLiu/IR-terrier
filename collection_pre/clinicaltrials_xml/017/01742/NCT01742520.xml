	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of sucrose 24% for pain prevention on preterm infants. Our hypothesis is that repeated doses of sucrose 24%, given prior to painful procedure,do not impair neurodevelopmental outcomes of preterm infants</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neurodevelopmental Outcomes of Preterm Infants Treated for Pain Management With Repeated Doses of Sucrose 24%</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>preterm infants born at 27-33 weeks gestational age at Sheba Medical Center will be recruited for this study. Prior to invasive procedure infants will be treated with pacifier and swaddling as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and Canadian Pediatric Society. Group 1.Will be treated with Sucrose 24% 0.1-0.5ml on the anterior pat of the tongue 1-3 min prior to invasive procedure. Group 2. Similar to group 1 but breast milk or formula will replace Sucrose. Number of invasive procedures/day will be documented General Movements by Prechtel will be used for developmental assessment at 2,4,6 weeks after birth and at 14-16 weeks corrected age Griffiths developmental scales (GMDS) will be used at 40 weeks, 14-16 weeks corrected age, and 3-6 month corrected age</detailed_description>
