	<brief_summary>This study is to evaluate if Bio-absorbable Felt(NEOVEIL速) makes the amount of exudate reduce and shortens time until drain removal after minimally invasive surgery for early gastric cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Study for the Impact of Bio-absorbable Felt (NEOVEIL速) With Fibrin Sealant on Removal of Drainage Tube After Minimally Invasive Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We investigate the effect on drainage amount of Bio-absorbable Felt(NEOVEIL速) after D1+b or D2 lymphadenectomy with distal gastrectomy for early gastric cancer. This study is an randomised controlled trial undertaken in 7 centers in South Korea. Patients with stage I-II gastric cancer who is going to have curative distal gastrectomy with D1+b or D2 lymphadenectomy are randomly assigned to use bio-absorbable felt(NEOVEIL速) or not to use it. Block randomisation will be done by a central interactive computerised system, stratified by center.</detailed_description>
