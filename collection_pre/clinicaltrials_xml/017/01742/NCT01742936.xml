	<brief_summary>The current study proposes to investigate Point of Care Testing (POCT) (Coagcheck®) and compare obtained results versus standard laboratory coagulation parameters prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT). The time difference in obtaining the two results will also be examined. A total of 100 pediatric patients undergoing spinal surgery or cardiopulmonary bypass will be enrolled and consented per protocol. Blood samples will be obtained simultaneously tested on both the standard laboratory apparatus and the Coagcheck® device. If the two results are comparable, this could have immediate clinical application and impact in the operating room as POCT results are available within 2-3 minutes compared to 1-2 hours for standard laboratory samples.</brief_summary>
