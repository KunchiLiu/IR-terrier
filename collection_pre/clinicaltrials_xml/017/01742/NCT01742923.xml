	<brief_summary>Patients with hypertension have an increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction. However, poor adherence to treatment with antihypertensives and lipid-lowering agents occurs frequently within this patient group. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a complex tailored intervention in a hospital setting will lead to increased medication adherence and fewer cardiovascular events when compared to a usual care group. Interventions focus on motivational interviewing, medication review and telephone follow up.</brief_summary>
