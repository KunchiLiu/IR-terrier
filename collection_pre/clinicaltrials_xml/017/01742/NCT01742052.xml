	<criteria>RRMS as defined by the revised McDonald criteria Evidence of recent MS activity defined as either: at least one documented relapse in the previous 12 months, OR a positive gadolinium (Gd)enhanced MRI scan within 3 months prior to screening, OR at least two documented relapses in the previous 24 months with a positive Gdenhanced MRI scan within the previous 12 months Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS) score ≥0.0 and ≤5.5 points. Primary progressive, secondary progressive or progressive relapsing MS at screening Disease duration &gt;15 years combined with an EDSS score ≤2.0 Relapse of MS during the Screening Period History or known presence of other neurological disorders likely to render the subject unsuitable for the study History of any of a list of predefined cardiovascular diseases History or known presence of any significant central nervous system, infectious, metabolic, oncological, ophthalmological or respiratory system disease or illness likely to render the subject unsuitable for the study Previous exposure to any sphingosine 1phosphate receptor modulator Receipt of a live vaccine or systemic corticosteroid use within 28 days prior to randomisation Previous treatment with betainterferons or glatiramer acetate within 14 days prior to randomisation Previous treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis, certain immunosuppressants, lymphocytedepleting therapy, total body irradiation or bone marrow transplantation Need, or likely need for, treatment with Class I or III antiarrhythmic drugs or with heartratelowering betablockers or calciumchannel blockers, or with any other drugs which can reduce the heart rate Evidence of significant anaemia, thrombocytopenia, leucopoenia or lymphocytopenia, renal or hepatic impairment Clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) findings.</criteria>
