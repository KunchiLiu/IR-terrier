	<brief_summary>This is a phase 2 multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-arm study for subjects with locally recurrent or metastatic triple negative breast cancer. Patients will be randomized 2:1 to either tivozanib hydrochloride and weekly paclitaxel or placebo and weekly paclitaxel. Subjects will be stratified based on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score (0 vs 1) and line of treatment (first vs second). All subjects will be evaluated for progression free survival and overall survival as well as safety and tolerability. Biomarker and pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis are also included in study. This study will determine whether tivozanib hydrocholoride combined with weekly paclitaxel improves clinical outcomes in patients with triple negative breast cancer.</brief_summary>
