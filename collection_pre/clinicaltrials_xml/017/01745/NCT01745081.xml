	<brief_summary>Mannitol 20% has long been used to treat elevated intracranial hypertension in trauma and intensive care settings. More recent data indicate that hypertonic saline may be as effective or more effective than mannitol for this purpose, with possible fewer side effects. This study compares both agents in favoring cerebral relaxation during elective supratentorial procedures for tumor resection. Study hypothesis: 3% hypertonic saline will provide better cerebral relaxation with fewer side effects than 20% mannitol.</brief_summary>
