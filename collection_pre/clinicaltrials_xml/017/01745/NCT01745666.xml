	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to evaluate the best stress exam to unmask long QT in patient with KCNQ1 or KCNH2 mutation without long QT interval in rest electrocardiogram.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Between Epinephrine and Exercise Test in QT Long Syndrome Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>65 patients with KCNQ1 or KCNH2 mutation presenting QTc interval &lt;470msec and 65 patients without KCNQ1 or KCNH2 mutation presenting QTc interval &lt;470msec will be included. All patients will have the 2 tests: exercise test and epinephrine test, in one half day. At the end of the inclusions, two experts will examine examens results without knowing in which arm (mutated or not) the patient belongs.</detailed_description>
