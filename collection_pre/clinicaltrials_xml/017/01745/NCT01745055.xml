	<brief_summary>This study was designed to estimate the effects of methotrexate (MTX) on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CP-690,550 when administered to subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), to estimate the effects of CP-690,550 on the PK of MTX and to evaluate the short-term safety and tolerability of co-administration of CP-690,550 and MTX.</brief_summary>

Treatment with an oral stable weekly dose of Methotrexate (MTX) (1525 mg/week, administered as a single dose [SD]) for a minimum of 4 doses (4 weeks) Blood dyscrasias including confirmed: Hemoglobin &lt;9 g/dL or Hematocrit &lt;30%; White blood cell count &lt;3.0 x 109/L; Absolute neutrophil count &lt;1.2 x 109/L; Platelet count &lt;100 x 109/L Evidence or history of clinically significant infections within the past 6 months (eg, those requiring hospitalization, requiring parenteral antimicrobial therapy, or those with recurrent oral or genital herpes, recurrent herpes zoster, or any infection otherwise judged by the investigator to have the potential for exacerbation by participation in the trial. Total bilirubin, AST (aspartate aminotransferase) or ALT (alanine aminotransferase) more than 1.2 times the upper limit of normal at the Screening visit, or a history of clinically significant elevated liver function tests (LFTs) while on current MTX dose or chronic liver disease, recent or active hepatitis.</criteria>
