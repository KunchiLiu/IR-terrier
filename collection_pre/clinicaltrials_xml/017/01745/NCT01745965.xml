	<brief_summary>Trial to optimize neoadjuvant therapy for HER overexpression and co-expressing of hormone receptors(ER and/or PR) breast cancer (HEr2+/HR+). A new high potential trastuzumab conjugate T-DM1(trastuzumab was linked with the cytotoxic agent mertansine DM1)was tested with endocrine therapy and without against a standard arm with trastuzumab and endocrine therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective, Randomized Multicenter, Open-label Comparison of Preoperative Trastuzumab Emtansine (T-DM1) With or Without Standard Endocrine Therapy vs. Trastuzumab With Standard Endocrine Therapy Given for Twelve Weeks in Patients With Operable HER2+/HR+ Breast Cancer Within the ADAPT Protocol.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>the neoadjuvant therapy Patients with HER2+/HR+ (HER2+ and ER+ and/or PR+) tumor will receive single agent T-DM1 for 12 weeks (3,6 mg/kg q3w) with or without standard endocrine therapy (tamoxifen in premenopausal women and an aromatase inhibitor in postmenopausal women, if not contraindications are present, in a standard daily dosage). The control group will receive trastuzumab in 3-weekly schedule (8 mg/kg as loading dose and then 6 mg/kg q3w) in combination with the same standard endocrine therapy, if no contraindications are existent.</detailed_description>
