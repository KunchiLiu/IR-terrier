	<brief_title>SB-659032 Platelet Aggregation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SB-659032 is a selective and orally active inhibitor of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) that is being developed for the treatment of atherosclerosis. This study is designed to assess whether inhibition of plasma Lp-PLA2 activity impacts platelet function as assessed by ex vivo platelet aggregation tests and in vivo plasma biomarkers. Blood samples for PK analysis and measurement of Lp-PLA2 activity will also be collected. Questionnaires will be completed to evaluate the frequency of odorrelated AEs with non-enteric coated formulation of SB-659032 relative to placebo. This will be a double blind, repeat dose, randomized, placebo-controlled, two period, period balanced, crossover study. There will be a minimum of a 21 day washout period between dosing in each period.</detailed_description>
