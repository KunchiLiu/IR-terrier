	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1b, multi-center, double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study designed to evaluate the safety and biological activity of two doses of EBI-005 ophthalmic solution versus placebo in subjects with moderate to severe Dry Eye Syndrome. Approximately 72 subjects will be enrolled and randomized in this study at up to 9 centers located in the United States (US). Subjects will be enrolled in two groups or cohorts. The first enrollment group will consist of 33 subjects.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- To investigate the safety and tolerability of EBI-005 ophthalmic solution compared to placebo in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Dry Eye Syndrome (DES). - To evaluate pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and immunogenicity of two different doses of EBI-005 ophthalmic solution. - To investigate the biological activity of multiple doses of EBI-005 ophthalmic solution compared to placebo as assessed by both objective and subjective assessments. - To investigate the comparative dose response of two different doses of EBI-005 ophthalmic solution. - To investigate the comparative tolerability of two different doses of EBI-005 ophthalmic solution. - To identify key biomarkers in the diagnosis and management of subjects with DES.</detailed_description>
