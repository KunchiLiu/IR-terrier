	<detailed_description>In patients with sarcoidosis, cardiac death is a leading cause of mortality which may represent unrecognized cardiac involvement. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) can detect cardiac involvement including minute amounts of myocardial damage. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the usefulness of CMR and compare it with standard clinical evaluation for cardiac involvement. Patients with documented extracardiac sarcoidosis or clinically suspected cardiac sarcoidosis will be enrolled.</detailed_description>
