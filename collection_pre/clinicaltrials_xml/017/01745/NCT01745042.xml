	<brief_title>Anthropometric, Metabolic, Cardiovascular and Symptomatic Profile in Postmenopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>When aging, the body composition changes, leading to a reduction of muscle mass and strength, and to an increase in total body fat. These body composition changes have especially been observed in postmenopausal women, due to the hormonal changes taking place. After the menopause, the gynoid fat distribution with fat deposits in the gluteo-femoral region changes to an android fat distribution with an increased upper body fat, especially in the abdominal region. These consequences of the menopause associated with a decrease in aerobic capacity and reduced total energy expenditure may lead to the metabolic syndrome (MetS). The aim of this study was to investigate the anthropometric, metabolic, cardiovascular and symptomatic profile in gynoid and android postmenopausal women.</detailed_description>
