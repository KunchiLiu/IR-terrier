	<brief_summary>In a retrospective analysis of data from 1100 patients, disease-delaying effects of Cerefolin®/CerefolinNAC® were examined in terms of cognition.

	<brief_title>Effect of Cerefolin®/CerefolinNAC® on Biomarker Measurements</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CerefolinNAC® is an orally administered prescription medical food, and is formulated as a combination of L-methylfolate calcium (as Metafolin®), methylcobalamin, and N-acetylcysteine. In a retrospective analysis, disease-delaying effects of Cerefolin®/CerefolinNAC® (CFLN) are examined in terms of cognition (measured by MCI Screen (MCIS)), and functional capacity (measured by Functional Assessment Staging Test (FAST)). - the treatment effect of CFLN on cognitive and functional measures, and on biomarker measures in patients with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD). The current study will expand the NAC-002b study dataset by prospectively collecting additional biomarker and imaging data in a more comprehensively assessed, matched sample of patients. This will allow more precise evaluation of cognitive and functional outcome measures, and biomarker measures will be assessed in an attempt to identify specific populations or conditions in which CFLN is most effective. The sample will consist of patients with homocysteinemia plus past/current CFLN treatment (Treatment Group) matched to those without homocysteinemia plus no past/current B12, folate or CFLN treatment (Non-Treatment Group). Also 65 additional subjects will be recruited for the non-Treatment group, which will be used to improve the rate of decline estimates for the cognitive and functional outcome measures.</detailed_description>
