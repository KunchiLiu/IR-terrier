	<brief_summary>The investigators will evaluate the accuracy of performing cytological imprints of targeted biopsies when diagnosing prostate cancer. It is useful to know whether the biopsy is cancer or not, in order to know when to stop sampling and when to continue. The strategy is used in other types of cancer, e.g lung, breast etc</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Study Evaluating Targeted Biopsies and Cytological Imprints in Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: When substituting a random biopsy procedure with a few targeted biopsies, it is of outmost importance to know immediately if the biopsy is positive or not. A recent study has demonstrated a high sensitivity and specificity of imprint cytology of random biopsies. Aim: The correlation between cytological imprints and histology of targeted prostate biopsies Material&amp;Method: All patients in this study are already participating in an ongoing randomized biopsy study (NCT01455792) comparing: 1. Preoperative MRI and targeted biopsies + random biopsies . 2. Random biopsies (gold standard). Only patients with a positive MRI were included in this collateral study. The cytological imprints (negative/positive) of each targeted biopsy is compared to the histology (negative/positive) and Gleason score.</detailed_description>
