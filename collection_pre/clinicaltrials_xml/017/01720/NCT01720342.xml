	<brief_title>Enable® Aortic Sutureless Bioprosthesis Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The EASE Enable study is intended to characterize the clinical performance of the Medtronic Enable® aortic bioprosthesis in a post-market real-world setting. This is a Non-randomized, prospective, non-interventional multi-center post-market release (PMR) study. Up to 800 subjects will be enrolled at up to 40 centers in Europe. After aortic valve replacement with the Enable® aortic bioprosthesis, each patient will have routine follow-up visits at the following intervals: at 30 days post-implant (at 30 days post-implant or prior to hospital discharge, whatever comes first), within 6 months following implantation, 1 year and annually thereafter up to 5 years post-implant.</detailed_description>

	<mesh_term>Aortic Valve Insufficiency</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patient with aortic valve stenosis, aortic valve insufficiency or a combination of the two. Patient requires replacement of his/her native aortic valve with a bioprosthesis with or without concomitant procedures. Patient is above the minimum age as required by local regulations to be participating in a clinical study. Patient is willing to return to the implant site for followup visits. Patient has been adequately informed of this clinical study and is willing to sign the patient Data Release Form. Patient requires replacement of two or more valves. Patient who underwent previous aortic valve replacement (AVR). Patient with native bicuspid aortic valve. Patient with active endocarditis or other systemic infection. Patient dilatation of the ascending aorta, deformations or irregular aortic annulus or ascending aorta geometry as seen via preoperative imaging.</criteria>
