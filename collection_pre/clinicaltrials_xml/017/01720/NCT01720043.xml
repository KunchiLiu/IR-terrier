	<criteria>Patients with the diagnosis of multiple myeloma Patients should have not have received VELCADE for at least 2 weeks before receiving treatment with VELCADE for platelet aggregation testing Patients are to be instructed not to take aspirin or ibuprofen 710 days prior to the platelet aggregations testing. Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any studyrelated procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care. Female subject is either postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, is surgically sterilized or if they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice 2 effective methods of contraception from the time of signing the informed consent form through 30 days after the last dose of VELCADE, or agree to completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse. Male subjects, even if surgically sterilized (ie, status postvasectomy) must agree to 1 of the following: practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and through a minimum of 30 days after the last dose of study drug, or completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse. Patients who have received Velcade within 2 weeks prior to study registration Patient has a platelet count of &lt; 150,000 within 7 days before enrollment. Patient has an absolute neutrophil count of &lt; 1000 within 7 days before enrollment. Patient has &gt; 1.5 x ULN Total Bilirubin Patient has &gt; Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy Patient had myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment or has New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities. Prior to study entry, any ECG abnormality at screening must be documented by the investigator as not medically relevant. Currently receiving medication with Coumadin, heparin, low molecular weight heparin, or NSAIDS. Concomitant use with any of these medications must be discontinued within two weeks prior to beginning protocol treatment. Patient has hypersensitivity to VELCADE, boron, or mannitol. Female subject is pregnant or lactating. Confirmation that the subject is not pregnant must be established by a negative serum pregnancy test result obtained during screening. Pregnancy testing is not required for postmenopausal or surgically sterilized women. Female patients who are lactating or have a positive serum pregnancy test during the screening period, or a positive urine pregnancy test on Day 1 before first dose of study drug, if applicable. Serious medical or psychiatric illness likely to interfere with participation in this clinical study. Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 2 years of enrollment, with the exception of complete resection of basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, an in situ malignancy, or lowrisk prostate cancer after curative therapy. Participation in clinical trials with other investigational agents not included in this trial, within 14 days of the start of this trial and throughout the duration of this trial. Radiation therapy within 3 weeks before randomization. Enrollment of subjects who require concurrent radiotherapy (which must be localized in its field size) should be deferred until the radiotherapy is completed and 3 weeks have elapsed since the last date of therapy.</criteria>
