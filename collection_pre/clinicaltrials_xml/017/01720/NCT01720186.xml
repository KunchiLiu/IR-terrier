	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study, single-center, prospective, open-label, to assess the acceptability and performance of the experimental medical device (SPI) used during an imaging examination (PET / CT 4D imaging in synchronized mode centered on the thorax). Each patient will be its own control, since the imaging examination will be synchronized simultaneously with the two systems: tested Medical Device (SPI) and reference Medical Device(RPM).</brief_summary>
