	<brief_summary>Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is the world leading cause of acquired brain injury. Literature suggests a pivotal role for attentional functioning in neurocognitive and behavioural consequences of paediatric TBI. Limitations of traditional neuropsychological measures of attentional functioning have interfered with identification of the effect of paediatric TBI on attentional networks so far. Moreover, the associations between attentional networks, learning abilities, academic performance and behavioural and emotional problems following paediatric TBI are yet to be explored.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the world leading cause of disability in children (Winslade, 1998), causing deficits in motor function, neurocognition and adaptive behaviour (Anderson, 2001). Literature shows that age at injury is inversely related to the magnitude of deficits following TBI, highlighting the vulnerability of children for the effects of TBI. The neurocognitive consequences of paediatric TBI have primarily been characterized by impairments in speed of information processing, attentional functioning and learning (Babikian &amp; Asarnow, 2009; Catroppa &amp; Anderson, 2009), interfering with typical neurocognitive development. We aim at elucidating the effects of TBI on neurocognitive function and investigate the relations between neurocognitive deficits, academic achievement and emotional and behavioural function, in order to improve our understanding of the post-injury functioning of children that have suffered TBI. Methods: Patients with TBI will be compared to a control group consisting of orthopedically injured patients. Orthopaedic control (OC) groups offer a better comparison to TBI patients than typically developing children by controlling for TBI risk factors related to neurocognition (e.g. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, socioeconomic status), hospitalisation and the type of injuries other than brain injuries. Measures: Child's Orientation and Amnesia Test, Attention Network Test, Probabilistic Learning Test, Child Behaviour Checklist, Strengths &amp; Difficulties Questionnaire, Experimental Neurocognitive Test developed at the VU University and Pupil Monitoring System.</detailed_description>
