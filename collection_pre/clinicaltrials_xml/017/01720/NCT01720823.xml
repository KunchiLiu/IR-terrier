	<brief_summary>It is often clinically impossible to differentiate children with an isolated snoring from those with OSA. The diagnosis of OSA is currently based on nocturnal, laboratory-based polysomnography. This expensive examination is poorly accessible due to appointments delays at hospital. Our study is designed to compare the characteristics of a home polysomnography versus standard polysomnography for the diagnosis of pediatric OSA.</brief_summary>
