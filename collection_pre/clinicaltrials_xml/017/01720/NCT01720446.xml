	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted globally. The aim of the trial is to evaluate cardiovascular and other long-term outcomes with semaglutide in subjects with type 2 diabetes. The trial is event-driven, i.e. the maximum trial duration (up to max. 148 weeks) will depend on the accrual of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in this trial and the remaining research programme. The incidence of MACE will be monitored throughout the trial which will be terminated according to plan when pre-specified stopping criteria are met.</brief_summary>
