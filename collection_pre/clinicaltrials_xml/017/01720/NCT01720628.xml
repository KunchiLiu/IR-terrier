	<brief_summary>Objectives: Behçet's disease (BD) is a systemic vasculitis. Since vascular endothelial dysfunction plays a prominent role in the pathogenesis of the disease, we considered angiogenic cytokines as an interesting target for investigation in BD. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible role of angiogenin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in the pathogenesis of BD. Design and Methods: Sixty five patients with BD and 21 healthy control subjects were included in the study. Serum angiogenin, bFGF and VEGF concentrations were determined by using in vitro enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) kits according to the manufacturer's instructions.</brief_summary>
