	<detailed_description>The goal of this study is to assess the feasibility of randomizing residents of long-term care facilities to either probiotics or placebo to assess whether probiotics can reduce influenza and other viral laboratory confirmed respiratory infection. The investigators will determine whether it is feasible to enroll residents and randomize them to a daily course of probiotics or placebo and monitor for influenza and other respiratory tract infections. In addition, the investigators will asses the feasibility of obtaining a nasal specimen for evaluation of the upper respiratory microbiome, measure antimicrobials, and deterioration in functional status. All aspects of the proposed trial will be assessed, including enrollment, randomization, respiratory infection surveillance, methods for outcome assessment, and event rates. The investigators will test the use of our data collection forms and data management strategy and will generate date to derive an appropriate sample size.</detailed_description>
