	<brief_summary>Shoulder tip and abdominal pain following laparoscopic procedures are well recognized as causes of post-operative morbidity. This prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial attempts to reduce post-operative pain in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery by implementing a simple intra-operative technique. Patients who undergo elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallbladder disease or laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair will be recruited to the trial. Patients will be randomized to either the current standard (control group) or to receive an intervention to remove residual CO2. In the intervention group the pneumo-peritoneum will be removed, at the end of the operation, by placing the patient in the Trendelenburg position and utilising a pulmonary recruitment maneuver consisting of two manual inflations to a maximum pressure of 60 cm H2O. In the control group residual pneumo-peritoneum will be evacuated at the end of the procedure by passive decompression via the open operative ports.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This trial recruited 76 randomly assigned patients, 37 in the intervention group and 39 in the control group. The overall post-surgery pain scores, as analysed by two-way ANOVA, were significantly lower in the intervention group (P=0.0019). On Bonferroni post-tests both 12 hour (P&lt;0.01) and 24-hour (P&lt;0.01) pain scores were significantly lower in the intervention group.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patients were recruited from a single Consultant's surgical clinic at the same District General Hospital between August 2010 and February 2012. This study was approved by the local ethics committee (National Research Ethics Service REC ref: 09/H0405/65) and informed consent was obtained from all patients after they had the opportunity to study information leaflets that were also given to them. The trial was designed as a prospectively randomized and double blind trial with a 1:1 (control:intervention) allocation. The inclusion criteria was all adults with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status grade 1 or 2, who were undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallbladder disease or laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair performed as a transabdominal preperitoneal procedure (TAP). All procedures and data collection occurred at a District General Hospital. The preoperative exclusion criteria included patients younger than 18 years, those who refused to give consent, those that had an inability to understand the research questionnaire and pregnancy. Patients who were found to require additional procedures, for example a conversion to open surgery, were excluded from the study prior to randomization.</criteria>
