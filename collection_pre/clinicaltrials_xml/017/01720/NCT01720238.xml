	<brief_summary>Though newly reported HBV infection and HBsAg prevalence in China have greatly decreased, patients who had been chronically infected with HBV, especially those with liver cirrhosis cause great burden on public health care. In view of economic development level, drug availability and lack of independent health economics evidence, the investigators are still unable to give specific guidelines for HBV related compensated liver cirrhosis in China. Therefore, the investigators aim to investigate clinical effects and cost-effectiveness of two early anti-viral therapy strategies on HBV related compensated liver cirrhosis through this prospective, open-label, multicenter and nonrandomized study.</brief_summary>
