	<brief_summary>This study is being carried out to find out whether there is reduction in vancomycin-induced kidney injury (nephrotoxicity) when vancomycin is given as intermittent versus continuous infusion. This study will recruit 220 subjects from 2 hospitals over a period of 3 years. Participants are invited if they have an infection that requires prolonged vancomycin therapy (&gt; more than 10 days).</brief_summary>
