	<brief_title>Bone Marrow Derived Stem Cell Transplantation in T2DM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize that Autologous bone marrow derived stem cells which would be expanded into culture and their subsequent transplant into the pancreas of patients with T2DM, aged 30 - 70 years with triple oral hypoglycemic agent failure and on insulin(&gt;0.4 U/ kg body weight/day) will lead to abolition or reduction of insulin requirement by more than or equal to 50% in these patients over a period of 6 months. It is assumed that stem cell in these patients leads to increased angiogenesis, secretion of various cytokines and upregulation of pancreatic transcription factors and Vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) and creates a micro-environment which supports beta cell/resident stem cell activation and survival.</detailed_description>
