	<detailed_description>Aims: Recent reports have described cases of novel thin-strut coronary stent longitudinal deformation during or after deployment and a biomechanical analysis have suggested increased susceptibility for such a complication for the platinum chromium (PtCr) coronary stent platforms . The aim of this analysis is to assess the incidence of longitudinal stent deformation for PtCr stents in a large single centre all-comers population . Methods: Quantitative angiographic analysis (QCA) of PtCr stents deployed in consecutive all-comers patients treated in our Laboratory from January 2011 to August 2012 will be performed by an independent core laboratory. In particular QCA : nominal stent lenght ratio will be calculated for every PtCr stent. Clinical follow up with data about overall and cardiac mortality, myocardial infarction and target vessel revascularization will also be performed.</detailed_description>
