	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the outcome of incisional negative pressure wound therapy in preventing surgical site infections and wound complications (dehiscence) in high-risk patients undergoing complex spinal surgery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomized, controlled study will compare the outcomes of NPWT versus the outcomes of not using NPWT in post-operative wound management following a complex spinal surgery. The allocation of patients (no NPWT device versus applying an NPWT device) will be determined by computer-generated randomization. The following data will be collected to determine impact on the outcome of wound management (i.e., infection and wound dehiscence): age, gender, body mass index (BMI), dorsal fat, estimated blood loss during the surgical procedure, length of surgery, length of hospital stay, highest peri-operative glucose, medical comorbidities, and history of infection.</detailed_description>
