	<brief_summary>Bariatric surgery is the only satisfactory treatment for loss and weight maintenance in obese patients. This loss is a result of several factors that go beyond the simple anatomical abnormality of the gastrointestinal tract and may be the product of post-op energy expenditure changes. The respiratory quotient (RQ) and diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) are important components of energy expenditure and possible changes in them can perform an important role in weight loss after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB). Previously, we conducted a cross-sectional study where we measured the RQ and DIT in pre and post-op RYGB patients, which was published in the Surgery of Obesity and Related Diseases (SOARD) journal. The objective of this study is to perform a prospective analysis of these same variables (RQ and DIT), evaluating them in the same patients, when pre and postoperatively.</brief_summary>
