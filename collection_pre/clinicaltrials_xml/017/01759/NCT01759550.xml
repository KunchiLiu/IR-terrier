	<brief_summary>The study is primarily to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the LigaSure Advance™ Pistol Grip and LigaSure™ Blunt Tip using the Force Triad™ Energy Platform during Roux-en-Y and gastric reduction procedures (sleeve gastrectomy or placation), respectively. Also, Economic value of using LigaSure in gastric surgeries will be appraised. In this prospective case series, 60 patients previously scheduled to undergo a Roux-en-Y or gastric reduction procedure (sleeve gastrectomy or placation) will have hemostasis controlled with LigaSure Advance ™ Pistol Grip or LigaSure™ Blunt Tip, respectively. All subjects undergoing Roux-en-Y or gastric reduction procedures (sleeve gastrectomy or placation) procedure at Durham Regional Hospital will be recruited. Data Analysis will be performed using the data collected in the software program titled MetaBar at Duke University Medical Center. Categorical variables will be summarized as proportions for each category; continuous measures will be summarized by mean and standard deviation or median and range as appropriated for the data distribution. Procedure-related risks are those typically associated with gastric procedures and general anesthesia including intra-operative bleeding, infection, and injury to surrounding organs and structures. Device related risks include those normally associated with the use of electrosurgery including intra-operative bleeding, unintended tissue burns, electrical shock, and electrical stimulation of muscles and nerves.</brief_summary>
