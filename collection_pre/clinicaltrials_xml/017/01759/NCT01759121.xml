	<brief_title>Safety and Effectiveness Study of 532nm Laser Subthreshold Panretinal Photocoagulation for Severe NPDR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized, parallel controlled, clinical-trial aims to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of 532nm laser partially subthreshold panretinal photocoagulation with PASCAL endpoint management function for severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy : (1)To evaluate therapeutic effect of 532nm laser partially subthreshold panretinal photocoagulation with PASCAL endpoint management function for severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy; (2)To compare side effect of 532nm laser partially subthreshold panretinal photocoagulation with PASCAL endpoint management function on retina with traditional visible endpoint panretinal photocoagulation.</detailed_description>
