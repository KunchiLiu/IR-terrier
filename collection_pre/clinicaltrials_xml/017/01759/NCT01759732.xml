	<brief_summary>Rationale: Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, anti-thymocyte globulin and low-dose total body irradiation (LD-TBI) may induce the engraftment cross the immunologic barrier in the setting of HLA-haploidentical allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. In addition, depletion of CD3 cells may contribute to prevent developing severe acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) in haploidentical transplantation. Purpose: Phase II trials to evaluate the efficacy of haploidentical stem cell transplantation with fixed dose of T cells after in vitro T cell depletion using CD3 monoclonal antibody for children with acquired severe aplastic anemia</brief_summary>
