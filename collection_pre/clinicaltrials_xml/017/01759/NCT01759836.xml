	<brief_summary>Biochemical recurrence develops in approximately 30-40% of men with locally advanced prostate cancer who undergo radical prostatectomy. To date, the effect of statins on prostate cancer recurrence has been investigated in several retrospective studies with inconsistent results. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of statin on biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy for locally advanced prostate cancer.</brief_summary>
