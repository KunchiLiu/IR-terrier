	<brief_summary>There are many surgical methods available for the treatment of patients with acromioclavicular dislocations. No single method has yet proven to be superior to the others. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical outcome and complications associated with coracoclavicular ligament repair using autogenous gracilis tendon graft implanted in a single transclavicle transcoracoid bone tunnel. The implantation is performed using an endobutton system that augments the repair with fibrewires. The investigators will prospecitvely follow 30 patients enrolled in the study. The hypthesis is that this near anatomical repair of the coracoclavicular ligaments will result in good clinical outcome and few complications.</brief_summary>
