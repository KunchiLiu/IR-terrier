	<brief_summary>Currently, there is no direct, reliable, bed-side, and non-invasive method for assessing changes in brain activity associated with concussion. Event Related Potentials (ERPs), which are temporal reflections of the neural mass electrical activity of cells in specific regions of the brain that occur in response to stimuli, may offer such a method, as they provide both a noninvasive and portable measure of brain function. The ERPs provide excellent temporal information, but spatial resolution for ERPs has traditionally been limited. However, by using high-density electroencephalograph (EEG) recording spatial resolution for ERPs is improved significantly. The paradigm for the current study will combine neurophysiological knowledge with mathematical signal processing and pattern recognition methods (BNA™) to temporally and spatially map brain function, connectivity and synchronization. The proposed study will provide additional evidence for the utility and contribution of the BNA™ test (reflecting temporal and spatial changes in brain activity as well as brain functional connectivity associated with concussion) in concussion management.</brief_summary>
