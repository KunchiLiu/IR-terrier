	<detailed_description>Being physically active on a regular basis has many health benefits. Nevertheless, the majority of the Belgian population doesn't reach the recommended amount and intensity of physical activity to profit from these health benefits. A physical activity counselor can possibly play a crucial role for these physically inactive individuals. He/she can design an individualized exercise program to stimulate the person to become lifelong physical active. Research has shown that exercise promotion at work can result in a lower absenteeism, prevention of burn-out and a positive corporate identity.</detailed_description>
