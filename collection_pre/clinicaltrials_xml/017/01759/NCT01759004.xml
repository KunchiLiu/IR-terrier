	<brief_summary>The diagnosis of lipoedema and obesity are often mixed up, unclear stated and often there is a misdiagnosis. The primary aim is to investigate whether there is a difference in muscle strength between women with lipedema and women with obesity. The secondary aim is to investigate whether there is a difference in physical fitness between women with lipedema and women with obesity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Physical Condition in Lipedema and Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lipedema is a genetically mediated disorder of adipose tissue that occurs exclusively in women. Lipedema is an under-recognized condition, often misdiagnosed as lymfedema or dismissed as simple obesity. The diagnosis of lipedema is a clinical diagnosis and may be challenging to determine among patients who are obese. Measurements of muscle strength and physical fitness may give more clarity to differentiate between lipedema and obesity. This may lead to improvements in the criteria of diagnosing lipedema. The research question of the study is: Is there a difference in muscle strength between adult women with lipedema and adult women with obesity? In this study 40 patients will be studied; 20 patients in every group. Besides the general data as length, weight, age, abdominal circumference, volume of the legs additional muscle strength and physical fitness of women with lipedema and women with obesity will be measured and analysis. This study doesn't involve a negligible risk for participants. The study will not have direct benefit for the participants, but may be useful in giving more clarity in defining the phenotype for patients with lipedema.</detailed_description>
