	<brief_title>Multidrug Blister Pack Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Typical adherence rates for oral prescription medications are approximately 50-76%. Insufficient adherence causes an increase in morbidity, mortality, and costs, and decreases quality of life of patients. Multidrug blister packs are recommended to improve adherence and are widely used in Switzerland. However, evidence is poor and patient-relevant endpoints are seldom measured. This study was designed to compare patient-relevant outcomes in patients with medication repackaged in multidrug blister packs versus patients with medication dispensed in commercially available packages. Adherence of the intervention group will be monitored electronically and feedback will be given to the patients. The intervention will take place in a study pharmacy. Follow-up visits will take place at the study pharmacy at 3, 6, and 12 months for all patients. Study duration will be 12 months.</detailed_description>
