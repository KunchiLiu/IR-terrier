	<brief_summary>Epidemiological studies have indicated a positive health impact of coffee. Nevertheless, intervention studies testing the effect of daily coffee consumption over a longer period are lacking so far. Moreover, there is a lack of knowledge about the properties of different coffees and their influence on weight development. Therefore, we tested the effect of two coffees differing in their alkyl pyridine content over a period of 3 months on weight development.</brief_summary>
