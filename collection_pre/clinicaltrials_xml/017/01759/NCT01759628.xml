	<brief_summary>The aim of study was to evaluate the effect of helicobacter pylori eradication on liver function tests, lipid profile, homeostasis model assessment-IR (HOMA-IR) index, and anthropometric measurements (body mass index and waist circumference)in subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Helicobacter Pylori Eradication in Subjects With Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Helicobacter pylori (HP) antigens have been found in the liver of individuals with benign and malignant liver diseases. The role of HP in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is controversial. This randomized double blind clinical trial was performed in dyspeptic patients with positive antibody to HP and the evidence of fatty liver in ultrasonography. After excluding other causes, participants with persistent elevated serum aminotransferase levels were presumed to have NAFLD. Those with NAFLD liver fat score greater than (-0.64) and positive urea breath test (UBT) were enrolled. They were randomly assigned to lifestyle modification alone or lifestyle modification plus HP eradication groups. Quadruple therapy (omeprazole, amoxicillin, bismuth subcitrate, and clarithromycin) for HP eradication was performed in two weeks. HP eradication was documented by UBT. Fasting serum glucose, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, triglyceride, cholesterol, high and low-density lipoprotein, HOMA-IR, and anthropometric measurements (body mass index and waist circumference) were checked at baseline, eight weeks, and twelve weeks from the beginning of study.</detailed_description>
