	<brief_title>Safety and Feasibility Study of Enhanced Recovery in Pancreaticoduodenectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A specific enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol has been applied since October 2010 in consecutive patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) in a high volume Institution. Patient compliance for each item has been assessed. Each ERAS patient was matched with a patient who received standard perioperative care. Match criteria were age, gender, malignant / benign disease, and PD prognostic score.</detailed_description>
