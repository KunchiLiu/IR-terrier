	<brief_summary>This protocol was designed to assess if when subjects with CF are admitted to the hospital for a pulmonary exacerbation if a comprehensive exercise program (moderate to high intensity aerobic, resistance, flexibility and balance exercises) was superior to our "usual care intervention (30 min/day of self selected mode and intensity of exercise) in improving aerobic capacity, muscle strength/power, flexibility and balance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comprehensive Exercise Training Program During Hospitalization for an Acute CF Exacerbation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol was designed to assess if when subjects with CF are admitted to the hospital for a pulmonary exacerbation if a comprehensive exercise program (moderate to high intensity aerobic, resistance, flexibility and balance exercises) was superior to our "usual care intervention (30 min/day of self selected mode and intensity of exercise) in improving aerobic capacity, muscle strength/power, flexibility and balance. The experimental group will participate in the following regime: Day 1 - Evaluation including standardized tests and measures: If Day 1 is a M,W, F, day 2 will constitute: aerobic exercise between 20-30 minutes based on patient tolerance using the appropriate RPE scale (13-15 on Borg with patients ages 13-21, and 6-8 on pictoral CERT with patients ages 6-12)to ensure correct intensity. Choices will include treadmill, stationary bike, game bike, or ambulating at varying intensities throughout hospital; Balance Activities: Standing on bosu ball while performing UE activity (throwing, catching with another ball, Frisbee, etc.). Standing on one leg or B LE's will be determined by patients currently level. If Day 1 is a Tuesday or Thursday, day 2 will constitute: 5-10 minutes of aerobic activity at warm up level (11-13 on Borg, and 4-6 on PCERT)x resistance training for UE: biceps, triceps, lattisimus, rhomboids/mid-trap, thoracic expansion exercises, and other muscles based on patient needs; resistance training for LE: quadriceps, hamstrings, gluteals (especially maximus and medius), and other muscles depending on patient need, core and abdominal strengthening, Stretches for flexibility depending on the patients individual needs: Thoracic expansion stretches will be done with every pt. supine and sidelying. Stretches are held for 10 seconds and repeated 10 times, Hamstring stretches will be performed if pt unable to reach line with sit and reach test.</detailed_description>
