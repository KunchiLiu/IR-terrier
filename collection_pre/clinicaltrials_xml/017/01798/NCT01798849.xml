	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate safety, tolerability and effects on central diastolic blood pressure (cDBP) of MK-8892 given as single oral doses in healthy male participants (Panel A and B) and in male participants with mild-to-moderate hypertension (Panel C).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Rising Single Dose Study of the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics (PK) and Pharmacodynamics of MK-8892 (MK-8892-001)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up to three planned panels of either 8 healthy participants (Panels A and B) or 8 participants with mild to moderate hypertension (Panel C) will be enrolled. In Panels A and B, 8 participants will alternately receive single rising doses of MK-8892 or placebo. All doses will be administered in the fasted state, except Panel A, Period 5 in which a standard high-fat breakfast provided approximately 30 minutes prior to dosing. Panel A will begin first. At least 3 days will elapse before participants in the alternate panel (Panel B) will receive the next higher dose. In Panel C, 8 mild to moderate hypertensive male participants will receive single rising doses of MK-8892 or placebo. Panel C may begin after the first 4 periods of Panels A and B have completed dosing. For all panels, there will be at least 7 days washout between treatment periods for any given participant. Participants may only be enrolled in one panel of the study. Subsequent doses in any panel will be administered only after careful evaluation of safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamic effects of a given dose.</detailed_description>
