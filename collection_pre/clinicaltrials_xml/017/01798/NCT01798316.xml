	<brief_title>IV Acetaminophen for Postoperative Analgesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The recent clinical development of an intravenous (IV) acetaminophen formulation for use in the US has important implications for the management of postoperative pain given its safety profile and suitability for use in the early phase of the postoperative period. In clinical studies, a significant opioid-sparing effect has been documented with a substantial percentage of patients avoiding the need for opioid rescue medication altogether. This avoidance or delay in the use of opioids has been shown to reduce undesirable side effects. It is proposed that the use of IV acetaminophen as 1st line analgesic regimen in the post anesthesia care unit (PACU) for postoperative analgesia after laparoscopic cholecystectomy will result in decreased incidence of post operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) without compromising patient pain control and satisfaction.</detailed_description>
