	<brief_summary>In addition to chronic anovulation and hyperandrogenemia, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is also characterized by peripheral insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia, which in turn lead to the development of diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. Serum markers of inflammation are being increasingly recognized as predictors of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk, and chronic low-grade inflammation has been recently proposed to play a role in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to evaluate the effects of commonly used non-pharmacologic (diet and lifestyle change) and pharmacologic (oral contraceptives, metformin, anti-androgens) treatment strategies on classical and surrogate cardiovascular risk markers in women with PCOS. The study hypothesis is that some of the commonly used therapies of women with PCOS may have more favorable effects on classical and surrogate markers of cardiovascular risk then others or some of them may even confer a higher risk of cardiovascular events</brief_summary>
