	<brief_summary>This research study will investigate the safety, tolerability, and benefit of bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) to the lateral habenula for patients with treatment-resistant major depression (TRD) secondary to either nonpsychotic unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD), or bipolar disorder (BD) I. Six adult patients with TRD will be treated in this single-site study at Baylor College of Medicine; patients will be chronically symptomatic with significant functional disability, and will have demonstrated resistance to standard somatic and pharmacotherapeutic treatments. The primary outcome measure will be the change in the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS17) six months after the commencement of stimulation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study of Deep Brain Stimulation to the Lateral Habenulae in Treatment-Resistant Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study includes the following parts: 1. medical and psychiatric evaluation, 2. implantation of the brain stimulation system, and 3. follow up including programming and psychiatric testing after the implantation 1. Medical and psychiatric evaluation: During this part of the study, the investigator will ask detailed questions about the patient's psychiatric and medical history, and will ask for a list of medications along with response to previous treatments. As part of the medical evaluation, the patient will be asked to give a sample of both blood and urine for standard lab evaluation. All patients will be tested for the presence of drugs of abuse in their urine. All women of child bearing potential will also be tested for pregnancy. If any of the test results are positive, the patient cannot continue to be part of this study, but can receive other clinical care by a treating psychiatrist. 2. Implantation of the brain stimulation system: Description of the Medical Devices The brain stimulation system is implanted inside the patient's body. The implanted system is made up of three major parts: - The lead is made of four insulated wires with four electrodes at the end. - The extension connects the lead to the neurostimulator (power source). - The neurostimulator (battery) is the power source of the system. The neurostimulator is a metal "can", which depending on the model the patient receives, will be in the range of about 2 or 3 inches in diameter and about ½ inch thick. It contains a small battery and produces the electrical impulses needed for stimulation. For this study a rechargeable battery will be used. Although battery life varies for each patient depending on the type and intensity of stimulation needed for good symptom relief, the use of a rechargeable battery will extend the time before it must be replaced. Patients will have two neurostimulators implanted,. The surgeon may place the neurostimulators either near the collarbones, within the abdomen, or both as needed to allow for the proper distance between the neurostimulators. Patients will be admitted to the hospital either the night before or the morning of the surgery. The day of surgery, the following steps may occur: 1. A metal frame will be attached to the head. The frame is a special instrument that allows the surgeon to find the correct path to the target site in the brain. Local anesthetic will be given so that the pins, which hold the frame to the head, do not hurt. 2. Pictures of the brain will be taken using MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and/or computer-aided tomography (CAT) scans. This will allow the surgeon to determine the area in the brain where the leads will be placed. 3. The patient will then go to the operating room where two small holes will be drilled in the skull, one for each lead to be implanted. The patient will receive local anesthesia before this procedure. 4. The lead is then passed into the brain to the desired site. 5. A cap will be placed over the hole in the skull. The cap also holds the lead in position. 6. The metal frame is then removed from the patient's head. If the extension and the neurostimulator are not implanted right away, patients will typically be allowed to go home in approximately 24-48 hours. The study doctor will decide the length of the patient's hospital stay. 7. The extensions and neurostimulator may be placed one to two weeks after the leads are implanted. If so, this is an outpatient procedure that is performed under general anesthesia (ie patient is asleep). Patients will be discharged home on the same day once it is determined that they are in stable condition. 3) Follow-up programming and psychiatric assessments The study physician will want to see patients for follow up after surgery. Follow up visits are scheduled after patients are implanted. During these visits, the study physicians or other clinicians will assess the patient's condition using various standardized questionnaires. Frequent, non-invasive adjustment to the stimulation parameters may be required to achieve optimal symptom response. This adjustment period may take weeks or months. 4) Duration of treatment The optimization period generally lasts 6 months, after which modulation appointments are scheduled monthly or on an as needed basis. If a patient responds to the treatment, treatment may be temporarily discontinued between months 12 and 18 to find out if the response is because of the treatment. The patient will not be told when this discontinuation occurs and they will be carefully monitored during this time. If symptoms worsen, the patient will be informed if treatment has been discontinued, and they will have the option to have treatment restarted. If the patient continues to do well without stimulation, they may be offered the opportunity to continue without stimulation, consider removing the device, or to restart stimulation. Because the battery life is approximately 7-9 years, every 7-9 years batteries will need to be replaced. This requires patients to undergo a brief surgery to have the neurostimulator replaced - the neurostimulator contains a small rechargeable battery and produces the electrical impulses needed for stimulation. When the battery can no longer be recharged, the neurostimulator must be replaced. Once a patient has exited the study, their insurance may not pay for device replacements or other medical care related to the device.</detailed_description>
