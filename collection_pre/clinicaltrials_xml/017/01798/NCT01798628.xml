	<brief_title>A Study to Determine the Effect of Food on the Pharmacokinetics of Abiraterone Acetate in Healthy Male Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known), randomized (treatment sequences will be assigned by chance) study of a single dose of abiraterone acetate 1000 mg administered orally (by mouth) in approximately 36 healthy male participants under fasted and fed conditions. Three doses of abiraterone acetate will be administered with a 7-day washout period between each dose. The total study duration for each participant will be 21 days. Participants will be randomized to one of six treatment sequences (ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA): Treatment A = abiraterone acetate 1000 mg administered after a high-fat meal; Treatment B = abiraterone acetate 1000 mg administered after a low-fat meal; Treatment C = abiraterone acetate 1000 mg administered in the fasted state. No food will be ingested for 4 hours post-dose. Participants will be confined at the clinical research unit from the day prior to dosing until clinic discharge on the day following dosing in each treatment period. Serial pharmacokinetic samples will be collected and safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
