	<brief_summary>In patients with unprotected left main (LM) true bifurcation lesion (cohort A), elective 2-stent strategy is superior to provisional strategy at preventing the occurrence of 12-month target lesion failure after percutaneous coronary intervention for bifurcation lesion. In patients with unprotected LM non-true bifurcation lesion (cohort B), 1-stent technique with mandatory final kissing ballooning is superior to 1-stent technique without kissing ballooning at preventing the occurrence of 12-month target lesion failure after percutaneous coronary intervention for bifurcation lesion.</brief_summary>
