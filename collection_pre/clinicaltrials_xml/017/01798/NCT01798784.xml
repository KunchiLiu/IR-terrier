	<brief_summary>In a 4-arm, Randomized Control Trial among members of CVS Caremark or Penn Medicine Patients with suboptimal cholesterol control who are at high risk for CVD, the study investigators propose to test the effectiveness of different behavioral economic techniques in inducing habit formation for adherence to statin use and sustained reductions in LDL cholesterol after financial incentives are discontinued. Primary outcome is changes in LDL from enrollment to 12 months (6 months after cessation of financial incentives).</brief_summary>
