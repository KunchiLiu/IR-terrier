	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the allergen ethylenediamine dihydrochloride when prepared using methylcellulose versus preparation using polyvinylpyrrolidone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioequivalence of Ethylenediamine Dihydrochloride Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose an open, prospective, single-site study to evaluate the bioequivalence of ethylenediamine dihydrochloride in methylcellulose (MC)and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) formulations. Bioequivalence will be determined in 15 adult subjects, with a clinical history of contact dermatitis and a positive patch test (current or previous) to ethylenediamine ("sensitives").</detailed_description>
