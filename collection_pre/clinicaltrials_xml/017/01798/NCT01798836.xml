	<brief_title>Oestradiol Pre-treatment in an Ultrashort Flare GnRH Agonist/GnRH Antagonist Protocol in Poor Responders Undergoing IVF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The combined ultrashort flare GnRH agonist /GnRH antagonist protocol during COH cycle resulted in a significantly higher clinical pregnancy rate in patients with poor embryo quality, with repeated IVF failures and in poor responders. This is a protocol combining the effect of the microdose flare on endogenous FSH release with the benefit of an immediate LH suppression of the GnRH antagonist. A major disadvantage of the use of a GnRH antagonist protocol is the limitation for programming cycles, as the drugs administration is started on day 2 of the menstrual cycle and is strictly followed until the hCG criteria are met. The purpose of the study is to perform oestradiol pre-treatment with the combined ultrashort flare GnRH agonist /GnRH antagonist protocol aiming to 1. better programme an antagonist cycle and 2. improve the IVF outcome parameters, from the production of more follicles / oocytes up to the rise in live birth rates.</detailed_description>
