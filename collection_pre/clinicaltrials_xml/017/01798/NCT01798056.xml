	<brief_title>Immunogenicity and Safety Study of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals' Herpes Zoster (HZ/su) Vaccine in Adults With Solid Tumours Receiving Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be randomised into two groups based on the vaccination schedule in relation to the start of a chemotherapy cycle: - The OnChemo group receives their first HZ/su vaccination at the start of a chemotherapy cycle, - The PreChemo group receives their first HZ/su vaccination at least 10 days before the start of a chemotherapy cycle. The protocol summary has been updated following Protocol Amendment 2, August 2014, leading to the increase of the enrolment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol. Written informed consent obtained from the subject. A male or female aged 18 years or older (and has reached the age of legal consent) at the time of study entry (i.e., when informed consent is signed). Subject who has been diagnosed with one or more solid tumours (defined as a solid malignancy, i.e., not a blood element malignancy). Subject who is receiving or will receive a cytotoxic or immunosuppressive chemotherapy (such that the study vaccine can be administered at the latest at the start of the second cycle of chemotherapy). Life expectancy of greater than one year. Female subjects of nonchildbearing potential may be enrolled in the study: Nonchildbearing potential is defined as premenarche, current tubal ligation, hysterectomy, ovariectomy or postmenopause; Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the subject: has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period and for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series. Subjects receiving only newer, more targeted therapies if not taken together with a classical chemotherapy. Chronic administration and/or planned administration of systemic glucocorticoids within one month prior to the first vaccine dose and up to Visit 3 (Month 2). Inhaled, intraarticularly injected, and topical steroids are allowed. Previous vaccination against HZ or varicella within 12 months preceding the first dose of study vaccine/ placebo. Planned administration during the study of a HZ vaccine (including an investigational or nonregistered vaccine) other than the study vaccine. Previous chemotherapy course less than one month before first study vaccination. Occurrence of a varicella or HZ episode by clinical history within the 12 months preceding the first dose of study vaccine/ placebo. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine or study material and equipment. Administration or planned administration of a live vaccine in the period starting 30 days before the first dose of study vaccine and ending 30 days after the last dose of study vaccine, or, administration or planned administration of a nonreplicating vaccine within 8 days prior to or within 14 days after either dose of study vaccine. HIV infection by clinical history. Acute disease and/or fever at the time of vaccination. Acute disease is defined as the presence of a moderate or severe illness with or without fever, but excludes the underlying malignancy, as well as the expected symptoms/signs associated with that disease or its treatment: Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 37.5°C /99.5°F on oral, axillary or tympanic setting, or ≥ 38.0°C /100.4°F on rectal setting. The preferred route for recording temperature in this study will be oral. Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory infection) without fever, may receive the first dose of study vaccine/ placebo at the discretion of the investigator. Any condition which, in the judgment of the investigator would make intramuscular injection unsafe. Pregnant or lactating female. Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions (if of childbearing potential) before Month 3 (i.e., 2 months after the last dose of study vaccine/ placebo).</criteria>
