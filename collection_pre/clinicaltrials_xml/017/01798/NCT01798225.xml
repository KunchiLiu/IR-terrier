	<brief_summary>Our overall hypothesis is that treatment of periodontal disease will produce better diabetes glycemic control (glycated hemoglobin A1c, or HbA1c) and reduced levels of the catalytically active form of matrix metalloproteinase (aMMP-8) in the Gullah African American type 2 diabetes patients living on the Sea Islands of the South Carolina coast. The gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) aMMP-8 levels will be measured through a site-specific, novel noninvasive technique allowing the pathophysiological status of the periodontium tissue to be monitored. The investigators will conduct an interventional study on this population with minimal genetic admixture.</brief_summary>
