	<brief_summary>Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) occurs in approximately 10 % of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), but the outcome of reconstructive surgery is not clear. The purpose of this study was to determine the functional outcome after surgery, frequency of pouchitis, complications and failure-rate in UC-PSC patients compared to patients with UC alone. Both ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) and ileo-rectal anastomosis (IRA) were studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgical Reconstruction in Ulcerative Colitis With Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is characterised by inflammation and fibrosis of the biliary tree and the condition can lead to end-stage liver disease. PSC is strongly associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), with a prevalence of IBD in PSC as high as 60-84 % in Northern Europe and North America. The majority of patients with IBD and PSC have ulcerative colitis (UC). Considering all patients with UC, around 30% will ultimately require surgery; the most common indications are acute colitis, chronic refractory disease or colorectal dysplasia. The standard procedure is proctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA). However, ileo-rectal anastomosis (IRA) or conventional ileostomy are options. The prognosis after surgery is generally considered good. Previous studies have shown that the course of colitis in patients with UC/PSC is different from that of patients with UC-only. In a patient with UC, several aspects have to be considered at counselling before surgery. However, in many aspects, the literature is substantial for patients with UC-only (for example function and quality of life after IPAA) and key information can be safely provided. Conversely, patients with UC/PSC that require colectomy are rare and as a consequence, data on most aspects is sparse (18-20). The aim of the study was to assess outcome after surgery (IPAA or IRA) in patients with UC/PSC. Focus was on pouch/rectal function, pouchitis, surgical complications and failure. Patients with UC-only were employed as controls.</detailed_description>
