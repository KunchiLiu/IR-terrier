	<brief_title>Corticosteroids and Hemoglobin A1C Levels in Diabetic Patients With COPD Exacerbation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HbA1C levels were evaluated in diabetic patients with COPD exacerbation on admission to the hospital and 3-months later. Demographic, clinical, laboratory variables and total steroid dose were documented. Age- and sex-matched group of diabetic patients with COPD who were admitted for other reasons, were asked to participate as a control group. Mann-Whitney and Chi square/Fischer's exact tests were used to compare between the parameters of the two groups. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare between HbA1C levels at baseline and 3 months later. Multi-variate linear regression analysis was used to find predictors for increase in HbA1C levels in the patients' group.</detailed_description>
