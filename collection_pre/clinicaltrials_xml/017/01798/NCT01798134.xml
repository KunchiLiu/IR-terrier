	<criteria>1. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of HCC according to the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) criteria for diagnosis, and staged according to the Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC) criteria 2. Subject is competent and willing to provide written informed consent in order to participate in the study 3. Adults (male or female) patients ≥ 18 years of age 4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 02 or Child Pugh classification is 011 5. Multidonar or single nodular tumor ≥310cm, Patients with bilobar disease who can be treated superselectively in a single session or both lobes able to be treated within 35 weeks. Patient must have at least one tumor lesion that meets the following criteria: Lesion can be accurately measured in at least one dimension according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (mRECIST) criteria 6. No invasion in the major blood vessel (hepatic portal, hepatic vein) or bile duct by the Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or Computed Tomography (CT) 7. Proper blood, liver, renal, heart function: testing result within 2 weeks from registry of this study 8. No current infections requiring antibiotic therapy 9. Not actively on cumarin based anticoagulation or suffering from a known bleeding disorder 10. Measurable disease per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) 11. Expected survival more than 6 months 1. ECOG performance status &gt;2; or ChildPugh class C11 or more, or ASA class 5 2. Bilirubin levels &gt;3 mg/dl 3. HCC with large vessel or biliary duct invasion, diffuse HCC or extrahepatic spread 4. Patients in which any of the following are contraindicated or present: The use of doxorubicin MRI Hepatic embolization procedures White blood cell (WBC) &lt; 3000 cells/mm3 neutrophil &lt; 1500 cells/mm3 Cardiac ejection fraction &lt; 50 percent assessed by isotopic ventriculography, echocardiography or MR Elevated creatinine greater than or equal to 2.5 mg/dl Impaired clotting test (platelet count &lt; 5 x 104/mm3, Prothrombin timeInternational normalized ratio (PTINR &gt; 2.0) aspartate transaminase (AST) and/or alanine transaminase (ALT) &gt;5x ULN or, when greater &gt;250 U/L Known hepatofugal blood flow Arteriovenous shunt Arterioportal shunt Main stem portal vein occlusion(point 6 in inclusion criteria) 5. Women who are pregnant or breast feeding 6. Allergy to iodinated contrast used for angiography 7. Tumour burden of more than 50% of liver 8. Patients with objective signs of active bacterial, viral (human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)), or fungal infection 9. Other primary malignancies or evidence of metastatic disease 10. Patients previously treated with anthracyclines (other than doxorubicin). 11. Any comorbid disease or condition or event that, in the investigator's judgment, would place the patient at undue risk that would preclude the safe use of DEBTACE. 12. Under no circumstances should patients be enrolled in this study who is already participating in another study for treatment of primary liver cancer. 13. Under no circumstances should patients be enrolled in this study who has received any other embolotherapy (including Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT)) for the treatment of primary liver cancer.</criteria>
