	<brief_title>Study of the Effect of Low Level Laser Light Therapy on Reducing the Appearance of Cellulite in the Thighs and Buttocks.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cellulite is a common term used to describe superficial pockets of trapped fat, which causes uneven dimpling or "orange peel" skin. It appears in 90% of post-adolescent women. In advanced stages of cellulite, heaviness and pain may occur. Currently available treatments for cellulite have minimal to no demonstrable effect and some involve risky invasive procedures. Therefore, the potential advantages of the application of low level laser light therapy to reduce the appearance of cellulite over current treatment options include a risk free procedure that is non-invasive and pain free. Since low level laser light within the green spectrum has been proven to increase the synthesis of collagen, it is believed that its application may serve to decrease the appearance of cellulite by tightening the skin. Moreover, newly synthesized collagen may alter the irregular pattern of the connective tissue responsible for the formation of cellulite.</detailed_description>
