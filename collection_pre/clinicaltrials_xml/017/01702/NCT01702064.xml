	<criteria>Must have chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). They must also be under treatment with nilotinib as either first, second, or thirdline therapy. Must have a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) OR must have been on nilotinib for a minimum of 6 months. Must not have undergone treatment for any other form of cancer (aside from nonmelanoma skin cancer) in the past 5 years. 18 years of age or older and must be able to speak and read English or Spanish.

Women of childbearing age will be required to have a negative pregnancy test within 14 days of enrolling in this study. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document BHCG will be performed on all women of childbearing potential as screening prior to enrollment on this trial. STAT3 levels in the bone marrow will also be measured prior to enrollment. Patients who are in accelerated phase or blast phase CML. May not be receiving any other investigational agents. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to ruxolitinib or other agents used in the study. Known history of a prolonged QT interval (QTc &gt;480). Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Pregnant women are excluded from this study. Women who are breast feeding their infants should discontinue this practice if the mother is treated with ruxolitinib.
