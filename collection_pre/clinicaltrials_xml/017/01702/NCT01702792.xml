	<brief_summary>This is a non-randomized, open-label study in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma to determine the ability to generate human hybridomas from lymph nodes draining an autologous tumor vaccine injection and demonstrate that the hybridomas secrete glioblastoma-specific antibodies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Derivation of Tumor Specific Hybridomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The intradermal vaccine will be injected 20cm in the anterior thigh. Vaccination will be done twice and separated by one week. The first vaccination will be performed approximately 2 weeks after surgery. Approximately one week after the second vaccination one or two vaccine-draining lymph node(s) will be removed. The lymph node(s) will be identified using SN technology. One or two lymph node(s) will be removed. Lymph nodes will be processed for recovery of B cells and formation of hybridomas.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with confirmed new diagnosis of glioblastoma and who have a yield of at least 8x10(7) tumor cells obtained at the time of surgery Age &gt; 18 years KPS Score of greater than or equal to 70 Adequate bone marrow as evidenced by: Absolute lymphocyte count &gt; 1,000/uL Platelet count &gt; 50,000/uL Adequate renal function as evidenced by serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 Patients must be able to read, understand and provide informed consent to participate in the trial. Patients of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective form of contraception during the study and for 90 days following vaccination (an effective form of contraception is an oral contraceptive or a double barrier method) A patient may not be enrolled in the trial if any of the following criteria are met: Patients receiving dexamethasone &gt; 8 mg/day during the week before vaccination. Patients who are pregnant or lactating Patients with active second malignancy. Any other medical conditions, including mental illness or substance abuse, deemed by the Investigator to be likely to interfere with a patient's ability to sign informed consent, cooperate and participate in the study, or interfere with the interpretation of the results.</criteria>
