	<brief_title>TD-1211 IV/Oral Mass Balance Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will provide information regarding the metabolic pathway of TD 1211, the need for evaluation of potential drug-drug interactions, the need for studies in special populations and the absolute oral bioavailability of TD-1211. The administration of radiolabeled drug is necessary to fully characterize the rates and routes of elimination of TD 1211, providing further quantitative information on the disposition of TD 1211. The results from this study will allow a more comprehensive comparison between animal and human routes of elimination and metabolic profiles of TD 1211.</detailed_description>
