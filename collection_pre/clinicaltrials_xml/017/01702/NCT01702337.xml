	<brief_title>Prevalence-based Health and Economic Model of the Bivalent Versus the Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study uses a prevalence-based model (by using efficacy data from each vaccine's respective trials and published cost data for Taiwan) which estimates the differences in lesions, genital warts, cervical cancer and costs from a healthcare payer's perspective prevented between HPV-1 and HPV-2 vaccines during one year (when all women are vaccinated). It also analyses costs from a societal perspective.</detailed_description>
