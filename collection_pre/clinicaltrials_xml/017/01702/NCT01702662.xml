	<brief_summary>Photo-bio-stimulation by Low Level Light therapy(LLLT) has demonstrated its clinical use in chemotherapy/radiotherapy oral mucositis. Unpublished study (Melzer, Ben-Yehuda et al. UEGW 2012) with the Photopill (LLLT) capsule treatment in mice showed a significant beneficial effect on the endoscopic severity of DSS-induced colitis in mice. Therefore a phase 1 trial is designed to assess the safety and feasibility of the Photopill treatment in healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
