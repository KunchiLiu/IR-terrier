	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to train patients with tic disorders to control activity in a region of their brain that has been associated with the urge to tic. Patients will be given direct feedback regarding activity in this brain area while they are undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning, and will try to learn to control activity in the region during these feedback sessions. In separate sessions, patients will be given sham feedback based on the brain patterns of a prior subject rather than their own brain patterns. Our primary hypothesis is that the biofeedback training will reduce their tic symptoms more than the sham feedback.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of Tourette Syndrome or Chronic Tic Disorder currently active tics aged 1119 ability to execute most common tics without moving head while lying on back Blindness (because feedback is provided visually) Lifetime diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorder, bipolar disorder, or psychotic disorder. Presence of any serious psychiatric or psychosocial condition requiring initiation of new treatment or change in current treatment. Neurological conditions affecting central nervous system, with the exception that predisposition to migraine will not be grounds for exclusion Change in medication in the month prior to beginning the study Unwillingness to keep medication stable over the course of the intervention Full braces (but some retainers are OK) Claustrophobia of a degree that they cannot comfortably be scanned If common tics involve dramatic changes in breathing that could alter blood oxygenation measurements Inability to keep head still while executing most common tics Inability to keep head still in mock scanner Inability or unwillingness to understand or follow the instructions Pregnancy or possible pregnancy Subjects may also be excluded after the first magnetic resonance scan if we are unable to localize a region of their supplementary motor area involved in tics leaving us without a target area for biofeedback.</criteria>
