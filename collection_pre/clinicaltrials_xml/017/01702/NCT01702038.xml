	<brief_title>Determining the Responses and Impact of Rituximab-instigated Cell Depletion on T Cells in People With SLE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Immune cells are an important part of the abnormal autoimmune response in SLE. The B cell is a significant part of this autimmune response because it produces the antibodies which can react with normal tissue of the body. B cells have the ability to accumulate and promote the development of SLE. The purpose of this study is to determine how B cell subsets and autoantibodies are related to disease remission after rituximab treatment in subjects with SLE. This study will last approximately two years and consist of 15 study visits. These visits will occur at screening, baseline, Days 0 and 14, and Months 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24. Participants will receive a single rituximab injection on Days 0 and 14. Medication history and blood tests will occur at every study visit. A physical exam, medical history, and urine tests will occur at most visits. For females, a pregnancy test will occur at selected visits.</detailed_description>
