	<brief_summary>Boys suffer a disproportionately large number of fractures compared to girls (55-60%). This study aims to determine why this is the case by identifying risk factors for wrist fractures. The increase in fracture during childhood and adolescence may be associated with 1) risk-taking behaviour in boys, 2) obesity trends in boys during childhood and adolescence, and/or 3) impaired acquisition of bone strength during childhood and adolescence. Importantly from a knowledge translation perspective, modifiable factors such as behaviour, dietary habits or physical activity in boys may predict fracture. The investigators will measure 400 children (100 girls and 100 boys who have sustained a fracture; 100 same age and sex friends) across 4 years of growth. This study will assess risk behaviours, diet, physical activity, motor proficiency (i.e., balance and coordination), fat and muscle mass and bone strength to determine if there are, 1) differences in whether all or some of these factors predict fractures in boys compared with girls and, 2) whether these factors track forward similarly in boys compared with girls as children advance through the growth spurt.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators aim to better characterize factors that contribute to fracture in boys and girls and to assess whether such factors track across a four year period. The innovation is to use novel methods and an integrated approach, to measure the influence of risk-taking behaviour, body composition, bone microstructure, motor proficiency, diet and physical activity in one model across growth. This will provide a more comprehensive picture of the key multi-factorial predictors of fracture within- and between-sexes. This essential information will provide the basis for change in public health policy, clinical practice, community programs, and targeted interventions.</detailed_description>
