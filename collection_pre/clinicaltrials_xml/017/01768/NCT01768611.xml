	<brief_summary>Cells damaged by hyperglycemia are unable to downregulate glucose entrance in presence of high extracellular glucose resulting in intracellular activation of deleterious biochemical pathways. Expression of GLUT-1, the major glucose transporter in mesangial cells, is increased and participates in the induction of diabetic nephropathy. Variants in the gene encoding GLUT-1 (SLC2A1) have been associated to this diabetic complication. The aim of this study was to test whether polymorphisms in SLC2A1 confer susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy in Brazilian type 1 diabetes patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this study, 449 patients, included between October 2004 and October 2012, were sorted into three groups according to diabetic nephropathy stages: without (persistent normoalbuminuria, n=248), incipient (microalbuminuria, n=82) and overt diabetic nephropathy (macroalbuminuria or proteinuria or renal replacement therapy, n=119). Measurements of urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) or urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) were used to define DN: patients with persistent normoalbuminuria (&lt;30 mg/g creatinine or &lt;20 μg/min) were classified as without DN (n=248); patients presenting persistent microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/g creatinine or 20-200 μg/min) were classified as having incipient DN (n=82); and patients presenting persistent macroalbuminuria (&gt;300 mg/g creatinine or &gt;200 µg/min), proteinuria (&gt;500 mg/24 h) or renal replacement therapy were classified as having overt DN (n=119). Genotyping of polymorphisms was performed by Real Time PCR using fluorescent -labelled probes.</detailed_description>
