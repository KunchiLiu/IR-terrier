	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - To compare lixisenatide versus insulin glulisine in terms of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) reduction and body weight change at Week 26 in type 2 diabetic participants not adequately controlled on insulin glargine ± metformin. Secondary Objectives: - To compare the treatments/regimens on: - The percentage of participants reaching the target of HbA1c &lt;7% or ≤6.5%, - Body weight, - Self-Monitored Glucose profiles, - Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG), - Post-prandial plasma glucose (PPG) /glucose excursions during a standardized meal test (subset of participants), - Daily doses of insulins, - Safety and tolerability.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria : Participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed at least 1 year before screening visit (V1). Participants treated with basal insulin for at least 6 months. Participants treated for at least 3 months prior to visit 1 with a stable basal insulin regimen (i.e. type of insulin and time/frequency of the injection). The insulin dose should be stable (± 20%) and ≥20 U/day for at least 2 months prior to visit 1. Participants treated with basal insulin alone or in combination with 1 to 3 oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) that could be: metformin (≥1.5 g/day or maximal tolerated dose), a sulfonylurea (SU), a dipeptidylpeptidase4 (DPP4) inhibitor, a glinide. The dose of OADs should be stable for at least 3 months prior to visit 1. Exclusion criteria: At screening: age &lt; legal age of majority. At screening, HbA1c: &lt;7.5% and &gt;10.0% for participants treated with basal insulin alone or in combination with metformin only; &lt; 7.0% and &gt; 10.0% for participants treated with basal insulin and a combination of oral antidiabetic drugs which included a SU and/or a DPP4 inhibitor and/or a glinide. Women of childbearing potential with no effective contraceptive method, pregnancy or lactation. Type 1 diabetes mellitus. Treatment with glucoselowering agent(s) other than stated in the inclusion criteria within 3 months prior to screening. Previous treatment with short or rapid acting insulin other than in relation to hospitalization or an acute illness. Any previous treatment with lixisenatide, or any discontinuation from another glucagonlike peptide 1 (GLP1) receptor agonist due to safety/tolerability issue or lack of efficacy. At screening, Body Mass Index (BMI) ≤20 or &gt;40 kg/m^2. Weight change of more than 5 kg during the 3 months prior to the screening visit; use of weight loss drugs within 3 months prior to screening. Within the last 6 months prior to screening: history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or heart failure requiring hospitalization. Planned coronary, carotid or peripheral artery revascularisation procedures. History of unexplained pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, pancreatectomy, stomach/gastric surgery. At screening resting systolic blood pressure &gt;180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;95 mmHg. Personal or immediate family history of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) or genetic condition that predisposed to MTC (e.g. multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes). Contraindication related to metformin (for participant receiving this treatment), insulin glargine, insulin glulisine or lixisenatide. Participants with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min) or endstage renal disease. At screening, amylase and/or lipase &gt;3 times the upper limit of the normal laboratory range (ULN). At screening alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;3 ULN. At screening calcitonin ≥20 pg/ml (5.9 pmol/L). Exclusion Criteria for randomization at the end of the screening period before randomization: HbA1c &lt;7.0% or &gt;9.0%. 7day mean fasting SMPG &gt;140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/L). Amylase and/or lipase &gt;3 times ULN. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a participant's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
