	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of CPI-613 when given together with cytarabine and mitoxantrone hydrochloride in treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as CPI-613, cytarabine and mitoxantrone hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. CPI-613 may help cytarabine and mitoxantrone hydrochloride work better by making cancer cells more sensitive to the drugs</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CPI-613, Cytarabine, and Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CPI-613 when administered with high dose cytarabine, and mitoxantrone (mitoxantrone hydrochloride). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of CPI-613 following intravenous (IV) administration in combination with high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone. II. To observe the response rate (complete response [CR], complete response with incomplete platelet recovery [CRi] and partial response [PR]) of CPI-613 in combination with high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone. III. To observe the overall survival of patients treated with CPI-613 in combination with high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of CPI-613. Patients receive CPI-613 intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1-5, cytarabine IV over 3 hours every 12 hours for 5 doses beginning on day 3, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes after the 1st, 3rd, and 5th doses of cytarabine. . Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 2 courses* in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. NOTE: *Patients undergoing a second course of therapy receive CPI-613 IV over 2 hours on days 1-3, cytarabine IV over 3 hours every 12 hours for 5 doses beginning on day 2, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes after the 1st and 3rd doses of cytarabine. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.</detailed_description>
