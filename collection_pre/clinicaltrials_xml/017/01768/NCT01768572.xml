	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To assess, in the same study, the safety of sarilumab and tocilizumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who are inadequate responders to or intolerant of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>To Evaluate The Safety of SAR153191 (REGN88) and Tocilizumab Added to Other RA Drugs in Patients With RA Who Are Not Responding to or Intolerant of Anti-TNF Therapy (SARIL-RA-ASCERTAIN)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total study duration is up to 34 weeks: Screening up to 28 days, treatment phase of 24 weeks, and post-treatment follow-up of 6 weeks. After completion of the treatment phase of this study, patients are eligible to enter a long term safety study (LTS11210) for active treatment with SAR153191 (REGN88).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Diagnosis of RA, according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) 2010 Rheumatoid Arthritis Classification Criteria with ≥ 3 months disease duration. ACR Class IIII functional status, based on the 1991 revised criteria. Moderatetoseverely active RA. AntiTNF therapy failures, defined as patients with an inadequate clinical response defined by the investigator, after being treated for at least 3 consecutive months, and/or intolerance to at least 1 TNFantagonist, resulting in or requiring their discontinuation. TNFantagonists may include, but are not limited to, etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab and/or certolizumab pegol. Continuous treatment with one or a combination of nonbiologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for at least 12 consecutive weeks prior to screening and on a stable dose(s) for at least 6 consecutive weeks prior to screening: Methotrexate 10 to 25 mg/wk orally or parenteral (or per local labeling requirements if the dose range differs) Leflunomide 10 to 20 mg orally daily Sulfasalazine (SSZ) 1000 to 3000 mg orally daily Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 200 to 400 mg orally daily Exclusion criteria: Patients &lt;18 years of age. Use of parenteral corticosteroids or intraarticular corticosteroids within 4 weeks prior to screening. Use of oral corticosteroids in a dose higher than prednisone 10 mg or equivalent per day, or a change in dosage within 4 weeks prior to screening. Past history of, or current, autoimmune or inflammatory systemic or localized joint disease(s) other than RA. History of juvenile idiopathic arthritis or arthritis onset prior to age 16. Severe systemic RA, including but not limited to vasculitis, pulmonary fibrosis, and/or Felty's syndrome. Participation in any clinical research study that evaluated an investigational drug or therapy within 5 halflives or 60 days of the Screening Visit, whichever is longer. Patients with active tuberculosis or latent tuberculosis infection. Prior or current history of interstitial lung disease. Prior treatment with antiIL6 or antiIL6R therapies, including but not limited to tocilizumab or sarilumab. Treatment with antiTNF agents, as follows: Etanercept: within 28 days prior to randomization Infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, certolizumab pegol: within 42 days prior to randomization. Treatment with RAdirected biologic agents with non TNFα antagonist mechanisms without adequate washout as follows: Anakinra: within 28 days prior to randomization Abatacept: within 42 days prior to randomization Rituximab or other cell depleting agent: Within 6 months prior to randomization or until total lymphocyte count and CD 19+ lymphocyte count are normalized, or whichever is longer. Prior treatment with a janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor (eg, tofacitinib). Patients with a history of invasive opportunistic infection. Prior or current history of malignancy, including lymphoproliferative diseases, other than adequatelytreated carcinoma insitu of the cervix, nonmetastatic squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma of the skin, within 5 years prior to the randomization (baseline) visit. Prior or current history of other significant concomitant illness(es) that, according to Investigator's judgment, would adversely affect the patient's participation in the study. The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
