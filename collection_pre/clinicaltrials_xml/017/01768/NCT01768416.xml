	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to use the BIS monitor to assess the degree of consciousness in pre-terminal palliative patients admitted to our palliative care unit and to ascertain if this tool provides a more accurate assessment of consciousness in this specific group of patients than clinical observation of consciousness and the use of sedation scales. We hypothesize that the measured BIS results provide a more accurate assessment of the patient's level of consciousness than routine clinical observation or the use of sedation scales.</brief_summary>
