	<brief_summary>A double-blind randomized controlled trial to compare a shorter interval between the administration of mifepristone and misoprostol (simultaneous administration compared to 24hours from administration of mifepristone to receipt of the first dose of misoprostol) for termination of pregnancy up to 13-22 weeks of gestation. The investigators hypothesize that a shortened interval may achieve comparable efficacy in terminating pregnancy, whilst reducing the duration of the procedure and in turn, the duration of hospitalization.</brief_summary>
