	<brief_title>Phase 2 Efficacy Trial of OLT1177 Gel in Subjects With Moderate to Severe Pain Associated With OA of the Knee</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, repeat-dose, multi-center Phase 2 efficacy and safety clinical trial of subjects with moderate to severe pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee. Eighty-four subjects, randomized in a 2:1 ratio (OLT1177 Gel to vehicle control) will receive up to 40 doses of the Investigational Drug (56 subjects OLT1177 Gel and 28 subjects vehicle control) over 14 consecutive days given 3 times per day (4 mL per dose, TID on Days 1 - 13 with only one dose administered on Day 14, assuming TID on Day 1) and will have safety data collected through Day 28. Subjects with moderate to severe pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee will be evaluated twice for eligibility: 1) at the Screening visit; and 2) at the Baseline (Day 0) visit, after a 7-day washout period of all pain medications except for trial provided Rescue Medication (500 mg/dose of acetaminophen) for those that experience unacceptable pain during the washout and 14-day treatment period. Subjects will be encouraged not to take any pain medication during the 7-day washout period; however, for the first 5 days they are allowed to take only Rescue Medication. No pain medication, including Rescue Medication, is allowed during the 2-day pain intensity assessment period or within 48 hours of the Baseline (Day 0), Day 7 and Day 14 visits. Subjects will be asked to record and report their level of pain at different time points throughout the 14-day trial.</detailed_description>
