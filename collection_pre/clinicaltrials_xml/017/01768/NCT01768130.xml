	<brief_summary>The study will investigate the test-retest variability of thermal thresholds in patients with persistent pain after open inguinal herniotomy. Sensory mapping with a cool metal roller delineated an area with cool sensory dysfunction on the painful site. In this area and in a contralateral area as a control, 5 sites were outlined, including the point of maximum pain. In these total 10 sites warmth detection threshold (WDT), cool detection threshold (CDT) and heat pain threshold (HPT) were assessed using quantitative sensory testing. Tests were repeated after a 4-6 weeks interval.</brief_summary>
