	<brief_title>Antibiotic Prophylaxis When Removing Ureteric Stent After Stone Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many patients undergoing stone surgery receive a ureteric stent that should be removed after 14 days. This stent is removed cystoscopically and today this is done without giving antibiotics. Some patients get urinary tract infections subject to this. However the investigators do not know how many of these patients get UTI as most are followed by their primary care doctor. With this study the investigators would like to find out whether it is possible to avoid such infections and also find out how many actually do get infected.</detailed_description>
