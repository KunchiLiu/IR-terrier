	<brief_summary>A growing body of evidence suggests that in individuals with chronic lung disease their walk speed is related to their daily function and quality of life. It is possible to assess their usual (routine) and fast walking speeds by getting them to walk in a flat hallway. In individuals with chronic lung disease, we anticipate that their usual walk speed will be helpful in exercise prescription and use in multidimensional scoring systems. However, it is important to first determine the measurement properties of these two walk speeds.</brief_summary>
