At Screening, participant agrees not to take part in other research studies involving drugs, medical devices, or vaginal/rectal products for the duration of study participation (including the time between the Screening and Enrollment visits) Participants in the biopsy subset must also meet the following criteria at Screening to be eligible for inclusion: 14.

Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) 2. Hemoglobin 3. Platelet count 4. Serum creatinine Otherwise eligible participants with an exclusionary test result(s) listed above may be retested during the screening process. If a participant is retested and a nonexclusionary result is documented within the 42 days of providing informed consent, the participant may be enrolled. 3. Urinary tract infection (UTI) at Screening and/or Enrollment Note: Otherwise eligible participants diagnosed with UTI during Screening will be offered treatment and may be enrolled after completing treatment and all symptoms have resolved.

Note: Otherwise eligible participants with exclusionary pelvic and/or rectal examination findings may be enrolled/randomized after the findings have improved to a nonexclusionary severity grading or resolved. If improvement to a nonexclusionary grade or resolution is documented within 42 days of providing informed consent, the participant may be enrolled. 6. Any other condition that, in the opinion of the IoR/designee, would preclude informed consent, make study participation unsafe, complicate interpretation of study outcome data, or otherwise interfere with achieving the study objectives per the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events Version 1.0, December, 2004 (Clarification dated August 2009) ** per the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events Version 1.0, December, 2004 (Clarification dated August 2009), Addendum 1 Female Genital Grading Table for Use in Microbicide Studies *** per the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events Version 1.0, December, 2004 (Clarification dated August 2009), Addendum 3 Rectal Grading Table for Use in Microbicide Studies (Clarification dated May 2012).</criteria>
