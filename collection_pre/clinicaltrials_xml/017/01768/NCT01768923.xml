	<brief_summary>To investigate the effect of two tight-control treatment strategies, aiming at 1) 2011 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) definition of remission compare with 2) minimal disease activity (Disease Activity Index in 28 joints [DAS28] &lt;2.6), on arterial stiffness in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. To compare the effect of two treatments on arterial stiffness in Early Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early RA Vascular Randomised Controlled Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One hundred RA patients with active disease (DAS28 &gt;/=3.2), duration of symptoms less than 2 years, and are disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug naive will participate in this 1-year prospective, hospital-based, open-label, randomized, controlled trial. All participants will receive 1-year tight-control treatment. One hundred patients will be randomly assigned to two arms. Treatment will be adjusted according to a standardized protocol every 3-monthly aiming at remission defined by the 2011 ACR/EULAR definition (Group 1, n=50, simplified disease activity score [SDAI] â‰¤3.3) or minimal disease activity (Group 2, n=50, DAS28&lt;2.6).</detailed_description>
