	<brief_title>Ultrasonography Guided Subacromial Sodium Hyaluronate Injection in Rotator Cuff Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rotator cuff disease in particular is a common cause of shoulder pain and weakness and comprises a significant proportion of the musculoskeletal complaints presenting to primary care doctors. Ultrasound is a readily available and cheap modality for looking more specifically at the rotator cuff and surrounding structures. More recently, ultrasound guidance has become a commonly employed method to perform diagnostic or therapeutic interventions. Despite the long history and the fact that this is a common diagnosis made in clinical practice, the exact cause and best treatment for this condition still are being explored. Although there are a few high-quality studies demonstrating the efficacy of sodium hyaluronate injection for rotator cuff disease, this study will be performed to examine the effect of ultrasound-guided subacromial sodium hyaluronate injection in patients with impingement syndrome without rotator cuff complete tear.</detailed_description>
