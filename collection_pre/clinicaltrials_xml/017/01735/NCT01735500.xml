	<brief_summary>A prospective Study, aiming to understand and analyse the key role of the novel High Sensitivity Troponin T (hsTnT) within a group of patients undergoing an uncomplicated coronary angiography without receiving any additional intervention. The peri-procedural elevation of the hsTnT indicates some other factors being responsible for the elevation of the hsTnT in absence of an acute coronary syndrome, such as physiological components or micro-injuries. A one year follow-up has been collected.</brief_summary>
