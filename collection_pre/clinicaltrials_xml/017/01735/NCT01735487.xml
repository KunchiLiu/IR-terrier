	<detailed_description>The study is randomised cross-over trial designed to compare: 1) Cognitive performances levels for four different e-Cigarette strength. Participants will be requested to abstain from smoking and alcohol from 20:00 on the night before each study day and from food and caffeine for at least 1 h before the session. On arrival at the study centre, carbon monoxide (CO) will be measured in participants' expired breath. If CO will be &gt;15 parts per million (ppm), the assigned study treatment will be allocated; however, if CO was &gt;15 ppm or they will report smoking in the previous 12 h, participants will be rescheduled wherever possible to a subsequent session. On the first study day, participants will be randomised to use one of five ordered conditions: Electronic Nicotine Delivery Device (ENDD) (fourth generation) containing nicotine 2,4%; Electronic Nicotine Delivery Device (ENDD (second generation) containing nicotine 7,4 mg; Electronic Nicotine Delivery Device (ENDD containing nicotine 9 mg; Electronic Nicotine Delivery Device (ENDD nicotine free; their usual cigarette. Additionally participants will be trained to use an electronic cigarette. The following tests will be completed at the each visits: Continuous Performance Test - AX version (CPT-AX), Wisconsin card sorting test( WCST), Working memory test (N-BACK).</detailed_description>
