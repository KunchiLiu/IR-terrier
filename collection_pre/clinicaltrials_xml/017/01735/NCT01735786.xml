	<brief_summary>Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) has been widely used as a diagnostic and treatment techniques of gastrointestinal small lesions. Postoperative rebleeding is one of the common complication following EMR. Several endoscopic hemostasis methods are currently in use. EndoClotÂ® absorbable polysaccharide hemostat (PAPH) as a new hemostasis material was previously used for surgical hemostasis, but the therapeutic effect and safety in endoscopic application remains unknown. This study has been designed to observe the effect of rebleeding prevention after EMR.</brief_summary>
