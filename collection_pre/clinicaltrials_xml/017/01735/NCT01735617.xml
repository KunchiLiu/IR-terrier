	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to gather safety and effectiveness information about a new formulation of Hydrocortisone (Chronocort®) used to treat patients with a disease called congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Hydrocortisone is the man-made version of the hormone cortisol, which is released in the body following a regular daily pattern. The objective of the study is to measure the levels of hydrocortisone that are absorbed into the bloodstream once Chronocort® is taken and what affects it has on other hormones in the body. Since Chronocort® is anticipated to mimic the same release pattern of cortisol in the body, it is hoped that patients with CAH will be treated more effectively to manage their disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study to Characterize and Examine the Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of Chronocort® in Adults With CAH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a Phase 2 pilot study to characterize and examine the pharmacokinetics and efficacy profile of Chronocort® in adults with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). It is designed as a two-part, single cohort, open label, multiple dose Phase 2 pilot study to: (Part A) characterize and examine the pharmacokinetics (PK) and disease bio-marker behavior following short-term dosing with Chronocort®; and to (Part B) examine the disease control after six months dose titration with Chronocort® in adults with CAH.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Known CAH due to 21hydroxylase deficiency (classic CAH) based on hormonal and genetic testing currently treated with hydrocortisone, prednisone, prednisolone or dexamethasone on a stable dosage for a minimum of 3 months. 2. Male or female patients aged 18 and above. 3. Provision of signed written informed consent. 4. Good general health. 5. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test initially and at all visits. Females who are engaging in sexual intercourse must be using a medically acceptable method of contraception (as defined in the protocol, section 10.5). 6. Plasma renin activity must be within the clinically acceptable range at screening (less than 1.5 times upper normal range). 1. Comorbid condition requiring daily administration of a medication that induces hepatic enzymes or interferes with the metabolism of glucocorticoids. 2. Clinical or biochemical evidence of hepatic or renal disease. Creatinine above the normal range or elevated liver function tests (ALT or AST) &gt; 2 times the upper limits of normal. 3. Females who are pregnant or lactating. 4. Women taking an estrogencontaining oral contraceptive pill and who have taken it within 6 weeks of recruitment. 5. Patients taking spironolactone. 6. Patients on inhaled or oral steroids apart from treatment for CAH. 7. Patients with any other significant medical or psychiatric conditions that in the opinion of the Investigator would preclude participation in the trial. 8. Participation in another clinical trial of an investigational or licensed drug or device within the 3 months prior to inclusion in this study. 9. Patients with history of bilateral adrenalectomy.</criteria>
