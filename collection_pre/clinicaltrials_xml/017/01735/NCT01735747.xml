	<brief_summary>In this trial, we will treat newly diagnosed PCNSL with temozolomide, nedaplatin, vincristine (TNV) as the replacement of high-dose methotrexate to combine with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Our objective was to assess our treatment strategies' availability based on response rates, progression-free survival (PFS), median PFS, and toxicity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide, Nedaplatin, Vincristine, and Radiotherapy as First-line Treatment in Newly Diagnosed Primary CNS Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The best reported outcomes of PCNSL treatment are high-dose methotrexate-based chemotherapy combined with whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT). Despite aggressive therapy, however, nearly 50% of patients will relapse within 24 months of diagnosis. Furthermore, the application of high-dose methotrexate-based regimen is complex, needing be hydrated, alkalified and detoxified, and treatment-related toxicity mortality is severe[3,4]. In an attempt to improve upon these poor results and reduce treatment-related side effects, we will treat about 15-20 PCNSL patients with temozolomide concurrent chemoradiotherapy at the outset and then adjuvant chemotherapy for 6 cycles with temozolomide, nedaplatin, vincristine, as part of front-line therapy. Our objective is to assess our treatment strategies' availability based on response rates, progression-free survival (PFS), median PFS, and toxicity.</detailed_description>
