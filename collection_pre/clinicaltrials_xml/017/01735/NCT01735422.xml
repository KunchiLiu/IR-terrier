	<brief_summary>This is a single center, open-label, randomized, parallel group, dose finding study to evaluate safety and efficacy of recombinant human luteinizing hormone (r-hLH, LHadi速), compared with urinary human chorionic gonadotrophin (u-hCG, Profasi速), both given subcutaneously, in inducing ovulation in infertile women undergoing stimulation of follicular growth with recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (r-hFSH, Gonal-F速).</brief_summary>
