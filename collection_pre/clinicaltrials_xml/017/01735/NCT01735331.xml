	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is determine vascular endothelial growth factor levels and angiogenesis/vascularity from hysteroscopic endometrial biopsies which taken from patients who has Recurrent Pregnancy Loss.The endometrial vascular endothelial growth factor levels will be measured by immunohistochemical staining methods due to office hysteroscopic endometrial biopsy after the menstruation at follicular phase of menstrual cycle.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Levels at Hysteroscopic Biopsies Which Taken From Recurrent Pregnancy Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a prospective,observational,single-center study.Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board.This study will be completed 30 patients with Habitual Abortus. Endometrial vascular endothelial growth factor levels will be measured using Flk-1 / Kinase Domain Receptor / Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, Ab-1 (Rabbit PAb), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Ab-7 (VG1), Cluster of Differentiation 34 (Endothelial Cell Marker) Ab-1 (QBEnd/10), Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (N-term) (FLT1) antibody kits. All assays will be performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.</detailed_description>
