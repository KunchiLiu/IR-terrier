	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to determine whether supplementation with oils enriched with long chain n-3 PUFA, either EPA or DHA, had a differential effect on platelet, endothelial and vascular function.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Differential Effects of Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) and Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) on Platelet, Endothelial and Vascular Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Relatively few studies have made a head-to-head comparison of DHA (22:6n-3) with EPA (20:5n-3). The understanding of this differential effect may be of great interest in populations with low EPA intake such as vegetarians, who may choose to supplement their dietary intake of long-chain n-3 PUFA in the form of DHA-rich algal oil. This study aimed to investigate the effect of supplementation with oils rich in either EPA or DHA (3g/day, 6 weeks) in healthy young males on platelet, endothelial and vascular function, as well as other CVD risk factors. The primary outcomes were platelet monocyte aggregates and endothelial progenitor cells - novel markers of platelet and endothelial function, measured by flow cytometry, Secondary outcomes included capillary density, measured by capillaroscopy to assess changes in microvascular function, pulse wave analysis, digital volume pulse and ambulatory blood pressure. Other secondary outcomes included lipid profiles (TAG, cholesterol, NEFA), glycaemic control (HOMA, QUICKI) and oxidative stress (isoprostane). The omega-3 index (erythrocyte EPA+DHA) was used as a marker of compliance.</detailed_description>
