	<brief_summary>Surgical treatment for type 2 diabetes has been taken note especially in less obese or non obese patients. In Asian, the nuber of less obses or non obese patients with T2DM is greater than that of the obese. We are trying to do a prospective observational study for the evaluation of the effect of duidenojejunal bypass and gastric bypass on the glycemoc control in those patients. The selection criteria are type 2 diabetess, 20-60 years old, BMI 23-34 or 21-22 with viceral obesity, insulin use less than 10 years and the patients understanding the hypothesis of this study, risks, expecting effects and agreeing this study. We are checking oral GTT, insulin level, C-peptide level, HbA1C, etc. with some anthropometric measurs preoperatively, postoperatively, at 3 month and 12 month. We will compare the clinical factors at each time.</brief_summary>
