	<brief_summary>The Israel Terminally Ill Law, 2005 allows patients who are terminally ill and ventilated to have their ventilator placed on a timer which at a specific time in the future stops the ventilator, maintains the patient on positive pressure (CPAP) and allows the patient not to be reconnected to the ventilator. We will evaluate the safety of the Automatic Respiration Transfer-Timer by assessing vital signs, oxygenation and ventilatory pressures and volumes during the use of the timer with the regular ventilator. In addition, we will evaluate whether the timer stops the ventilator and switches to CPAP at the designated time.</brief_summary>
