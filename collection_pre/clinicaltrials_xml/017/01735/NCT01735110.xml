	<brief_title>PREPARE：Assessing the Safety and Efficacy of Radial Versus Femoral Approach PCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transradial intervention (TRI) has been widely practiced in China, accounting for approximate 80 to 90% of procedures. A recent meta-analysis indicated that TRI has advantages in reducing major bleeding and ischemic events compared to transfemoral intervention (TFI) after the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, no clinical trial has yet shown statistical equivalence in terms of long-term efficacy of TRI compared with TFI for the treatment of complex coronary lesions, which is simply due to limited numbers of subjects enrolled. The purpose of PREPARE trial is to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of TRI versus TFI for PCI in patients with left main (LM) and/or three-vessel coronary artery disease.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patient must be at least 18 years of age. Patient is able to verbally acknowledge an understanding of the associated risks, benefits and treatment alternatives and he or his legally authorized representative provides written informed consent prior to the randomization, as approved by the appropriate IEC. Patient must have evidence of myocardial ischemia (e.g., stable or unstable angina, silent ischemia, positive functional study or a reversible changes in the electrocardiogram (ECG) consistent with ischemia). Patient must be an acceptable candidate for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Patient with complex lesion who may need two or more than 2 stents implantation during the indexed procedure is required surgeon's consultation before the operation. The surgical consultation outcome must be recorded in detail. Patient must agree to undergo all protocolrequired followup examinations. Patient must agree not to participate in any other clinical study within the duration of this trial. Angiographic inclusion criteria： Target lesion must be able to be treated by using sixFrench guiding catheters. Target lesion can be Left Main and/or Multivessel Diseases with Syntax score ≤32 for LM and Syntax score ≤22 for MVD. Patient has received a heart transplant or any other organ transplant or is on a waiting list for any organ transplant. Patient is receiving or scheduled to receive chemotherapy for malignancy. Patient is receiving immunosuppression therapy or has known immunosuppressive or autoimmune disease (e.g. Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Lupus etc. Not include diabetes mellitus). Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, zotarolimus, polymer, Nickel, cobalt, chromium, iron, tungsten, etc. or stainless steel. Patient has extensive peripheral vascular disease that precludes safely insertion of 6 French sheath. Patient has other medical illness (e.g., cancer or congestive heart failure) that may cause noncompliance with the protocol, confound the data interpretation or is associated with a limited life expectancy (i.e., less than one year). Female patients of childbearing potential who have refused a urine or blood pregnancy test (to be done within 7 days prior to index procedure), patients who are nursing at the time of index procedure and those patients who do not agree at the time of consent to use any approved form of birth control up to and including the followup at 1 year. STEMI within 72h prior to procedure. History of CABG. Radial artery or femoral artery presence serious vascular bend or deformity that the 6F sheath can not go though. Based on investigator's clinical judgments, highrisk patients, referring to predicted procedural risks being higher than the procedural benefits must be excluded.</criteria>
