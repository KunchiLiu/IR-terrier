	<brief_summary>Since both pathologies (PCOS and NAFLD) involve disturbed carbohydrate economy, which revolve around insulin resistance, it is tempting to examine the specific "liver profile" of women with PCOD. Furthermore, it would be of great importance if lean women who suffer from PCOD would be revealed to shere cardiovascular risks with their more overweight peers. Patients - women who will be diagnosed with PCOD following their initial referal to our fertility clinic. Controls - normal ovulatory women who approached our fertility clinic due to either unexplained or male factor infertility. Workup - history for menstrual pattern; Clinical evaluation for features of hyperandrogenism; ultrasonographic documentation of ovarian morphology; follicular phase hormonal profile for validation of the diagnosis and for ruling out other pathologies which may cause anovulation. Liver profiling - The following blood tests will be used for the biochemical profiling: fasting glucose and insulin, CRP, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, AST, ALT, GGT, LDH, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, ferritin, HBA1C and micro albumin ratio. FibroScan® will be used to measure liver stiffness.</brief_summary>
