	<brief_summary>The investigators aimed to study the effect of prohepcidin levels on hematologic parameters and inflammatory markers in non-diabetic uremic patients. The investigators selected three groups of patients: Hemodialysis group, peritoneal dialysis group and the group with stage 4 chronic kidney disease. A control group was formed from healthy volunteers also. Each group has been planned to be formed of about 25 patients. Diabetic patients were excluded. Prohepcidin, hsCRP, IL-6, fibrinogen have been planned to be studied besides other routine biochemical analysis including hematological ones.</brief_summary>
