	<brief_title>Comparative Study of Algipore and Decalcified Freeze-dried Bone Allograft in Open Maxillary Sinus Augmentation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vertical and horizontal bone resorption of the alveolar ridge are common in edentulous jaws. In the distal area of the maxilla, an adequate bone volume is often lacking because of the proximity of the sinus cavities to crestal bone. Sinus floor augmentation is an established way of increasing the height and volume of bone in the posterior region of the maxilla, which increase the stability of dental implants. For this purpose various materials, including auto grafts, allografts, alloplasts, and xenografts have been used.</detailed_description>
