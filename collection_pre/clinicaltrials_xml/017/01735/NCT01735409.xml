	<brief_summary>This is a single center, non-randomized phase IIa study to determine the tolerance and safety of Abraxane (ABX) in combination with cisplatin (DDP) in patients with advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Patients in whom the standard therapy had failed or had been infeasible will be eligible.The safety and efficacy will be evaluated according to NCI-CTCAE V4.0 and RECIST 1.1 respectively.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose-finding Study of Abraxane in Combination With Cisplatin to Treat Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is most commonly seen in Southeast Asia, especially in southern and southeastern China, where the incidence rate has been documented between 10 and 150 cases per 100,000 population per year. For advanced or metastatic NPC, chemotherapy remain the mainstay of treatment. The 130-nm albumin-bound formulation of paclitaxel ([Abraxane, ABX ];Celgene,Summit,NJ) is a promising new agent with more efficient entry to the tumor microenvironment via caveolae-mediated transcytosis and preferential uptake by cancer cells. Superior activity of ABX-based regimens without the necessity for antianaphylactic pretreatments been shown in various solid tumors compared with the traditional solvent-based paclitaxel-based ones. However, the safety and efficacy of combination of ABX and cisplatin (DDP) has not been determined in patients with advanced NPC. In this single center, non-randomized phase IIa study, investigators seek to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of ABX-DDP, and perform an exploratory study of its efficacy as measured by tumor response.</detailed_description>
