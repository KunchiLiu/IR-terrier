	<brief_summary>Anesthesiologists get a course on localizing the cricothyroid membrane on a human using ultrasonography. Thereafter their ability to localize the cricothyroid membrane with either palpation or ultrasonography, in a randomised fashion, is tested.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasound Examination Versus Palpation to Locate the Cricothyroid Membrane</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ability to localize the cricothyroid membrane on patients before airway management is crucial in order to be able to follow the difficult airway algorithms. Studies have show a high failure rate when anesthesiologists rely on palpation. In this study Anesthesiologists get an e-learning course, get literature to study , and get a theoretical course and a hands-on course in using ultrasound for localizing the cricothyroid membrane. . Thereafter their ability to localize the cricothyroid membrane with either palpation or ultrasonography, in a randomised fashion, is tested.</detailed_description>
