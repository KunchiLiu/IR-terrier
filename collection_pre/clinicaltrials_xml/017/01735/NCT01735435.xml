	<brief_summary>The aim of this study to assess the impact of nutritional support guided by repeated measurements of REE in geriatric patients following surgery for hip fractures. Our hypothesis is that tight caloric control will reduce the risk of significant postoperative complications in geriatric patients following surgery for hip fractures. Study Design :Prospective, Single center, Randomized, Unblinded study. Study Population:geriatric patients following surgery for hip fractures.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tight Caloric Balance in Geriatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary outcome: presence of postoperative complications,hospital length of stay. Secondary outcomes: energy intake and calculated energy balance Study Procedure: eligible patients will be randomly assigned to 2 groups: the tight calorie (intervention)group and the control group.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>patients older than 65 years who were admitted to the unit following hip fracture within 48 hours of the injury and in whom orthopedic surgery was considered the treatment of choice. Patients were excluded if they presented to hospital &gt; 48 hours after the injury, were receiving steroids and/or immunosuppression therapy; in the presence of active oncologic disease, multiple fractures, diagnosed dementia or in the event that patients required supplemental nasal oxygen which precludes the measurement of resting energy expenditure.</criteria>
