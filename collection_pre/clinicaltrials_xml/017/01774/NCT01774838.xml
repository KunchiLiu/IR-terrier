	<brief_title>Vasoactive and Anti-inflammatory Effects of Prasugrel in Acute Coronary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trial Objectives To test the vasoactive and anti-inflammatory effects of prasugrel in patients with acute coronary syndrome, endothelial function -as a surrogate parameter of NO bioavailability- and different markers of inflammation, oxidative stress and platelet activation will be assessed in patients with unstable angina. Trial Design Single center, double blind, double-dummy, randomized, parallel trial. Endpoints Primary Endpoint Assessment of endothelial function (FMD) via high-resolution ultrasound (Sonoline G50, 12 MHz linear array transducer, Siemens, Germany) by experienced sonographer. Secondary Endpoints - Non-invasive assessment of microvascular perfusion and oxygen saturation by laser Doppler perfusion imaging and tissue spectrometry (O2C, Lea Medizintechnik, Giessen, Germany) - Determination of leukocyte activity: plasma MPO levels (ELISA), plasma elastase levels (ELISA) - Assessment of platelet activity: plasma levels of sCD40 ligand (ELISA), RANTES (ELISA) - Measurement of different oxidative stress markers: hsCRP (ELISA), CD40 ligand (ELISA), carbonylated proteins (ELISA), urinary 8-iso-PGF2α (gas chromatography mass spectrometry) - Determination of platelet-leukocyte aggregates by fluorescent activated cell sorter (FACS) - Assessment of platelet function (PADA-test)</detailed_description>
