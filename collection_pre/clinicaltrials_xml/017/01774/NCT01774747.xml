Have normal hepatic function [aspartate transaminase (AST), bilirubin, and alanine transaminase (ALT)] and renal function (creatinine clearance greater than 80 mL/min as assessed by Cockcroft Gault equation using serum creatinine) at screening and Day 1. Be females who are of childbearing potential: have a negative serum hCG pregnancy test at screening and Day 1; willing to not breastfeed from Day 5 until 90 days after discharge from the study site; Be females who are: unable to have children (eg, post menopausal, tubal ligation, hysterectomy) OR willing to remain abstinent (not engage in sexual intercourse) from check in until 90 days after discharge from the study site. OR willing to use an effective method of doublebarrier birth control (eg, partner using condom and female using diaphragm, contraceptive sponge, spermicide, or intrauterine device) from checkin until 90 days after discharge from the study site. Be males who: are sterile or willing to remain sexually abstinent or use an effective method of birth control (eg, condom) from checkin until 90 days after discharge from the study site. AND agree not to donate sperm during the study and for 90 days after discharge from the study site. Refrain from strenuous physical activity from 48 hours prior to checkin until discharge from the study site. Agree to remain housed at the study site for the clinical confinement of study and return for any visits required for additional safety or PK assessments. Agree to consume study meals per protocol. Subjects with MDD: In addition to inclusion criteria mentioned above for healthy subjects, the following inclusion criteria will be applied to subjects with MDD: Have the diagnosis of MDD as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition; Text Revision (DSM IV TR) criteria and confirmed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) diagnostic interview. This diagnosis will be confirmed by a psychiatrist or psychologist. The diagnosis should be supplemented (when possible) by confirmation of chart records or by a discussion with a treating healthcare professional or reliable informant. Diagnosis made by a psychologist must be reviewed by a psychiatrist. The subjects' current major depressive episode must be â‰¥ 4 weeks and &lt; 2 years in duration.

Have a stable living arrangement for at least 3 months prior to check in and agree to return to a similar living arrangement after discharge. This criterion is not meant to exclude subjects who have temporarily left a stable living environment. Such subjects remain eligible to participate in this study. Chronically homeless subjects should not be enrolled. The Medical Monitor should be consulted for individual cases as needed.

Considered by the PI to be at imminent risk of suicide or injury to self, others, or property. Subject answers "yes" to "Suicidal Ideation" Items 4 or 5 on the CSSRS at screening. Subjects who, by history, have smoked or used tobacco products within 60 days from screening until study follow up. Consumption of food or beverages containing alcohol, grapefruit, or caffeine within 72 hours prior to check in and until discharge from the study site, unless deemed acceptable by the PI. Participation in any other investigational study drug trial in which receipt of an investigational study drug occurred within 5 half lives or 3 months prior to checkin, whichever is longer. Taken any drug(s) known to be clinically relevant cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6), or cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors or inducers within 28 days prior to the first DSP 1053 dose and during the study conduct through follow up. Taken any antihistamines within 14 days prior to checkin and during the study. Family history of prolonged QT interval (QTc) prolongation.

Use of any prescription medications/products within 14 days prior to check in unless deemed acceptable by the PI. Subjects with MDD Except for Exclusion Criterion 18 mentioned above for healthy subjects all exclusion criteria will be applied and in addition the following exclusion criteria will be applied to subjects with MDD: History of bipolar disorder (I or II), schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, eating disorder, or obsessive compulsive disorder.
