	<brief_summary>A. Specific Aims: 1. There is one specific aim of this study. The aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of early standardized task-specific training (ESTT) in persons with acute stroke. B. Hypothesis: 1. It is our hypothesis that subjects who receive ESTT will walk faster and more symmetrically than published reports of gait outcomes in persons with stroke.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Early Standardized Task-Specific Training (ESTT)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is our contention that gait recovery after stroke is impacted by the interventions that are acutely utilized during training. There is not a consensus about how to most effectively train individuals after stroke. It is clear, however, that most persons are left with significant and often debilitating gait dysfunction after stroke so there is an urgent need to find more effective therapeutic methods.</detailed_description>
