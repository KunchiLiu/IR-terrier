	<brief_summary>This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter, international, parallel arm study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab, fluoropyrimidine and cisplatin as first-line treatment in participants with HER2-positive metastatic gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) or gastric cancer (GC). Participants will be randomized to receive pertuzumab 840 milligrams (mg) or placebo intravenously every 3 weeks (q3w) in combination with trastuzumab (initial dose of 8 milligrams per kilogram [mg/kg] intravenously [IV] followed by 6 mg/kg IV q3w) and cisplatin and fluoropyrimidine (capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil) for the first 6 treatment cycles. Participants will continue to receive pertuzumab or placebo and trastuzumab until disease progression occurrence of unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal from the study for another reason.</brief_summary>
