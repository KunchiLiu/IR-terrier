	<brief_summary>It is a cohort to evaluate the power of different diagnostic tests in predicting the prognosis of patients with severe liver disease. Patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis on the waiting list for liver transplantation will be evaluated with comparison of different diagnostic tests according to the MELD score (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease), MELD-Na (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease and sodium), indocyanine green clearance test, hepatic venous pressure gradient and transient elastography. All patients will be submitted to all the tests and prospectively followed for 6 months, to establish mortality and complications related to liver disease in order to define the value of each method to predict outcomes.</brief_summary>
