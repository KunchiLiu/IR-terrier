Subjects may continue on their current medication regimen to control preexisting medical and psychiatric (other than schizophrenia) conditions including the use of PRN medications. 8. Subject is currently stable on a 4, 6, or 8mg oral dose of risperidone for 30 days prior to admission Subject Exclusion Criteria 1. Known hypersensitivity or allergy to lidocaine or any local anesthetic agent of the amide type (local anesthetic used during implant and explant procedures) 2. Known sensitivity to polyurethane 3. Hospitalized or required acute crisis intervention for symptom exacerbation in the 30 days prior to admission as determined by the Investigator 4. Subject has a history of suicide attempt in the last year, or in the opinion of the investigator is currently at imminent risk of suicide 5. Reports or reveals a presence of clinically significant skin disorders (such as, but not limited to, skin cancer, psoriasis, eczema, or atopic dermatitis), evidence of recent sunburn, scar tissue, tattoo, open sore, body piercing or branding at the intended implantation site that would interfere with the implantation procedure or interfere with implant site assessments as determined by the Investigator 6. History of abnormal scar formation or family history of keloid formation 7. Have a positive screen for substances of abuse conducted at screening or had any history of abuse in the last six months as defined by DSMIV criteria 8. Have impaired hepatic (ALT/AST &gt;1.5 times higher than the upper limit of normal) or renal function (eGFR &lt;50mL/min) 9. Previously defined hypersensitivity to risperidone 10. History of neuromalignant syndrome (NMS) 11. Electroconvulsive therapy within 6 months of admission 12. Treatment of coexisting medical conditions that require the introduction of cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitors or inducers 13. Positive screen for Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg), Hepatitis C Antibody (anti HCV), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody and/or antigen 14. Participation in the treatment phase of a clinical study or receipt of an investigational drug within 30 days prior to study drug administration on Day 1; for investigational drugs with an elimination halflife greater than 15 days, this time period will be extended to 60 days 15. Prior participation in a EN3342 study 16. Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both Endo staff or staff at the investigational site) 17.
