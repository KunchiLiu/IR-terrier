	<brief_summary>Children who suffer fractures to the growth plates (physes) of their bones are at risk for premature growth arrest which can lead to long term complications. There is currently no technique to predict who is at risk of growth arrest following a physeal injury. The investigators aim to determine if diffusion MRI (an imaging method to analyze tissue properties) can effectively pick up differences between a healthy growth plate and an injured one. This would allow orthopaedics surgeons to predict which injuries are at a higher risk of growth arrest, so earlier interventions can be done in the orthopaedic clinic.</brief_summary>
