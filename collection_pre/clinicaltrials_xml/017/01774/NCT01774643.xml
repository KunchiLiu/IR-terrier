	<brief_summary>This is a feasibility study to perform image-guided liver biopsies in 25 patients who have pancreatic cancer with liver metastasis (cancer in the pancreas that has spread to the liver). This will contribute with samples for the bio-bank (bank of tumors) and develop xenografts (human tumors growing in mice) for further analysis of genes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study might bring a better understanding of the metastatic pancreatic cancer and evaluate the differences between the metastatic and the primary pancreatic cancer (the type that does not have metastasis).</detailed_description>
