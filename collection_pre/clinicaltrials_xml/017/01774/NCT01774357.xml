	<brief_summary>This is an observational registry study aiming to collect data on efficacy and safety of the single chamber Biotronik DX system with enhanced atrial diagnostics. The minimal follow-up period is 24 months. All analyses on the data will be done post-hoc; the study does not intend to confirm any pre-specified hypotheses.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Management and Detection of Atrial Tachyarrhythmias in Patients Implanted With BIOTRONIK DX Systems</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Enrollment (E0) Timing: • The enrollment (date of patient written informed consent) starts after implantation of a BIOTRONIK Lumax 540 VR-T DX ICD with Linoxsmart S DX or successor single chamber DX system according to current guidelines (primary or secondary prevention) but should not be later than 90 days after implantation. Procedures: - Check inclusion and exclusion criteria - Patient information and written informed consent process - Assignment of a unique study code - ICD interrogation (re-programming if necessary) - HMSC registration (recommended) - Investigator assessment: appropriate atrial sensing Documentation (note: where available the most recent assessment recorded within six months prior to hospital discharge shall be considered): - Medical History: - Demographic data - General history of cardiovascular disease - Etiology of underlying heart disease - Cardiac events and symptoms - Documented supraventricular arrhythmia prior to implantation - Device Interrogation - Date, home monitoring function, MRI scan - AF history: - type (none, paroxysmal, persistent, permanent) - date of first diagnosis (if applicable) - EHRA classification (if applicable) - AF burden (if available) - CHA2DS2-VASc - Risk factors and comorbidities: - thyroid dysfunction - diabetes mellitus - COPD - sleep apnea - chronic renal disease - History of thromboembolic events or stroke - Physical Examination: - Vital signs (SBP, DBP, height, body weight, BMI) - Current medication (substance class) - Heart failure indices - NYHA classification - BNP and NT-proBNP (only if determined in routine clinical practice) - LVEF (optional; echocardiography preferred, other methods accepted if no echo available) - ECG parameters (12 lead ECG; optional) - RR, PQ, and QT intervals - QRS width - rhythm disorders - clinical findings, morphology - Implantation: - Indication (primary prevention, secondary prevention) - Type of procedure (first implantation / replacement) - RV lead: - Dislodgement / repositioning after implantation? - Sufficient amplitudes (Atrial; Ventricular) and thresholds (Ventricular) - Other clinical complications during / after implantation? - Final lead position at discharge (apical, septal, other) - Atrial dipole (with or without atrial wall contact at rest) - Ease of implantation as assessed by investigator - An extended questionnaire including more detailed information on implantation procedure, technique and initial measurements will be requested as an optional documentation where data are available Follow-up Y1 and Y2 Timing: • 12 and 24 months (+/-2 months) after enrollment respectively Procedures: - ICD interrogation / function check-up and re-programming if necessary - Programmer download of all data not yet submitted to BIOTRONIK according to current working instruction - Investigator assessment: appropriate atrial sensing Documentation (note: where available the most recent assessment recorded between the current and the preceding visit shall be considered): - Physical Examination: - Vital signs (SBP, DBP, height, body weight, BMI) - Current medication (substance class) - Heart Failure indices: - NYHA classification - BNP and NT-proBNP (only if determined in routine clinical practice) - LVEF (optional; echocardiography preferred, other methods accepted if no echo available) - ECG parameters (12 lead ECG; optional): - RR, PQ, and QT intervals - QRS width - rhythm disorders - clinical findings, morphology - Device Interrogation - Date, home monitoring function, MRI scan Event based documentation - New-onset or worsening AF - AF interventions - Worsening heart failure - Shock episode - Thromboembolic events (CVA, TIA, PAE) - Continuous surveillance / reporting of (serious) adverse events / (serious) adverse device effects</detailed_description>
