	<brief_summary>Investigation of arginine and NO metabolism in healthy subjects is important as a reference for alterations in arginine-NO metabolism in patients. Moreover, this study will indicate the changes during aging and gender-related differences. Although data on arginine metabolism exist in literature, data are limited to young healthy male subjects. Since patients with suspected changes in arginine metabolism, e.g. sepsis and cancer patients are often elderly and also women, knowledge of arginine metabolism in these groups is needed.</brief_summary>
