	<brief_summary>This is a multinational, multicenter, randomized, open-labeled, Phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and safety of treatment with Dacomitinib (PF-00299804) to treatment with gefitinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating mutation (s). Analyses of primary objective (Progression Free Survival) will be done as defined in the protocol.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>440 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio between Dacomitinib (PF-00299804 ) vs. gefitinib.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Evidence of histo or cytopathology confirmed, advanced NSCLC (with known histology) with the presence of EGFR activating mutation (exon 19 deletion or the L858R mutation in exon 21). It is acceptable for subjects with the presence of the exon 20 T790M mutation together with either EGFR activating mutation (exon 19 deletion or the L858R mutation in exon 21) to be included in this study Minimum of 12 months disease free interval between completion of systemic therapy and recurrence of NSCLC Adequate tissue sample must be available for central analyses. Adequate renal, hematologic, liver function. ECOG PS of 01. Radiologically measurable disease. Any evidence of mixed histology that includes elements of small cell or carcinoid lung cancer. Any other mutation other than exon 19 deletion or L858R in exon 21, with or without the presence of the exon 20 T790M mutation. Any history of brain mets or leptomeningeal mets. Any previous anticancer systemic treatment of early, locally advanced, or metastatic NSCLC. Uncontrolled medical disorders.</criteria>
