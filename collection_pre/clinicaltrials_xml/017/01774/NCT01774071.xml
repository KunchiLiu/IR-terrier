	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if a new diagnostic research agent named 89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A can show prostate cancer tumors on a PET scan; as well as see how long 89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A lasts in the blood when given in small amounts. DFO-MSTP2109A is an antibody that works against STEAP1 - found on the surface of prostate cancer cells. Attached to the DFO-MSTP2109A is a radioactive material called 89ZR, which allows it to be imaged by a PET scanner. The results of this study may help researchers know whether 89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A can be used as a diagnostic agent for finding prostate cancer that have STEAP1 on its surface with a PET scanner. The reason why identifying STEAP1 on prostate cancer cells is that new therapies are being developed to target STEAP1 prostate cancer cells.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>To be included in this study, patients should be eligible for enrollment into protocol 11016 (therapy with the DSTP3086S ADC) or meet all of the following criteria: Patients meeting the criteria for enrollment on research protocol 11016 to receive DSTP3086S ADC (therapeutic ADC based on MSTP2109A) will be the preferred patients for this study. Patients that are to receive DSTP3086S will not be injected with DSTP2086S until imaging with 89ZrDFOMSTP2109A is finished, approximately 1 week. Adult male &gt; 21years of age Visible lesions by either CT, bone scan or MRI consistent with metastatic disease Metastatic progressive disease Imaging modalities: Bone scan: new osseous lesion and/or MRI or CT: An increase in measurable soft tissue disease or the appearance of new sites of disease. Or PSA changes over range of value 26% Patients with histologically confirmed prostate cancer at MSKCC STEAP1 antigen positive tissue known from prior IHC testing or if STEAP1 status is not known archival sample will be sent to Genentech for IHC. Samples need to be positive, when feasible metastatic lesions will be tested preferentially rather than the primary. Performance status of 60 or higher (Karnofsky scale) (Appendix A) Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document PSA levels to be taken within 2 weeks of antibody administration. Patients meeting any of the following exclusion criteria will not be eligible for study entry: Previous anaphylactic reaction to human, humanized or chimeric antibody Hematologic Platelets &lt;75K/mcL ANC &lt;1.0 K/mcL Hepatic laboratory values AST/ALT &gt;2.5 x ULN Renal laboratory values Bilirubin &gt;1.5 x ULN (institutional upper limits of normal) eGFR &lt; 30mL/min/1.73m2 Patients with history of hypersensitivity reaction to any component of 89ZrDFOMSTP2109A, including DFO</criteria>
