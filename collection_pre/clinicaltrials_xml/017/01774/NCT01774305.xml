	<brief_summary>Coughing during emergence from general anaesthesia may lead to dangerous effects including laryngospasm, detrimental haemodynamic changes. Post-thyroidectomy bleeding occurs in 1-4% of patients, and severe coughing may cause bleeding. Dexmedetomidine, a potent Î± adrenoreceptor agonist, is theoretically appropriate for reducing airway and haemodynamic reflexes during emergence from anaesthesia. In this study, we investigated whether intravenous single-dose dexmedetomidine at the end of surgery reduces coughing during extubation after thyroidectomy.</brief_summary>
