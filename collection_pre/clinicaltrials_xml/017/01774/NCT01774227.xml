	<brief_summary>- Transcleral cyclophotocoagulation (TSCPC) has long been used as refractory glaucoma management and is very easy to learn and easy to perform. - Recent advances in laser technology; the role of TSCPC is being expanded because it has benefits of noninvasive glaucoma procedure. - The titration (pops), the fixed high-energy, and the fixed-low energy (slow-coagulation) are three energy delivery techniques. - The present study would report on the outcome (efficacy and safety) of the slow-coagulation versus the titration method in treatment of refractory glaucoma with dark iris. - The results would provide reliable evidences to supplement clinical judgment when making a decision in favor of each treatment method for glaucoma patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>the Pops-titration Versus the Slow-coagulation Cyclophotocoagulation in Treatment of Refractory Glaucoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Several protocols afford delivery of the "optimum" dose of laser energy per session necessary to achieve a long-term effective ocular hypotensive response balancing risks related to a high energy treatment and risks related to retreatment due to suboptimum dose delivery. - There are two main approaches to delivering laser energy, the pops-titration method and the fixed energy method that are the fixed-high and low-energy (the Gaasterland's slow-coagulation technique). - Of particular interest is which laser energy delivery method (slow-coagulation versus pops-titration) affords the optimal dose of photocoagulation necessary to achieve an effective long-term intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction while minimizing the risk of adverse events related to overtreatment and retreatments especially in refractory glaucomatous eyes with dark iris color.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eyes with no visual potential and very high intraocular pressure (on maximal medical treatment) in which the intraocular pressure will probably cause corneal complications Eyes with no visual potential and very high intraocular pressure (on maximal medical treatment) in which the intraocular pressure cause eye pain and need pain relief Eyes with minimal useful vision and intraocular pressure over the target intraocular pressure Eyes in which trabeculectomy with mitomycinC and/or drainage implants have a high probability of failure Eyes in which trabeculectomy with mitomycinC and/or drainage implants have previously failed Patient refuses to undergo more aggressive intraocular surgery Patients whose general medical condition precludes invasive surgery The visual acuity in the fellow eye is no light perception Have previously been treated by the transcleral cyclophotocoagulation Allergy to anesthetic medication Can not measure the intraocular pressure by the applanation method</criteria>
