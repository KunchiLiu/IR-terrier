	<detailed_description>The study is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of post-menopausal females with stage 1 hypertension. The goal is to randomize 40 post-menopausal females with stage 1 hypertension and assess whether azilsartan reduces urinary aldosterone levels. Additionally, a small sub-study comparing pre-menopausal and post-menopausal female aldosterone levels was performed as well as the presence of aldosterone production in fat cell cultures of a subset of 3 patients in the randomized trial.</detailed_description>
