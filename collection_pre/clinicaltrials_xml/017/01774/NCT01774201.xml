	<brief_summary>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic progressive neurological disease. Respiratory dysfunction due to weakness in the respiratory musculature has been described in MS. This leads to increased morbidity and mortality in late stages of the disease. It is possible that respiratory dysfunction influence physical fitness in earlier stages as well. Walking disability and fatigue causes significant impact on health in patients with MS, even in earlier stages. The hypothesis is that there is a relationship between respiratory function, walking capacity and fatigue and that daily deep breathing exercise during two months will improve respiratory function, walking capacity and fatigue.</brief_summary>
