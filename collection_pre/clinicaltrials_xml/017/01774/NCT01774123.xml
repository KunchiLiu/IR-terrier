	<detailed_description>Optical coherence tomography imaging of the retina has been shown to be an effective non invasive method to study retinal changes associated with multiple sclerosis induced optic neuritis. The retina is a unique structure in that it is an unmyelinated part of the central nervous system (CNS). However, it is uncertain which layer of the retina provides the best correlation with MS disease. The investigators propose a prospective, case-control study to compare OCT measurements from different parts of the retina of MS patients with optic neuritis, those without optic neuritis, and healthy controls. The investigators will then correlate the OCT measurements to clinical measures of disease. This will allow future studies to use OCT technology as a primary outcome in studying MS axonal and cell body injury of the CNS, as well as evaluating strategies in treating MS.</detailed_description>
