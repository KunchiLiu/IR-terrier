	<brief_summary>A prospective study, proof-of concept, randomized, controlled, parallel groups, simple blind was performed in 30 male patients (50-60 years old) with Intermittent Claudication (Rutherford category 1-2) recently diagnosed and clinical manifestations not exceeding 6 months with hypertension and/or dyslipidemia as unique co-morbility disorders. After a period of stabilization of the claudication distance in the Stress test (12.5%, 3.2 km/h) during 2 weeks, were randomized 1:1 to the experimental arm (Bosentan 62.5 mg twice daily/four weeks and 125 mg twice daily/eight weeks) or control group.</brief_summary>
