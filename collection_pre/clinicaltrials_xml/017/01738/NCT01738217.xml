	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, monocentric, non-randomized, phase I-II study. The goal is to assess the faisability and the capabilities of fluorescence imaging in hepatic surgery, and specially to help the surgeon while performing liver surgery. This study will be performed on patient intended to undergo a liver cancer surgery.It will contain three steps, assessing the following items: - Step 1: to assess the faisability of the use of the Fluobeam, in actual clinical surgical conditions and validate the data obtained in the preclinical phase, - Step 2: to assess the ability of the combination of ICG and Fluobeam to mark hepatic lesions, - Step 3: to assess the ability of the combination of ICG and Fluobeam to help in guiding per-hepatectomy. 3 to 6 patients will be enrolled in the first step, 20 in the second step and 20 in the third step. Patients will be followed during 4 weeks after the surgery.</brief_summary>
