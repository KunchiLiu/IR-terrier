	<brief_summary>The primary aim of this study was to compare the effects of supplementation with one of three dietary fibers (gum arabic, carboxy-methylcellulose, or psyllium) or a placebo on fecal incontinence (FI), symptom intolerance, and quality of life in community-living individuals who have incontinence of loose or liquid feces. A secondary aim was to explore the possible mechanism(s) underlying the supplements' efficacy (i.e., improvements in stool consistency, water-holding capacity or gel formation).</brief_summary>
