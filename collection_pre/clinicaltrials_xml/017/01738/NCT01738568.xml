	<brief_summary>Aging is associated with a loss of brain function and conditions such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease. It is likely that decreased brain metabolism is contributing to the progression of age related degenerative diseases. Aerobic exercise training can increase brain volumes and is associated with decreased risk for degenerative brain conditions. However, little is know about the changes that occur to brain metabolism with aerobic training and aging.</brief_summary>
