	<brief_summary>This study is evaluating the impact of antioxidant supplements on blood sugar control and cardiovascular risk factors in adults over the age of 50 with at 3 months of Type 2 diabetes. The investigators hypothesize that daily supplementation with a multiple micronutrient formulation containing dietary and endogenous antioxidants in combination with usual care will reduce markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in Type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of Micronutrients in Combination With Usual Care in Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is evaluating the impact of an antioxidant and micronutrient supplement on markers of oxidative stress and inflammation as well as on blood sugar control in adults over the age of 50 who have had Type 2 diabetes for at least 3 months. The purpose of this study is to see if these antioxidants reduce the oxidative and inflammatory state seen in patients with Type 2 diabetes as well as whether or not they make it easier to control blood sugar, affect the number and dosage of diabetic medications, and/or reduce the risk factors involved in long-term diabetes related complications such as in lipid profile and carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT).</detailed_description>

Inability to communicate in written and spoken English 3. Organ (kidney, pancreas, liver) transplant recipients 4. Individuals who are not likely to return for the followup because they or their sponsors are likely to have a permanent change of station or termination of service before completion of the protocol 5. Pregnancy (Women who are premenopausal will be informed that pregnancy must be ruled out by a serum HCG test if they would like to be considered for participation in the study. Women who have had a hysterectomy or have not had a menstrual period for at least one year prior to consent will be considered postmenopausal and will not require a serum pregnancy test). 6. Patients who are routinely taking more than 81 mg aspirin (ASA)/day or who are using ASA or ASAcontaining products to manage a chronic condition.</criteria>
