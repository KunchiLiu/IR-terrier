	<brief_summary>The study is aimed to assess the dose proportional total systemic exposure (when the administration is without the activated charcoal) to B17MP (active metabolite of BDP) and its lung bioavailability (when the administration is with the activated charcoal) after single inhalation of CHF 1535 NEXThaler DPI at two dose strengths. At the same time, the study will assess if the lung deposition and the total systemic exposure to Formoterol is affected by increasing doses of BDP.</brief_summary>
