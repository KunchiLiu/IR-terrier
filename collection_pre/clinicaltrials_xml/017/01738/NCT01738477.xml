	<brief_summary>The purpose of this follow-up study is to evaluate the persistence of antibodies against all the vaccine antigens 10 years after booster vaccination with either Tdap or Td, and also to assess immunogenicity and safety of another dose of Boostrix, administered in this study. This protocol posting deals with objectives and outcome measures of the extension phase. The objectives and outcome measures of the primary phase are presented in a separate protocol posting (NCT number = NCT00109330).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunogenicity and Safety of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals' Boostrix™ Vaccine in Previously Boosted Young Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects were previously vaccinated with either Boostrix or a control Td vaccine in study NCT00109330. Only subjects who were part of the primary study will be invited to participate in this study. All subjects will receive a single dose of Boostrix at Visit 1 (Day 0) and subjects will be observed till Visit 2 (Day 30) for safety in terms of solicited adverse events (during 4 days post vaccination), unsolicited adverse events (during 31 days post vaccination) and serious adverse event (during the trial period). A blood sample will be collected from all subjects before vaccination (Visit 1) and one month after vaccination (Visit 2) for antibodies estimation. This summary has been updated following Protocol amendment 2 dated 03 October 2013. The protocol is being amended to facilitate enrolment by: - - Extending the window period for re-vaccination from ± 6 months to ± 300 days from the Year 10 time point. - - Extending the recruitment period from 6 months to 14 months. The format of non-inferiority criterion of the first co-primary objective has been updated to keep it aligned with the format of non-inferiority criterion of the second co-primary objective.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol (e.g. completion of the diary cards, return for followup visit). Subjects who have received a dose of Tdap or Td vaccines 10 years (+/300 days) back, in study NCT00109330. Written informed consent obtained from the subject. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Female subjects of nonchildbearing potential may be enrolled in the study. Nonchildbearing potential is defined as premenarche, current tubal ligation, hysterectomy, ovariectomy or postmenopause. Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the subject has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period and for 1 month after completion of the vaccine dose. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine within 30 days preceding the dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the booster vaccine dose . For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone (≥ 20 mg/day (for adult subjects), or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed. Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol in the period starting 30 days before and ending 31 days after the dose of vaccine, with the exception of Influenza vaccine which is allowed throughout the study period. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational vaccine/product (pharmaceutical product or device). Previous vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus or pertussis since the last dose received in the Study NCT00109330. History of diphtheria, tetanus or pertussis diseases following the receipt of booster dose in the Study NCT00109330. Severe allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) after previous administration of any tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid, or pertussisantigen containing vaccines, or any component of Boostrix. Hypersensitivity to latex. Encephalopathy (e.g. coma, decreased level of consciousness, prolonged seizures) of unknown etiology occurring within 7 days following previous vaccination with pertussiscontaining vaccine. History of any neurological disorders or seizures. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required). Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment. Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 99.5°F for oral, axillary or tympanic route, or ≥ 100.4°F for rectal route. The preferred route for recording temperature in this study will be oral. Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhea, mild upper respiratory infection) without fever may, be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months preceding the booster dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period. Pregnant or lactating female. Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions up to 1 month postvaccination.</criteria>
