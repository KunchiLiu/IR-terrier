	<brief_summary>Mallet finger is an avulsion of the extensor tendon at its insertion on the base of the distal phalanx, with or without fracture. Treatment af mallet finger fractures involving more than 1/3 of the articulating surface is controversial. There are to our knowledge no randomized controlled trials comparing splinting and surgical treatment with extension block technique. The aim of this study is to compare splinting and surgical extension block fixation of mallet finger fractures in a randomized controlled trial.Our hypothesis is that conservative treatment with splinting is comparable to surgical treatment concerning functional outcome, and may even reduce the complication rates. The original protocol was designed to include participants with non-subluxated and subluxated mallet finger fractures. However this study only included participants with non-subluxated fingers.</brief_summary>
