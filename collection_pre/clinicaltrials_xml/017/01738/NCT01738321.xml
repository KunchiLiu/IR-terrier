	<brief_summary>To date, there are no data in the literature regarding changes in the intracuff pressure during prolonged surgical procedures. It is possible that the pressure will increase over time related to gas expansion during equilibration to body temperature. If this is the case, these patients may be at risk for tracheal damage. This is a prospective study to evaluate the changes in intracuff pressure over time during prolonged surgical procedures.</brief_summary>
