	<brief_summary>This protocol examines choice where it pertains to choosing between two standard methods for appendectomy, laparoscopic or open procedures, and the affect that "cost" of the appendectomy has upon choice. Children admitted with a diagnosis of uncomplicated appendicitis will be consented to participate in a study in which the patient can choose between laparoscopic or open appendectomy procedures. Those that agree to review a consent form will be randomly placed into one of two groups. The two groups consist of one in which the consent form includes "cost information for each operative procedure" in the comparison between the procedures, and the other group receives a consent form that does not include "cost information for each operative procedure". Both groups also view a short, group specific, computerized presentation that describes each procedure. The hypothesis is that those patients given a choice between two similar surgical procedures and are provided with "cost information" will more often choose the less expensive surgical procedure than those that do not have information related to the cost of the surgical procedures.</brief_summary>
