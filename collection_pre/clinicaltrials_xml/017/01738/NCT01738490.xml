	<brief_summary>The overall aim of the study is to investigate the Ponto wide implant considering; initial implant stability, stability over time, skin reaction and long term success when loaded at 3 weeks post surgery. Patients' quality of life improvements following implantation will also be surveyed. More specifically the primary objective of this clinical study is to test the hypothesis - The new Ponto wide diameter implant offers increased implant stability measured as ISQ (implant stability quotient) compared to the previous generation Ponto implant. And the secondary objective is to - Investigate when in time implant stability is the lowest as the initial mechanical stability is gradually replaced by biological stability</brief_summary>
