	<brief_summary>In order to learn more about women's health issues that occur over the lifespan, the Women's Health Study: from Adolescence to Adulthood is building a biorepository and database. The biorepository collects, processes and stores samples (such as urine, saliva, blood, cells, tissue and peritoneal fluid) until they are needed for research. The database contains de-identified information about our study participants. The biorepository and database are being created to serve as a resource for researchers from Boston Children's Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital and outside institutions.</brief_summary>
