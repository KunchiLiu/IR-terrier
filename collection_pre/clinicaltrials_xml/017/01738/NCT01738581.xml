	<brief_summary>This study is exploring a new experimental procedure in dystonia called repetitive transcranial magnetic brain stimulation (TMS) combined with rehabilitation. The purpose of the study is to determine whether repetitive TMS is effective as a treatment to reduce symptoms in dystonia as demonstrated by improved motor performance.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>rTMS and Retraining in Focal Hand Dystonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: Though the etiology of focal hand dystonia (FHD) is uncertain, two primary factors implicated in the development of dystonic symptoms are excessive cortical excitability and impaired sensorimotor processing. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the functional efficacy and neural effects of a Dual intervention of rTMS and sensorimotor retraining. Our working hypothesis is: subjects receiving the combined intervention will (1) display significantly improved handwriting measures; (2) report significant improvement in daily functional ability; (3) display reduced hand cramping compared; and (4) demonstrate reduced corticospinal excitability after the Dual intervention when compared to the rTMS+ stretching and massage (Sham) intervention. METHODS: A randomized, single-subject, multiple baseline design with crossover is used for this study that will examine ten subjects with FHD with two interventions: five days of low-frequency 1 Hz rTMS + sensorimotor retraining (Dual intervention) vs. rTMS + stretching and massage (Sham). The rTMS is applied to the premotor cortex at 1 Hz at 90% resting motor threshold for 1200 pulses. For sensorimotor retraining, a subset of the Learning-based Sensorimotor Training program was followed.</detailed_description>
