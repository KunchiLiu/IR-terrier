	<brief_summary>Primary objectives : - To investigate the safety and the tolerability of ATO by IV infusions to patients with SLE, - To determine the maximum tolerated dose of ATO. Secondary objectives : - Evaluation of the clinical and biological response of the SLE to ATO, - Time of relapse in case of positive response, - Determination of the efficacy, - Pharmacokinetic study of ATO.</brief_summary>
