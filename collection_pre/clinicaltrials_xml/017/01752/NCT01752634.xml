	<brief_summary>This study is to provide 24 - 52 week efficacy, safety and tolerability data to support the registration of the secukinumab (AIN457) prefilled syringe (PFS) for subcutaneous self administration in subjects with active PsA despite current or previous NSAID, DMARD and/or anti-TNFα therapy. An additional 4 years of long-term efficacy and safety data will be collected during the post Week 52 period of the study.</brief_summary>
