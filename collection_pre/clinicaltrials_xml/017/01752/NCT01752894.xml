	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is 1&gt; to compare neointimal stent coverage after OCT-guided vs. Angio-guided PCI, 2&gt; to compare neointimal stent coverage at 3 months after EES vs BES implantation, 3&gt; to determine the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy by OCT measurement at 3 months</brief_summary>
