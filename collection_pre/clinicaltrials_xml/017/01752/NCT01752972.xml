	<brief_summary>Patients of arsenical keratosis may be treated with spirulina. Is this improvement related to the levels of zinc, vitamin E and linoleic acid at the site of the keratosis (palm)? To understand this, patients of palmer arsenical keratosis (n=10), arsenic exposed controls (n=10) and healthy volunteers (n=10) will be treated with spirulina powder 10 g/day orally for 12 weeks. Skin extracts will be collected both before and after supplementation from the palm and dorsum for estimation of zinc, vitamin E and linoleic acid levels.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Spirulina on Zinc, Vitamin E and Linoleic Acid Levels in Palm Skin Following Chronic Exposure to Arsenic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients of arsenical keratosis remain untreated due to unavailability of effective drug. To find out an effective drug, the pathogenesis of keratosis should be understood. Spirulina is one of the dietary supplements, that improves the symptoms of keratosis. Is this improvement related to the levels of zinc, vitamin E and linoleic acid at the site of the keratosis (palm)? Ten patients of moderate palmer arsenical keratosis will be treated with spirulina powder 10 g/day orally for 12 weeks. Skin extracts will be collected both before and after supplementation from the palm and dorsum using a mixture of chloroform and ethanol. Zinc, vitamin E and linoleic acid levels will be estimated from the extracts. Similar protocol of spirulina administration and the collection of skin extracts will be done in arsenic exposed controls (n=10) and healthy volunteers (n=10).</detailed_description>
