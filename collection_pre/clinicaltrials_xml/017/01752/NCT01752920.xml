	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, Phase 1/2, dose escalation and signal finding study of ARQ 087 administered to subjects with advanced solid tumors with FGFR genetic alterations, including intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) with FGFR2 gene fusion. The study is designed to explore the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of ARQ 087 and to define a RP2D of ARQ 087.</brief_summary>

Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test during Screening Period and within 48 hours of the first dose of ARQ 087. 1. Anticancer therapy, such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal, targeted therapy, or investigational agents within four weeks or five times of the drug half life, whichever is longer, of the first dose of ARQ 087 2. Major surgery or radiation therapy within four weeks of the first dose of ARQ 087 3. Previous treatment with FGFR inhibitors 4.

Significant GI disorder(s) that could interfere with the absorption, metabolism, or excretion of ARQ 087 (e.g. Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, extensive gastric resection) 9. History and/or current evidence of clinically relevant ectopic mineralization/calcification 10. Previous malignancy within 2 years prior to the first dose of ARQ 087, except curatively treated nonmelanoma skin cancer, carcinoma insitu of the breast or cervix, or superficial bladder tumors 11. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection 12. Concurrent uncontrolled illness not related to cancer, including but not limited to: Psychiatric illness/substance abuse/social situation that would limit compliance with study requirements. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus 13. Blood transfusion within 5 days of the blood draw being used to confirm eligibility 14. Pregnant or breastfeeding</criteria>
