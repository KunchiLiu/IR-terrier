	<brief_summary>In healthy young subjects a single bout of strength training following endurance training has been shown to improve markers for aerobic capacity in muscle compared to a single bout of endurance training alone. The present project tests the hypothesis: 12 weeks of training with sessions of endurance training followed by strength training is superior to endurance training alone for health participants 50-65 years of age. The outcome measures are maximal oxygen uptake and knee-extension strength.</brief_summary>
