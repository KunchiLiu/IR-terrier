	<brief_summary>The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effects of a blockade of the vasopressin system and central hemodynamic system in heart failure (HF) patients during physical exercise. The significance of the vasopressin system during physical exercise is unclear. If vasopressin is a significant regulator of exercise hemodynamics in HF, strategies to intervene against activation of the V1A-receptor might be expected to improve HF symptoms and possibly outcome. The potential effects of the central hemodynamic system will be evaluated with a Swan-Ganz catheter. Echocardiography will be performed at rest and during submaximal working capacity before and during the infusion of a vasopressin receptor antagonist (conivaptan) or placebo. Cardiac output will be measured by thermodilution. The exercise test will be performed at 50 % of VO2 max and hemodynamic and echocardiographic measurements will be collected. The exercise test will be performed on a supine multistage bicycle.</brief_summary>
