	<brief_title>A Prospective Randomized Trial of Prostate Biopsy Protocols Comparing the Vienna Nomogram and a Standard 10-core Biopsy Scheme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trans rectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided prostate biopsy remains the standard for prostate cancer diagnosis. However, the standard protocols miss 15 to 30% of cancers, leading to a variable number of repeat biopsies. In 2005 the Vienna nomogram was introduced, defining the number of cores to be obtained in a prostate biopsy in relation to age and prostate volume in patients with a serum PSA level of 2-10 ng/mL. The objective of the study is to determine if the Vienna nomogram increases the detection rate of trans rectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsies, compared to a 10-core biopsy. This prospective randomized study enrolled men eligible for a prostate biopsy were randomized to a Vienna nomogram protocol or a 10-core protocol. They were further stratified according to age (≤65; &gt;65 and ≤70; &gt;70 years) and prostate volume (≤30; &gt;30 and ≤50; &gt;50 and ≤70; &gt;70 cc). A subgroup analysis for patients with serum PSA values between 2 and 10 ng/mL was performed.</detailed_description>
