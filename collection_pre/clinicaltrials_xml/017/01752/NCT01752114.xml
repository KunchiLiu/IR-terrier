	<detailed_description>Patients must present with previously non-diagnosed lung nodules as found on CT. There is no change to the typical standard of care that any of the investigating physicians and/or centers provide the patients enrolled in this study. The data from this study will not be used to diagnose cancer nor be used to influence treatment decisions for the study participants.</detailed_description>
