	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that the investigators can detect protein-sparing effects of administration of the ketone 3-hydroxybutyrate and free fatty acids during simulation of an acute inflammatory disease. The investigators use the infusion of endotoxin, US standard reference E.coli in healthy subjects as a model for inflammation / infection and to evaluate the effect on protein metabolism using different tracers and the investigators can measure the various intracellular signaling pathways of selected muscle and adipose tissue.</brief_summary>
