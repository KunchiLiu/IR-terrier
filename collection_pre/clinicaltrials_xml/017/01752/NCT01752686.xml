	<brief_summary>This study is designed to investigate the efficacy of carboplatin, as a post-operative adjuvant chemotherapy for triple negative breast cancer patients who have pathologic residual cancer after the preoperative chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase III Trial of Carboplatin as Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Triple Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Neo-adjuvant period Four cycles of 60 mg/m2 doxorubicin and 600 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide therapy at 3-week intervals followed by four cycles of 100 mg/m2 docetaxel at 3-week intervals. In POST Neo-adjuvant period Randomization: At the time of post neo-adjuvant period, the patients will be assigned to each treatment group in a 1:1 ratio i.e. carboplatin AUC 6 group vs. observation group. Six cycles of carboplatin (AUC=6) on the first day of every 21 days.</detailed_description>
