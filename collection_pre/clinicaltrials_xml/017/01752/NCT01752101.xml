	<detailed_description>Blood samples are obtained from those patients undergoing procedures to determine if a lung nodule is benign or cancerous. The data from the study will not be used to guide or influence the treatment of the patients enrolled in this study. There is no change from the normal standard of care that patients receive.</detailed_description>
