	<brief_summary>The newer generation ZES (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, Resolute Integrity) and EES (Abbott Vascular, Abbott Park, Illinois, Xience Prime) were introduced to South Korea. Although these are thought to be superior in effect and stability compared to ZES and EES of previous generation, there are few clinical data regarding the high risk groups of diabetes patients or small vessels lesion. Moreover, looking at the 8.3% of restenosis in Resolute All Comer study (23% diabetes), the investigators could not know the outcome in high risk patients such as diabetes or small vessels lesion. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness and safety of Resolute Integrity or Xience Prime in diabetes or small vessels lesion patients.</brief_summary>
