	<brief_summary>A Phase 2 open-label, single-arm, non-randomized study in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who failed prior treatment with sorafenib using a Simon's 2-stage design. A set minimum number of patients must demonstrate disease control at 16 weeks to proceed to Stage 2. At Stage 2, a set number of patients must have disease control at 16 weeks to declare that SGI-110 is of interest in the treatment of advanced HCC after failure of prior sorafenib.</brief_summary>
