	<brief_summary>The idea behind the Teledi@log consortium is to develop tele-rehabilitation concepts and technologies so that all types of heart disease patients, regardless of degree of severity, can be offered individual, customized and coordinated tele-rehabilitation across sectors. The project is innovative, breaking new ground in relation to existing national and international research projects in the area. The Teledi@log consortium sees its major task as developing and testing scenarios which can lead to a more coherent rehabilitation for heart patients in areas such as patient training, organization across the boundaries of the health system and using tele-rehabilitation technology. The Teledi@log consortium seeks to develop new tele-rehabilitation concepts which bring the patient closer to the health system and thereby promote the heart patient's rehabilitation, giving the patient and their families a more active role via new tele-rehabilitation technologies.The hypothesis of the study is that heart patients participating in a telerehabilitation program will have a higher quality of life compared to heart patients following traditional rehabilitation activities.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aims of the research project are: To assess the heart patients' and family members' needs for rehabilitation in the health system To assess the need for coordination of the rehabilitation effort in the health system To develop tele-rehabilitation concepts and technologies for heart patients, family members and health professionals in the health sector To promote an early, rapid and effective rehabilitation of heart patients to improve their daily life and working life. To prevent re-hospitalization of heart patients through a more individualized and differentiated rehabilitation effort using tele-rehabilitation technologies. To conduct a randomized study of a tele-rehabilitation concept using tele-rehabilitation technologies and to assess the clinical, technical, organizational and health-economic effects.</detailed_description>
