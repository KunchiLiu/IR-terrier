	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to describe gastrointestinal (GI) motility in patients suffering from severe Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and to compare these results with similar results from a study on healthy subjects. Both studies are done with the use of Motilis 3D-Transit system which consists of a small electronic capsule ingested and detected by a receiver carried by the patient. Position and orientation of the capsule are interpreted by dedicated computer software and transit times, progression velocity and contraction frequencies can be revealed. The study is mainly descriptive and is designed to test and evaluate the usefulness of the Motilis 3D Transit system in UC patients and to tell us more about GI motility during severe inflammation. Motilis 3D-Transit system gives us a unique chance to study the gastrointestinal canal as a whole during severe illness. We expect to include 20 patients suffering from severe UC admitted to Hospital with the purpose of getting medical treatment. We do not expect any drop out, but in case of drop out a new patient will be included.</brief_summary>
