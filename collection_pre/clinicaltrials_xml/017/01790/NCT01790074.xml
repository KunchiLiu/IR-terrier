	<brief_summary>It is a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing real and simulated manual treatment of trigger points (TrPs) in patients with cervicogenic headache (CeH). The purpose of the current randomized clinical pilot trial was to determine the preliminary effects of TrP manual therapy in individuals with CeH with sternocleidomastoid muscle active TrPs as compared to manual contact over the muscle tissues.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>CeH pain has been mostly related to joint, disk and ligament pain from the upper cervical spine; however, clinicians should consider that the upper cervical spine also receives afferent inputs from muscles. In fact, the role of referred pain to the head elicited by muscle TrPs has received particular interest in recent years. No study has investigated the effectiveness of TrP manual therapy in patients with CeH exhibiting active TrPs. Investigators hypothesized that patients receiving a real TrP treatment will exhibit a greater reduction in pain, sensitivity, cervical range of motion and neck endurance than those receiving a manual control non-therapeutic intervention.</detailed_description>
