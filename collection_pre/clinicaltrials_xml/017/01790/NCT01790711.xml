	<brief_summary>The gut microbiota is considered to constitute a "microbial organ" which has pivotal roles in the body's metabolism. Evidence from animal and human studies strongly support the link between intestinal bacteria and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The present clinical trial aims to re-establish a gut functionality state of intestinal flora through fecal microbiota transplantation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fecal Microbiota Transplantation on Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We established a standard bacteria isolation from donated fresh stool in lab.Then the bacteria is transplanted to mid-gut (at least below the second part of duodenum ) through regular gastroscope. Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive fecal microbiota transplantation only once or traditional therapy, and accept follow-up for at least one year. Blood tests,OGTT and magnetic resonance spectroscopy will be used to assess participants at study start and at study completion.</detailed_description>
