	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out if giving the study drug Ruxolitinib (INC424) prior to a combination of other chemotherapeutic drugs (Fludarabine and Busulfan) before infusing another person's hematopoietic stem cells (bone marrow transplantation) will be successful in people who have advanced primary myelofibrosis (PMF), post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis (PPV-MF) or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (PET-MF), collectively known as myelofibrosis (MF). MF is a disorder in which bone marrow tissue develops in abnormal sites because the bone marrow itself undergoes fibrosis or scarring. This study plans to evaluate whether adding the drug Ruxolitinib will further aid in reducing pre-transplant spleen size, improve physical performance levels and reduce adverse events (side effects) related to the transplant. Ruxolitinib is a drug that is approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with advanced forms of myelofibrosis. Using Ruxolitinib prior to stem cell transplantation is experimental.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ruxolitinib Prior to Transplant in Patients With Myelofibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A two- stage Simon Phase II study will be conducted in each of two groups of patients: related and unrelated donor transplants. In each donor transplant group, the first stage of this design will include 11 patients evaluated for death or graft failure by 100 days post-transplant. In each stratum, we will enroll additional patients (up to 20%) of stratum total to take into account exclusions due to donor failure (such as donor deemed unsuitable for stem cell donation due to medical or other reasons) only. Those patients who have toxicities related to Ruxolitinib and not been able to reach HCT due to these toxicities will be included in the estimation of overall failure rates. Only those patients who are excluded based on donor related issues without any regimen related complications will be excluded from the estimation of failure rates. However, all data on these patients will be reported.</detailed_description>
