	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determinate the efficacy and safety of the 3-drug induction treatment (RVD; lenalidomide plus bortezomib plus dexamethasone)followed by randomized autologous stem cell mobilization, autologous stem cell transplantation and lenalidomide maintenance. Primary endpoint is the immunophenotypic remission rate.During the randomized mobilization phase two active comparator arms Cyclophosphamide (CY)2g/m2 + Granylocyte-colony stimulating factor)G-CSF vrs G-CSF will be compared regarding efficacy, costs and safety.</brief_summary>
