	<brief_summary>The gut microbiota is considered to constitute a "microbial organ" which has pivotal roles in the intestinal diseases and body's metabolism. Evidence from animal and human studies strongly supports the link between intestinal bacteria and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Dozens of studies reported its efficacy in treatment of severe Clostridium difficile colitis. Preliminary studies using FMT for Ulcerative Colitis (UC), Crohn's diseases, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and constipation have also met with some success. This is an initial step into investigating the potential efficacy of standardized fecal bacteriotherapy through mid-gut (at least below duodenal papilla) for UC, the investigators propose to determine the efficiency and safety of FMT in a series of 60 patients with moderate to severe UC (Montreal classification).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Standardized Fecal Microbiota Transplantation for Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present clinical trial aims to re-establish a gut functionality state of intestinal flora through FMT as a therapy for UC. Investigators established a standard bacteria isolation from donated fresh stool in lab. Then the bacteria is transplanted to mid-gut through regular gastroscope. Patients in this study will assigned to receive FMT only once or traditional treatments according to associated guidelines and follow-up for at least one year. Blood tests , endoscopy and questionnaire will be used to assess participants at study start and at study completion.</detailed_description>
