	<brief_summary>The objective of the proposed study is to evaluate the clinical utility of muscle ultrasonography for improving the diagnostic yield and safety of core muscle biopsy. Our facility currently uses core (needle) biopsy to obtain muscle samples in patients 18 years old or older. Currently, there is no imaging tool used to guide the actual biopsy. As muscle biopsy is an invasive and potentially painful procedure, improving the diagnostic yield of this test is important.</brief_summary>
