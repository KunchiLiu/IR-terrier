	<brief_summary>The study is based on the identification of sentinel node(s) by SENTIMAG / SIENNA + in addition to the usual method (blue and /or radioactive product). This is a feasibility study</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IDENTIFICATION OF SENTINEL NODE(S) IN BREAST CANCER</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Identification of Sentinel node(s) 1. Step 1: Identification using the technique Nanocis Sub-areolar injection of Tc99m-Nanocis ® the day before or the day of surgery 2. Step 2: Identification using the technique SentiMag ® / Sienna+ Injection Sienna + ™ should be done just after induction of anesthesia and before the injection of Patent Blue dye 3. Step 3: Identification using the technique of Patent Blue Dye or Lymphotropic dye injection or Patent Blue is performed after induction of anesthesia, the injection and production Sienna + ™, the operating theater by the surgeon - Detection of Sentinel node(s) 1. Step 1: probe SentiMag ® (study) 2. Step 2: hand probe gamma radiation detection and / or colorimetric detection (standard) - Sentinel node's excision of radioactive and / or blue and / or magnetic (colored brown-brown) - After the procedure: Characterization of the size and weight of lymph nodes, histological and / or molecular OSNA and linking nodal status with the detection rate of sentinel nodes for each technique. NB: In case of synchronous bilateral cancer, 2 records are possible</detailed_description>
