	<brief_summary>The hypothesis of this study is that a diet high in sugars will increase abnormalities in blood lipids which are associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk, relative to a diet which is low in sugar. We predict that this potentially adverse effect of dietary sugars on blood lipids will be more pronounced in people with a raised level of stored fat inside their liver, as compared to people with a low level of stored fat.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>How Does Dietary Carbohydrate Influence the Formation of an Atherogenic Lipoprotein Phenotype (ALP)?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aims to determine the metabolic mechanism(s) by which dietary extrinsic sugars (sucrose and fructose), promote the formation of a high risk dyslipidaemia, known as an atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype (raised plasma triglyceride, low HDL and predominance of small, dense LDL), in men with raised cardio-metabolic risk and percentage of liver fat, as determined by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). The study examined the impact of diets high and low in extrinsic sugars, on the metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins in vivo, of two groups of men with a high (&gt;10%)and low (&lt;2%)percentage of liver fat, by the trace-labelling of these lipid moieties with stable isotopes, and detection by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The study had a two-way cross-over design, with two, 12 week dietary interventions separated by a six week wash-out period. The dietary intervention with high and low sugars was achieved by a dietary exchange with supermarket foods, which were consumed within the homes of the participants.</detailed_description>
