	<brief_summary>This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer. "Investigational" means that the drug is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it-such as the safest dose to use, the side effects it may cause, and if the drug is effective for treating different types of cancer. It also means that the FDA has not yet approved BKM120 for use in patients, including people with your type of cancer. BKM120 is a drug that works by blocking a protein called PI3K which may contribute to cancer growth. This drug has been used in experiments in the laboratory and information from these research studies suggests that BKM120 may help to prevent cancer cells from growing. In this research study, the investigators are looking to see if BKM120 works to stop breast cancer cells from growing.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If you agree to participate in this research study you will be asked to undergo some tests and procedures to confirm your eligibility. Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that you do not take part in the research study. If you have had some of these tests and procedures recently, they may or may not have to be repeated. These tests and procedures include: a medical history, physical examination, vital signs, self-rated mood questionnaire, assessment of your tumor, blood tests, serum pregnancy test, urine test and electrocardiogram. If these tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will begin the study treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be able to participate in this research study. The following additional research procedures will be performed at the time of study screening: research blood sample and tumor tissue collection from a previous biopsy or surgery. If you take part in this research study, you will be given a study drug-dosing calendar for each treatment cycle. Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days during which time you will be taking the study drug BKM120 once per day. You should take your BKM120 every day in teh morning at approximately the same time. You will be required to keep a drug diary while on this study. Please bring the drug diary with you to every clinic visit. During Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, you will come into clinic every two weeks to undergo several tests in order to evaluate your health status and to see how you are tolerating treatment, as well as to evaluate any symptoms you may have. For all cycles thereafter, you will come into clinic once a month every 4 weeks. Evaluations of your blood samples and physical assessment may lead to changes in your study treatment. On Day 1 of every Cycle and Day 15 of Cycle 1 and 2 you will undergo the following: vital signs, physical examination, blood tests, two self-rated mood questionnaires, uring test, scans (or imaging tests), tumor biopsies. You will return for an end of treatment visit approximately 7 days after stopping your study medication. At this visit the following assessments will be performed: vital signs, physical examination, blood tests, research blood sample, urine test, two self-rated mood questionnaires, electrocardiogram and tumor biopsy. If you stopped the study medication for other reasons than your condition worsening, a member of the research study staff will contact you or your physician every 3 months for a total of 2 years after the discontinuation of the study treatment, in order to obtain more information on which additional therapy you have received for your disease, or how your disease is evolving. If you do not terminate study treatment early you will be in this research study for about 3 months.</detailed_description>
