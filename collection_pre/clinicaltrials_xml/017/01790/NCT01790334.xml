	<brief_summary>It is widely known that positive mechanical ventilation increases the positive intrathoracic pressure which affects the pressure in the RIJV, resulting in an increase of the CSA. Currently, there appears to be a lack of studies in the literature that assess the effects of different modes of ventilation of this increase. The aim of our study is to evaluate the changes in cross-sectional area and diameters of RIJV under two different mechanical ventilation modes (PCV and VCV) and spontaneous ventilation in head neutral and 30 degree rotated lateral position by using ultrasonography and to determine the ventilation mode that is most suitable for catheterization.</brief_summary>
