	<brief_summary>In this study, efficacy of methylprednisolone in reduction of signs and symptoms (back pain, stiffness, joint pain and swelling) of active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) will be investigated. It is expected, that a single dose of methylprednisolone 500 mg given intravenously at baseline will lead to a rapid reduction of symptoms of active AS, which can be seen already 2 weeks after drug administration.</brief_summary>
