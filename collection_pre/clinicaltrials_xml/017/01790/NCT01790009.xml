	<brief_summary>Accumulating evidence suggests that regular consumption of foods and beverages rich in flavanols, such as cocoa, tea, apples and wine, may have cardiovascular benefits. Several well-controlled randomised human intervention studies have shown that cocoa flavanols have beneficial effects on blood pressure, endothelial function and other biomarkers of cardiovascular health. These vascular improvements have been correlated in time with changes in plasma flavanol metabolites. The health benefits of flavanol consumption are therefore likely dependent on changes in their absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME). Recent studies have provided detailed information regarding the absorption and metabolism of cocoa flavanols. However, there is a lack of information on whether there are changes in flavanol absorption and metabolism with increasing age.</brief_summary>
