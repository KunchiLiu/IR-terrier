	<brief_summary>Conventional urethrography is the standard diagnostic evaluation for patients with a suspicion of urethral stricture. The radiation dose of this examination is 5-9 mSV. Sono-urethrography was introduced in 1988 (McAninch et al. , J Urol 1988); the diagnostic accuracy of sono-urethrography is equal compared to conventional urethrography, with even a better measurement of stricture length and degree of spongiofibrosis with sono-urethrography. However, sono-urethrography remained underused among urologists and radiologists. Patients will be randomly assigned into two groups: Group A: conventional urethrography Group B: sono-urethrography In case sono-urethrography is inconclusive or of poor quality, a conventional urethrography will be performed. The radiation dose in the two groups will be measured. The stricture length and location will be recorded and compared with the perioperative findings in order to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy. The complications of the procedure(s) will be recorded with a questionnaire directly after and two weeks after the conventional or sono-urethrography.</brief_summary>
