	<brief_title>Water-based Zinc Efficacy Trial in Beninese Shool Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A double-blind efficacy study will be carried out over 4 months in school age children enrolled in a primary school equipped with a water pump, in the rural area of the commune of Natitingou, Benin. Participating children will be randomly assigned to one of two groups of intervention or control. On a daily basis, all children will consume a defined quantity of pump-water outside of meals. The water offered to children in the first group of intervention will be previously filtered and zinc-fortified by the LSF-filter; the children in the second group will receive water that has been filtered only. A nutrition survey will provide an indication of dietary zinc intake. The effect of enriched water consumption on children's zinc status will be evaluated by analyzing the concentration of zinc in serum at baseline, midpoint and endpoint of the intervention. Diarrhea rates will be monitored by recording episodes of diarrhea.</detailed_description>
