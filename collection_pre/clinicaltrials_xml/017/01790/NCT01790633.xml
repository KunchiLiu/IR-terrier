	<brief_summary>This is a pilot, monocentric, prospective, randomized control trial looking at the use of rapid tests as a part of normal care. The investigators will be testing for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Testing will be proposed to all persons seeking care at the Centre d'Accueil, de Soins et d'Orientation from the organization Médecin du Monde (CASO, MDM). Infection status of participants will be determined by either the standard test (ELISA) or rapid test. The choice between tests will be determined randomly. The overall goal is to determine the general acceptability and feasibility of rapid tests and to see if they can help individuals increase their awareness of infection status when compared to longer, routine methods of testing. In addition, results from these tests will allow the medical doctor to guide participants to appropriate care. All positive tests will be confirmed at a specialized hospital (Hôptial Saint-Antoine, Paris, France) and health-specific information will be obtained four months after testing.</brief_summary>
