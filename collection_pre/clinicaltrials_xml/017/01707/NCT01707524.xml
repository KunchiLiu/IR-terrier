	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to measure radiation exposure during coronary angiography (CA) with a trans-radial approach (TRA), specifically comparing access via the left versus right radial artery in patients with suggested clinical predictors of TRA failure/difficult. These predictors include age &gt;70, female gender, height &lt;64 inches, and history of hypertension.The study also aims to determine difficulties encountered during left or right radial access in this specific patient population. A secondary aim is to compare the results of enrolled patients with a registry of patients where femoral access was obtained. Currently more than 1 million percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) are performed in the United States annually. There is a growing trend to perform procedures utilizing the TRA due to recent data demonstrating decreased bleeding and access-site complications compared to the femoral approach. However, the TRA approach is also know to be associated with greater radiation exposure compared to the femoral approach. Furthermore, the TRA to catheterization may be difficult in certain populations because of anatomic considerations. Though traditionally completed via canalization of the right radial artery (RRA) due to feasibility with room setup, left radial artery (LRA) access may be superior due to the shorter distance needed to reach the ascending aorta and bypassing the tortuosity of the right subclavian artery. Given the benefits of the TRA, it is important to determine how left versus right radial artery access affects parameters of radiation exposure in addition to procedural difficulty. This study will be a prospective, randomized study of patients with suggested predictors of TRA failure/difficulty referred for coronary angiography. Patients referred for coronary angiography using the trans-radial approach will be randomly assigned to obtain arterial access via the right or left radial artery. A registry of patients referred for coronary angiography using the trans-femoral approach will be compiled. The primary outcome measure will be radiation exposure as measured by dose area product output from the coronary angiography system. Secondary measures will include the total fluoroscopy time, total dose of radiation, number of catheters used, and incidence of subclavian tortuosity. In addition, procedural complications and success rates will also be evaluated.</brief_summary>
