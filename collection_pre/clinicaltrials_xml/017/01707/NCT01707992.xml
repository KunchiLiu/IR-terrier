	<brief_summary>This is a multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study followed by active treatment, to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of two doses of oral administration of laquinimod 0.6 mg/day or 1.2mg/day in subjects with RRMS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy and Safety and Tolerability of Laquinimod in Subjects With Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible subjects with confirmed relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into one of the following treatment arms: Laquinimod capsules 0.6 mg, Laquinimod capsules 1.2 mg and matching placebo. The study will be comprised of two treatment periods: Period 1: Double-blind Placebo-controlled (DBPC) period: not more than 24 months of once-daily, oral administration of either laquinimod 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg or matching oral placebo. The Sponsor will declare closing of Period 1 for all subjects when 260 events of confirmed disease progression (CDP) have occurred or when all ongoing enrolled subjects completed 24 months in Period 1 (whichever occurs first).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must have a confirmed and documented MS diagnosis as defined by the Revised McDonald criteria, with relapse onset disease or a relapsingremitting disease course. Subjects must be ambulatory with Kurtzke EDSS score of 0 5.5 in both screening and randomization visits. Subjects must be in a stable neurological condition, relapsefree and free of any corticosteroid treatment [intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM) and/or per os (PO)] or adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), 60 days prior to randomization. Subjects must have experienced at least one documented relapse in the 12 months prior to randomization. Subjects must be between 18 and 55 years of age at screening, inclusive. Subjects must have disease duration of not more than 15 years. Women of childbearing potential (for example women who are not postmenopausal or surgically sterilized) must practice an acceptable method of birth control for 30 days before taking the study drug and two acceptable methods of birth control during the duration of the study and until 30 days after the last dose of study medication. Acceptable methods of birth control include: intrauterine devices, barrier method (condom or diaphragm with spermicide) and hormonal methods of birth control (e.g. oral contraceptive, contraceptive patch, and longacting injectable contraceptive). Subjects must be able to sign and date a written informed consent prior to entering the study. Subjects must be willing and able to comply with the protocol requirements for the duration of the study. Subjects with progressive forms of MS. Subjects with Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO). Use of experimental or investigational drugs and/or participation in drug clinical studies within 6 months prior to randomization. Use of immunosuppressive agents,or cytotoxic agents, including Cyclophosphamide within 6 months prior to randomization. Use of either of the following within 2 years prior to screening visit: natalizumab (Tysabri®), rituximab, ocrelizumab, atacicept, belimumab, or ofatumumab. Use of teriflunomide (Aubagio®) within 2 years prior to randomization, except if active washout (with either cholestyramine or activated charcoal) was done 2 months or more prior to randomization. Previous treatment with glatiramer acetate (Copaxone®) Interferon β (either 1a or 1b), fingolimod (Gilenya®), dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera®) or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) within 2 months prior to randomization. Chronic (more than 30 consecutive days) systemic (IV, IM or PO) corticosteroid treatment within 2 months prior to randomization. Previous use of Mitoxantrone (Novantrone®), Cladribine, or alemtuzumab (Lemtrada®). Previous use of laquinimod. Previous total body irradiation or total lymphoid irradiation. Previous stem cell treatment, autologous bone marrow transplantation or allogenic bone marrow transplantation. Use of moderate/strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 within 2 weeks prior to randomization. Use of inducers of CYP3A4 within 2 weeks prior to randomization. Pregnancy or breastfeeding. Serum levels ≥3x upper limit of the normal range (ULN) of either alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) at screening Serum direct bilirubin which is ≥2xULN at screening. Subjects with a clinically significant or unstable medical or surgical condition or any other condition that cannot be wellcontrolled by the allowed medications permitted in the study protocol that would preclude safe and complete study participation, as determined by medical history, physical examinations, ECG, laboratory tests MRI or chest Xray. Such conditions may include: A major cardiovascular event (e.g. myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, decompensated congestive heart failure, pulmonary embolism, coronary revascularization) that occurred during the past 6 months prior to randomization. Any acute pulmonary disorder A CNS disorder other than MS that may jeopardize the subject's participation in the study, including such disorders that are demonstrated on the baseline MRI. A gastrointestinal disorder that may affect the absorption of study medication. Renal disease. Any form of acute or chronic liver disease. Known human immunodeficiency virus positive status. A history of drug and/or alcohol abuse. Unstable psychiatric disorder. Any malignancies, excluding basal cell carcinoma, in the 5 years prior to randomization. A known history of sensitivity to gadolinium (Gd). GFR ≤ 60 mL/min at the screening visit. Inability to successfully undergo MRI scanning. Subjects who underwent endovascular treatment for Chronic Cerebrospinal Venous Insufficiency (CCSVI)within 3 months prior to randomization. Known hypersensitivity that would preclude administration of laquinimod capsule, such as hypersensitivity to: mannitol, meglumine or sodium stearyl fumarate.</criteria>
