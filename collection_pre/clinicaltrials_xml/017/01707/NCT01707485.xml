	<brief_summary>This study will investigate the feasibility of testing whether a 5-day course of antibiotics is as effective as a 10-day course for the treatment of uncomplicated community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children. To accomplish this, previously well children aged 1-10 years who present to McMaster Children's Hospital (MCH) emergency department (ED) with CAP will, if they consent, be randomly chosen to be given either a 5 day or 10 day course of amoxicillin. Neither the child, the child's caregiver, nor the researchers will know whether the child is in the 5- or 10-day antibiotic group. Once the child has received the medication and for two weeks after that, caregivers of children will be asked to complete a daily symptom diary for their child, and will come to MCH at the end of the two week period (between day 14-18) to be assessed by one of the researchers. This information will then be used to compare both groups of children to determine if a 5 days of treatment is non-inferior to 10 days. The investigators hypothesize that running such a trial is feasible.</brief_summary>
