	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well decitabine and total-body irradiation followed by donor bone marrow transplant and cyclophosphamide works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Giving decitabine and total-body irradiation before a donor bone marrow transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving decitabine and total-body irradiation before the transplant together with high-dose cyclophosphamide, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil after the transplant may stop this from happening.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Decitabine and Total-Body Irradiation Followed By Donor Bone Marrow Transplant and Cyclophosphamide in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine overall survival at 100 days after transplantation following decitabine and a bone marrow transplant using a donor that is at least partially-matched and a myeloablative preparative regimen with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Patients enrolled in this study will also be followed for the following endpoints: neutrophil and platelet recovery, graft failure, acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), chronic GVHD, incidence of infection, treatment-related mortality, time to relapse/progression, overall survival, and progression-free survival. OUTLINE: Beginning between days -29 and -22, patients receive decitabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour daily for 10 days, fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days -5 to -2, and busulfan IV over 3 hours on days -5 to -2. PREPARATIVE REGIMEN: Patients undergo total-body irradiation twice daily (BID) on day -1. TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo allogeneic bone marrow transplant on day 0. GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days 3 and 4, tacrolimus orally (PO) BID or IV continuously on days 5-180, mycophenolate mofetil PO three times daily (TID) on days 5-35 and filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) beginning day 5 until absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,000/mm^3 for 3 consecutive days. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months and 1 year.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must meet one of two disease criteria: Acute myelogenous leukemia within one of the following categories: Primary induction failure (PIF): patients who have not achieved a complete remission following initial diagnosis and after at least two induction cycles of chemotherapy consisting of cytarabine and an anthracycline or highdose cytarabine Relapsed AML: Patients are defined as having relapsed disease if they entered a complete remission confirmed with a bone marrow biopsy following initial treatment, and then were found to have morphological or cytogenetic evidence of recurrent disease on a subsequent bone marrow exam Any complete remission (CR)2 or greater: CR must be defined using a bone marrow exam taken at least 21 days since the last chemotherapy (including a methyltransferase inhibitor), and may include CRp (morphologic CR without peripheral platelet recovery) CR1 with highrisk features: includes patients with treatmentrelated AML, secondary AML (following myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS] or myeloproliferative neoplasms [MPN]), highrisk cytogenetic or molecular phenotype (by National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN] criteria) Untreated AML (&gt; 20% blasts on a bone marrow) arising from a previous confirmed diagnosis of MDS or MPN (excluding BCRABL positive diseases).
