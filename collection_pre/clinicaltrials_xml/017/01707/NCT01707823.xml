	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies low-dose acetylsalicylic acid in treating patients with stage I-III non-small cell lung cancer. Studying samples of urine and blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes in biomarkers that occur during treatment with acetylsalicylic acid</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low-Dose Acetylsalicylic Acid in Treating Patients With Stage I-III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether ASA (acetylsalicylic acid) 325 mg inhibits prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) biosynthesis in patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Cyclooxygenase (COX) catalytic activity will be determined by measuring the metabolite of PGE2, 11alpha-hydroxy-9,12-dioxo-2,3,4,5-tetranor-prostane-1,20 dioic acid (PGE-M) in urine pre- and post-ASA 325 mg as a surrogate of systemic PGE2 biosynthesis. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether COX-2 protein has a slow turnover in adenocarcinoma of the lung. COX turnover will be determined by measuring urinary PGE-M levels daily for 7 days after discontinuing ASA 325 mg. COX-2 and Prostaglandin expression will also be measured in tumor samples of patients taken at the time of surgery. OUTLINE: Patients receive acetylsalicylic acid orally (PO) for 7 days and urine is collected for 7 days post therapy.</detailed_description>
