	<brief_title>Beneficial Effects of Grape Seed Proanthocyanidin Extrat on Progression of Atherosclerotic Plaques in Clinical Use</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atherosclerotic plaques indicate the occurrence of ischemia events and how to deal with it is a difficult task for clinical physicians. Grape seed proanthocyanidin extrat (GSPE) has been reported to exert an antiatherogenic effect by inducing regression of atherosclerotic plaques in animal experimental studies. In this study, the antiatherogenic effect of GSPE has been investigated in clinical use.</detailed_description>
