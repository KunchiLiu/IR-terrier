	<brief_summary>This is an open label, exploratory study of simtuzumab (GS-6624) in adults infected with HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), or co-HIV/HCV with histological evidence of liver fibrosis. Participants will receive simtuzumab 700 mg intravenously every 2 weeks for a total of 24 weeks (12 infusions) while continuing on standard therapy for HIV (HIV-infected subjects only).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key HIVinfected subjects must have positive serologies with viral load suppressed below 400 copies/mL HCVinfected subjects must have: Chronic HCV infection with HCV RNA ≥ 2000 IU/ml AND at least 1 of the following: Been null responder to previous pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy OR Failed to achieve sustained virologic response (SVR) on a regimen containing a directacting antiviral (DAA) in addition to pegylated interferon and ribavirin OR Are unwilling to receive or have contraindications to interferon therapy for HCV HIV/HCV coinfected subjects must have: Positive HIV serologies with viral load suppressed below 400 copies/mL Chronic HCV infection with HCV RNA ≥ 2000 IU/ml AND at least 1 of the following: Been null responder to previous pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy OR Failed to achieve SVR on a regimen containing a directacting antiviral (DAA) in addition to pegylated interferon and ribavirin OR Are unwilling to receive or have contraindications to interferon therapy for HCV Willing to allow blood and tissue samples to be stored for future use to study HIV infection, immune function, liver disease and additional mechanisms involved in liver fibrosis among patients with HIV and/or HCV, which may not be related directly to the specific objectives of this study protocol Have a primary care physician Key Cause of liver fibrosis other than HCV or longterm ART treatment for HIV Currently being treated for HCV Evidence of active Hepatitis A, B or D infections History or evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma Unwillingness to undergo a liver biopsy pretreatment and posttreatment, or to undergo all other protocol required tests/procedures or return to the site for required visits Presence of contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging (e.g., presence of any metal in the body, cardiac or neural pacemaker, aneurysm clip, cochlear implant, claustrophobia)</criteria>
