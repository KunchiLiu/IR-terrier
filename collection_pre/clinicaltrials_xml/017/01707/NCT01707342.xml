	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the absolute bioavailability and pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the medication) of simeprevir (TMC435) after administration of single oral doses of 50 mg and 150 mg when administered together with a single intravenous (IV) dose of 100 microgram [3H]-TMC435 in healthy male participants.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Absolute Bioavailability and Pharmacokinetics of Simeprevir (TMC435) Administered as Single Oral Doses of TMC435 and an Intravenous Microdose of [3H]-TMC435 in Healthy Male Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), sequential (a single group of participants where study medication is administered in a sequence), single-dose study to assess the absolute bioavailability and pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the medication) of single oral doses of 50 mg and 150 mg simeprevir (TMC435) administered together with an intravenous (IV) microdose of 100 microgram [3H]-TMC435 in healthy male participants. The study consists of 3 phases, screening phase (21 days prior to administration of study medication), treatment phase, and a follow up phase. In the treatment phase, participants will receive 2 treatments, ie, Treatment A: single oral dose of simeprevir (TMC435) 50 mg followed 5 hours later by a single 10 minute IV infusion of [3H]-TMC435 (100 microcurie) 100 microgram; and Treatment B: single oral dose of simeprevir (TMC435) 150 mg followed 5 hours later by a single 10 minute IV infusion of [3H]-TMC435 (100 microcurie) 100 microgram. Treatments will be administered in two consecutive treatment periods, first Treatment A in Period 1, followed by Treatment B in Period 2; separated by a washout period (period when the participant is not receiving any study medication) of 7 to 14 days. The follow up will be for 5 to 7 days after end of Period 2. Blood samples will be collected for full plasma pharmacokinetics evaluations; along with urine and stool samples for analysis of total plasma radioactivity. Safety evaluations for adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs, physical examination, liver volume determination, and specific toxicities will be monitored throughout the study. The total duration of the study will be approximately 42 days.</detailed_description>
