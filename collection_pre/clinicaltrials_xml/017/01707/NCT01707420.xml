	<brief_summary>The typical post-operative course for children following surgical removal of their tonsils and adenoids can be challenging, especially for pain control. First line medications for pain include intravenous and enteral narcotics, acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists but their effects appear to be short-lived. Gabapentin has been shown in adult studies to tone down the body's response to pain and decreases opioid use post-operatively. The purpose of this study is to see if a single preoperative dose will reduce post-operative pain scores and the amount of analgesic used.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preoperative Gabapentin for Post-tonsillectomy Pain in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial to study the effect of a preoperative oral dose of gabapentin on postoperative analgesic requirements and subjective pain levels in children undergoing tonsillectomy with adenoidectomy. Investigators will also look for a limited set of genotypic variations to explain any difference between individuals or groups in their response to the medication. Additionally, investigators will document potential adverse effects including excessive sedation, respiratory issues, surgical bleeding and emergence agitation/delirium. Investigators hypothesize that gabapentin will reduce opioid analgesic requirements and pain scores up to 36 hours post adenotonsillectomy without increased adverse effects such as emergence delirium, respiratory complications or bleeding. The clinical effect may depend on the individual's pharmacogenetic profile to look for a specific set of genetic polymorphisms that relate to the metabolism and effect of the study drug, gabapentin, and opioid analgesic pain medications.</detailed_description>
