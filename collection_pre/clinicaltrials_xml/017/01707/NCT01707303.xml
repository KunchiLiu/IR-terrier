	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, controlled, pilot study of two separate Cohorts of patients from the intensive care unit. Cohort I will enroll 50 patients and randomize to receive one physical therapy session per day or receive usual ICU care. Cohort II, will enroll an additional 50 patients and randomize to receive either two physical therapy sessions per day or usual care. Outcome will be length of hospital stay measured in days. Secondary outcomes will be mortality, ventilator days, ICU days, and for Cohort II, grip strength, dynamometer strength assessments and the short physical performance battery (SPPB). Study subjects will have blood for cytokine analysis through their first week of study.</brief_summary>
