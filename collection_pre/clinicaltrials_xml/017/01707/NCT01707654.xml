	<brief_summary>A combination of soft tissue and digital nerve defects in the finger results in sensory loss of the finger pulp. Reconstruction of these combined injuries is difficult. When the neurocutaneous defect is associated with wound infection, reconstructive alternatives are more limited. From July 2008 to May 2010, a retrospective study was conducted with 9 consecutive postinfection patients who had the neurocutaneous defect of the finger following trauma. The purpose of this retrospective study is to report repair of the complicated infected wound in the finger using the bipedicled nerve flap and to evaluate the efficacy of this technique.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Repair of Infective Wound Associated With Nerve Defect in the Finger Using A Bipedicled Nerve Flap</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>an infective wound with exposed bone or tendon in the finger; soft tissue defect involving proximal half of the middle phalanx, the proximal phalanx, or both; associated digital nerve defect 1 to 4 cm in length; single or double nerve defects; and simultaneous repair of nerve and soft tissue defects. injury to the course of the pedicle or the donor site; nerve defect less than 1 cm or larger than 4 cm in length; occurrence of the defect in a region the flap is unable to reach, such as distal interphalangeal joint region, distal portion of the middle phalanx of the middle finger and the thumb; no involvement of the digital nerve.</criteria>
