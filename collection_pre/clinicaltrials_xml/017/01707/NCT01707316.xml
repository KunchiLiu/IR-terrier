	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the medication) and pharmacodynamics (the action of the medication on the body) of JNJ-28431754 (canagliflozin) and its main metabolites (break-down products) following 2 different doses of canagliflozin in healthy Chinese volunteers. Safety and tolerability of canagliflozin will also be assessed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Canagliflozin in Healthy Chinese Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be a double-blind (neither the Investigator nor volunteer knows the assigned treatment), randomized (the treatment is assigned by chance), placebo-controlled (one of the study treatments is inactive), single-dose, 3-way cross over study (all volunteers will receive each of the 3 treatments but in a different order) in healthy Chinese volunteers. Volunteers will be assigned to 1 of 3 treatment sequence groups (ABC, BCA, or CAB). The treatment sequence will be decided by randomization. Treatment A will be a single oral (by mouth) dose of 100 mg of canagliflozin. Treatment B will be a single oral dose of 300 mg of canagliflozin. Treatment C will be a single oral dose of placebo (inactive medication). Each treatment will be given during a treatment period of 5 days duration; each treatment period will be separated by a washout period (a time period with no medication) of at least 10 days. Canagliflozin is currently being investigated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).</detailed_description>
