	<brief_summary>This is multi-center prospective randomized trial evaluating the effectiveness of a new brain-computer interface for communication of quadriplegic patients in a clinical context. This performance of this will compared to traditional assistive technology (scanning system) and to performance of a healthy volunteer population.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The evaluation aims to estimate the performance of BCIs in patient and healthy subjects in a clinical setting (primary objective) and to compare this performance with an existing assitive technology adapted to the target population of this study (scanning system). A quadriplegic patient population (n = 10) evaluated the two techniques and a population of healthy subjects (n = 10) evaluated the BCI only. When a subject meets all the eligibility criteria and is not discarded by any non-inclusion criteria, he is included in the study. The order of the two techniques to be compared is randomized.</detailed_description>
