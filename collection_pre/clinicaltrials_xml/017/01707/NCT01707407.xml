	<brief_summary>1. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of pomalidomide administered with the CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitor ketoconazole compared with pomalidomide alone in healthy male subjects. 2. To evaluate the PK of pomalidomide administered with the CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitor ketoconazole plus the CYP1A2 inhibitor fluvoxamine compared with pomalidomide alone in healthy male subjects. 3. To assess the PK of pomalidomide administered with the CYP1A2 inhibitor fluvoxamine and the CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitor ketoconazole compared with pomalidomide plus the CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitor ketoconazole in healthy male subjects. Part 2 1) To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of pomalidomide administered with the CYP3A4 inducer carbamazepine compared with pomalidomide alone in healthy male volunteers. Secondary Objectives 1) To evaluate the safety of pomalidomide in Part 1 and Part 2 when administered with ketoconazole, fluvoxamine and/or carbamazepine. In addition: To evaluate the safety of pomalidomide in Part 1 and Part 2 when administered with ketoconazole, fluvoxamine and/or carbamazepine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Effect of CYP450 and P-gp Inhibition and Induction on the Pharmacokinetics of Pomalidomide (CC-4047) in Healthy Male Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a single-center, open label non randomized, 2-part study with 3 periods in Part 1, and 2 periods in Part 2. Parts 1 and 2 will be conducted in parallel. The entire study will consist of a screening phase, two dosing parts, and a follow-up telephone call for safety. All Periods will be separated by a washout period of at least 3 days (no more than 5 days) from the last pomalidomide dose to the next drug dose. Safety will be monitored throughout the study. Safety evaluations will include adverse event (AE) reporting, concomitant medications, PEs, vital sign measurements, 12-lead ECGs, and clinical laboratory safety tests. Thirty-two healthy (16 per each Part), male adult subjects 18 to 55 years of age who meet all inclusion criteria and do not meet any of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study. Subjects enrolled in Part 1 cannot participate in Part 2 and vice versa. Study treatments (pomalidomide, ketoconazole, fluvoxamine and carbamazepine) should be administered with meals and subjects should be a served a standard meal (ie, breakfast or dinner) approximately 30 minutes prior to dosing. The meal should be consumed within 30 minutes from serving and dosing must occur 30 minutes (±5 minutes) after serving the meal. Subjects should be encouraged to consume the whole meal served prior to dosing. After each dosing, food and beverages (except water) will be withheld from all subjects until at least 4 hours post dose; thereafter, subjects will be served standard meals and snacks. For determination of plasma concentrations of pomalidomide, ketoconazole, fluvoxamine and carbamazepine (and its active metabolite carbamazepine 10,11-epoxide) in each dosing regimen (Period), serial blood samples will be collected. A safety follow-up will be conducted by telephone within 4 to 7 days from the last dose. In the event a subject discontinues from the study prematurely, an early termination visit will be performed within 4 days following the day of discontinuation.</detailed_description>

Vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, and oral body temperature) will be assessed in the supine position after the subject has rested for at least 5 minutes. 2. Subject must be afebrile (febrile is defined as ≥ 38.5ºC or 101.3 Fahrenheit). 3. Systolic blood pressure in the range of 90 to 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure in the range of 60 to 90 mmHg, and pulse rate in the range of 45 to 100 bpm. 4. Must have a normal or clinically acceptable 12lead ECG, with a QTcF value ≤ 430 msec. 5. Clinical laboratory safety tests must be within normal limits or clinically acceptable to the Principal investigator (PI) Subjects (with or without vasectomy) must agree to use barrier contraception (ie, latex condom or any nonlatex condom not made out of natural [animal] membrane [eg, polyurethane]) and one other method (eg, spermicide) when engaging in sexual activity with woman of childbearing potential during study conduct, and for 90 days after the last dose of study medication. Must agree to refrain from donating blood or plasma (other than for this study) while participating in this study and for at least 28 days after the last dose of study drug. Similarly, must agree to refrain from donating sperm while participating in this study and for at least 90 days after the last dose of study drug.
