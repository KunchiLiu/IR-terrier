	<brief_summary>The investigators propose to use positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to determine whether nicotinic receptor availability at pretreatment predicts smoking cessation success. The investigators will recruit 30 smokers from those enrolled in the Pharmacogenetics of Nicotine Addiction Treatment clinical trial. The investigators will measure nicotinic receptor availability using the PET radioligand 2-[18F]FA, after overnight abstinence and prior to initiation of treatment.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participants will be male and female smokers between the ages of 18 and 65 and must be enrolled(consented and meet all eligibility requirements) in the ongoing PNAT trial [NCT01314001] in order to participate in this substudy. They must be able to provide informed consent and weigh less than 300 lbs (due to limitations of the PET and MRI scanners). In addition to the exclusion criteria used for PNAT trial [NCT01314001], participants in this trial will be excluded if they meet the following criteria: ImagingRelated 1. Weigh over 299 lbs. 2. Selfreported history of head trauma or brain (or CNS) tumor. 3. Selfreported history of claustrophobia (contraindicated for PET and MRI). 4. Cochlear implant or bilateral hearing aids. 5. Pacemakers, certain metallic implants, or presence of metal in the eye as contraindicated for MRI. 6. History of gunshot wound (including BB guns). 7. Circumstances or conditions that may interfere with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 8. CO reading greater than 15ppm at the PET Scan Session (or at least a 50% reduction from the PNAT Intake Session). 9. BrAC reading greater than or equal to 0.01 at the PET Scan Session. 10. Positive urine drug screen for cocaine, phencyclidine, amphetamines, methamphetamines, tricyclic antidepressants, opiates, methadone, benzodiazepines, or barbiturates at the PNAT Intake Session or PET Scan Session. 11. Positive urine pregnancy (females only) screen at the PET Scan Session and/or MRI Scan Session. 12. Inability to give blood at the PET Scan Session (blood samples are required to analyze PET data). 13. Prior exposure to radioactive tracers in imaging studies or for medical reasons may be exclusionary. General 1. Any medical condition, illness, disorder or concomitant medication that could compromise participant safety or treatment, as determined by the Principal Investigator or Coinvestigators. 2. Inability to provide informed consent or complete the study procedures within 10 hours and/or correctly, as determined by the Principal Investigator or Coinvestigators. 3. Any physical or visual impairment that would prevent completion of the cognitive tasks. 4. Participation (within the last 6 months) in other studies at our center involving similar cognitive testing procedures.</criteria>
