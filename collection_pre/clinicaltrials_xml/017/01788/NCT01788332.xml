	<brief_summary>In 2010, more than 35,000 people died in the United Kingdom from lung cancer, the majority from non-small cell cancer (NSCLC). Chemotherapy is one of the main treatments for patients with NSCLC but those treated will still only live for an average of 9 or 10 months after diagnosis. The purpose of this clinical trial is to find out whether or not giving a drug called Olaparib following chemotherapy will benefit patients with NSCLC who have responded to initial chemotherapy treatment by prolonging the time before the tumour regrows. Olaparib is a new, oral drug developed by AstraZeneca which may help to slow down cancer growth. The rationale for this clinical trial is that chemotherapy damages tumour cell DNA and NSCLC tumours that respond to chemotherapy are less able to repair this damage. This can be exploited by using Olaparib as it blocks an enzyme called Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) which is essential for DNA repair. This will prevent DNA repair and cause cancer cell death by a mechanism known as synthetic lethality. Synthetic lethality arises when a combination of mutation in two or more genes leads to cell death. Up to 300 patients who are to receive standard chemotherapy treatment will be initially registered into the trial. Of these patients, 114 patients who have responded to chemotherapy will be randomly allocated to receive either Olaparib or an inactive dummy pill or placebo by mouth. The trial will assess whether Olaparib delays disease progression following standard chemotherapy treatment in patients. It will also show whether the side effects of adding Olaparib following standard treatment are acceptable.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a multicentre randomised phase II trial. Patients are initially registered either before or during induction chemotherapy, their response to which will be used to determine whether they are eligible for randomisation. All patients will be asked to consent to archival tissue collection for translational analysis and to provide a translational blood sample. The second consent will precede randomisation to one of two groups of maintenance therapy (olaparib or placebo) with 1:1 randomisation if they have had an objectively measured complete or partial response following standard chemotherapy. Randomised patients will receive olaparib or placebo until disease progression. They will be monitored by CT scan every two cycles until disease progression, where they will be managed according to local practice. Follow up will be for a maximum of 12 months from the point of randomisation or until disease progression. All randomised patients for whom we have a baseline translational blood sample will be asked to provide a follow up blood sample upon randomisation and again at radiological progression. Registered patients with progressive disease after the initial induction chemotherapy will be asked to provide a follow-up blood sample at the end of induction chemotherapy.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Registration: Histological diagnosis of NSCLC. Histology can be either squamous or nonsquamous. Stage IIIB or stage IV lung cancer that is not amenable to curative therapy. ECOG performance status 01. Have had no prior systemic treatment for lung cancer including previous adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy. Patients who have already started their chemotherapy are not eligible. Eligible to receive standard platinum doubletbased chemotherapy. Men or women, aged 18 or over and capable of giving informed consent. Willing to consent to provide tissue and blood for translational research. Informed consent prior to any study specific procedures. Exclusion Criteria Registration: Evidence of small cell, large cell neuroendocrine or carcinoid histology. Have a serious or uncontrolled medical condition that could compromise the patients' ability to adhere to the protocol. Have a secondary malignancy (except adequately treated nonmelanomatous skin cancer, or other cancer considered cured by surgical resection or radiation). Patients who have had another malignancy in the past but have been disease free for more than 5 years are eligible. Have had a blood transfusion within 4 weeks prior to study entry, and have a white blood count &gt;3x109/L. Have central nervous system metastases (unless the patient has completed successful local therapy for central nervous system metastases). Are receiving concurrent administration of any other systemic antitumour therapy. Have received a recent (within 30 days of enrolment) or are receiving concurrent yellow fever vaccination. Previous treatment with PARP inhibitors. Difficulty swallowing. Uncontrolled GI disorders such as active diverticulitis or colitis, or any major GI resection which could have an impact on patients' ability to absorb Olaparib. Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome / acute myeloid leukaemia. Congenital long QT syndrome. Inclusion Criteria Randomisation: Partial or complete response to platinum containing doublet chemotherapy after a minimum of 3 cycles, according to RECIST, as assessed by the local radiologist. Patients with stable disease or a mixed response following induction chemotherapy should not be included. Adequate organ function, including the following: 1. Adequate bone marrow reserve; absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;1.5 x 109/L, platelets &gt;100 x 109/L, Haemoglobin of &gt;10g/dl. 2. Hepatic: total bilirubin &lt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal (xULN); alkaline phosphate (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;2.5 x ULN. ALP, AST and ALT &lt;5 x ULN is acceptable if the liver has tumour involvement. 3. Renal: calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt;50ml/min based on the original weight based Cockroft and Gault or Wright formula, serum creatinine &lt;1.5 x institutional ULN. 4. No features suggestive of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia on peripheral blood smear. Willing to use two adequate forms of contraception throughout the trial and for three months following last administration of olaparib. Informed consent. Exclusion Criteria Randomisation: Patients with radiological disease progression or stable disease. Have received treatment with an agent that has not received regulatory approval, within 30 days of study entry. Have had a blood transfusion in the period between induction chemotherapy and starting Olaparib dosing and have a WBC &gt;3 x109/L. Resting ECG with measurable QTc &gt;/ 480 msec. Are pregnant or breastfeeding.</criteria>
