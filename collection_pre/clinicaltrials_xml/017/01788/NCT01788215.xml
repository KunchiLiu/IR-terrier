	<brief_title>Effect of a Commonly Used Antibiotic, Doxycycline, in Women With Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is one of the leading causes of female infertility, affecting 5-10% of reproductive-age women . This heterogeneous disorder is characterized by anovulatory infertility, androgen excess, an increase in the ratio of LH to FSH, and morphologic polycystic changes to the ovaries. Obesity and insulin resistance are also metabolic factors associated with PCOS that further increase the morbidity in these patients. Inducing fertility in patients with PCOS can be a challenge, as it most often involves ovulation induction that can lead to ovarian enlargement, hyperstimulation, and multiple-birth pregnancies. This study is designed to determine novel effective strategies to promote normal cycling in this patient population.</detailed_description>
