	<brief_title>A Study to Assess Learning Performance in Patients With Schizophrenia and Young and Elderly Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an exploratory study involving schizophrenic patients (Group 1) and young and elderly healthy volunteers (Group 2 and 3 respectively). No investigational medicinal product will be administered. For all participants enrolled (Group 1 to 3) the study will consist of an eligibility screening examination (from Day -21 up to and including Day 1) and 3 cognitive assessment days. Cognitive assessments will be made on 2 subsequent days (Days 1 and 2) which are separated by overnight sleep. In addition, a session will be performed on Day 7. Completion of the cognitive test batteries can occur at any time during the day provided that the completion time is comparable on all test days. For each participant, the maximal study duration will not exceed 4 weeks.</detailed_description>
