	<brief_summary>Interventional diagnostic, international, multicenter and non-comparative study of EGFR mutation status in aNSCLC patients (locally advanced and/or metastatic disease) with adenocarcinoma and non-adenocarcinoma histologies. It will be conducted in Asia Pacific and Russia and will assess the current status of EGFR mutation testing, and the concordance of EGFR mutation status derived from tumour samples and blood based circulating free DNA.</brief_summary>
