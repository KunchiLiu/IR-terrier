	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic, Safety, and Tolerability Study of Risperidone ISM® at Different Dose Strengths</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial will try to characterize and document the pharmacokinetics of risperidone ISM in schizophrenic or schizoaffective patients after one intramuscular injection at different dose strengths.Likewise, the safety and tolerability of risperidone ISM will be evaluated in the above mentioned population. Following confirmation of eligibility and a washout period for study-prohibited drugs, a total of 33 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a single intramuscular (IM) injection of one of the following dosages of study drug: Group 1: 50 mg risperidone ISM Group 2: 75 mg risperidone ISM Group 3: 100 mg risperidone ISM Several blood samples for plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments will be obtained pre-dose and post-dose. Safety assessments will be conducted at each pre-specified time points.</detailed_description>
