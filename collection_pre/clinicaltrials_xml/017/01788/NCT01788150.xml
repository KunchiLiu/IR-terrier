	<brief_summary>A prospective, randomized, active-control, multi-center clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of the Svelte Drug-Eluting Coronary Stent Integrated Delivery System (IDS) to that of the commercially available Resolute IntegrityTM Drug-Eluting Stent. The study objective is to assess the safety and efficacy of the Svelte Drug-Eluting Coronary Stent Integrated Delivery System (IDS) compared to the Resolute IntegrityTM Drug-Eluting Stent in patients with single, never previously treated coronary artery lesions</brief_summary>

	<criteria>General Inclusion Criteria 1. Patient is ≥18 years old; 2. Patient is eligible for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI); 3. Patient is an acceptable candidate for emergent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery; 4. Patient has clinical evidence of ischemic heart disease, stable or unstable angina, silent ischemia, or a positive functional study; 5. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7days before the trial procedure; 6. Patient or subject's legal representative has been informed of the nature of the trial and agrees to its provisions and has provided written informed consent as approved by the Hospital Research Ethics Committee (HREC) of the respective investigational site; and 7. Patient agrees to comply with specified followup evaluations and to return to the same investigational site where the procedure was performed. Angiographic Inclusion Criteria 1. Patient has either a single target lesion, or two lesions (target and nontarget) located in separate coronary arteries; 2. If a nontarget lesion is treated, it must be treated first and only with commercially available PTCA balloons and/or stents. Post PCI of the nontarget vessel, all of the following conditions must be met: 1. Residual diameter stenosis &lt; 30%; 2. Absence of any angiographic complications; 3. Absence of ischemic symptoms; and 4. Absence of significant new arrhythmia or ECG monitoring changes suggestive of ischemia. 3. Reference vessel ≥ 2.5 mm and ≤ 3.5 mm in diameter by visual estimate; 4. Target lesion &lt; 20 mm in length by visual estimate (the intention is to cover the entire lesion with one stent of adequate length); and 5. Target lesion stenosis ≥ 50% and &lt; 100% by visual estimate. General Exclusion Criteria 1. Patient is currently enrolled in another investigational device or drug trial that has not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the current study endpoints Note: Trials requiring extended followup for products that were investigational, but have since become commercially available, are not considered investigational trials; 2. The patient requires a staged procedure of the target vessel within 6months or a staged procedure of a nontarget vessel within 30days postprocedure; 3. The target lesion requires treatment with a device other than PTCA prior to stent placement (such as, but not limited to, directional coronary atherectomy, excimer laser, rotational atherectomy, etc.); 4. Any DES deployment anywhere in the target vessel within the past 9months; 5. Any BMS deployment anywhere in the target vessel within the past 6months; 6. Any previous stent placement within 10 mm (proximal or distal) of the target lesion; 7. Myocardial infarction within 72hours of the index procedure, with the exception of: 1. Patients who have had a STEMI and PCI to the culprit lesion may be included if they have a suitable lesion in another vessel, and have been clinically and hemodynamically stable for 72hours; 2. Patients who have had a nonSTEMI may be included if their troponin levels are within the laboratory normal range within 24hours preprocedure. 8. Comorbid condition(s) that could limit the patient's ability to participate in the trial or to comply with followup requirements, or impact the scientific integrity of the trial; 9. Concurrent medical condition with a life expectancy of less than 12months; 10. Documented left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 30%; 11. Unstable angina pectoris from an extracardiac cause (Braunwald Class A IIII); 12. Known allergies to the following: Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), Clopidogrel bisulfate, Ticlopidine, Prasugrel, Rapamycin, Zotarolimus, PEAIII AcBz, Heparin/ Bivalirudin, or contrast agent (that cannot be adequately premedicated); 13. Platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm3 or &gt; 700,000 cells/mm3 or a WBC &lt; 3.000 cells/mm3 or hemoglobin &lt; 100g/l; 14. Acute or chronic renal dysfunction (serum creatinine &gt; 170μmol/L); 15. History of a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the prior 6months; 16. Active peptic ulcer or upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding within the prior 6months; 17. History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or will refuse blood transfusions; and 18. Patients requiring ongoing anticoagulation with warfarin or dabigatran. Angiographic Exclusion Criteria 1. Total occlusion (TIMI 0 or 1); 2. Target vessel has angiographic evidence of thrombus 3. Target vessel is excessively tortuous or has heavy calcification; 4. Significant (&gt; 50%) stenosis proximal or distal to the target lesion that might require revascularization or impede run off; 5. Target lesion is located in or supplied by an arterial or venous bypass graft; 6. Ostial target lesion (within 5.0 mm of vessel origin) or any location within the left main coronary artery; 7. Target lesion involves a side branch &gt; 2.0 mm in diameter; and 8. Unprotected Left Main coronary disease (stenosis &gt; 50%).</criteria>
