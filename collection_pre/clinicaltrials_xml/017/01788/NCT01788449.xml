	<brief_title>Study Evaluating the Association of Antibiotic Measures and Control of Bacterial Resistance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primarily, this study is designed to assess the efficacy of piperacillin/tazobactam in reducing the cases of colonization and infection of extended-spectrum betalactamases (ESBLs) producing E.coli or K pneumoniae, S aureus methicillin resistant (MRSA) and Enterococcus vancomycin resistant (VRE). Secondly, this study plans to determine the acquisition rate of ESBL producing E Coli or K pneumoniae, methicillin resistant S Aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus spp (VRE), both pre- and post-intervention.</detailed_description>
