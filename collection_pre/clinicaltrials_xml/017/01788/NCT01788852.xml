	<detailed_description>Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted disease and it causes cervical and anal cancer. Prevalence and incidence of HPV infection among young adults who are sexually experienced is high. No data exist for HIV-positive adolescents in regards to HPV infection, cervical and anal intraepithelial neoplasia. This study will compare the prevalence of HPV infection, intraepithelial neoplasia and E6/E7 biomarker at cervical and anal sites among perinatally HIV-infected adolescents, behaviorally HIV-infected adolescents, and HIV-negative adolescents.</detailed_description>
