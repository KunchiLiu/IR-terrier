	<brief_summary>This study examines the long term safety and efficacy of the Fixed Dose combination BAY98-7106 (nifedipine plus candesartan primarily at the highest dose in development) in patients with moderate to severe hypertension. Patients meeting the entry criteria, will receive the Fixed Dose combination for 28 weeks, including 8 weeks with stepwise dose increase up to the high target dose. The first 200 subjects completing 28 weeks will continue treatment for additional 24 weeks (52 weeks in total). Subjects who do not tolerate an increased dose will be treated at their highest tolerable dose.</brief_summary>
