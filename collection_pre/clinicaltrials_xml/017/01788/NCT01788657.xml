	<brief_summary>Internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (iCBT) has been shown effective for depression in several studies, however the investigators know very little about how the written treatment material should be designed to be effective and at the same time acceptable to the patients. The investigators are not aware of any research that has investigated if slow readers, or persons with difficulty concentrating, can use the standard material or if they would benefit more from using an adapted version. In this study the investigators will assess reading speed and the ability to concentrate in all patients and then randomise them to an internet-based treatment for depression using either a standard material or a condensed one. The condensed material consists of 30000 words and will be available as text files and on audio files. The standard material consists of 60000 words and is only available as text files. Both groups will have the possibility of e-mail contact with a personal therapist during the treatment. Patients will be recruited within Örebro County by referrals and self-referrals. The goal is to recruit between 200 and 300 patients during 2 years. The treatment time will be 10 weeks and all patients will be assessed for depression at an interview with a psychologist. There will also be interviews after treatment and one year after treatment. The most important outcome will be depressive symptoms.</brief_summary>
