	<brief_summary>This study aims to conduct a randomized controlled trial that will test the feasibility and preliminary effect of a multimedia version of a computerized multimedia intimate partner violence (IPV) prevention service tool designed to increase identification of IPV victimization and to improve linkages to IPV-related services among female offenders under court supervision or probation, compared to a non-media version of the same IPV screening, brief intervention and referral service delivered by a case manager. The study addresses the following: Primary study aims 1. To design and beta-test a Computerized Multimedia IPV Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral Service tool for female offenders under court supervision or probation. 2. To obtain preliminary estimates of the effects of the Computerized Multimedia versus the Case Manager IPV service conditions on identification of different types of IPV during the service session and on access to and utilization of IPV services over the three-month follow-up period. 3. To examine and enhance the feasibility (recruitment, enrollment, fidelity of service delivery, client satisfaction, safety, and retention) for a future larger scale R01 study. Secondary study aim 4. To obtain estimates of the effects of the Computerized Multimedia versus the Case Manager IPV service conditions on recidivism, adherence to drug treatment (e.g., attendance, completion) and abstinence of substance use over the follow-up period, controlling for baseline outcomes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Intimate partner violence is a serious public health problem that disproportionately affects drug-involved female offenders under community supervision. Moreover, accumulating research has found strong associations linking experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) and continued drug use among women in drug treatment. This research suggests that failure to prevent IPV among drug-involved female offenders under community supervision likely to result in higher rates of relapse, treatment attrition and recidivism and underscores the need to address the IPV service needs among the rapidly growing population of female offenders under community supervision. Computerized multimedia IPV prevention service tools have been shown to be feasible and effective in conducting screening, brief intervention and referral for IPV in medical care settings. The proposed services research addresses the significant public health problem of IPV victimization and a co-occurring risk for relapse and recidivism among drug-involved female offenders under court supervision or probation. The proposed computerized tool employs a self-paced, multimedia format to conduct IPV screening, brief intervention and IPV-related service referrals that is informed by best IPV screening and referral practices and previous intervention research. This innovative tool represents a cost-effective option that may implemented with greater fidelity and result in better client satisfaction and IPV prevention outcomes. Furthermore, if found to be effective in identifying IPV and improving linkage to IPV services, this cost effective computerized service tool may be scaled up with ease and speed in court and probation settings in New York State and nationwide.</detailed_description>
