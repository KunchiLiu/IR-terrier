	<brief_title>The Effect of Administration of Low Dose Adrenaline During Surgery on Bleeding During Hip Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hip arthroplasty is associated with bleeding, anemia and the need for allogeneic transfusion. Administration of low-dose adrenaline activates the coagulation system and may decrease intraoperative and immediate postoperative bleeding. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluation whether intraoperative IV-administration of low-dose adrenaline reduces bleeding in elective total hip arthroplasty.</detailed_description>
