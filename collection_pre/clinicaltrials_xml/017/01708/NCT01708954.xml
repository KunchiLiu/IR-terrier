	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well giving erlotinib hydrochloride and cabozantinib-s-malate alone or in combination works as second or third line therapy in treating patient with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. Erlotinib hydrochloride and cabozantinib-s-malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether giving erlotinib hydrochloride together with cabozantinib-s-malate is more effective than erlotinib hydrochloride or cabozantinib-s-malate alone in treating non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib Hydrochloride and Cabozantinib-s-Malate Alone or in Combination as Second or Third Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare the progression-free survival (PFS) associated with patients treated with erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride) versus (vs) erlotinib plus cabozantinib (cabozantinib-s-malate). II. To compare the PFS associated with patients treated with erlotinib vs cabozantinib. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate overall survival in the three treatment arms. II. To evaluate best objective response rate in the three treatment arms. III. To define the toxicity associated with each regimen. IV. To conduct correlative science studies that will help to select predictive biomarkers of response to therapy, including mesenchymal-epidermal transition (MET) expression and potentially other tissue biomarkers, plasma biomarkers, and bone scans. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. ARM A (erlotinib): Patients receive erlotinib orally (PO) daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM B (cabozantinib): Patients receive cabozantinib PO daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM C (erlotinib+cabozantinib): Patients receive erlotinib as patients in Arm A and cabozantinib as patients in Arm B. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM Z: Patients achieving disease progression in Arm A or Arm B may receive erlotinib and cabozantinib as patients in Arm C. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria (Step 1): Cytologically or histologically confirmed nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) Predominant nonsquamous histology (patients with NSCLC not otherwise specified [NOS] are eligible); mixed tumors will be categorized by the predominant cell type; if small cell elements are present the patient is ineligible Stage IV disease (includes M1a, M1b, or recurrent disease), according to the 7th edition of the lung cancer TNM classification system Patients must have measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1 criteria; baseline measurements and evaluation of all sites of disease must be obtained within 4 weeks prior to registration Prior to registration, the investigator/site must confirm that sufficient pathology material representative of patient's cancer is available for submission for MET immunohistochemical (IHC) testing Patients must have received one or two lines of prior chemotherapy (first line platinumdoublet based chemotherapy plus switch maintenance chemotherapy counts as one line of therapy); prior adjuvant chemotherapy for early stage disease does not count as one line of therapy if 12 months or greater elapsed between completion of adjuvant therapy and initiation of firstline systemic therapy; if less than 12 months elapsed, adjuvant chemotherapy counts as one line of therapy Any prior chemotherapy (based on administration schedule) must have been completed in greater than or equal to the time frames specified in the protocol Patients must have discontinued treatment with any other type of investigational agent &gt;= 4 weeks prior to registration Patients must have recovered to baseline or Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 4.0 =&lt; grade 1 from toxicity due to all prior therapies except alopecia and other nonclinically significant adverse events (AEs) Patients with no known brain metastasis at baseline must have baseline brain imaging within 12 weeks prior to study registration not demonstrating brain metastases; patients with brain metastases at baseline must have baseline brain imagining within 4 weeks prior to study registration and meet all of the specific criteria for brain mets listed in the protocol Radiation related toxicities must have resolved to =&lt;
