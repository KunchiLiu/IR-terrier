	<brief_title>Learning Theory to Improve Obesity Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of the Cue Exposure program is to train children to resist cues to eat unhealthy foods. Through a series of experimental studies, the investigators will evaluate how many weekly treatment visits there should be, whether children should be exposed to a single food or multiple foods during treatment, whether to use partial reinforcement or not, whether visits should be daily or weekly, and whether the exposures should be in single or multiple contexts. The investigators will be recruiting parent-child dyads in the San Diego community to participate in 8 to 16 weekly or daily treatment sessions either in their home, community center, or our lab, depending on the treatment arm. Parents and children will complete baseline and post-treatment assessments consisting of collecting psychophysiological data, completing laboratory tasks, and completing questionnaires. The investigators will be evaluating which treatment condition reduces overeating (as measured by our laboratory tasks).</detailed_description>
