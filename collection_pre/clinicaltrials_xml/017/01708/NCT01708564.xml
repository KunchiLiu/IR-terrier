	<brief_summary>This study will assess the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rhFVIIa at three dose levels. The results will help identify the most optimal doses to take forward to the Phase 2/3 studies where bleedings in hemophilia patients with inhibitors will be treated with rhFVIIa.</brief_summary>
