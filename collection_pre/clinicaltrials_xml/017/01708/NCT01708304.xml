	<brief_summary>The University of Washington's Northwest Research Group on Aging is partnering with Area Agencies on Aging (AAA) in Washington and Oregon to complete this translational investigation of RDAD (Reducing Disabilities in Alzheimer's Disease). RDAD is an evidence-based program with demonstrated efficacy in helping older adults with dementia maintain physical function and remain physically and mentally healthy. This study asks two questions: 1) Can AAA partners successfully translate and implement RDAD, and 2) Is AAA implementation of RDAD effective in producing desired outcomes among agencies, providers, and older adults with dementia and their family members. This study is being conducted in Washington and Oregon states.</brief_summary>
