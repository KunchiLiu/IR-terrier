	<brief_summary>This study will compare the effectiveness of a psychoeducational memory program versus a computerized memory program in individuals with mental illness. Although improvements are expected with both form of interventions, we do not know which will provide maximal benefit in this population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison of the Effectiveness of Two Types of Memory Training Programs in People With a Diagnosis of Mental Illness.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of the current study is to compare two memory strategies, a top-down (i.e., educational and interventional)protocol vs. a bottom-up (computerized)protocol, in a population of individuals diagnosed with mental illness. Performance on ecologically validated memory tasks will be measured before and after each intervention protocol. Improvements are expected following each protocol. However, there is no evidence available to support added benefits from one protocol over another. As such, the current study will endeavour to contrast the two intervention types (top-down vs. bottom-up) to determine which, if any, provides maximal benefit.</detailed_description>
