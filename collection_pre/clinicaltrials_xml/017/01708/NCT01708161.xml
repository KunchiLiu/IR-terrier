	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center, open-label, phase Ib/II study. The aim of the phase Ib part is to estimate the MTD(s) and/or identify the recommended phase II dose(s) (RP2Ds) for the combination of BYL719 and AMG 479 (ganitumab), followed by the phase II part to assess the clinical efficacy and to further assess the safety of the combination in selected patient populations. Patients will be treated until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity develops, or withdrawal of informed consent, whichever occurs first. All patients will be followed up. At a minimum, patients must complete the safety follow-up assessments 30 days after the last dose of the study treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase Ib/II Study of the Combination of BYL719 Plus AMG 479 in Adult Patients With Selected Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-center, open-label, phase Ib/II study. The aim of the phase Ib part is to estimate the MTD(s) and/or identify the recommended phase II dose(s) (RP2Ds) for the combination of BYL719 and AMG 479 (ganitumab), followed by the phase II part to assess the clinical efficacy and to further assess the safety of the combination in selected patient populations. The dose escalation part of the study will be guided by a Bayesian Logistic Regression Model (BLRM). Once MTD/RP2D has been determined, patients will be enrolled in two Phase II arms. Patients with PIK3CA mutated or amplified hormone receptor positive breast carcinoma will be enrolled in Arm 1; patients with PIK3CA mutated or amplified ovarian carcinoma will be enrolled in Arm 2. Patients will be treated until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity develops, or withdrawal of informed consent, whichever occurs first. All patients will be followed up. At a minimum, patients must complete the safety follow-up assessments 30 days after the last dose of the study treatment.</detailed_description>
