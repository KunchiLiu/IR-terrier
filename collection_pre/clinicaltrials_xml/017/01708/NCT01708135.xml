	<brief_summary>This current study aims to evaluate the efficacy of engagement modules in preparing patients for bariatric surgery. With the help of the Center for Innovation (CFI), a smartphone app (Android and Apple compatible) has been created that will assist in both educating and engaging patients to develop and maintain healthy lifestyle modifications. Our goal is to create a cost-effective, smartphone-based platform that serves to not only efficiently educate but to also verify competence and keep our patients engaged during the lengthy pre-bariatric surgery process.</brief_summary>
