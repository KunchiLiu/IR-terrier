	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, single-institution observational study to be conducted at 4 clinics within the Southern California Permanente Medical Group. Pregnant women who present for prenatal genetic counseling at the designated clinics and who meet study eligibility criteria will be offered the option of the verifi® prenatal test by a trained, licensed and certified genetic counselor (GC) . Women who elect the verifi® prenatal test will have a blood sample drawn by peripheral venipuncture that will be sent to the Verinata Health CAP-accredited clinical laboratory (Redwood City, CA). Results will be reported to the ordering health care provider by the laboratory within 8-10 business days and will be shared with the subject by their provider. Subject care and decision-making following NIPT result will be clinically managed by the provider with his/her subject and is not dictated by the study protocol. All eligible women who provide informed consent, whether they elect or decline NIPT will be asked to complete a short questionnaire on their views of prenatal testing. The uptake of invasive prenatal procedures (CVS and/or amniocentesis) by the total prospective cohort will be collected through review of electronic medical records (EMR). A historical cohort with matched demographic and pre-test indications to the prospective cohort will be identified from the EMR for comparison in the primary analysis.</brief_summary>
