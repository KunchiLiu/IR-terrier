	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well ipilimumab with or without high-dose recombinant interferon alpha-2b works in treating patients with stage III-IV melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab, may block tumor growth by targeting certain cells. Recombinant interferon alfa-2b may interfere with the growth of tumor cells. It is not yet known whether ipilimumab is more effective with or without high-dose recombinant interferon alfa-2b in treating melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ipilimumab With or Without High-Dose Recombinant Interferon Alfa-2b in Treating Patients With Stage III-IV Melanoma That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Test the hypothesis that the combination of ipilimumab and high-dose interferon-alpha 2b (HDI [recombinant interferon alfa-2b]) will improve progression free survival (PFS) of patients with advanced metastatic melanoma as compared to ipilimumab alone (across ipilimumab treatment status). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Test the hypothesis that the combination of ipilimumab and HDI will prove to be safe and tolerable. II. Within the constraints of the sample size, attempt to test the hypotheses that (1) ipilimumab 10 mg/kg will lead to improved PFS in comparison to ipilimumab 3 mg/kg (across HDI treatment status); (2) the combination of ipilimumab and HDI will improve overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced metastatic melanoma as compared to ipilimumab alone (across ipilimumab treatment status) and (3) ipilimumab 10 mg/kg will lead to improved OS in comparison to ipilimumab 3 mg/kg (across HDI treatment status). OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms. ARM A: INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive higher dose ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes once every 3 weeks for 4 doses and recombinant interferon alfa-2b IV over 20 minutes 5 days a week for 4 weeks and then subcutaneously (SC) 3 times weekly for 8 weeks. MAINTENANCE PHASE: Patients receive higher dose ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes once every 12 weeks for 4 doses beginning in week 24 and recombinant interferon alfa-2b SC 3 times weekly for 48 weeks. ARM B: INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive higher dose ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes once every 3 weeks for 4 doses. MAINTENANCE PHASE: Patients receive higher dose ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes once every 12 weeks for 4 doses beginning in week 24. ARM C: INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive lower dose ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes once every 3 weeks for 4 doses and recombinant interferon alfa-2b IV over 20 minutes 5 days a week for 4 weeks and then SC 3 times weekly for 8 weeks. MAINTENANCE PHASE: Patients receive lower dose ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes once every 12 weeks for 4 doses beginning in week 24 and recombinant interferon alfa-2b SC 3 times weekly for 48 weeks. ARM D: INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive lower dose ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes once every 3 weeks for 4 doses. MAINTENANCE PHASE: Patients receive lower dose ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes once every 12 weeks for 4 doses beginning in week 24. In all arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually for up to 5 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma, either initial presentation or recurrent, that is of cutaneous origin or unknown primary origin and that is histologically diagnosed No more than one prior systemic therapeutic regimen for unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma; this includes chemotherapy, biologic therapy, biochemotherapy, or investigational treatment; this does not include any therapies given in the adjuvant setting; however, patients are excluded if they have a history of prior treatment for melanoma (either adjuvant or metastatic disease) with ipilimumab or other cytotoxic Tlymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) inhibitor, or prior interferonalpha treatment for metastatic disease (history of adjuvant interferonalpha is allowed); there should be a 4week washout period between last treatment administration and initiation of study therapy Patients must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 01 Patients must not have other significant medical, surgical, or psychiatric conditions or require any medication or treatment that in the opinion of the investigator may interfere with compliance, make the administration of ipilimumab or HDI hazardous or obscure the interpretation of adverse events (AEs), such as a condition associated with frequent diarrhea; patients must not have an active infection requiring current treatment with parenteral antibiotics Patients must not have a history of inflammatory bowel disease or diverticulitis (history of diverticulosis is allowed) Patients who have other current malignancies are not eligible; patients with other malignancies are eligible if they have been continuously disease free for &gt; 5 years prior to the time of randomization; one exception are patients treated with a curative intent and are continuously disease free for &gt; 3 years; these patients would be considered eligible: Patients with prior history at any time of any in situ cancer, lobular carcinoma of the breast in situ, cervical cancer in situ, atypical melanocytic hyperplasia or Clark I melanoma in situ are eligible Patients with prior history of basal or squamous skin cancer are eligible Patients must not have autoimmune disorders or conditions of immunosuppression that require current ongoing treatment with systemic corticosteroids (or other systemic immunosuppressants), including oral steroids (e.g., prednisone, dexamethasone) or continuous use of topical steroid creams or ointments or ophthalmologic steroids; a history of occasional (but not continuous) use of steroid inhalers is allowed; replacement doses of steroids for patients with adrenal insufficiency are allowed; patients who discontinue use of these classes of medication for at least 2 weeks prior to randomization are eligible if, in the judgment of the treating physician investigator, the patient is not likely to require resumption of treatment with these classes of drugs during the study; exclusion from this study also includes patients with a history of symptomatic autoimmune disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive sclerosis [scleroderma], systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome, autoimmune vasculitis [e.g., Wegener's granulomatosis]); motor neuropathy considered of autoimmune origin (e.g., GuillainBarre syndrome and Myasthenia gravis); other central nervous system (CNS) autoimmune disease (e.g., poliomyelitis, multiple sclerosis); patients with autoimmune hypothyroid disease or type I diabetes on replacement treatment are eligible Due to the possible effect of treatment with ipilimumab on the immunologic response to infectious disease vaccines, patients must not have had any infectious disease vaccination (e.g, standard influenza, H1N1 influenza, pneumococcal, meningococcal, tetanus toxoid) within 4 weeks prior to randomization Women must not be pregnant or breastfeeding; all females of childbearing potential must have a blood test or urine study during screening to rule out pregnancy; NOTE: a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is any woman, regardless of sexual orientation or whether they have undergone tubal ligation, who meets the following criteria: has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy;
