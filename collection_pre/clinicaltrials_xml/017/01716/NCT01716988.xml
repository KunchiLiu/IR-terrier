	<brief_summary>A study of micafungin in ICU versus non-ICU patients showed a significantly lower treatment success in ICU patients compared with non-ICU patients. It is known that in critically ill patients, alterations in function of various organs and body systems can influence the pharmacokinetics and hence the plasma concentration of a drug. The pharmacokinetic parameters of micafungin in critically ill patients are most likely different, but this has not been specifically studied. The pharmacokinetic parameters of micafungin in critically ill patients will be established and plasma concentrations of micafungin will be correlated with disease severity.</brief_summary>
