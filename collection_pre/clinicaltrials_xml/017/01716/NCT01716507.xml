	<brief_title>23 Gauge and 20 Gauge Vitrectomy for Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachments</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The majority of studies on PPV for PRD up to this time have used 20-gauge instrumentation. Currently, both 23-gauge and 20-gauge instrumentation are commercially available for PPV. No studies have reported the efficacy of 23-gauge PPV compared to 20-gauge PPV for primary pseudophakic RRD. As a result, many retinal surgeons choose the modality based on personal preference.</detailed_description>
