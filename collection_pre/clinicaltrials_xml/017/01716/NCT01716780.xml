	<brief_summary>This study is looking at treating cancer pain in head and neck cancer. Patients are asked in outpatients to score their worst pain on a scale of 0 to 10 in the last 24 hours. Those with a pain score of 4 and above are randomised into the study. Patients are allocated to continue with their current care (control group) or to be reviewed by the pain/palliative care team (intervention group). At baseline questionnaires are completed on level of pain, type of pain, quality of life and anxiety/depression. Information is also collected on the analgesia they've used in the past month and basic health economics (GP/hospital visits related to pain management and treatment). Follow up in the trial is for 3 months and consists of questionnaires as above and further collection of information on analgesic usage and health economics.</brief_summary>
