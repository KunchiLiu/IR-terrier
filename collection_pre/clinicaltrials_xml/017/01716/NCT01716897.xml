Any history of cerebrovascular disease (stroke or transient ischemic attack) 4. A history of prolonged QT/QTc interval or prolonged period from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave on an ECG (QT)/ QT corrected for heart rate using Fridericia?s formula (QTcF) interval (QTcF &amp;gt; 450 ms) as demonstrated by the mean of triplicate electrocardiogram (ECGs) (recorded at least 1 min apart) at Screening or Baseline Period 5. Any other clinically significant ECG abnormalities at Screening or Baseline Periods, e.g. component of the ECG cycle from onset of atrial depolarization to onset of ventricular depolarization (PR)&amp;gt;220 ms, component of ECG wave representing ventricular depolarization (QRS)&amp;gt;110 ms 6.
