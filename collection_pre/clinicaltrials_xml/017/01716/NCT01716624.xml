	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of Botulinum Toxin A as primary therapy for children with neurogenic bladder due to spina bifida and compare results with standard oral oxybutynin therapy. This study hopes to demonstrate that Botulinum Toxin A can maintain or improve bladder storage function without side effects associated with oxybutynin use.</brief_summary>
