	<brief_title>CARTO® 3 System and Real Time Intracardiac Ultrasound</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is purposed to measure "real world" acute procedural outcomes (procedural efficiency and acute safety) associated with use of the CARTO® 3 System and real time intracardiac ultrasound in a clinical setting in subjects with drug refractory recurrent symptomatic paroxysmal AF.</detailed_description>
