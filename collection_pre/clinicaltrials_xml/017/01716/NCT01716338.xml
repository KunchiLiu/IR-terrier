	<brief_summary>Glyburide is a medication that has been safely used for several decades to treat non-insulin dependent diabetes. This pilot study seeks to evaluate whether glyburide, administered at the lowest dose (1.5 mg/dL daily) to healthy (non-diabetic) subjects is safe both physically and cognitively. The investigators are hopeful that the results of this study will provide the necessary foundation to evaluate this medication's use on a larger scale to determine the feasibility of using glyburide in soldiers either prophylactically or for the treatment of brain injury.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Glyburide Healthy Volunteer Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a placebo controlled (2:1 drug vs. placebo), randomized clinical trial of 21 healthy, non-diabetic volunteers receiving daily doses of oral glyburide (1.5 mg) vs. placebo while under careful medical monitoring in an inpatient Clinical Research Unit (CRU)within the Center for Applied Research Sciences (CARS) at the Washington University in St. Louis Medical Center for a duration of 7 days and nights (24 hours per day). Interested subjects who call for more information about the study will be scheduled for a screening visit. Subjects will participate first in an informed consent process, and those wishing to take part will be asked to undergo a comprehensive interview detailing their past medical history and formal physical examination (which includes laboratory tests of the urine and blood). If a subject is deemed appropriate by the team, he/she will be asked to perform an exercise test (treadmill for 30 minutes) and will have an Electrocardiogram (ECG) completed to further determine eligibility. Individuals who do not meet inclusion criteria based on screening activities will be notified immediately that they are not eligible. Volunteers meeting all eligibility criteria will be scheduled for the week long in-patient evaluation. Each subject will undergo a battery of physical, cognitive, and laboratory tests in addition to receiving oral glyburide or placebo each day for one week.</detailed_description>
