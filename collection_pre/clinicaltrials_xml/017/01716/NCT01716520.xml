	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the lung function response to UMEC/VI, UMEC, and VI in individual patients using a cross-over design. This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 3-way crossover study. Eligible subjects will be randomized to a sequence of UMEC 62.5mcg, VI 25mcg, and UMEC/VI 62.5/25mcg. All subjects will receive each treatment once-daily for 14 days, and each treatment will be separated by a 10-14 day washout period. There will be a 5-7 day run-in period prior to randomization.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Type of Patient: Outpatient Informed Consent: A signed and dated written informed consent prior to study participation Age: Subjects 40 years of age or older at Visit 1 Gender: Male or female subjects. COPD diagnosis: As defined by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) Severity of disease: A pre and postsalbutamol FEV1/FVC ratio of &lt;0.70 and a pre and postsalbutamol FEV1 of ≤ 70% of predicted normal values at Visit 1 Smoking History: Current or former cigarette smokers with a history of cigarette smoking of ≥ 10 packyears at Visit 1 Female subject of non childbearing potential OR a female subject of child bearing potential, with a negative pregnancy test at screening, and agreeing to consistently and correctly use one of the acceptable contraceptive methods Pregnancy: Women who are pregnant or lactating or are planning on becoming pregnant during the study Asthma: A current diagnosis of asthma Other Respiratory Disorders: Known alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency, active lung infections (such as tuberculosis), and lung cancer are absolute exclusionary conditions. Other Diseases/Abnormalities: Subjects with historical or current evidence of clinically significant cardiovascular, neurological, psychiatric, renal, hepatic, immunological, endocrine (including uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or hematological abnormalities that are uncontrolled and/or a previous history of cancer in remission for &lt; 5 years prior to Visit 1 Contraindications: A history of allergy or hypersensitivity to any anticholinergic/muscarinic receptor antagonist, beta2agonist, lactose/milk protein or magnesium stearate or a medical condition such as of narrowangle glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction that, in the opinion of the study physician contraindicates study participation or use of an inhaled anticholinergic. Hospitalization: Hospitalization for COPD or pneumonia within 12 weeks prior to Visit 1. Lung Resection: Subjects with lung volume reduction surgery within the 12 months prior to Visit 1. 12Lead ECG: An abnormal and significant ECG finding from the 12lead ECG conducted at Visit 1 Screening Labs: Significantly abnormal finding from clinical chemistry or hematology tests at Visit 1 as determined by the study investigator. Medication Prior to Spirometry: Unable to withhold salbutamol for the 4 hour period required prior to spirometry testing at each study visit and at each spirometry test performed at home. Medications Prior to Screening: Use of the prohibited medications according to defined time intervals prior to Visit 1 Oxygen: Use of longterm oxygen therapy (LTOT) described as oxygen therapy prescribed for greater than 12 hours a day. Asneeded oxygen use (i.e., ≤ 12 hours per day) is not exclusionary. Nebulized Therapy: Regular use (prescribed for use every day, not for asneeded use) of shortacting bronchodilators (e.g., salbutamol, ipratropium bromide) via nebulized therapy Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program: Participation in the acute phase of a pulmonary rehabilitation program within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1. Subjects who are in the maintenance phase of a pulmonary rehabilitation program are not excluded. Drug or Alcohol Abuse: A known or suspected history of alcohol or drug abuse within 2 years prior to Visit 1. Affiliation with Investigator Site: Is an investigator, subinvestigator, study coordinator, employee of a participating investigator or study site, or immediate family member of the aforementioned that is involved in this study. Inability to read: In the opinion of the Investigator, any subject who is unable to read and/or would not be able to complete a questionnaire</criteria>
