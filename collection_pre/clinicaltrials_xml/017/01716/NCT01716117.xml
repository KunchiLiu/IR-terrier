	<brief_summary>This clinical research study is designed to determine safety and effectiveness of the Surpass Flow Diverter (Surpass System), an investigational device developed to treat wide neck, large or giant intracranial aneurysms. An intracranial aneurysm is a bulge in the wall of a blood vessel in the brain. The bulge is caused by a weakening of the vessel wall. If left untreated, the bulge may continue to grow larger and ultimately the vessel may break open (rupture), resulting in serious bleeding into or around the brain. The information collected from this study will be used to evaluate how well patients do when treated with the Surpass System both immediately after treatment of an aneurysm and over a long period of time (5 years).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Effectiveness of an Intracranial Aneurysm Embolization System for Treating Large or Giant Wide Neck Aneurysms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective of this study is to determine safety and effectiveness of the Surpass Flow Diverter (Surpass System) in the endovascular treatment of large or giant wide-necked intracranial aneurysms in the internal carotid artery up to the terminus. The Surpass Flow Diverter is an intracranial implant designed to be placed in a parent artery so as to divert blood flow away from an aneurysm. Use of the Surpass System may be associated with a decrease in neurological death or ipsilateral stroke in patients with large or giant wide-neck aneurysms. In a given patient, the Surpass System will be deemed effective if treatment results in complete occlusion of their aneurysm without clinically significant stenosis of the parent artery at one year.</detailed_description>
