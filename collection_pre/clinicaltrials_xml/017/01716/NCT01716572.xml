	<brief_title>Erythromycin Versus Gastric Lavage to Improve Quality of Endoscopy in Patients With Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The researchers will investigate whether erythromycin infusion is better than gastric lavage prior to emergency endoscopy to improve the quality of examination in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. One hundred and twenty-two patients admitted within 12 hours after hematemesis will be randomly assigned to receive erythromycin infusion or gastric lavage by nasogastric tube prior to emergency endoscopy. The endoscopic procedures will be recorded on Digital Video Disc (DVD). Two endoscopists blinded to the cleansing strategy will assess the quality of examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract by using scales designed by Frossard and Avgerinos . Secondary endpoints will be the need for a second-look endoscopy, the mean number of blood units transfused, the need of surgery or arteriography, and the mean duration of hospitalization</detailed_description>
