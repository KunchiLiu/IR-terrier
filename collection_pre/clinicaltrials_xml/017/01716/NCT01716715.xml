	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well giving cabozantinib-s-malate or paclitaxel works in treating patients with persistent or recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cavity cancer. Cabozantinib-s-malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known whether cabozantinib-s-malate or paclitaxel is more effective at treating patients with persistent or recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cavity cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cabozantinib or Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Persistent or Recurrent Epithelial Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cavity Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the activity of cabozantinib (cabozantinib-s-malate) relative to weekly paclitaxel in patients with persistent or recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer with a log-rank test assessing progression-free survival (PFS) at 3.68 months (approximately pre-cycle 5) and 7.36 months (approximately pre-cycle 9). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). II. To estimate and compare the proportion of patients responding to therapy by Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST), cancer antigen 125 (CA125) response, the overall survival (OS), and the duration of response in each arm. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To retrospectively correlate c-met proto-oncogene (MET) expression with overall outcome. II. To retrospectively correlate c-MET copy number with overall outcome. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. ARM II: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have recurrent or persistent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma; histologic documentation of the original primary tumor is required via the pathology report Patients must have measurable disease or nonmeasurable (detectable) disease: Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded); each lesion must be greater than or equal to 10 mm when measured by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or caliper measurement by clinical exam; or greater than or equal to 20 mm when measured by chest xray; lymph nodes must be greater than or equal to 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI Nonmeasurable (detectable) disease is defined in this protocol as the absence of measurable disease but at least one of the following conditions: Ascites and/or pleural effusion attributed to tumor Solid and/or cystic abnormalities on radiographic imaging that do not meet RECIST 1.1 definitions for target lesions Patients with measurable disease must have at least one "target lesion" to be used to assess response on this protocol as defined by RECIST 1.1;
