	<brief_summary>This study will prospectively enroll approximately 660 children, at least 18 months and less than 5 years of age, who have been referred to a pediatric developmental evaluation centers. Enrolled children will have blood drawn for RNA gene expression analysis and undergo a clinical evaluation to determine the presence or absence of a diagnosis of ASD. The sequential co-primary objectives of this study are: - To develop an algorithm to classify blood RNA gene expression patterns to maximize agreement between the classification and a clinical assessment of presence or absence of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). - To prospectively assess the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the blood RNA gene expression classification algorithm (the SDX-002 test) in children referred to a developmental evaluation clinic for a possible developmental disorder.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Referred to a developmental evaluation centers for evaluation of a possible developmental disorder, other than isolated motor problems. 2. Age &gt;= 18 months and &lt; 5 years. 3. Parent/legal guardian has been informed about the study and has signed an informed consent form. 1. Prior reliable diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (i.e. prior evaluation by a multidisciplinary team has already reliably established Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis). 2.
