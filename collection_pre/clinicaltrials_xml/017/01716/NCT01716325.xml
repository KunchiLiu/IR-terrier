	<detailed_description>A mobile environment to improve the process of an integrated treatment of obese people will be identified, developed, introduced and clinically evaluated. The study will include 150 patients aged between 25 to 65 for men and 25 to 70 for women, diagnosed with obesity (BMI≥30 or BMI&gt;27,5 and 20% risk or more for developing a cardiovascular diseases). One group of patients will visit conventional live workshops for weight loss and the other group will use ICT. At the initial examination by the doctor all survey participants will have measured blood pressure, body mass, waist circumference, percentage of body fat, percentage of skeletal muscle, resting metabolic rate, estimated risk of developing cardiovascular disease and will be directed to laboratory examination (blood lipids and cholesterol, blood sugar). Both groups will go through 16 workshops for weight loss. Each week they will monitor their body mass, waist circumference, physical activity (type, duration, intensity) and food intake (type, quantity). After six months all survey participants will be examined again. We will compare effectiveness of ICT weight loss group with conventional weight loss group.</detailed_description>
