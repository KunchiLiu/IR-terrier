	<brief_summary>R2C2 study has shown that abdominal obesity is associated with a cardiac and vascular remodelling in healthy volunteers. This remodelling is correlated with renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) activation and/or systemic fibrosis. R2C2 II study is designed to confirm the hypothesis that RAAS is associated with an early remodelling and implicated in the transition to cardiac failure in abdominal obesity.</brief_summary>
