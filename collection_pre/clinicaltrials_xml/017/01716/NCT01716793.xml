	<brief_summary>In a protocol of treatment of AML used in 1994 for adults with AML up to the age of 50 years, the Spanish CETLAM group showed a complete remission rate 75 % using the combination of daunorubicin (60 mg/m2, 3 days) plus conventional dose cytarabine (100mg/m2/day in continuous infusion during 7 days) and etoposide (100mg/m2 IV/day 3 days). If idarubicin (10 mg/m2, 3 days) was administered instead of daunorubicin, the complete remission (CR) rate in adults up to 60 years was 75%. To improve the proportion of CRs and to decrease relapse rate appearing in 50% of patients, the phase II AML-99 trial includes intermediate dose-cytarabine during induction and risk-adapted post remission treatment based on the improvement in prognostic characterization of AML and the implementation of novel transplantation techniques.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Risk-adapted Therapy for Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Induction chemotherapy: idarubicin (12mg/m2/day intravenous), intermediate-dose cytarabine (500mg/m2/12h, intravenous) and etoposide (100mg/m2/day, intravenous) in 3+7+3 schedule. This induction therapy is repeated if complete remission (CR) is not achieved after the first course of treatment. Consolidation therapy: mitoxantrone (12mg/m2/day, intravenous, days 4, 5 and 6) and intermediate-dose cytarabine (500mg/m2/12h from day 1 to 6). Risk-stratification according to cytogenetics, courses to CR and availability of an HLA-identical sibling: - Patients in the favorable cytogenetics group [t(8;21), inv(16) or t(16;16)] are treated with high-dose cytarabine (3g/m2/12h, intravenous, days 1, 3 and 5). - Patients in intermediate cytogenetics group (normal karyotype and a single course to achieve the CR) receive an autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplant, regardless of having an HLA-identical sibling. - The remaining patients are considered in the high-risk group and are treated with autologous or allogeneic PBSC transplantation depending on the availability of a sibling donor. In allotransplants, CD34+ cell selection of hematopoietic cells is performed.</detailed_description>
