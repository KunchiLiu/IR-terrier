Volunteers completed questionnaires for each period on overall health and well being, stool frequency and consistency and gastrointestinal symptoms.

The primary objective of the study is tan increase in fecal butyrate concentration. Secondary objectives are changes in microbiota composition and short-chain fatty acids.</brief_summary>
