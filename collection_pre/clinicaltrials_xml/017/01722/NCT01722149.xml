	<brief_summary>MPM patients are not eligible for surgical procedures like decortication or pleuro-pneumectomy and have a median survival of 12 months with palliative chemotherapy. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches are of crucial need in this clinical situation. This is a phase I trial for patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma with pleural effusion testing the safety of a fixed single dose of 1x10e6 adoptively transferred FAP-specific re-directed T cells given directly in the pleural effusion. Lymphocytes will be taken 21 days before transfer from peripheral blood. CD8 positive T cells will be isolated and re-programmed by retroviral transfer of a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) recognizing FAP which serves as target structure in MPM. - Trial with immunomodulatory product / biological</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Re-directed T Cells for the Treatment (FAP)-Positive Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase I trial for patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. A fixed single dose of adoptively transferred FAP-specific CD8 positive re-directed T cells will be given in the pleural effusion. Three patients who are at the time point of screening not operable will be treated with re-directed T cells administered into the pleural effusion after completion of 3 cycles of palliative chemotherapy. In the case of one AE grade III/IV or one SAE - and the occurrence of DLT both judged to be treatment related by an independent safety monitoring board - the patient number will be expanded to 6 patients. The study will be stopped if one additional DLT occurs also judged to be treatment related. Patients will be treated with 1x10e6 re-directed FAP-specific T cells injected in the pleural effusion. The study ends 35 days after adoptive T cell transfer. Re-directed FAP-specific T cells will be administered at day 0 (day 14 of the third cycle of palliative chemotherapy). The study is designed to demonstrate safety of 1x10e6 re-directed FAP-specific T cells. The next patient will be enrolled earliest, when the previous patient completed day +14 and the safety monitoring board has not declared any DLTs. The palliative chemotherapy is not part of the study protocol.</detailed_description>
