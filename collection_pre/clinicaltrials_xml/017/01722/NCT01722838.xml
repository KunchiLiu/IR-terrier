	<brief_summary>B-ME is a research intervention study designed to address the needs of African American men who have sex with men (AAMSM) who are at high risk for HIV. The intent of the intervention is to decrease HIV risk behaviors among African American MSM using an intervention developed by and for African American MSM. The hypothesis guiding this study is: that participants who complete B-ME intervention will report greater reductions in sexual risk behaviors than the standard of care comparison group.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Specific Aims of this study are 1) to further explicate and develop the intervention, 2) to evaluate its efficacy in reducing HIV risk behaviors and 3) to expand the limited body of research on HIV prevention/risk reduction practices for African American men who have sex with men(AAMSM). The study will use a randomized-controlled trial design to compare receiving B-ME intervention to receiving basic men's health and wellness messaging (standard of care), hypothesizing: hypothesizing: that participants who complete B-ME intervention will report greater reductions in sexual risk behaviors than the standard of care comparison group. The study will utilize a pre-test/post-test design with participants randomized to intervention and comparison groups; have a strategy to retain at least 80% of participants through study completion; collect data at baseline, at 3 months post-intervention, and at 6 months post-intervention; and rigorously measure outcomes that directly impact HIV risk. Data will be collected at each assessment point to assess B-ME's ability to improve behavioral outcomes that directly impact Black MSM HIV risk: (1) number of unprotected anal and vaginal sex events; (2) number of unprotected sex events with persons of unknown HIV status; (3) frequency of HIV testing, and (4) increased communication between partners about sex and strategies for reducing the risk of HIV infection.</detailed_description>
