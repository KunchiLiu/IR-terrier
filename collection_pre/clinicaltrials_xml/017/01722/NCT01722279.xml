	<brief_title>The Long Term Impact of Bariatric Surgery on Quality of Life</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Information from existing databases and medical records will be used to obtain a list of phone numbers for persons who had roux-en-y bariatric surgery at the SVBCE five or more years ago at the St. Vincent Bariatric Center of Excellence (SVBCE. The interview includes scripts that the caller will use to recruit subjects in either direct conversation, in voice mail or by leaving a message. Recruitment will cease after 400 complete post pilot interviews are obtained. The interview covers topics related to physical and psychological health and quality of life. The number of questions asked will vary from subject to subject since some questions are asked only if a prior question is answered affirmatively. For example, if a subject responds "yes" when asked "have you had plastic surgery?" the subject is then asked what type of procedure they had. The topics covered are as follows: weight, current health, post surgery complications, relationships, work, cross addiction, mental health, diet, television viewing, exercise, and life satisfaction.</detailed_description>
