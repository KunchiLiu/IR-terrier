	<brief_summary>Introduction: parastomal hernia (PH) is a frequent complication after an ostomy, despite the many prevention and treatment techniques that have been described. Since the introduction of laparoscopy, the frequency of PH is even higher than in open surgery. This type of hernia remains a surgical problem of considerable importance, requiring significant consumption of public health and economic resources, and representing a major alteration of the quality of life of these patients. Objective: to evaluate the effectiveness of the insertion of a prosthesis to prevent PH in elective surgery for laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection. Methodology: prospective, multidisciplinary, multi-center randomized controlled study. Control group: Rectal neoplasms undergoing elective surgery for laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection. Study group: Rectal neoplasms undergoing elective surgery for laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection with a lightweight mesh (polypropylene and poliglecaprone 25). Sample size was calculated based on a proportion of parastomal hernia of 65% in the control group and 15% in the study group. With an α risk =0.05 and 1- β= 0.8, 28 patients are required, 14 per group. Estimating a drop-out rate of 10%, the final number will be 32 patients. The efficacy will be evaluated clinically at six months and abdominal CT will be performed at 12 months along with another clinical evaluation.</brief_summary>
