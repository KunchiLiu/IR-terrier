	<brief_summary>Decision making capacity fatigues after repeated decisions similar to skeletal muscle. The result is decision fatigue, in which subsequent decisions are altered toward the status quo. Patients are at risk for decision fatigue yet it has not been studied. The Investigator proposes a randomized study in the outpatient setting in patients at high risk for needing to make complex decisions, in an effort to determine the impact of decision fatigue on participant self-control and subsequent choices.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Frequent Decision Making Among Patients With Serious Illnesses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Just as skeletal muscle fatigues after repeated use, decision-making capacity fatigues when repeated choices are made. This phenomenon, in which people experience diminished concentration and willpower after repeated decision-making, is termed decision fatigue. (1) People experiencing decision fatigue are more likely to bias subsequent choices toward the status quo. By choosing the status quo, the decision-maker reserves the option to make an alternate choice at a later time, thereby preserving possibilities. Patients and their surrogates often make complex medical decisions for which they may have little experience. Although clearly at high risk, decision fatigue has not been studied this population. To elucidate these questions, we propose a four arm study of patients in a population at high risk for making complex decisions. Participants will be randomly assigned to varied levels of decision making effort to assess for the development of resultant decision fatigue and whether it alters subsequent decisions.</detailed_description>
