	<brief_summary>Patients treated with Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) or direct oral anticoagulants as Rivaroxaban, Apixaban, Edoxaban or Dabigatran, who experience severe bleeding and/or need urgent interventions/operations that cannot wait are included in this registry, or during emergency operations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reversal Agent Use in Patients Treated With Direct Oral Anticoagulants or Vitamin K Antagonists</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Registry will offer the opportunity to evaluate the effects of reversal agents as PCC, aPCC, rVIIa, specific antidots in e.g. severe bleeding patients treated with oral anticoagulants. By collecting case reports from several university hospitals and clinics, different treatment strategies in clinical practice will be observed and evaluated, and may serve as a comprehensive information resource for the safe management with DOA, but also with the long-term anticoagulation based on coumarin derivatives in the near future. The current objective of this registry is to: 1. Document the clinical course and outcome of various clinical bleeding events associated with DOA or VKA in patients with severe life-threatening bleeding making intervention necessary 2. Document the clinical course and outcome of urgent surgical interventions within 24 hours after admission in patients under DOA or VKA treatment. 3. Characterisation of therapeutic strategies in stopping acute life-threatening bleeding including following agents and methods: 1. blood transfusion, 2. platelet concentrates 3. reversal agents [e.g. vitamin K, prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), activated PCC (aPCC), activated factor VII (aVII), fibrinogen concentrate, fresh frozen plasma (FFP)] 4. specific antidots, e.g. idarucizumab 5. haemodialysis 6. desmopressin 7. tranexamic acid 8. no specific treatment in respect to the above mentioned treatments (e.g. stop of medication and waiting until anticoagulant effect of DOA is decreased).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient Eligibility 1. a) Bleeding patients: Anticoagulated patients with DOA or VKA with clinically overt major bleeding according to a specified ISTH definition for nonsurgical patients: Symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, such as intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraarticular or pericardial, or intramuscular with compartment syndrome Bleeding causing a fall in hemoglobin level of 2 g L1 (1.24 mmol L1 ) or more leading to transfusion of two or more units of whole blood or red cells. OR b) Acute surgical need Patients treated with DOA or VKA and who need urgent operation which cannot wait (&lt; 24 h after last intake of drug) AND 2. with or without reversal agent use (e.g. PCC, aPCC, rVIIa) (and/or haemodialysis for dabigatran) AND 3. provides informed consent after the acute event</criteria>
