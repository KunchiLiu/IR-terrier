	<brief_summary>The CATS project is designed to increase understanding of interventions that are feasible and effective in helping injection drug users (IDU) or other patients at high risk of poor medication adherence who are HIV-positive to maintain a high ART adherence. The study will involve: assessing the feasibility and acceptability of using real-time feedback, a wireless technology-updated adaptation of an approach the investigators found to be feasible and effective in China, to promote ART adherence among Chinese patients, including IDU; generating preliminary effectiveness data of real-time feedback on adherence, CD4 count, and HIV viral load; and identifying the factors that explain how real-time feedback influences intervention success or failure. The specific aims of the study are: SA1: Determine the feasibility and acceptability of using real-time feedback, a wireless technology-updated adaptation of an approach we found to be feasible and effective in China, to promote ART adherence among Chinese patients. The investigators will conduct a pilot RCT of the real-time feedback intervention among Chinese patients in order to assess its feasibility and acceptability in this population. SA2: Generate preliminary effectiveness data of real-time feedback on adherence, CD4 count, and HIV viral load. The RCT will allow the researchers to generate rigorous estimates of effect sizes on these important endpoints. SA3: Describe the factors that explain how real-time feedback influences intervention success or failure. The investigators will use a quantitative-qualitative mixed-methods research approach to explore how the intervention influences the experience of adherence support in this patient population.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators will implement CATS over 2.5 years by implementing a randomized controlled trial to assess real-time feedback, an intervention that utilizes wireless technology via an electronic pill container device ('Wisepill'), and investigating the mechanisms by which the intervention operates using quantitative and qualitative research methods. 120 patients will be enrolled in a HIV clinic in Nanning, capital of Guangxi province, a border province with high rates of HIV and IDU. Enrolled patients will be randomized to intervention vs. comparison group for the 6-month intervention. The study will follow all patients for an additional 3 months to determine sustainability of intervention impact. In addition to adherence and clinical data, quantitative and qualitative data will be collected using survey instruments, focus groups, and in-depth interviews. Analysis of these data will enable achievement of the specific aims and contribute to the scientific evidence base on effective approaches to promoting ART adherence among IDU and other patients.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients who are 18 years of age and above, currently on ART or about to begin ART at the Guangxi CDC clinic, deemed at risk for poor adherence either by patients or medical staff, own a cell phone, and provide written consent. Persons who do not speak Mandarin Chinese or who have mental health issues such that they cannot provide written informed consent will not be allowed to participate.</criteria>
