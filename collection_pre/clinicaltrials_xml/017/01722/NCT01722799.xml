	<brief_summary>Significant lesions in small coronary arteries are frequently found (35%-50%) in patients with coronary artery disease. Independently of the type of coronary angioplasty the restenosis and the need for repeat revascularization remains the main limitation, representing a challenging problem even in the DES (drug eluting stent) era. Recently has been developed drug eluting balloons (DEBs), which have been successfully tested in small series on in-stent restenosis, but few evidence is available in the context of small vessels disease. The current study has been designed to know, in one hand, the clinical efficacy of the Drug elluting balloon IN.PACT FALCON and, in other hand, the effectiveness, and the cost-effectiveness incremental analysis of DEBs (IN.PACT FALCON vs. DES ( RESOLUTE INTEGRITY) in patients with de novo lesions in small vessels.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recent studies have reported the efficacy of the local application of paclitaxel ® inhibiting neointimal proliferation, and thus the limitation of restenosis, which has led to the conception and development of drug-coated balloon or "Drug Eluting Balloons" (DEB), releasing the antiproliferative drug at the time of expansion. Initially they were applied in the treatment of in-stent restenosis. However, DEB may represent a therapeutic alternative in other contexts where anatomo-clinical uses are not always therapeutic percutaneous coronary revascularization with stent implantation, as is the case of coronary lesions located in small vessels.</detailed_description>
