	<brief_summary>Assessment of the effect of hyperoxia and hypertonic saline on survival in patients with septic shock Hyperoxia and hypertonic saline may have beneficial effects on organ perfusion and oxygenation and may reduce the organ failure occurences. To date, only scarce data are available. Side effects are not well described. Therefore we designed a randomized clinical trial in order to assess the early administration of hypertonic saline and oxygen in the very early beginning of septic shock.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study is designed as factorial 2x2. Patients will be stratified at the randomisation according the presence or absence of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in order to perform a sub group analysis for all outcome criteria.</detailed_description>
