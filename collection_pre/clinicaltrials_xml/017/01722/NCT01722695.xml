	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to show equivalent performance of the Revaclear dialyzer when compared to a dialyzer with larger membrane surface area. Study design: open, randomized, cross-over, multicentric, controlled prospective Medical devices: Revaclear 200 versus FX 60 or Revaclear 400 versus FX 100, depending on patient needs Patients/sample size: 30 adult chronic hemodialysis patients Treatment: Each patient will be treated by hemodialysis for one week (3 dialysis sessions) with Revaclear dialyzers and one week (3 dialysis sessions) with FX dialyzers. Objectives: intraindividual comparison of dialysis dose; reduction rates and total removal of urea, phosphate, creatinine and ß2-microglobulin; albumin loss Primary variable: dialysis dose Kt/V urea Secondary variable: reduction rates and total removal of urea, phosphate, creatinine and ß2-microglobulin Safety variable: albumin loss, blood count</brief_summary>
