	<brief_title>A Multicenter, Open-label, Phase 3 Study of the Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Ibrutinib Versus Chlorambucil in Patients 65 Years or Older With Treatment-naive Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (RESONATE™-2)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design: This is a randomized, multicenter, open-label, Phase 3 study designed to compare the safety and efficacy of Ibrutinib versus Chlorambucil in treatment-naive patients 65 years or older who have CLL or SLL. Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Treatment Arm A or B: - Treatment Arm A: Oral Chlorambucil 0.5 mg/kg on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle; the dose can be increased, if well tolerated, in increments of 0.1 mg/kg on Day 1 of each cycle to a maximum of 0.8 mg/kg; patients receive a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 12 cycles, in the absence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. - Treatment Arm B: Oral Ibrutinib 420 mg/day Randomization will be stratified on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0,1 versus 2); presence of advanced Rai stage (yes/no), advanced being defined as Stages 3-4; and geographic region: US versus non-US.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Males or females of 65 years of age or greater. Patients between the ages of 65 and 70 years of age must have 1 or more of the following comorbidities that may preclude the use of frontline chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, or rituximab: creatinine clearance &lt; 70 mL/min using the CockcroftGault equation platelet count &lt; 100,000/μL or hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL clinically apparent autoimmune cytopenia (autoimmune hemolytic anemia or immune thrombocytopenia) ECOG performance score = 1 or 2 2. Diagnosis of CLL/SLL that meets IWCLL diagnostic criteria (Hallek 2008) 3. Active disease meeting at least 1 of the following IWCLL criteria (Hallek 2008) for requiring treatment: Evidence of progressive marrow failure as manifested by the development of, or worsening of, anemia and/or thrombocytopenia Massive, progressive, or symptomatic splenomegaly Massive nodes or progressive or symptomatic lymphadenopathy Progressive lymphocytosis Autoimmune hemolytic anemia and/or immune thrombocytopenia that is poorly responsive to corticosteroids or standard therapy Constitutional symptoms 4.

Adequate hematologic function, defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000/μL (independent of growth factor support for at least 7 days prior to screening) and platelet count ≥ 50,000/μL (independent of transfusion and growth factor support for at least 7 days prior to screening) 8. Adequate hepatic function, defined as serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) &lt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), and total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN 9.

Willingness of male patients, if sexually active with a female of childbearing potential, to use an effective barrier method of contraception during the study and for 3 months following the last dose of study drug 12. Ability to provide written informed consent and to understand and comply with the requirements of the study 1. Known involvement of the central nervous system by lymphoma or leukemia 2. History or current evidence of Richter's transformation or prolymphocytic leukemia 3.
