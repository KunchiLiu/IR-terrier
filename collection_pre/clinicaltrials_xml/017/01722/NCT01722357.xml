	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to address 3 main sets of questions in the bariatric surgery population. 1) Does bariatric surgery, without any other intervention, lead to increased physical activity and improved physical fitness? 2) Does wearing a pedometer lead to increased physical activity in obese individuals prior to and/or after bariatric surgery? Does the increased activity result in improvements in physical fitness? 3) Does physical activity counseling increase physical activity prior to and or/after bariatric surgery? Does the increased activity result in improvements in physical fitness? The overall goal of the study is to determine the impact of bariatric surgery on physical activity and assess the utility of additional interventions to help postoperative patients adopt a more active lifestyle. Participants are randomized to usual care, pedometer use, or pedometer use plus exercise counseling before and for the first 6 months after bariatric surgery. In an extension of the primary study, from 1 to 5 years after surgery, all patients receive exercise counseling. Physiological measures will be assessed to determine whether bariatric surgery and/or improved physical activity levels result in improved physical fitness.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Promoting Physical Activity Among Bariatric Surgery Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bariatric surgery leads to improvement or resolution of a variety of health conditions. It is also well established that physical activity, with or without weight loss, improves many health-related problems and can have a positive impact on mood. Therefore, physical activity may amplify the health and psychological benefits often experienced from bariatric surgery. Prior to surgery many patients are relatively inactive due to physical and social barriers associated with their weight. In addition, many patients find it difficult to adopt an active lifestyle after surgery, despite an increased capacity to exercise. However, weight loss is associated with physical activity after bariatric surgery. Nonetheless, little is known about the most effective means to promote activity among this group of individuals. This study will examine changes in physical activity and fitness after bariatric surgery and examine whether the addition of pedometer use and exercise counseling may lead to greater improvements.</detailed_description>
