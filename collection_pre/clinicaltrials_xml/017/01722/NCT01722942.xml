	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of the treatment using implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation to that of the treatment using amiodarone in the primary prevention of all-cause mortality in high-risk patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Amiodarone Against ICD Therapy in Chagas Cardiomyopathy for Primary Prevention of Death</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chagas disease is an endemic problem in Latin America, where millions of people are chronically infected by Trypanosoma cruzi. The disease has also recently become clinically and epidemiologically relevant in several other countries due to social factors related to individuals migration and globalization. Chagas cardiomyopathy occurs in 30%-50% of the infected individuals, leading to considerable morbidity and mortality rates. Sudden cardiac death is the major cause of death in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy. While implantable cardioverter defibrillator and treatment with amiodarone have been recommended and performed empirically for the secondary prevention in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy, no consistent scientific evidence exists on the role of these therapeutic strategies for the primary prevention of Sudden cardiac death in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy and high mortality risk. The main hypothesis of this study is that implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation is more efficient in the primary prevention of death in Chagas cardiomyopathy than drug therapy with amiodarone in patients with documented non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. We should point out that the death risk will be assessed using the Rassi risk score for death prediction validated based on non-invasive variables and, depending on the results of this study, it may guide the indication of implantable cardioverter defibrillator in Chagas cardiomyopathy.</detailed_description>
