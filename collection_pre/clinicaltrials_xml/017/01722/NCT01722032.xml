	<brief_summary>Background: Many unhealthy dietary and physical activity habits that foster the development of obesity are established by the age of five. Presently, approximately 70 percent of children in the United States are currently enrolled in early childcare facilities, making this an ideal setting to implement and evaluate childhood obesity prevention efforts. We describe here the methods for conducting an obesity prevention intervention randomized trial in the child care setting. Methods/Design: A randomized, controlled obesity prevention trial in 28 low-income, ethnically diverse child care centers located throughout Miami-Dade County, FL is currently being conducted over two years (2010-present) to test the efficacy of an intervention that poises teachers and parents as lifestyle change agents. The Healthy Caregivers-Healthy Children (HC2) program includes a curriculum focusing specifically on healthy food choices, increased exercise, and role modeling. The program targets food policy changes throughout the school, and via the child, caregiver, and teacher. Major outcome measures include child body mass index percentile and z score, fruit and vegetable and other nutritious food intake, and amount of physical activity. Discussion: Although few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life, this period may represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention. Findings from this investigation should inform both the fields of childhood obesity prevention and early childhood research about the effects of an obesity prevention program housed in the childcare setting. (H1) A child care center-based obesity prevention intervention program that includes a teacher and parent nutritional gatekeeper and role modeling program will be more effective in maintaining BMI in 3-5 year olds compared to a control group. (H2) Role modeling (teacher and parent) will be identified as a significant mediator in preventing obesity among intervention children versus controls. (H3) A child care center-based multi-level obesity prevention intervention program will improve child nutrition (increased consumption of fruits and vegetables, decreased consumption of sweetened beverages) and increase physical activity level compared to a control group.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Over one third of preschoolers were either overweight (18.4%) or obese (16.5%). The majority (92%) of caregivers of an overweight/obese child inaccurately perceived that their child was in a normal BMI category. Foreign-born caregivers were significantly more likely to inaccurately perceive their child's BMI percentile category, versus US-born caregivers (OR=0.65, 95% CI, 0.48-0.88). Specifically, those born in South America [OR=0.59. 95% CI, 0.36-0.98), Central America/Mexico (OR=0.59, 95% CI,0.41-0.85), and Caribbean Hispanic nations [OR=0.54, 95% CI 0.35-0.83) were significantly less likely to accurately perceive their child's BMI category, versus US-born caregivers. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that foreign-born parents of preschool-age overweight/obese children in particular do not accurately perceive their child's BMI status. Pediatricians and other healthcare providers serving foreign-born caregivers may consider additional healthy weight counseling for these families.</detailed_description>
