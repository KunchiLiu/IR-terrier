	<brief_title>Lead Registry for Optim Leads</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients are enrolled in the registry up to 180 days post implantation of an Optim lead. Patients with Optim™ ICD leads and Quicksite®/Quickflex®/Quickflex® µ/Quartet® LV leads are followed indefinitely following enrollment. Patients with other Optim leads are followed for a period of 60 months after Optim™ lead implantation. The follow-up plan for this registry is based on the established follow-up practices currently used by each of the respective registry centers. Patients are followed according to the center's standard follow-up schedule. At each office/clinic follow-up visit standard electrical measurements are collected. During system revision in a patient with either Optim™ ICD leads, Quicksite®, Quickflex®, Quickflex® µ or Quartet® LV lead, cinefluoroscopy (AP, LAO 45° or the best possible LAO view, RAO 45° or the best possible RAO view) should be performed at specific study sites. If cinefluoroscopy or chest X-ray is performed according to the site's standard of care then copies of those should be submitted.</detailed_description>
