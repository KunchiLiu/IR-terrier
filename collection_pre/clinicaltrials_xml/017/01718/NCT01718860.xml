	<brief_summary>The investigators evaluate the assumption that postoperative residual curarization is associated with impaired gas exchange upon post anesthesia care unit arrival and longer hospital length of stay. Additionally, the investigators also evaluate the assumption the use of neostigmine reversal of residual neuromuscular block is associated with an increased incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications and intensive care unit admission.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators' laboratory has recently identified the intraoperative use of intermediate-acting non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents and neostigmine reversal of neuromuscular blockade as independent risk factors for severe postoperative respiratory complications. Additionally, the investigators found that postoperative residual curarization (PORC), defined as a train-of-four ratio less than 0.90 upon postanesthesia care unit (PACU) arrival, is associated with an increased PACU length of stay. To examine the mechanisms contributing to the association of neuromuscular transmission failure with postoperative respiratory complications, the investigators aim to evaluate in a performance improvement driven initiative to better understand the association between the use of neuromuscular blocking agents and reversal agents with postoperative respiratory complications (see British Medical Journal 2012 Oct 15;345:e6329) if patients presenting with PORC develop subsequently 1) an increased incidence of postoperative impaired gas exchange upon PACU admission and result in 2) an increased hospital length of stay. In addition the investigators evaluated the effects of neostigmine on signs and symptoms of postoperative respiratory dysfunction and an incidence of unplanned postoperative intensive care unit admission.</detailed_description>
