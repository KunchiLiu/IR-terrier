	<brief_summary>Multiple overlapping drug-eluting coronary stents (DES) are usually needed to treat long coronary stenoses but this strategy is expensive and the response to overlapping DES has not been extensively studied. The recent availability of bioabsorbable polymer DES could allow treatment of long coronary stenoses without leaving gross burden of non-absorbable polymer in the vessel wall, even in case of overlapping stents. Thus we planned to evaluate which of the 2 strategies, namely using a single long biabsorbable DES or two shorter biabsorbable DES with minimal overlapping, is better in treating long coronary stenoses. The study is a spontanous randomized multicenter open-label study. A maximum of 300 patients with stable angina and at leat 1 coronary stenosis &gt;28mm and &lt;40mm of length will be randomized in 1:1 fashion by a Web-based electronic CRF. The long stent group (Group A) will be treated by a single 44mm Biomime DES (II generation DES with bioabsorbable polymer, Meril Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd., Gujarat, India). The short stent group (Group B) will be treated by 2 short Biomime DES positioned with minimal overlapping. The primary end-point of the study will be the 6 moth in-stent late lumen loss. Seconadry end-points will be 1, 6 and 12 month overall mortality, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization, stent thrombosis and MACE (combination of the 3 previous clinical end-points). Patients will be evaluated by 6-month control coronary angiography and late lumen loss in the stented vessel will be measured in a quantitative coronary angiography Core Lab (Cardioimaging Centre, Novara, Italy)</brief_summary>
