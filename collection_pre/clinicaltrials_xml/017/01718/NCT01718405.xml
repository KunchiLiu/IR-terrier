	<brief_summary>Studies have shown that an acute bout of aerobic exercise positively effects cognition, mainly executive functioning; however the effect is not observed among all people and it is not clear whether only aerobic exercise can produce this effect or possibly also resistant exercise. The main purpose of our study is to examine whether genetic variation is a moderator of this effect and whether resistant exercise is comparable to aerobic exercise in improving cognition following a single bout of exercise.</brief_summary>
