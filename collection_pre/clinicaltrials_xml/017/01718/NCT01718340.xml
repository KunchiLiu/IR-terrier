	<brief_summary>The prevalence of insulin resistance is increased in women with recurrent miscarriage compared with matched fertile controls,Insulin resistance (IR) in this syndrome is not only implicated toward early pregnancy loss (EPL) but also pathognomic for various obstetrical complications during pregnancy.An elevated free androgen index appears to be a prognostic factor for a subsequent miscarriage in women with recurrent miscarriage. There is insufficient evidence to evaluate the effect of metformin supplementation in pregnancy to prevent a miscarriage in women with recurrent miscarriage.</brief_summary>
