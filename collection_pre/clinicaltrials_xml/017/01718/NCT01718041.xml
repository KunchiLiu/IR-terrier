	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1b/2a study of VRS-317 (long-acting growth hormone) in pediatric patients with growth hormone deficiency. During Phase 1b, pediatric patients each will receive a single subcutaneous injection of VRS-317. During the Phase 2a stage, patients will receive 6 months of VRS-317 treatment at dose levels selected from the Phase 1b stage. The primary endpoints for the study are to determine the safety and efficacy of repeat dose VRS-317.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In Phase 1b, separate cohorts of patients will be tested in a single ascending dose format. Safety review committee meetings will take place prior to escalating to each increasing dose level. Enrolled patients will be monitored for 60 days for safety with PK/PD and safety labs collected. Two dose levels will be selected after completion of Phase 1b to be tested during Phase 2a (6 months of continuous VRS-317 treatment). Safety and PK assessments will be made during the Phase 2a stage. Patient heights will be measured by stadiometer.</detailed_description>
