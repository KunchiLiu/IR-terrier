	<brief_summary>For patients with non-resectable cholangiocarcinoma, gemcitabine with cisplatin is considered as the reference treatment in first line chemotherapy. However, the outcomes of these patients remain limited and therefore more effective drugs are warranted. The context of the disease and current data on sunitinib suggest that sunitinib may have activity in patients with advanced non resectable cholangiocarcinoma. Thereby, it is proposed to conduct an open label single arm trial aiming evidencing activity of sunitinib in such a patient population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Sunitinib in Patients With Advanced Cholangiocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective is to evaluate the overall survival of patients with advanced and unresectable cholangiocarcinoma treated continuously by sunitinib as second line at the dose of 37.5 mg per day, after one line of chemotherapy and to determine whether sunitinib deserves further studies in this indication. The secondary objectives are - To evaluate the criteria of efficacy - To evaluate the effects of sunitinib on tumor angiogenesis - To characterize the safety profile of sunitinib - To identify markers associated with response to sunitinib</detailed_description>

Male patients must be surgically sterile or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of therapy. The definition of effective contraception will be based on the judgment of the investigator or a designated associate 18. Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and followup schedule; those conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial 19. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory tests and other study procedures 20. Registration in a national health care system (CMU included). 1. Hilar cholangiocarcinomas, cholangiocarcinomas located in the gall bladder, hepatic capsule effraction, extrahepatic primary cholangiocarcinoma, carcinoma of the Water ampullum. 2. Prior treatment with other chemotherapy than gemcitabine and/or platinum. 3. Concomitant treatment with any chemotherapy, chemoembolization therapy, immunotherapy, antitumoral hormonotherapy or investigational anticancer agents.. 4. Prior treatment with any tyrosine kinase inhibitors or antiVEGF angiogenic inhibitors. 5. Diagnosis of any second malignancy within the last 5 years, except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri. 6.

Unstable systemic diseases including uncontrolled hypertension (&gt;150/100 mmHg despite optimal medical therapy) or active uncontrolled infections. 10. Drug having proarrhythmic potential (terfenadine, quinidine,procainamide, disopyramide, sotalol, probucol, bepridil, haloperidol, risperidone, indapamide and flecainide). 11.

Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and in the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.</criteria>
