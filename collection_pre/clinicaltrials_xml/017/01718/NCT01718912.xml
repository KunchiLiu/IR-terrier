	<brief_summary>Many physically handicapped patients at the dental department, Toronto Rehabilitation Institute(TRI) have considerable gingival inflammation and breath odour because of the inability to effectively handle a toothbrush. These patients have considerable periodontal disease. There is a concern that these pathogens may have a detrimental effect on wound healing in other areas of the body. Hypothesis: Patients attending the dental department at TRI that are treated with the antibiotic-antifungal rinse containing metronidazole and nystatin will show substantial decrease in periodontal disease as measured by bleeding points and pocket depth when compared to the group that continues to use their regular oral hygiene methods (control group).</brief_summary>
