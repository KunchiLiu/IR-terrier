	<brief_summary>During CPR bag-valve mask ventilation is difficult for basically skilled rescuers. Ventilation may be inefficient or with too high pressures result in stomach inflation and aspiration. Studies suggest that with a supraglottic airway device, such as the laryngeal tube, a basically skilled rescuer may ventilate more efficient and also safer. No prehospital study has been conducted comparing laryngeal tube and bag-valve mask ventilation during CPR. Thus, this study intends to compare ventilation with laryngeal tube and bag-valve mask performed by paramedics during CPR.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>During CPR bag-valve mask ventilation is difficult for basically skilled rescuers. Ventilation may be inefficient or with too high pressures result in stomach inflation and aspiration. Studies suggest that with a supraglottic airway device, such as the laryngeal tube, a basically skilled rescuer may ventilate more efficient and also safer. No prehospital study has been conducted comparing laryngeal tube and bag-valve mask ventilation during CPR. This study intends to compare ventilation with laryngeal tube and bag-valve mask performed by paramedics during CPR. This study may provide information if paramedics in an emergency should ventilate as they do traditionally with bag-valve mask ventilation or if they should ventilate with a laryngeal tube.</detailed_description>
