	<brief_summary>The current treatment methods of liver cirrhosis are limited ,including antiviral therapy,supportive therapy and liver transplantation. Antiviral therapy and Supportive therapy especially the regularly intravenous infusions of plasma or albumin are combined in the clinical classical therapy treatment. In the other hand,umbilical cord mesenchyma stem cell with self and directed differentiation capacity can effectively rescue experimental liver failure and contribute to liver regeneration, which suggests the feasibility of stem cell transplantation therapy. In this study, the safety and efficacy of umbilical cord mesenchyma stem cell transplantation through interventional procedures and classical therapy in patients liver cirrhosis will be evaluated and compared.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Difference in Efficacy Between Stem Cell Transplantation and Classical Therapy in Liver Cirrhosis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will includ two research centers, the number of patients in transplantation group will be 30, the number of patients in classical therapy group will be 30. All the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be same and the data analysis will be complete by the epidemiological commissioner.</detailed_description>
