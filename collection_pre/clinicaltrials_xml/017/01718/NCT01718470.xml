	<brief_summary>Extubation and emergence from anesthesia lead to systemic and cerebral hemodynamic changes that can cause cerebral edema and hemorrhage. The hemodynamic profile on emergence is more favorable if a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is inserted before neurosurgical patients emerge from anesthesia. We aimed to compare the impact of awakening neurosurgery patients after insertion of a ProSeal LMA to replace the endotracheal tube (ETT).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proseal Laryngeal Mask Airway or Endotracheal Tube for Emergence From Neuroanesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At the end of surgery, the anesthesiologist opened a sealed envelope labeled with software-generated randomized numbers to learn the patient's assignment to one of two groups to emerge from anesthesia with the ETT still in place or after it had been replaced by an LMA. Hemodynamic variables were recorded at 8 moments: baseline, in the operating room one minute before anesthetic induction; 5 minutes after the end of surgery before awakening (ETT group) or before tube replacement (LMA group); and 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 min after extubation or LMA removal (according to group assignment).</detailed_description>
