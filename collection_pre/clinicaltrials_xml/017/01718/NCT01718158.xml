	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with Pegylated Interferon Lambda-1a, given in combination with Ribavirin and Daclatasvir for 24 weeks, is as safe and effective as the standard treatment with Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2a + Ribavirin + Telaprevir in subjects who are infected with Chronic Hepatitis C virus genotype 1b and have never received any prior anti-HCV treatment, or who have relapsed after an initial, successful treatment with Pegylated Interferon Alfa + Ribavirin</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Evaluation of a Regimen Consisting of Peginterferon Lambda-1a + Ribavirin + Daclatasvir (Lambda + RBV + DCV) in HCV Genotype 1b Treatment naïve Patients or Prior Relapsers to Peginterferon Alfa + Ribavirin (Alfa + RBV) Therapy</brief_title>
