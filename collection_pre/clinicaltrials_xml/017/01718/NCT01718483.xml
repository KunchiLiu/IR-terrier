	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1. Subject is between 1855 years of age. 2. Subject meets the following DSMIVTR criteria for a diagnosis of BED: Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterized by both of the following: eating, in a discrete period of time (eg, within a 2hour period) an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat in a similar period of time under similar conditions, and a sense of lack of control over the eating (eg, a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating). The binge eating episodes are associated with at least 3 of the following: eating much more rapidly than normal; eating until uncomfortably full; eating large amounts of food when not feeling physically hungry; eating alone because of being embarrassed by how much one is eating; feeling disgusted with oneself, depressed, or feeling very guilty after overeating. Marked distress regarding binge eating. The binge eating occurs, on average, at least 2 days a week for 6 months. The episodes of binge eating do not occur exclusively during the course of bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa. 3. Subject's BED is of at least moderate severity with subjects reporting at least 3 binge eating days per week for the 14 days prior to the Baseline Visit (Visit 0) as documented in the subject's binge diary. A binge day is a day during which at least 1 binge eating episode occurs. 4. Female subjects must have a negative serum B HCG pregnancy test and a negative urine pregnancy test. Exclusion Criteria 1. Subject has concurrent symptoms of bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa. 2.

Subject is considered a suicide risk in the opinion of the investigator, has previously made a suicide attempt, or is currently demonstrating active suicidal ideation. Subjects with intermittent passive suicidal ideation are not necessarily excluded based on the assessment of the investigator. 6. Subject has known history of symptomatic cardiovascular disease, advanced arteriosclerosis, structural cardiac abnormality, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac problems. 7.
