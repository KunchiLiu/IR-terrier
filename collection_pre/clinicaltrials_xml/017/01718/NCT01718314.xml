	<brief_summary>Hysteroscopy is an instrument to visualize the interior walls of uterus (womb) and it enables the doctor to do minor operative procedures. Although it causes little discomfort, sometimes it may be disturbing for the patient. This pain is usually perceived during the passage of the instrument through the cervix (neck of the womb). The investigators would like to minimize this pain by two drugs: Misoprotol and lidocaine</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Sublingual Misoprostol Versus Lidocaine Spray for Hysteroscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Outpatient or office hysteroscopy has become the 'gold standard' for the investigation of the intrauterine abnormalities. This minimal invasive modality provides brilliant and clear visualization of the entire uterine cavity and besides this, by the operative channel, minor procedures may easily be performed in the office setting which is priceless for the gynecologist. However, pain related to the procedure may make the procedure uncomfortable for the patient and the physician. Together with the operative time, hysteroscope diameter is considered as the main factor influencing pain. The pain perceived during hysteroscopy may be reduced by using a smaller diameter hysteroscope or by using anesthesia, which decreases pain perception. In this prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study, we aim to compare the effectiveness of sublingual misoprostol versus lidocaine pump spray for pain relief during office hysteroscopy.</detailed_description>
