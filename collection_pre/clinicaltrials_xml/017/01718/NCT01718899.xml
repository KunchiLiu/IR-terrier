	<brief_title>Phase 1/2a Study of Cancer Vaccine to Treat Smoldering Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a dose escalation, phase 1/2a study to assess the safety and tolerability of PVX-410, (a multi-peptide cancer vaccine), treatment regimen in patients with smoldering multiple myeloma as a single agent and in combination with lenalidomide.. Approximately 22 patients will receive six (6) bi-weekly, subcutaneous injections of PVX-410 for a total of twelve (12) weeks of treatment. Safety will be monitored throughout the study. Tolerability, immunogenicity and clinical response will also be measured as described in the protocol.</detailed_description>

Patient has abnormal cardiac status, evidenced by any of the following: New York Heart Association (NYHA) stage III or IV congestive heart failure (CHF). Myocardial infarction within the previous 6 months. Symptomatic cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment or persisting despite treatment. Patient is receiving any other investigational agent. Patient has a current active infectious disease or positive serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or hepatitis B virus (HBV). Patient has a history of or current autoimmune disease. Patient has been vaccinated with live attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks before study vaccination.</criteria>
