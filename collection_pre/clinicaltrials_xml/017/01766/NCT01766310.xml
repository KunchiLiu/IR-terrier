	<brief_title>Effect of Folic Acid Supplementation on Plasma Homocysteine Level in Obese Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atherosclerosis is common &amp; remains a significant clinical problem because of leading to myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular death. Many studies founded hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for those cardiovascular diseases which take responsible for about 10% of total cardiovascular disease risk. Reduction of elevated plasma homocysteine may prevent up to 25% of cardiovascular events. One of modifiable cause of hyperhomocysteinemia is prevention of vitamin deficiency, especially folate deficiency. Obese Thai children are probable risk for folate deficiency due to low dietary folate intake and low serum folate level from unbalanced diet (low vegetables intake &amp; high fat diet) and high prevalence of thalassemia. Moreover obese children are also at risk of atherosclerosis. However, no data have been reported about effect of folic acid supplementation on homocysteine level in these patients.</detailed_description>
