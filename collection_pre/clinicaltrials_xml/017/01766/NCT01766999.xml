	<brief_summary>Tumescent local anesthesia is a procedure which is frequently performed for plastic cosmetic surgical procedures such as liposuction. The subcutaneous adipose tissue is infiltrated with large volumes of a solution which also contain local anesthetics. However local anesthetics, can also lead to a marked production of methemoglobin. New generation pulse oximeters are able to measure SpMetHb non-invasivly. The aim of this study is: 1. to investigate multi-wavelength pulse oximetry as a monitoring method for patients at increased risk for methemoglobinemia. 2. to illustrate MetHb concentrations over a course of 24 hours after a liposuction employing tumescent anesthesia has been carried out.</brief_summary>
