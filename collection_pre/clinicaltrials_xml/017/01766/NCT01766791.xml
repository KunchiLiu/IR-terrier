	<brief_summary>A plethora of trials reported the positive effect of resistance exercise on functional and morphological parameters. Although a large amount of the studies used suboptimum devices and obsolete methods the results of these older studies were still considered as golden standard. The aim of the present study is thus to determine the proper effect of different resistance exercise protocols with and without adjuvant protein supplementation on functional and morphological muscle and body composition parameters in male untrained subjects 30-50 years old under special regard of modern medical imaging and segmentation technologies. Our general study hypothesis is that HIT-resistance exercise significantly impact relevant muscular parameters of the upper leg.</brief_summary>
