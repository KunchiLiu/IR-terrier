	<brief_summary>This is an experimental research study for pregnant women between 23 and 37 weeks age of gestation who will be having a baby sooner than term. This study is to learn if waiting 20, 40, or 60 seconds to clamp the umbilical cord after baby delivers will improve his/her outcome and overall health. Benefit to the baby may come by increasing the amount of blood in the baby's body, reducing the need for possible transfusion later, and possible prevention of other complications caused by too little blood in the baby. Possible reduction of cerebral palsy may be realized by a longer interval for cord clamping.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimal Timing of Cord Clamping in Preterm Pregnancy Following Vaginal or Cesarean Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intention is to enroll every preterm delivery into this trial containing six groups of patients, vaginal or cesarean delivery with clamping of the cord at 20, 40 or 60 seconds. Expectation is 1500 deliveries over 2 year period of time. Randomization upon entry to L&amp;D unit. Removal from study if resuscitation deemed urgent by newborn staff. Strong effort to keep newborn warm using appropriate measures. Evaluation to determine if there are differences in transfusion, anemia, time to onset of spontaneous respiration, occurence of IVH or CP.</detailed_description>
