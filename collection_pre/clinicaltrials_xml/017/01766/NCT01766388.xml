	<brief_title>Mifepristone and Misoprostol for Mid-trimester Termination of Pregnancy in Armenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women who were deemed eligible for the study by the provider gave informed consent. They took 200 mg of mifepristone orally at the study clinic. In 24-44 hours, they returned to the clinic for induction with misoprostol. They were admitted as inpatients at the clinic and took 400 mcg of buccal misoprostol every 3 hours until the fetus and placenta were expelled. If there was no full expulsion after 10 doses of misoprostol, the provider used their discretion to determine the appropriate clinical course of action. After responding to questions about their experience with the procedure, women were discharged from the study.</detailed_description>
