	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to measure the beneficial effects of an optimized berries extracts on diabetes and cardiovascular diseases prevention. Our hypothesis is that including a polyphenol rich berries extract in daily feeding will improve insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, pancreatic β-cells function, lipids and inflammatory profile, and oxidative stress markers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Beneficial Effects of a Polyphenol Enriched Beverage on Type 2 Diabetes Prevention and on Cardiovascular Risk Profile of Men and Women With Insulin Resistance.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes is an up rising disease that makes it a major public health problem. While 221 millions cases were estimated in 2010, the prevalence would be 366 millions in 2030. It is well recognized that regular consumption of fruits and vegetables can lower the incidence of chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and inflammatory diseases. Recently, Drs Desjardins, Abrams and Marette's research team discovered a high amount of a sesquiterpene in berries. This molecule is recognized for its ability to improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, and to lower pro-inflammatory profile of obese mice. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of a polyphenol rich berries extract mix on insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, pancreatic β-cells function, lipids and inflammatory profile, and oxidative stress markers, on human obese subjects that have insulin resistance.</detailed_description>
