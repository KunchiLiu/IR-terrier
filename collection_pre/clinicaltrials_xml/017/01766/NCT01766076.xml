	<brief_title>Atorvastatin for HAART Suboptimal Responders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators have previously shown that up to 40% of HAART-treated adults have suboptimal CD4 recovery despite viral suppression. The investigators have also shown that immune activation and exhaustion are significantly higher among patients that do not exhibit satisfactory rise in CD4 counts despite viral suppression (suboptimal responders); when compared with their counterparts with viral suppression and satifactory CD4 count recovery (optimal responders). Given that atorvastatin changes immune activation in this pilot study, then larger studies can be done to understand its effect on CD4 count increase among suboptimal responders.</detailed_description>
