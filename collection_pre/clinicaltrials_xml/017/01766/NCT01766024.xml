	<brief_summary>This is a randomized double-blind crossover study of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and tolerability of BCD-033 (interferon beta-1a manufactured by CJSC BIOCAD, Russia) and Rebif® (Merck Serono S.p.A.., Italy) in healthy volunteers. The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and tolerability parameters after single subcutaneous injection. Each dtug will be administered to each volunteer at a dose of 44 µg as a single subcutaneous injection with an interval of at least 14 days.</brief_summary>

This criterion is not applicable to patients who underwent surgical sterilization. Reliable contraceptive measures include one barrier method in combination with one of the following methods: spermicides, intrauterine device or oral contraceptives used by participant's partner; Consent to avoid alcohol intake within 24 hours before and 8 days after each administration of the test or reference drugs; Consent to avoid grapefruit juice (or other products containing grapefruit) intake within 72 hours before and 8 days after each administration of the study or reference drugs. Previous use of IFNβ1containing medications at any time before inclusion; History of serious allergic reactions (anaphylaxis or multiple allergy); Known allergy or intolerance to interferons or any other components of study or reference drugs; Major surgery within 30 days before screening; Impossibility to install venous catheter for blood sampling (e.g. because of skin disorders at the sites of venipuncture); Diseases or other conditions that can interfere with the investigational drugs pharmacokinetics (e.g. chronic liver, kidney, blood, circulatory system, lung or neuroendocrine diseases, including diabetes mellitus and others); History of epileptic seizures; Regular oral or parenteral use of any medications including overthecounter drugs, vitamins and nutritional additives within less than 2 weeks before inclusion in the study; Intake of medications, including overthecounter drugs and biologically active additives that can influence hemodynamics, liver function etc. (barbiturates, omeprazole, cimetidine etc.) within less than 30 days before inclusion in the study; Intake of medications that influence immune status (cytokines and their inductors, glucocorticoids etc.) within less than 30 days before participation in the study; Smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day; Subjects who consume more than 10 units of alcohol per week or who have history of alcohol abuse or evidence of drug/chemical abuse (one unit of alcohol equals ½ l [500 ml] of beer, one glass [200 ml] of wine or l shot glass [50 ml] of spirits); Donation of 450 ml and more of blood or plasma within 2 months before inclusion in the study; Participation in other clinical studies within less than 1 month before inclusion in the study or simultaneous participation in another clinical study; Previous participation in this study</criteria>
