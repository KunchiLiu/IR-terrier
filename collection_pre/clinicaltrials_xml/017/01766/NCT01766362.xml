	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to show that PRPC performed in a single session using a Pascal laser leads to better management of the disease (better rate of regression of neovessels, lower risk of a loss of visual acuity in the long term related to macular edema), a saving of time and better comfort for both patient and doctor.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diabetes type 1 or 2 Subjects with severe nonproliferative or early proliferative diabetic retinopathy (according to the Alfediam classification) Subjects with central macular thickness less than or equal to 350 µm according to spetralis OCT Subjects registered with a social security agency Subjects who have provided written informed consent Subjects aged 18 or above Pregnancy Breastfeeding women Patients presenting a contraindication to Mydriaticum and Neosynephrine History of glaucoma or noncontrolled ocular hypertension Blindness in one eye History of renal insufficiency requiring dialysis, or kidney or pancreas transplantation Unbalanced diabetes requiring, in the previous 4 months, intensive insulin therapy. Central macular thickness greater than 350 µm Visual acuity less than 20/32 measured using an ETDRS chart Proliferative diabetic retinopathy associated with "high risk factors" (extensive prepapillary neovessels and/or preretinal or prepapillary neovessels associated with preretinal of intravitreal hemorrhage) Macular edema due to causes other than diabetic retinopathy (venous occlusion, uveitis) or occurring in a context of vitreomacular traction Already started PRPC History of eye surgery or YAG laser capsulotomy performed during the preceding 6 months Subjects under legal supervision or guardianship</criteria>
