	<brief_summary>South Asians have one of the highest rates of heart disease of all populations and a unique and deleterious obesity phenotype of increased body fat and inner-abdominal compared to those of European background. We have subsequently identified that this unique phenotype accounts for much of the increased heart disease risk in South Asians, with the greater amounts of inner abdominal fat being particularly implicated. In addition, South Asians in Canada have substantially lower levels of leisure-time physical activity. At present, we do not know the answers to the following questions: 1. Is a conventional (standard) physical activity program that has proven effective at reducing inner abdominal fat and heart disease risk factors in populations of European background be effective in South Asians? 2. Is an alternative physical activity program commonly practiced by South Asians (such as bhangra dance) be effective at reducing inner abdominal fat and heart disease risk factors in South Asians? In this study, we will perform a randomized controlled trial of three conditionsâ€”gym-based standard exercise program (SE),bhangra dance exercise program (BE) and non-exercise control (NE).We will recruit 75 post-menopausal South Asian women with abdominal obesity and assign them randomly to one of the three groups (25 per group). We anticipate that both the SE and BE programs will be superior to the NE group in terms of reducing VAT and CVD risk factors. Such findings will demonstrate that exercise is an effective method that favourably modifies the obesity phenotype of excess VAT in South Asians, and should be central to health promotion and disease prevention strategies.</brief_summary>
