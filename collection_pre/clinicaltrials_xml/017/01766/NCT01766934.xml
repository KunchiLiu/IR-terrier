	<brief_title>Non-interventional, Long-term Safety Data Collection of Zarzio速 / Filgrastim HEXAL速 in Stem Cell Donors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a prospective, non-interventional long term data collection study. Adult healthy unrelated stem cell donors receiving Sandoz' filgrastim according to the stem cell mobilization protocols of the respective apheresis centers will be monitored for safety and efficacy during the mobilization period, and a systematic safety data follow-up will be implemented for up to 10 years after mobilization.</detailed_description>
