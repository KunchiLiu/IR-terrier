The principal objective is to seek in subjects who have undergone cerebral MRI and echocardiography, associations between the thickness of postganglionic fibers measured by Optical Coherence Tomography at the 7th year (n=1500) and signs of cerebral impairment (psycho-cognitive tests, circulation time, MRI signs). This association will be studied after taking into account the principal environmental (particularly dietary) and genetic risk factors.</brief_summary>
