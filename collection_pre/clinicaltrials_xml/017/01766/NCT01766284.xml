	<brief_summary>Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a technology using harmless near infra-red light scatter to produce an image. Prior studies with OCT have demonstrated that OCT of the uterine cervix can differentiate between grades of pre-invasive and invasive cervical disease and cancer. This study will evaluate the ability of the NIRIS 1300e imaging (OCT) system to detect pre-invasive cervical disease and cervical cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Diagnostic Efficacy of "Real Time" Niris 1300e Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) Imaging System in the Management of Pre-invasive and Invasive Neoplasia of the Uterine Cervix</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>B. Specific Aims 1. Primary. To determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for Niris 1300e OCT enhanced gynecologic examination (VIA-OCT vs.colposcopy-biopsy) for the detection of lesions equal or greater than cervical intraepithelial neoplasia II (CIN II) and cancer in a "real time" clinical evaluation. 2. Secondary. To examine the ease of use of Niris 1300e OCT in a real time clinical setting in order to assess its potential application during a "see and treat" or "single episode of care" clinic visit.</detailed_description>
