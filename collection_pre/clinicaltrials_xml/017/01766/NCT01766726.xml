	<brief_summary>The main aims of this study are to determine whether: a) ART-naïve HIV+ subjects have increased artherosclerotic plaque inflammation/vulnerability, b) newly-initiated QUAD/Stribild therapy will decrease plaque inflammation/vulnerability in these subjects, and c) QUAD/Stribild therapy will improve indices of immune dysregulation and lipid dysfunction as a mechanism of improved plaque inflammation/vulnerability. Parameters of lipid and immune function will also be assessed in healthy control subjects, for comparison.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Newly-Initiated QUAD Therapy on Aortic/Coronary Inflammation in ART-Naïve Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with HIV are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease than healthy subjects. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has greatly increased the lifespan of HIV+ patients, but their risk of CVD remains higher than normal. Previously, it has been shown that compared to healthy control subjects, ART-treated HIV+ patients have more atherosclerotic plaque inflammation in the aorta. This study is intended to determine whether atherosclerotic plaque inflammation/vulnerability is increased in ART-naïve HIV+ patients and whether these parameters can be improved through 6 months of newly-initiated QUAD/Stribild therapy. Additionally, the study will determine whether indices of immune dysregulation and lipid dysfunction are increased in ART-naive HIV+ patients and whether these parameters can also be improved through 6 months of newly initiated QUAD/Stribild therapy.</detailed_description>
