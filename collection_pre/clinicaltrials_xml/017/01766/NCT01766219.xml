	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid in treating patients with advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma that cannot be removed by surgery. 6,8-Bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid may stop the growth of cholangiocarcinoma by blocking blood flow to the tumor</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CPI-613 in Treating Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Bile Duct Cancer That Cannot Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of CPI-613 (6,8-bis[benzylthio]octanoic acid) in patients with advanced unresectable cholangiocarcinoma who have failed available therapies. OUTLINE: Pre-cycle: Patients receive 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1-5, 1 week prior to course 1. Patients receive 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 4 of weeks 1-3. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients responding to treatment may receive up to 4 more courses of treatment. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up bimonthly.</detailed_description>
