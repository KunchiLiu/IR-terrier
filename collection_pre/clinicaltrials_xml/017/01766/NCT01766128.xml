Demographic data, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), modified Hoehn&amp;Yahr and modified Schwab&amp;England activities of daily living scale will be determined and registered for each patient. Patients of group A will be treated by zonisamide 50mg/d for 12 months and the other group will be treated by placebo for the same time.
