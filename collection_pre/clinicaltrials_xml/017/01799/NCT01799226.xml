	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the anti-inflammatory effects of Colgate Total® during an experimental gingivitis model developed by Löe et al. Half of the participants will use Colgate Total® (which contains triclosan), while the other half will use a toothpaste which does not contain triclosan as the control.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Colgate Total® During an Experimental Gingivitis Model</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a double-blind. Subjects will be randomly assigned to the test or control dentifrice arm. Enrolled subjects will also be randomly assigned to either right or left side mandibular stent. During the induction phase (i.e., day 0 to day 21), participants are instructed to refrain from all hygiene procedures in the stent area. During this time period, participants evenly distributed 2mL of their assigned dentifrice into their stent, allowing it to come into contact with the areas of experimental gingivitis for two minutes twice daily while traditional tooth brushing was performed in the non-stent areas. Clinical measures, saliva, gingival crevicular fluid and plaque samples will be collected at days 0, 14, 21, and 35 study visits. A randomization chart will be used to identify which two sites (teeth and tooth surface) will be used at the specific study visit for collection of gingival crevicular fluid(GCF) and plaque.</detailed_description>
