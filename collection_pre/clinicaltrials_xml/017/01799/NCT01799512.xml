	<brief_summary>Stress hyperglycemia occurs in 50-85% of patients admitted to a medical intensive care unit (MICU) and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. However, randomized controlled trials examining the effects of strict glycemic control demonstrated conflicting results. A common finding in these trials was the high risk of hypoglycaemia. This randomized controlled trial evaluates the impact of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RT-CGM) on glycemic control and risk of hypoglycemia in severely ill MICU patients with an APACHE-II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) score ≥20.</brief_summary>
