	<brief_summary>Geographic atrophy (GA) causes the loss of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells in broad areas of the retina. The application of subthreshold micropulse laser spots in healthy RPE in the vicinity of the area of GA may restore the imbalance in survival factors caused by the disease (ie, the laser may decrease vascular endothelial growth factor and RPE-derived transforming growth factor beta, upregulation of pigment epithelium-derived factor). This may slow or even stop the enlargement of atrophy secondary to GA, and therefore, avoid further vision loss.</brief_summary>
