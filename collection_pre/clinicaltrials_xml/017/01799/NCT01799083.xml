	<criteria>Solid Tumor Histologically confirmed advanced solid tumor 1 to 3 prior treatment regimens At least one site of radiographically measurable disease of ≥ 2 cm in the largest dimension by traditional computerized tomography (CT) scanning technique or ≥ 1 cm in the largest dimension by spiral CT scanning (per RECIST criteria); or if, in the Principal Investigator's opinion, evaluable disease can be reliably and consistently followed, the subject may be eligible upon approval by the Medical Monitor B Cell Lymphoma Histologically or cytologically confirmed B Cell Lymphoma. Patients must have had an initial diagnosis of B Cell NHL (including follicular, small lymphocytic, lymphoplasmacytoid, and marginal zone lymphoma), indolent disease that transformed to a more aggressive subtype, as previously described or patients may have mantle cell lymphoma. Patients are required to have received prior chemotherapy (alone or combined with rituximab or other treatment) and are considered refractory to (defined as no response, or progression within 6 months of completing therapy) or intolerant of continued rituximab or other treatment. Patients may have received up to a maximum of four prior unique chemotherapy regimens, including if not contraindicated autologous stemcell transplantation (ASCT). For patients to enroll in the expanded dose group for lymphoma, patients must have measurable disease Disease Related Chemotherapy with approved or investigational anticancer therapeutics, including steroid therapy, within 3 weeks prior to first dose or 6 weeks for antibody therapy Radiation therapy or immunotherapy within 3 weeks prior to first dose (except for antibody therapy, where 6 weeks is required); localized radiation therapy within 1 week prior to first dose Subjects with prior brain metastases are permitted, but must have completed treatment and have no evidence of active central nervous system (CNS) disease for at least 4 weeks prior to first dose For lymphoma patients; patients with prior stem cell transplant therapy (autologous SCT within the prior 8 weeks; allogeneic SCT within the prior 16 weeks). Patients with prior allogeneic SCT should not have evidence of moderatetosevere GVHD. Participation in an investigational therapeutic study within 3 weeks prior to first dose Prior treatment with decitabine Concurrent Conditions Major surgery within 3 weeks prior to first dose Congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association class III to IV), symptomatic ischemia, conduction abnormalities uncontrolled by conventional intervention, or myocardial infarction within 3 months prior to first dose Acute active infection requiring systemic antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals within 2 weeks prior to first dose Known or suspected HIV infection or subjects who are HIV seropositive Active hepatitis A, B, or C infection Significant neuropathy (Grade 3, Grade 4, or Grade 2 with pain) at the time of the first dose Ethical / Other Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating Any clinically significant psychiatric or medical condition that in the opinion of the Investigator could interfere with protocol adherence or a subject's ability to give informed consent</criteria>
