	<brief_title>Continuous Treatment Study of Topiramate in Migraine Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multicenter (conducted in more than one center), dose-titration (dose escalation/reduction) study of topiramate in participants with migraine. This study is a continuous study for the participants who were enrolled in the JNS019-JPN-02 study. Participants who completed the JNS019-JPN-02 study will receive treatment for 52 weeks starting at Visit 4 of the JNS019-JPN-02 study. The present study will consist of 3 weeks of Transfer period (during this period the dose titration will take place and along with dose titration the new treatment will be initiated at 25 milligram per day [25mg/day]), Continuous treatment period (32 weeks), Exit period (up to 3 weeks) and Follow-up period (4 weeks). Participants in the Continuous treatment period will receive topiramate tablets orally in the dose range of 50 mg/day to 100 mg/day. Dose can be increased or decreased as per Investigator's discretion. The maximum daily dose will be 200 mg/day. Efficacy will be primarily evaluated by change from Baseline in the number of monthly migraine attacks in Continuous treatment period. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
