	<detailed_description>Relations between infant and vulnerable first time's mothers - Does video guidance with the Marte Meo method promote the process? Intervention study in a community setting Background Infants develop their mentality, social and psychologically competencies in relations with parents and sensitive and responsive caregiving is important for infant's healthy development. Maternal responsiveness defined as the mother's ability to recognise infant's cues and act on those is a key to promote a secure child. At risk are unsecure/uncertain mothers, postpartum depressed mothers, mothers with preterm children and infants who in the perspective of the mother cries persistent and/or does not sleep well. Danish public health nurses do home-visiting parents and they have opportunity to support parents in the development of relations to the infants. Some nurse's uses video-guidance with the Marte Meo method to promote the development of a healthy parent-infant relations, but knowledge about the effect of parent's having received video-guidance with the method is lacking. Study part 1 Aim: To develop a screening tool to help public health nurses to identify unsecure mothers. Design: Intervention Mapping step 1. Need assessment and development of few questions as a screening tool. Test of questions by face and content validation. Study part 2 Develop a standardised preventive program step 2-4 in Intervention Mapping. The intervention is done by public health nurses, in home visits to first times mothers in the period from the child 2 to 6 months aged. The intervention includes 2-5 home visits with video-guidance's and has focus on the mother's ability to recognise infant's cues and act on those.
