	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the potential benefit of enhancing knee surgery for cartilage injury using some of the patient's own cells, taken from fat tissue, that may be able to help cartilage to regenerate.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of Cell Therapy to Enhance Arthroscopic Knee Cartilage Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participation in this study will allow the surgical team to remove a small amount of fat (20 to 30 ml, or between 1 and 2 tablespoons) from just below the skin in the belly region that will be processed to remove regenerative cells, which will then inserted into the knee to the damaged cartilage. These cells may encourage healing at the surgical site, although whether or how much they encourage healing is unknown. Determining whether such improved healing occurs is the purpose of this study. Some patients will have the fat removed and cells inserted in their knee, and other patients will not have the fat removed or cells inserted. To which group patients are assigned is determined by a random process, similar to flipping a coin. The surgery is the same in all other ways for all patients. Participation will require attending regularly scheduled postoperative visits, having 3 MRI tests, and answering a short survey. No additional visits other beyond those normally scheduled for postsurgical care are required.</detailed_description>
