	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to identify prognostic factors and to develop predictive models of risk of febrile neutropenia and neutropenia grade 3/4 in patients with solid tumors receiving chemotherapy with schemas that have an inherent risk of febrile neutropenia of 10-20%.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male or female &gt; 18 years Histologically confirmed solid tumor. Subjects who have not received chemotherapy and / or radiotherapy in the last 3 months. Subject to initiate a chemotherapy (ie, cycle 1, day 1) The chemotherapy regimen should have an inherent risk of febrile neutropenia of 1020%. Planning a minimum of 3 cycles chemotherapy. Adequate bone marrow reserve defined by: leukocytes ≥ 3,000 / mm3, platelets ≥ 100.000/mm3; neutrophils ≥ 1,500 / mm3. Adequate hepatic and renal function, defined by: bilirubin &lt;1.5 times the normal value, ALT and AST &lt;3 times the normal range (both can be elevated up to 5 times the normal value in patients with known liver metastases); creatinine &lt;1.5 times upper normal value ECOG ≤ 2. Informed consent Patients under treatment with an investigational treatment. Active infection in the last 72 h before starting chemotherapy. Indication of chemotherapy dose intensity or chemotherapy included in the risk rating of febrile neutropenia &lt;10% or &gt;20%. Patients with concomitant chemoradiotherapy. Patients being treated with biological drugs in monotherapy. Any other condition causing neutropenia. History of bone marrow transplant or stem cells.</criteria>
