	<brief_summary>Cirrhosis is associated with a reduction in muscle mass and exercise capacity. This has an impact or morbidity and mortality. Regular aerobic exercise training is a proven effective therapy to improve exercise capacity in healthy and clinical populations. the effect of this training has not yet been evaluated in cirrhosis. The safety of this intervention also requires further study. Using a randomized controlled design, the investigators aim to conduct a pilot study evaluating the safety and efficacy of eight weeks of aerobic exercise training on aerobic capacity.</brief_summary>
