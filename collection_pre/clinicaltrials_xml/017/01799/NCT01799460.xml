	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to analysis the different genotype in the idiopathic membranous nephropathy patients which with different therapeutic outcomes after treated by the Comprehensive Treatment Regimen or immunosuppressive agents, and so as to looking for ideal markers to assess appropriate treatment approach and the long-term efficacy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study on Single-nucleotide-polymorphism in Idiopathic Membranous Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to looking for the gene level predictors in the patients who suffered from idiopathic membranous nephropathy. And according to the predictors, the clinicians could make a decision which method should be taken on IMN patients, Traditional Chinese Medicine or western medicine, and could get better results.</detailed_description>
