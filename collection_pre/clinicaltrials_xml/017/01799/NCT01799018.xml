	<criteria>Non traumatic SAH documented by CT scan Patient with SAH who would need external ventricular drain (EVD) for the management of hydrocephalus Patients with normal pressure Hydrocephalus that require an external drain Control (non hemorrhagic) group CSF collected from patients with posterior fossa tumor or stroke with EVD in place for the management of hydrocephalus. Recent infection within last 1 month of presentation can increase inflammatory markers Recent surgery or acute myocardial infarction within last 1 month of presentation Age &gt; 89 years or &lt; 18 years</criteria>
