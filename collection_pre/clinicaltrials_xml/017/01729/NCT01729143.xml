	<brief_summary>As obesity rates worldwide continue to increase, there is a focus on identifying active food ingredients which increase metabolic rate which can be used as a dietary supplement in the treatment of overweight and obesity. Promising animal and cell studies have suggested a role for black pepper and an active component of black pepper, piperine, in energy expenditure. However, the effects of black pepper have not been determined in humans. The investigators hypothesis if that consumption of 1.5g black pepper (0.5g in each of three meals over one day) will result in an elevation in 24-h resting energy expenditure when contrasted to a control day (no black pepper, same diet intake).</brief_summary>
