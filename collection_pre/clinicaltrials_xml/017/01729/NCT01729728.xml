	<brief_summary>To find out if a drug called tapentadol administered by mouth safely relieves pain in children. Look at the amount of tapentadol in the blood after a single oral dose. Tapentadol oral solution for children is still being tested and is not yet registered. Tapentadol tablets are effective in treating both acute and chronic pain in adults. This trial will help to understand how tapentadol oral solution works in children.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic, Efficacy and Safety Study of Tapentadol Oral Solution in Children With Postoperative Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The lower age limit for the clinical trial was initially set to 3 years of age in the protocol. The trial planned for the inclusion of participants in three age categories. Age 3 to less than 6 years (young children), age 6 to less than 12 years (older children) and age 12 to less than 18 years of age (adolescents). There was a request by the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) at the European Medicines Agency to include participants 2 years of age (very young children). The protocol amendment thus planned to combine the two youngest age groups into a single reporting group. The protocol amendment only planned that the very young children group would have separate analysis for the Faces Pain Scale Revised (FPS-R) Scale and for the presentation of the serum concentrations, because the pharmacokinetic sampling scheme used in the 2 year old participants was different from the young children group (aged 3 to less than 6 years).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A maximum body weight of 85.0 kg. A minimum body weight of 10 kg for participants aged 2 years to less than 3 years old. If female and postmenarchal, or 12 years or older, the subject has a negative urine pregnancy test within 24 hours before surgery. Having completed either dental surgery or tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy surgery (age group: 6 to less than 18 years of age). Having completed ear, nose, or throat surgery (including but not limited to tonsillectomy (age group: 2 to less than 3 years of age). Participant aged 6 to less than 18 years has a postoperative pain intensity score greater than or equal to 4 on the Color Analog Scale (CAS) as a result of the surgical procedure or the participant has a pain level that the usual standard of care following the surgical procedure (which reliably produces moderate to severe pain) requires opioid treatment. Participant aged 2 years to less than 6 years has a pain level following a surgical procedure that reliably produces moderate to severe pain, for which the usual standard of care requires opioid treatment. Participant is alert, orientated, and able to follow commands and complete the postoperative required procedures. History of brain injury. Clinically relevant abnormal ECG. Clinically unstable vital signs and/or a saturation of oxygen saturation (SpO2) less than 93%. During surgery SpO2 may decrease &lt;93%. Clinically relevant abnormal values for clinical chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis at enrollment. Body temperature above 38.5Â°C within 48 hours prior to dosing. Positive drugs of abuse test result.</criteria>
