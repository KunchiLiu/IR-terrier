	<detailed_description>Our prospective research is carried out in one of the stem cell therapy centers in Egypt where 140 hepatitis C virus infected patients attending for stem cell therapy are enrolled in our study and the patients will be followed up after stem cell therapy where the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma after stem cell therapy will be calculated , another group of hepatitis C virus infected patients attending to Kasr El Aini university hospital to receive the standered line of care as indicated will be enrolled in our study and will be followed up , where the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma will be calculated and compared to the previous group , to determine if there is a significant difference between both groups regarding the incidence of hepatocellular and determine whether stem cell therapy affecets the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in hepatitis C virus infected patients.</detailed_description>
