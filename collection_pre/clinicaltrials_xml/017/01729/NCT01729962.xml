The secondary purpose is to evaluate any adverse events that occur during the clinical study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Study of the Optical Biometer for Measurements of the Eye</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective clinical study to be conducted at a single clinical site located in the United States. This study will assess the agreement of an investigational device to the predicate device and an ultrasound reference device and the precision of the investigational device with a comparison to the precision of the predicate. Any adverse events associated with the investigational device can or the predicate device will be assessed.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subjects who can follow the instructions by the Principal/Clinical Investigator or clinical staff at the clinical site, and can visit on scheduled examination dates. 2. Subjects who sign an informed consent form to participate in the clinical trial. 3. Subjects who agree to take the qualifying eye examination and a series of devices measurements. 4. Subjects able to fixate on a target. 5. Subjects must meet at lease one of the following criteria: Normal eyes: Subjects with a natural lens without a cataract, corneal abnormalities or prior keratorefractive surgery. Eyes with Cataracts: Subjects with a preexisting cataract without corneal abnormalities or prior keratorefractive surgery. Eyes without a Natural Lens: Subjects that are pseudophakic or aphakic without corneal abnormalities or prior keratorefractive surgery. Eyes with Corneal Abnormality: Subjects with a corneal abnormality and a natural lens without a cataract, or Subjects post keratorefractive surgery and a natural lens without a cataract. 1. Pregnancy. 2. Any eye condition preventing use of any of the instruments used in the study. 3. Any eye condition which might impair the validity of results from any of the instruments used in the study. 4. Any medical condition, which, in the Investigator's judgment, interferes with the subject's ability to comply with the protocol, compromises subject safety, or interferes with the interpretation of the study results.</criteria>
