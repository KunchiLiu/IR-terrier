	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate that changes in plasma levels of circulating neurohormones (mainly BNP and NT-proBNP), measured at rest and post-exercise correlate with exercise functional limitation (assessed by exercise peak VO2) and exercise ultrasonic parameters (as left ventricular filling, obstruction, and mitral regurgitation)</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The secondary purposes are to study the kinetics of secretions of natriuretic peptides, and their relationships with extent of MRI myocardial fibrosis with the degree of exercise functional limitation.</detailed_description>
