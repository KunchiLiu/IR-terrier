	<brief_title>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in Treating Anxiety in Patients With Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and Their Caregivers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To identify, through both quantitative and qualitative methods, clinical correlates of anxiety and points of intervention to reduce anxiety in patients with late-stage lung cancer and their primary caregivers. II. To apply these findings to develop a brief dyadic intervention based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to reduce anxiety in late-stage lung cancer patients and their primary caregivers. III. To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the pilot intervention through number of completed visits and assessment pre- and post- intervention. OUTLINE: Participants undergo cognitive behavioral therapy over 1 hour once weekly for a total of 6 sessions. Sessions are tailored to patient and caregiver cognitions and approach and avoidance behaviors. After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 1 week.</detailed_description>
