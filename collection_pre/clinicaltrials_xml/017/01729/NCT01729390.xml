	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to determine whether varying the energy density and portion size of the main course will affect meal energy intake after consumption of a first course that has previously been shown to enhance satiety. It is hypothesized that increasing either the energy density or portion size of the main course will increase meal energy intake after consumption of the first course. It is also hypothesized that compared to when a first course is consumed, not consuming a first course will increase meal energy intake.</brief_summary>
