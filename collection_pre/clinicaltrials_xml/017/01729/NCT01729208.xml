Subject is currently or within 30 days prior to this study has been an active participant in another clinical study. Current or prior use of bifocals, progressive addition lenses, atropine, pirenzepine or ANY other myopia control treatment. Regular use of ocular medications (prescription or overthecounter), artificial tears, or wetting agents. Current use of systemic medications which may significantly affect contact lens wear, tear film production, pupil size, accommodation or refractive state. A known allergy to fluorescein, benoxinate, proparacaine or tropicamide. Strabismus by cover test at far (4 m) or near (40 cm) wearing distance correction. Any ocular, systemic or neurodevelopmental conditions that could influence refractive development.</criteria>
