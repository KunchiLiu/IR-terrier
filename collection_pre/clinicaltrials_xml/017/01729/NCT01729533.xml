	<brief_title>The Benefits of Intracytoplasmic Morphologically Selected Sperm Injection (IMSI) in Couples With Unexplained Infertility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>When routine infertility workup yields normal results in both partners, the couple is defined as suffering from unexplained infertility. These couples present normal semen analysis. It has been reported that even infertile patients with normozoospermic parameters can have higher values of DNA damage than fertile controls. It has been proposed that the use of ''invisible damaged'' spermatozoa could result in fertilization failure, impaired normal embryo development, reduced implantation and pregnancy rates. The motile sperm organelle morphology examination (MSOME) allows the detection of sperm vacuoles that seems to be related to sperm DNA damage. The investigators hypothesized that couples with unexplained infertility could benefit from the injection of spermatozoa selected under high-magnification (x6600)</detailed_description>
