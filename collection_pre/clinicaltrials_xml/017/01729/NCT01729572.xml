	<brief_summary>Schizophrenia is a chronic debilitating mental disorder, characterised by a relapsing remitting course. Although anti-psychotics can prevent relapse, its effect on schizophrenia outcome remains very limited, mainly due to very poor adherence to medications by the patients. This study aims to find, whether the add-on of remote monitoring of medication compliance via tele-medicine, to routine out-patient clinic care, can improve patients adherence and reduce the risk of relapse.</brief_summary>
