	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study to assess the effectiveness, safety and feasibility of carotid body removal in patients with high blood pressure (hypertension) resistant to medical treatment. Patients with high blood pressure are at significant risk of medical complications including stroke and heart disease. The principle research question is whether removal of the carotid body will lead to an improvement in the blood pressure of this patient group.</brief_summary>
