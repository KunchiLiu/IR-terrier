	<brief_title>Vestibular Rehabilitation and Dizziness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dizziness is among the most prevalent complaints for which people seek medical help and the incidence increases with advancing age. Dizziness represents a diagnostic and treatment challenge because it is a subjective sensation, refers to a variety of symptoms (unsteadiness, spinning, sense of motion or lightheadedness), and has many potential contributory factors. Dizziness is often related to vestibular disease which is treated effectively with vestibular exercises. Successful management of dizziness is critical because dizziness is a major risk factor for falls in older adults. There are parallels between the effects of age-related versus disease-related loss of vestibular function - in complaints of dizziness and increased risk for falls. The investigators' question, then, is whether the same exercises that are beneficial for patients with vestibular pathology are beneficial for older patients with dizziness but normal vestibular function. Older adults with dizziness who have been referred to Audiology for vestibular evaluation will be randomized to receive either standard balance rehabilitation plus placebo eye exercises (CON) or standard balance rehabilitation plus vestibular-specific exercises (GS). Primary outcomes include symptoms, balance-related confidence, dynamic visual acuity, postural stability as measured by sensory organization test, fall risk as measured by dynamic gait index, and gait speed. Assessment will occur at baseline, discharge from physical therapy (PT), 1 and 6 months post-PT.</detailed_description>
