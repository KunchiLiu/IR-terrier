	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well vaccine therapy works in treating patients with stage IV hormone receptor positive breast cancer. Vaccines made from peptides may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage IV Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To quantify and characterize human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-specific central memory T cell (TCM) and effector memory T cell (TEM) subsets in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) of patients vaccinated with a HER2 cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) peptide-based vaccine. II. To evaluate the feasibility of expanding HER2-specific effector T cells (TE) derived from HER2-specific TCM or TEM precursors in patients vaccinated with a HER2 CTL peptide-based vaccine and characterize their function. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety of administering a HER2 CTL peptide-based vaccine in patients who are receiving trastuzumab and/or lapatinib (lapatinib ditosylate). OUTLINE: Patients receive HER-2/neu peptide vaccine intradermally (ID) once monthly for 3 months. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks.</detailed_description>
