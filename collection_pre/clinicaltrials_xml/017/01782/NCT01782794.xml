This is a national, prospective, epidemiological study, comprising four measurement time-points over a three-year period, (T1 in 2009, T2 in 2010, T3 in 2011, and T4 in 2012) in order to cover the period prior to the introduction of InfanrixHexaÂ® reimbursement, the transition period, and the period following reimbursement of the vaccine. The periods between each data collection time-point will be identical, lasting a year. Two age groups will be investigated at each data collection time-point: 12-15 months and 24-27 months, thus providing measurements before/after reimbursement.</detailed_description>
