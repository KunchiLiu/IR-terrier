	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to characterize the deficit in critical components of personal identity (self-consciousness and social cognition) in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and fronto-temporal lobar dementia (FTLD), compared to healthy elderly, combining a neuropsychology and multi-podal neuroimaging study. We posit that the alteration of some aspects of self-consciousness (autobiographical memory, nosognosia, metacognition) and social cognition (theory of mind and facial) results in personality changes in the patients, primarily due to the alteration of self-consciousness in AD and to social cognition in FTLD.</brief_summary>
