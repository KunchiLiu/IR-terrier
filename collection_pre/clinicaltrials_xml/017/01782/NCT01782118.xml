	<brief_summary>Background: Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are effective for treating gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, they may be associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections. Aim: To determine if Lactobacillus GG (LGG) is an effective adjunct to PPI for reducing the risk of gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections in children with GERD. Study design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LGG for Prevention of Infectious Complications During PPI Treatment in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with GERD treated with PPI will be randomly assigned to receive LGG in dose of 10(9) Colony Forming Units (CFU) twice daily for 6 weeks or a comparable placebo twice daily for 6 weeks.</detailed_description>
