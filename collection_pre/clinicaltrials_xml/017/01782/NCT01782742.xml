	<brief_summary>Retinoid X receptors (RXR) are nuclear receptors that have been linked to numerous metabolic pathways relevant to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Aβ (harmful protein) production and removal. The study drug "bexarotene" is an FDA approved anti-cancer agent but is not approved for use in Alzheimer's disease. Bexarotene acts as an RXR agonist that has reduced Aβ (harmful protein) in the brain in experimental models of Alzheimer's disease. This study aims to determine the safety and effect on abnormal proteins found in the brain (based on brain scans) of 300 mg of "bexarotene" administered for one month compared to placebo (inactive agent).</brief_summary>

History of malignancy within the past five years with the exception of basal cell or squamous cell cancer, insitu cervical cancer, or localized prostate cancer. History of seizure in the past three years prior to randomization Any contraindication of having brain MRI Any contraindication of having PET (inability to lie flat and still for the duration of the scan, intolerance to previous PET such as hypersensitivity reaction to PET ligand or imaging agent) The subject has any unstable medical illness including hypertension, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal failure, liver failure or other organ compromise. Other clinically important abnormality on vital signs, physical examination, neurologic examination, laboratory results, or electrocardiogram (ECG) examination (e.g. Atrial fibrillation) that could compromise the study or be detrimental to the subject. The subject has received bexarotene previously. The subject has an allergy to bexarotene. Has had a PET scan in the past 12 months. Has had radiotherapy in the past year. Have participated in an investigational drug or device study within 30 days prior to Visit 2. Have been treated with immunomodulators to treat AD (vaccines, antibodies etc) within 6 months prior to visit 2 Unable to swallow uncrushed oral medication in capsule form Have any condition or reason that, in the opinion of the investigator, which could interfere with the ability of the patients to participate or complete the trials, or places the patient at undue risk or complicates the interpretation of safety or efficacy data.</criteria>
