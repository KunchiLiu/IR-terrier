	<criteria>Subjects will be eligible to participate in the study if they are between the ages of 3060 and are clinically diagnosed with Type II diabetes by their primary care providers or endocrinologists (diagnosis usually based on FPG &gt; 126 mg/dL on two occasions). Participants must have been diagnosed for at least one year and currently be under medical supervision for the disease. They must also have an A1c measurement above 7%, which indicates less than optimal management of the disease. The study will exclude pregnant women; those with comorbidities affecting life expectancy (e.g. malignancy, CVD); uncontrolled hypertension (&gt; 150/100 mmHg); serious trauma (e.g. MVA) within the previous 12 months; diagnosed bleeding/clotting disorders; those currently under chiropractic care or having contraindications to Activator care (e.g. vertebral fracture, infection, active inflammatory arthritis, severe osteoporosis). The presence of these exclusions will be determined during the history and exam procedures. All female subjects will be asked to take precautions during their participation in the study to avoid becoming pregnant.</criteria>
