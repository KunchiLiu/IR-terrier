	<criteria>Weight &gt;40 kg (88 lb) and â‰¤150 kg (330 lb); if between 13 and 14 years of age must weigh &gt;= 50 kg (110 lb) Acute IA defined as duration of clinical syndrome of &lt;30 days. Female subjects of childbearing potential must be using a medically accepted method of birth control before beginning studydrug treatment and agree to continue its use for 30 days after stopping study medication. Chronic (&gt;1 month duration) IA, relapsed/recurrent IA, or refractory IA which has not responded to antifungal therapy. Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis, pulmonary sarcoidosis, aspergilloma, or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). Known mixed invasive mold fungal infection including Zygomycetes, and/or a known invasive Aspergillus fungal infection in which either study drug may not be considered active. Receipt of any systemic (oral, intravenous, or inhaled) antifungal therapy for this infection episode for 4 or more consecutive days (&gt;= 96 hours) immediately before randomization. Developed the current episode of IA infection during receipt of &gt;13 days of antifungal prophylaxis with an agent considered to be a moldactive antifungal agent. Receipt of posaconazole or voriconazole as empirical treatment for this infection for 4 days (96 hours) or more within the 15 days immediately before randomization. Known hypersensitivity or other serious adverse reaction to any azole antifungal therapy or to any other ingredient of the study medication used. Females who are pregnant, intend to become pregnant, or are nursing at the time of randomization. Known history of Torsade de Pointes, unstable cardiac arrhythmia or proarrhythmic conditions, or a history of recent myocardial infarction within 90 days of study entry. Hepatic cirrhosis or a ChildPugh score of C (severe hepatic impairment) at the time of randomization. Severe renal insufficiency (estimated creatinine clearance &lt;20 mL/min) or on hemodialysis at the time of randomization or likely to require dialysis during the study. Known hereditary problem of galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency, or glucosegalactose malabsorption. Acute symptomatic pancreatitis within 6 months of study entry or a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis at the time of randomization. Active skin lesion consistent with squamous cell carcinoma at the time of randomization, or a current or prior history of malignant melanoma within 5 years of study entry. On artificial ventilation or receiving acute Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)/Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BPAP) at the time of randomization. Known or suspected Gilbert's disease at the time of randomization. Requires treatment with other medications that cannot be stopped and for which there is a known contraindication to coadministration of one or more of the study drugs.</criteria>
