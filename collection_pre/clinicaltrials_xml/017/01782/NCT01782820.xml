	<brief_summary>The aim of the present study is to compare the time course of a neuromuscular block in patients receiving dexamethasone 8 mg in order to reduce postoperative nausea or vomiting several hours before surgery with patients receiving the drug immediately before induction of anaesthesia and patients without a dexamethasone prophylaxis. The primary end point is the time from start of injection of rocuronium until recovery to a train of four ratio (TOF ratio) of 0.9.</brief_summary>
