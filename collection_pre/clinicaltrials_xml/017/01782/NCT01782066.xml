	<brief_summary>Invasive meningococcal disease is a worldwide problem with serious repercussions for those affected. Vaccination is recognized as the best way to combat it. The cost of vaccination is prohibitive in many low-resource settings at home and abroad. By harnessing the special immunologic properties of the skin, a dose reduction may be achieved by intradermal administration of the vaccine. The cost savings associated with dose reduction will increase availability of the vaccine.</brief_summary>
