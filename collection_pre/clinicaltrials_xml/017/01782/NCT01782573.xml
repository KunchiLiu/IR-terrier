	<brief_title>The Efficacy of Chlorhexidine Gluconate Pre - Disinfection Scrubbing in Preventing Surgical Site Infections for Hepatectomy Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgical site infections (SSIs) following elective surgical procedures occur most commonly as a result of colonization by the patient's native skin flora . The most common pathogens causing SSIs are Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococci , components of normal skin flora . Therefore, preoperative disinfection of the surgical site with an antiseptic skin preparation is standard practice before any surgical intervention to decrease skin microbial counts before incision . It is considered an important step in limiting surgical wound contamination and preventing infection. A variety of skin-preparation agents and methods are available for preventing surgical site infections and the techniques for preoperative cleansing of the skin vary among hospitals and surgeons. There is a pressing need to elucidate the effect of cutaneous disinfection with chlorhexidine gluconate ( CHG ) in prevention of surgical site infections. Many studies demonstrated that comparisons with cutaneous disinfection with povidone-iodine, disinfection with CHG before insertion of an intravascular device and for post-infection site care can substantially reduce the incidence of device-related infection . Hence, this study aimed to test whether an additional chlorhexidine gluconate scrub followed by a routine disinfection would lower the incidence of surgical site culture and subsequent infection after hepatic resection. This data will show the originality and clinical importance of a cutaneous pre-disinfection scrubbing solution for such risk patients with hepatectomy.</detailed_description>
