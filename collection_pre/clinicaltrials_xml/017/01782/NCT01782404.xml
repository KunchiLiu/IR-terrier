	<brief_summary>This a prospective, non-controlled, open, multi-center study evaluating the reduction of bacteriuria after bladder irrigation with chlorhexidine in spinal cord injured patients with chronic bacteriuria practicing intermittent catheterisation (IC). Patients will be treated with chlorhexidine for bladder irrigation twice daily for a maximum of 7 days. The study hypothesis is that bladder irrigation with chlorhexidine is efficient for a short term reduction of bacteriuria in patients performing intermittent catheterization (IC).</brief_summary>
