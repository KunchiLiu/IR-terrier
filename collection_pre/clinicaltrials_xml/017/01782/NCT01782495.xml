	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate Chronic Hepatitis C Infection in Adult Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ABT-450, ritonavir, ABT-267 (ABT-450/r/ABT-267) with or without ABT-333 and with or without ribavirin in adult transplant recipients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Male or female, at least 18 years of age at the time of screening. 2. Currently taking an immunosuppressant regimen based on either tacrolimus or cyclosporine. Corticosteroids such as prednisone or prednisolone are permitted as components of the immunosuppressant regimen providing the dose is not more than 10 mg/day. 3. HCV IFN therapy treatmentna√Øve or experienced, either pre or post liver or renal transplant. 4. Screening HCV genotype testing indicating infection with genotype 1 or 4 HCV only. 1. Use of everolimus or sirolimus as part of the immunosuppressive regimen within 2 months of Screening Visit. 2. Use of any medications listed below as well as those that are contraindicated for use with either ritonavir or RBV within 2 weeks prior to study drugs administration or 10 halflives (if known), whichever is longer. 3. Positive test result for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or antihuman immunodeficiency virus antibody (HIV Ab). 4. Documented history of posttransplant complications directly involving the hepatic or renal vasculature as appropriate to the organ transplanted, e.g., thrombosis of the portal vein, the hepatic artery and/or hepatic vein. 5. Clinically significant abnormalities, other than HCV infection, in a subject posttransplant based upon the medical history, physical examination, vital signs, laboratory profile and a 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that make the subject an unsuitable candidate for this study in the opinion of the investigator.</criteria>
