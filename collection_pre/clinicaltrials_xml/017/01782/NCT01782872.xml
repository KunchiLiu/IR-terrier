	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine which medication(s) should be included in the interscalene nerve block (an injection of local anesthetic [numbing medicine] near nerves in the shoulder) for patients undergoing total shoulder arthroplasty (shoulder replacement). The ideal nerve block would reduce pain after shoulder surgery without causing a great deal of muscle weakness.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analgesia After Total Shoulder Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patients will receive an intravenous pain pump (patient-controlled analgesia) and a nerve block with long-lasting local anesthetic. The three study groups will receive additives (clonidine, dexamethasone, buprenorphine plus local anesthetic) in the nerve block that may reduce postoperative pain. One of the study groups uses the usual concentration of local anesthetic, while the other two study groups use reduced concentrations of local anesthetic. Follow-up with study patients begins on the day of surgery and continues through postoperative day 2. Seen twice daily, patients will be asked about their pain and assessed for sensory function and strength of their shoulder muscle and hand grip.</detailed_description>
