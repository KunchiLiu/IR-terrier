	<brief_summary>This study is for patients who have been diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma that has spread (metastasized) or that is not eligible for removal by surgery. The purpose of this study is to determine how soft tissue sarcomas respond to treatment with an investigational drug called tivozanib. In some lab and clinical studies, tivozanib has been shown to interfere with the growth of some types of tumors. The study will also evaluate how safe the study treatment is by observing how many and what kind of adverse events (side effects) participants experience.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study of Tivozanib in Patients With Metastatic and Non-resectable Soft Tissue Sarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the progression-free survival (defined as complete response [CR] + partial response [PR] + stable disease [SD]) assessed at 16 weeks for patients treated with tivozanib. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Overall response rate (defined as CR + PR). II. Clinical benefit rate (CR + PR + SD). III. Overall survival (up to 2 years beyond progression). IV. Correlation of clinical outcome with antibodies for vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1) and VEGFR2. V. Assess Safety and tolerability. OUTLINE: Patients receive tivozanib orally (PO) daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or until discontinuation per patient preference or physician recommendation. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.</detailed_description>

tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area may be considered measurable for the purposes of this study only if there is evidence of growth of the area following a course of irradiation that cannot be attributed to necrosis or bleeding into the tumor Patients must have had a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 4 prior chemotherapy regimens for recurrent/metastatic disease (it will be up to the treating investigator to define what constitutes a "regimen" in each case); the last dose of systemic therapy (include tyrosine kinase inhibitors) must have been given at least 4 weeks prior to initiation of therapy; patients receiving BCNU or mitomycin C must have received their last dose of such therapy at least 6 weeks prior to initiation of therapy Patients with brain metastasis that have been treated with definitive surgery or radiation and have been clinically stable for 3 months following the procedure with no neurological signs or symptoms and no requirement for systemic glucocorticoids are eligible for study Patients must exhibit an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1.5 x 10^9/l Platelets &gt;= 75 x 10^9/l Total bilirubin =&lt;

2.5 x institutional ULN Serum creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x ULN If urine protein:creatinine (UPC) &gt;= 1, then a 24hour urine protein must be assessed; patients must have a 24hour urine protein value &lt; 1g to be eligible Patients must not have current evidence of another malignancy; there are no restrictions regarding prior history of malignancy If female and of childbearing potential, documentation of negative pregnancy test is required within 7 days prior to first dose; sexually active males and females of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraceptive measures, while on study and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug; all subjects (and their partners) must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception; effective birth control includes (a) intrauterine device (IUD) plus one barrier method; or (b) 2 barrier methods; effective barrier methods are male or female condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides (creams or gels that contain a chemical to kill sperm) Note: oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives may be affected by cytochrome P450 interactions, and are not considered effective for this study Adverse events related to prior tumorspecific therapy must have resolved to less than or equal to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (CTCAE) (version 4) grade 1 prior to study entry (except alopecia) Patients taking cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 inducers at the time of screening/registration are still eligible for participation, but whenever possible these medications should be discontinued or changed to one that is not an inducer NOTE: No washout period is required NOTE: It will be up to the treating investigator's discretion to assess whether or not the risk of discontinuing or changing the medication is higher or lower than the risk of continuing it while on study for the individual patient Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document; signed and dated informed consent must be obtained prior to registration on trial Patients with any one of the following sarcoma histological subtypes will not be eligible for participation: alveolar softpart sarcoma, chondrosarcoma, dermatofibrosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), Kaposi sarcoma, mixed mesodermal tumor/carcinosarcoma, osteosarcoma, and low grade (grade 1) sarcomas; NOTE: Myxoid liposarcoma with t(12;16) or t(22;22) is permitted; rhabdomyosarcoma (Embryonal, Alveolar, pleomorphic), interdigitating dendritic sarcoma, giant cell tumor of bone Patients who have had major surgery within 21 days or those who have not recovered from adverse events associated with surgery to =&lt; grade 1 will not be eligible for participation; excluded from such considerations are surgical changes not expected to improve, e.g. removal of muscle tissue; patients may be on replacement glucocorticoids for preexisting glucocorticoid deficiency (e.g. Addison's disease) Patients receiving any other investigational agents will not be eligible for participation Patients with a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to tivozanib will not be eligible for participation Patients with serious and/or unstable preexisting medical, psychiatric, or other conditions that could interfere with safety, provision of informed consent, or compliance to study procedures and requirements will not be eligible for participation, including but not limited to: Uncontrolled intercurrent illness Ongoing or active infection including HIV, active hepatitis B or C) Symptomatic congestive heart failure Unstable angina pectoris Cardiac arrhythmia Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements will not be eligible for participation Pregnant women and women who are breastfeeding will not be eligible for participation Patients with a history or clinical evidence of central nervous system (CNS) metastases or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis will not be eligible for participation;
