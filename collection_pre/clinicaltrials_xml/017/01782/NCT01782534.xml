	<brief_summary>The relevant predictive hospital risk factors for 5-year mortality of patients with aortic dissection is untill unlear. The aim of this study is to collect the clinical data of 111 hospitalized patients admitted to hospital from Aug. 2001 to Aug. 2007, and statistically analyze the hospital risk factors related to 5-year mortality by univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression.</brief_summary>
