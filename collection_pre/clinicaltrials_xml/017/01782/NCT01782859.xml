	<brief_summary>Studies have shown that surgery causes some reactions in your body consistent with inflammation. When the inflammation is extensive, it may affect different parts of the body including the lungs. Corticosteroids are commonly used to treat inflammation and are different from performance enhancing steroids associated with athletics. The purpose of this study is to determine the influence of low dose steroids given 3 times in a 24 hour period on thrombotic markers (markers that are associated with increased risks of clotting, a possible complication of surgery), interleukin (IL)-6 cytokine release (part of the stress response seen with surgery), and urine desmosine levels (a marker of lung injury) in a randomized placebo controlled trial patients undergoing total hip replacement.</brief_summary>
