	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy of Iocide oral rinse in a human clinical trial of gingivitis. Iocide oral rinse will be evaluated against a placebo rinse. Indices for gingivitis, plaque and bleeding will be scored and blood tests will be performed to determine the effect of the antimicrobial oral rinse on relative levels of biological markers of inflammation.</brief_summary>

Subjects meeting any of the following exclusion criteria will not be eligible for participation in this study: History, or current evidence, of any significant acute or chronic subjectreported medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would render examination difficult or invalid or prevent the subject from active study participation; ≤24% of sites with GI score &gt;2; Thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOab) positive &gt;34; Screening serum level of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) &lt;0.45 or &gt;4.5; Treatment with antibiotic within the one (1) month period prior to the screening examination; History of heart murmur, history of rheumatic fever, valvular disease, prosthetic implant or any other condition requiring antibiotic premedication; History of thyroid disease; Purported sensitivity or allergy to iodine; Known sensitivity or allergy to shellfish; History of diabetes; History of autoimmune disease; Gross oral pathology (periodontal disease, rampant caries, tissue damage created by poor oral care or treatment, soft or hard tissue tumors) that, in the opinion of the Investigator, could influence the outcome of the study; True periodontal pockets of &gt; 5 mm and/or visible recession indicative of attachment loss; Current signs or symptoms of mucosal tissue ulcerations or inflammation, or canker sores; Presence of orthodontic appliances or any removable appliance that impinges on the oral tissues being assessed; History of early onset periodontal disease or acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis; Subject reported history in past 6 months or current alcohol abuse that, in the opinion of the Investigator, could influence the outcome of the study; Subject reported history of last past 6 months or current drug abuse; Chronic treatment (2 weeks or more) with any medication known to affect periodontal status (including phenytoin, calcium antagonists, cyclosporine, coumarin, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and aspirin) within 1 month of the screening examination. All other medications for chronic medical conditions have been initiated at least 3 months before enrollment; Current use of a statin or the use of a statin within the past sixty (60) days of screening; Concomitant therapy with another investigational drug or device without prior approval from the Sponsor within four weeks prior to Visit 2 (Study Day 1); Concomitant endodontic or periodontal therapy other than prophylaxis in the past six (6) months; Females with childbearing potential with a positive pregnancy test, pregnant or nursing mothers, suspected pregnancy, or intention to become pregnant during the study; Residence in the same household as a subject already enrolled in the study (inclusion may create blinding and/or compliance issues); Unable and unwilling to comply with the informed consent process, to meet study requirements including following instructions on study intervention, and to return for followup visits as required by the protocol.</criteria>
