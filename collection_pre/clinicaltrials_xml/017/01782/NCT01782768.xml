	<brief_summary>Background: The efﬁciency of Neural respiratory drive (NRD)expressed by a ratio of ventilation to the diaphragm electromyogram (EMGdi) decreases in patients with COPD .Improving the neural respiratory drive efficiency of COPD will help to relieve the clinical symptom and make the patients feel comfort.Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation(NPPV)is a good treatment to AECOPD patients.It is unknown the effects of different mode of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation(NPPV) such as proportional assist ventilation (PAV) and pressure-support ventilation (PSV) on the efﬁciency of Neural drive of AECOPD and which mode benefit the patients more. Objective: To compare the short-term effects of mask pressure support ventilation (PSV) and proportional assist ventilation (PAV) on Neural respiratory drive in recovering patients of AECOPD</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Effects of Different Noninvasive Ventilation Mode on Neural Respiratory Drive in Recovering AECOPD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods: After the baseline data of spontaneous breathing was collected, 20 hypercapnic recovering AECOPD patients were placed on different mode of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation(NPPV, such as the PAV or PSV mode) randomly. For each mode, three levels (PA-, PA, PA+or PS-, PS, PS+), ) of support were applied.PS and PA are set for the patient's comfort . On the basis of these two levels, 25% increase and reduction assisted level of pressure were set both for PS and PA (PA-, PA+or PS-, PS+). At each level, the patients were ventilated at least 20 minutes until the breathing was stable. The respiratory frequency (RR), tidal volume (VT), transdiaphragmatic pressure (pdi) the pressure-time product (PTP) and root-mean-square(RMS) of EMGdi were calculated. Esophageal and gastric balloon－catheters were used to detect the intra-thoracic and abdominal pressure. Airway pressure was also measured simultaneously. EMGdi was recorded from a multipair esophageal electrode .During ventilation Airflow and ventilation were measured with pneumotachograph.</detailed_description>
