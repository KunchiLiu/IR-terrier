	<brief_summary>Obesity is a serious medical, social, and economic problem and is becoming even greater concern, as the prevalence of overweight and obese individuals has steadily increased over the years. Excessive body weight can have a profound influence on lower extremities, including pain, degenerative disease, and compromised quality of life. However, no study to-date has examined the effects of weight change on foot structure and function in individuals over time. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of weight reduction on foot structure and function in obese adults. Improved understanding of the relationship between body weight and foot biomechanics is needed to promote health and healthier lifestyles.</brief_summary>
