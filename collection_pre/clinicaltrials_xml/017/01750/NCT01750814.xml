	<criteria>Healthy adults, 18 to &lt;60 years old Subjets willing to provide written informed consent and able to comply with the requirements for the study Subjects with a history of hypersensitivity, especially anaphylactic reactions to egg, egg proteins, chicken or components of vaccine such as gentamicin, gelatin, and arginine Subjects with a history of GuillainBarré syndrome Subjects with severe chronic diseases (e.g., cardiovascular diseases without controllable hypertension, hemoglobinopathy, respiratory, metabolic, and renal disorders) who are considered by the investigator to be ineligible for the study Subjects previously treated with anticoagulant therapy or hemophiliac patients who may be at risk of severe hemorrhage after an intramuscular injection Subjects who have had an acute febrile (at least 38.0°C) episode at some time during the 72 hours before enrollment Subjects who have received a vaccination within 7 days before enrollment or who are scheduled for another vaccination (excluding the study vaccine) during the study Immunocompromised subjects with immunodeficiency diseases or those who are receiving immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapy, e.g., azathioprine, cyclosporin, interferon, granulocytecolony stimulating factor, tacrolimus, everolimus, sirolimus Subjects who have received highdose corticosteroids in the 3 months before vaccination or who will be administered a cumulative dose of 700 mg of corticosteroids during the study. Inhaled, intranasal, and local application of corticosteroids is permitted, regardless of dosage, and corticosteroids such as prednisolone at a maximum dose of 15 mg/day are allowed Subjects who have been administered immunoglobulins or bloodderived products 3 months before enrollment or who are scheduled for the administration during the study Subjects who have received an influenza vaccine within 6 months of enrollment A female subject who is pregnant or who is breastfeeding. Subjects of childbearing potential without an appropriate contraceptive measure within 30 days before enrollment and who do not agree to use a clinically acceptable method of birth control during the study (e.g., oral contraceptives, condom, diaphragm or intrauterine device, or vasectomy of male partner) Subjects who have participated in any other clinical trials within 30 days of the administration of the study vaccine Individuals with other clinically significant medical or psychological condition who are considered by the investigator to be ineligible for the study</criteria>
