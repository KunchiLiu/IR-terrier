	<brief_summary>Chronic venous leg ulcers (CVU) represent a medical problem associated with significant morbidity, increased work absenteeism and earlier retirement as a consequence of disability. This strongly affects the patient's quality of life and has a significant economic impact on healthcare systems. Reports of studies with animal models show that treatment with bone marrow-derived stem cells has a beneficial effect in healing chronic skin wounds. The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the safety and feasibility of cell therapy with bone marrow derived cells (BMDC) as a complementary healing therapy in chronic venous leg ulcers, and in addition to evaluate its effectiveness. The knowledge gained in the pilot study will be used to refine the clinical protocol procedures of a subsequent randomized study. Patients with venous legs ulcers meeting eligibility criteria and providing appropriate written informed consent will be enrolled for study participation. Enrolled patients will receive Autologous BMDC implantation at de venous ulcer in conjunction with standard of care (SOC) treatment. During follow up, adverse events will be assessed by ulcer clinical examination. Effectiveness of the experimental treatment will be assessed by evaluating ulcer healing (reduction of the ulcer area) and pain reduction over a six-month period.</brief_summary>
