	<brief_summary>Thyroid nodules are common problems and although &gt; 95% are stated to be benign, they may cause some problems like hyperthyroidism, compression symptoms, and cosmesis associated with their function, size and localization. Especially for these nodules, patients undergo surgery and face up with the problems associated with surgical complications although they are not cancer. In some studies, radiofrequency ablation previously used for intrabdominal tumors like hepatic metastasis...,was stated to be efficient in the treatment of benign thyroid nodules and in some recurrent thyroid cancer cases. Therefore, the investigators decided to use this method in our patients having nodules like previously mentioned and see the efficacy and safety of the technique.</brief_summary>
