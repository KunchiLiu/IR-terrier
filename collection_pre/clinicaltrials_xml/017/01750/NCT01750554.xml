	<brief_summary>The investigators are proposing to continue investigation to improve the accuracy of the SpHb (continuous hemoglobin monitoring device) by administering an intermediate acting digital nerve block in the finger connected to the SpHb, specifically bupivacaine 0.25% in patients undergoing spine surgery. Bupivacaine is FDA approved and in routine use.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Influence of a Bupivacaine Digital Nerve Block Using Rev G.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergoing spine surgery will be randomized to receive (or not) the bupivacaine digital block on the finger attached to the new limited release version of the hemoglobin sensor, RevG. The SpHb reading will be compared to a blood hemoglobin level analyzed in the UCSF Clinical Laboratories.</detailed_description>
