	<brief_summary>Overactive bladder is defined as a syndrome composed of urgency, increased urinary frequency, and sometimes urinary incontinence; its etiology may be characterized as neurogenic or non-neurogenic (i.e., idiopathic). This illness has a great impact in quality of life and one of the available treatments is the injection of Botulinum Toxin. This study aims to review the efficacy and safety of type-A Botulinum Toxin in the management of Idiopathic Overactive Bladder. A systematic search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and LILACS, and the controlled randomized clinical trials were chosen to review with the CONSORT criteria by independent reviewers. Outcomes analyzed were the efficacy of the intervention for relieving the symptoms (urgency, frequency and urgency incontinence), adverse events to treatment, change in quality of life and urodynamic measures.</brief_summary>
