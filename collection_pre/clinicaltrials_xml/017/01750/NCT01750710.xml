	<brief_summary>This exploratory cross-sectional study proposes, firstly, to objectify in a population of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT 1A)if there is a correlation between the recording of electrical parameters and upper limb muscle strength of the thigh and in a second step, to seek a relationship between the measured parameters.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients suffering from CMT 1A neuropathy will be invited to go through a series of tests such as: - Electromyography - Isokinetic test - Podiatric assessment - Functional evaluations: Hand dexterity, limbs muscles strength - Quality of life assessment with questionnaires</detailed_description>
