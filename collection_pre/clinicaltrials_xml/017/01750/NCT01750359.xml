	<brief_summary>Antidepressants generally do not lead to an immediate relief of symptoms. Most people will not see a significant improvement for at least 4 weeks. Studies have generally shown that the full benefits of antidepressant therapy may take as long as 8 to 12 weeks. However, this timeline is variable among individuals.Curcumin is one of the main curcuminoids isolated from this perennial herb. It possesses a variety of pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects. Curcumin has been found to possess antidepressant action in various animal models of depression. Chronic administration of curcumin has been reported to exert antidepressant-like action in olfactory bulbectomy model of depression in rats. Although the mechanism of the antidepressant effect of curcumin is not fully understood, it is hypothesized that it acts through inhibiting the monoamine oxidase enzyme and modulating the release of serotonin and dopamine.In randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 40 patients will be randomized to receive either 500 mg/day of curcumin or placebo together with antidepressants for 6 weeks.</brief_summary>
