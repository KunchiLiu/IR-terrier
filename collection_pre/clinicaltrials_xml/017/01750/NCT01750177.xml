	<brief_summary>The purpose is to investigate the effect of sedentary screen time activities on food intake and subjective appetite in 9- to 14-year old normal weight and overweight/obese girls. The investigators hypothesize that pre-meal exposure to screen time activities for 45 minutes increases subjective appetite and food intake at the next meal. Food intake will be measured immediately following screen-time exposure, and subjective appetite measured throughout the study period at 0, 15, 30, 45 and 75 minutes.</brief_summary>
