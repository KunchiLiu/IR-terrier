	<brief_summary>It is established that the surviving patients after a stay in the ICU are characterized by frequent malnutrition and morbidity and mortality. The main goal of this work is to study the relationship between nutritional statuses during ICU hospitalization, whatever its determinants, and quality of life, morbidity and mortality at one year. The hypothesis of the study is that the presence of under nutrition is responsible for a 10% increase in crude mortality at one year (which would be respectively 30% for malnourished patients and 20% for non-malnourished patients).</brief_summary>
