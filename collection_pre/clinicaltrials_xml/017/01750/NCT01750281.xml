	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to treat patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with a combination therapy of selumetinib and two different doses of docetaxel 75mg/m2 or 60 mg/m2 vs placebo and compare how well each dose affects how their cancer responds. It will also help us to understand the tolerability profile of the different dosing regimens in these patients</brief_summary>
