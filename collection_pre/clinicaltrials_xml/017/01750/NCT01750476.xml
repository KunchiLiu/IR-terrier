	<brief_summary>The investigators are conducting a research study to understand how cells responsible for fighting infection (immune cells) are affected by hormonal contraceptive use. The investigators hypothesize that progestin-containing hormonal contraceptives (i.e., Depo-Provera) inhibit host response to infection. To test this hypothesis, the investigators will collect blood and genital tract samples from women before and after their initiation of a hormonal contraceptive (either birth control pills, Depo-Provera, or Mirena).</brief_summary>
