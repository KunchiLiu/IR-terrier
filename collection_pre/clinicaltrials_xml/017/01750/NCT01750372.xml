	<brief_summary>Standardized outcome measures can be used to document patient health outcomes and improve treatment of those requiring prosthetic and orthotic (O&amp;P) services. Though numerous instruments have been developed, existing measures of O&amp;P outcomes have serious shortcomings including limited evidence that the scores are responsive to clinical changes. The investigators are developing the Prosthetic Limb Users Survey-Mobility (PLUS-M) using modern measurement methods to be a brief, precise and flexible measure of mobility for persons with lower limb amputation (LLA). The investigators propose the following objectives to achieve this goal. Key objective 1: develop a measure (item bank) for measuring mobility in persons with lower limb loss Key objective 2: study health profiles of lower limb prosthetic users Key objective 3: validate the measure in a longitudinal study of people receiving replacement prosthetic limbs Key objective 4: study longitudinal health patterns of persons with lower limb amputation</brief_summary>
