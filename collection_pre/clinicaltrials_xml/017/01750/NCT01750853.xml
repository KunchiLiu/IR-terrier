	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of LY3045697 after a single dose, and to determine how long LY3045697 remains in the body. Two cohorts (groups) of 9 participants each will participate in 3 dosing periods. These participants will receive placebo in one period only. A third cohort of 9 will participate in 2 dosing periods and participants will receive either 2 dose levels of LY3045697 or 1 dose level of LY3045697 and placebo by the end of both periods.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of LY3045697 in Healthy Participants</brief_title>

In addition, participants with the following findings will be excluded: Confirmed corrected QT (QTcF) interval &gt; 450 milliseconds (msec) for males and &gt; 470 msec for females; additional ECGs may be performed if required Complete bundle branch blocks and other conduction abnormalities other than mild first degree atrioventricular block Irregular rhythms other than sinus arrhythmia or occasional, rare supraventricular ectopic beats History of unexplained syncope Family history of unexplained sudden death or sudden death due to long QT syndrome Twave configurations are not of sufficient quality for assessing QT interval, as determined by the MI Show evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and/or positive human HIV antibodies, hepatitis C and/or positive hepatitis C antibody, or hepatitis B and/or positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) Intend to use overthecounter or prescription medication within 5 days prior to dosing, other than daily multivitamin therapy, stable thyroid hormone replacement or medication assessed as acceptable by the MI and not interfering with the integrity of the study data collection. Medications for benign indications in healthy participants may be continued, with the exception of drugs that may alter adrenal function, blood pressure or potassium Have donated blood of more than 50 milliliters (mL) of blood within 60 days prior to dosing Have an average weekly alcohol intake that exceeds 21 units per week or participants unwilling to stop alcohol within 48 hours of entry into study until discharge each period (1 unit = 12 ounces (oz) or 360 mL of beer; 5 oz or 150 mL of wine; 1.5 oz or 45 mL of distilled spirits) Have an abnormal blood pressure (supine) defined as diastolic blood pressure &gt;95 or less than (&lt;) 50 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and/or systolic blood pressure &gt;150 or &lt;90 mmHg confirmed by at least 1 repeat measurement Regularly use known drugs of abuse or show positive findings for such use on urinary drug screening Use of natural licorice (glycyrrhizinic acid) within 5 days of enrollment or use during the study Are unwilling to abstain from using grapefruitcontaining products and saltsubstitutes containing potassium for the duration of the study Have serum potassium &gt;upper limit of normal (result from suspected hemolyzed sample may be repeated) or &lt;lower limit of normal per lab reference range Have serum creatinine &gt;124 micromoles per liter (μmol/L) (male); &gt;106 μmol/L (female)</criteria>
