	<brief_summary>"This study is a single-center, randomized, open-label, 3-period, 5-treatment, 6-sequence design. A total of 54 eligible subjects will receive three total treatments; one with intravenous (IV) infusion and two with the Study System. Each subject will be randomly assigned to receive a treatment sequence consisting of Treatment A (IV fentanyl citrate), Study System Treatment B (170 mcAmp), and one of three additional Study System treatments (140 mcAmp or 200 mcAmp or 230 mcAmp) "</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Characterization of the Active, Separated System With PK Controller (Fentanyl Iontophoretic Transdermal System, 40 Mcg Fentanyl Per Activation).</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>"The Study System is a single-use system that consists of two parts: a Drug Unit containing 10.8 mg fentanyl hydrochloride, and a Controller that supplies the dosing current. The two parts are packaged separately and assembled immediately prior to use. The Study System will be applied to the upper, outer arm of each subject. Fentanyl will be delivered from the Study System via transdermal iontophoresis using a current of 170 mcAmp (Treatment B), 140 mcAmp (Treatment C), 200 mcAmp (Treatment D), or 230 mcAmp (Treatment E). Each subject will be randomly assigned to a treatment sequence consisting of Treatment A (IV fentanyl citrate), Study System Treatment B (170 mcAmp), and one of three additional Study System treatments consisting of Treatment C (140 mcAmp), Treatment D (200 mcAmp), or Treatment E (230 mcAmp). Each subject will therefore receive a total of three treatments (A and B and either C, D, or E). The specific treatments are outlined in detail below: - Treatment A: Fentanyl citrate (equivalent to 80 mcg fentanyl) administered over 20 minutes by IV infusion every hour through 23.33 hours. - Treatment B: Two consecutive 40 mcg fentanyl doses each delivered over 10 minutes by the Study System (170 mcAmp) every hour through 23.33 hours. - Treatment C: Two consecutive 35 mcg fentanyl doses, each delivered over 10 minutes by the Study System (140 mcAmp) every hour through 23.33 hours. - Treatment D: Two consecutive 50 mcg fentanyl doses, each delivered over 10 minutes by the Study System (200 mcAmp) every hour through 23.33 hours. - Treatment E: Two consecutive 54 mcg fentanyl doses, each delivered over 10 minutes by the Study System (230 mcAmp) every hour through 23.33 hours. Naltrexone (50 mg) will be administered orally (PO) every 12 hours, beginning 14 hours before the start of each fentanyl treatment and ending approximately 11 hours after completion of each treatment "</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subjects must provide written informed consent to participate in the study and document their understanding that they are free to withdraw from the study at any time. 2. Subjects must be healthy volunteers with no clinically relevant abnormalities, as determined by medical history, physical examination, blood chemistry, complete blood count, routine urinalysis (a microscopic urine analysis will be performed at the Investigator's discretion if the macroscopic analysis is abnormal), and electrocardiogram (ECG). Prior medical history, physical examination, and physical and laboratory findings will be reviewed and repeated as deemed appropriate by the supervising physician. 3. Subjects must be male or female volunteers, between ages 18 to 45 years, inclusive. 4. Subjects must have a Body Mass Index (BMI = weight [kg]/height2 [m2] of 18 to 28 kg/m2, inclusive. 5. Subjects must have an average blood pressure from three separate readings in the range of 100 to 139 mm Hg systolic (inclusive) and 50 and 89 mm Hg diastolic (inclusive) after sitting for 5 minutes before and between readings. 6. Subjects must have negative urine drug test results (for drugs of abuse) in each urine sample collected at the time of fentanyl dosing in each treatment period. Each urine sample will be tested for the presence of cannabinoids, amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, and opiates. 7. Subjects must have a negative alcohol test within the 24 hours before the start of fentanyl dosing in each treatment period. 8. Subjects must provide consent to use a medically acceptable method of contraception throughout the entire duration of the study and for one week after the study is completed. Medically acceptable methods of contraception that may be used by the subject and/or female partner include birth control pills, diaphragm with spermicide, intrauterine device (IUD), condom with spermicide, vaginal spermicidal suppository, surgical sterilization (6 months postsurgery), postmenopausal (not experienced a menstrual period for a minimum of 2 years), and progestin implant or injection (used consistently for the 3 months prior to study dosing). 1. Subjects who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant during the time of their participation in this study 2. Subjects with clinically significant medical problems that, in the opinion of the supervising principal investigator, place the subject at undue risk of AEs. These conditions can include, but are not limited to, dermatologic, psychiatric, respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, hematological, genitourinary, gynecologic, neurologic, or endocrine or other organ abnormality or pathology. 3. Subjects with evidence of orthostatic hypotension (e.g., supinetostanding blood pressure decrease of ≥ 20 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 10 mm Hg diastolic AND ≥ 20 beats per minute (bpm) increase in heart rate after standing for 3 minutes) or with any reported symptoms of lightheadedness, dizziness, or fainting upon standing. 4. Subjects with resting heart rate &lt; 50 or &gt; 100 beats per minute. 5. Subjects with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or any other lung disease (e.g., sleep apnea,asthma) that could cause CO2 retention beyond normal. 6. Subjects with oxygen saturation &lt; 97% on room air. 7. Subjects with active systemic skin disease or with active local skin disease, such as but not limited to, sunburn, psoriasis, or atopic dermatitis, which would preclude application of the Study System to the upper outer arm. 8. Subjects with a history of significant dermatologic cancers (e.g., melanoma or squamous cell carcinoma). Basal cell carcinomas that were superficial and do not involve the arms are acceptable. 9. Subjects with localized skin pigmentation (e.g., tattoos, sunburn, scars, branding, etc.) or open sores, body piercing, active skin lesions on the upper arms that could interfere with the ability to assess skin site reactions. 10.
