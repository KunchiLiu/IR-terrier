	<brief_title>Comparing Validity of Non-Invasive Hemoglobin Monitoring to Laboratory Results in Critically Ill Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective study to determine the accuracy of the Masimo Pronto Non-Invasive Hemoglobin Monitor and associated Rainbow® probes in the detection of hemoglobin concentration in critically ill children. Data from at least 30 patients admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) over a period of 2 months will be collected and analyzed for this study. Note, that this device would not lead to deviations in routine patient care; specifically, the non-invasive monitor placed on the patient's finger is FDA approved. The proposed monitors are identical macroscopically to monitors, which are currently used to measure oxygen saturation at this institution. Clinical decisions, additional blood draws or alterations to the plan of care will not be made based on study data. The objective is to compare the validity of the hemoglobin values determined from non-invasive technology with measured laboratory values for hemoglobin utilized as standard of care.</detailed_description>
