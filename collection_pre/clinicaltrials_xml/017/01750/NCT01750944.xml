	<brief_title>Measurement of a Systolic Pressure Index at the Toe After a Walking Test</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our secondary objectives are: - to evaluate the concordance between left- and right-side measures: systolic pressure indices measured at the toe after a walking test (healthy volunteers) - to evaluate the concordance between left- and right-side measures: systolic pressure indices measured at the ankle after a walking test (healthy volunteers) - to evaluate the concordance of the variation in systolic pressure indices measured at the toe and ankle during the recuperation phase after a walking test (5 and 10 minutes after end of walking test) in healthy volunteers</detailed_description>
