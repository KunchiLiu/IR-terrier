	<brief_summary>This observational study will evaluate the predictive value of rapid virological response (RVR) and early virological response (EVR) on sustained virological response (SVR) by stage of liver fibrosis in treatment-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 initiated on treatment with Pegasys (peginterferon alfa-2a) and Copegus (ribavirin). Patients will be followed for 48 weeks of treatment and up to 24 weeks of follow-up.</brief_summary>
