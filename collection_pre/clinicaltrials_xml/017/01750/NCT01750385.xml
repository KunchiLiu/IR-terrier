	<brief_summary>Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy (POEM) is a novel, promising endoscopic technique for achalasia because it is safer and more effective than traditional Heller's myotomy. However, the issue of antibiotic prophylaxis in POEM has evoked considerable controversy recently. Therefore, we conduct this study to elucidate the status of POEM-related bacteremia and procalcitonin levels in order to preliminary observe whether antibiotic prophylaxis is needed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bacteremia and Procalcitonin Levels in Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy for Achalasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective: To elucidate the status of POEM-related bacteremia and procalcitonin levels in order to preliminary observe whether antibiotic prophylaxis is needed. Interventions: Patients with achalasia diagnosed by symptoms, endoscopy and barium swallow eligible for POEM are randomized to either use antibiotic prophylactically or not. Main outcome measurements: Blood culture positive incidence; secondary outcomes are procalcitonin levels, C-reactive protein levels, white blood cell counts and so on.</detailed_description>
