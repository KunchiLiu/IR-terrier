	<brief_title>Study of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Exacerbations In Spain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be followed for 12 months. Information to be collected includes clinical, analytical, immunological, microbiological, hemodynamic, imaging, environmental, social and other blood markers of inflammation (IL-8, IL-6, TNF, TNF-alpha, endothelin-1, SLPI, IL10, TGF-beta and markers oxidative stress (TEAC)), and sputum (cell count, IL-6, IL-8, SLPI, ET 1, IL10). Each center will collect clinical data, blood gas, microbiological and functional data for their patients, which will be centralized through the website of the Red Respira (www.redrespira.net). A frozen serum sample and another of frozen sputum supernatant will be sent to the coordinating center (Palma de Mallorca). Statistical analysis will include descriptive statistics: mean, standard deviation and range. Comparison of quantitative variables to be assessed using Student's t-test and ANOVA. Correlations between variables will be performed using bivariate analyzes (Pearson's linear correlation coefficient) and multivariate (multiple regression) analyses, among others.</detailed_description>
