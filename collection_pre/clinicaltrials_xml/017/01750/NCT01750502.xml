	<brief_summary>Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pleiotropic cytokine that promote the inflammatory response.In animal studies, it has been found that MIF is released in the ischaemic heart, promoting glucose uptake and protecting the heart from ischaemia-reperfusion injury.The MIF concentration, influenced by age and myocardial ischemia, have different impact on myocardial functional recovery after ischemia.Therefore, the purpose of this experiment is to study the clinical significance of MIF in patients with coronary heart disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Clinical Diagnosis Meaning of MIF in Coronary Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MIF is a pleiotropic cytokine that promote the inflammatory response. MIF is expressed in several cell types,including monocytes/macrophages, vascular smooth muscle and cardiomyocytes, and is released on stimulation from pre-formed storage pools. A foreign study reported that MIF had demonstrated to offer protection from I/R-injury by activating adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and inhibiting c-Jun Nterminal kinase (JNK)-induced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. In addition, animal experiments showed that MIF was reduced in aged heart compared with young heart. Coronary heart disease is a chronic ischemic disease, in which MIF may play as a protective factor during the whole procedure. We observed individuals who will be taking coronary angiography during the hospitalization. Individuals will be assigned to coronary-artery-disease group, which included acute coronary syndromes and stable ischemic heart disease, or non-coronary-artery-disease group, according to coronary angiography. All participants will be extracted 3ml blood sample 5 minutes before coronary angiography. Coronary-artery-disease group will be taken another two blood samples, 5 minutes after the opening of the balloon and 5 minutes after the stents have been implanted, respectively.</detailed_description>
