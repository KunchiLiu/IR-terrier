However, the investigators don't know whether the smoking factors, alcohol factors, surgery type, education background, etc. will affect individual pain perception and possible postoperative pain in Chinese population. This study was conducted to investigate the power of these possible affect factors. Method: Patients receiving elective surgery under general anesthesia were recruited into this study. The investigators measured their preoperative pressure pain threshold (PPT) and pressure pain tolerance (PTO)and also investigated the patient's personal information of smoking factors, alcohol factors, surgery type, education background, etc. In addition, we retrospectively investigated the visual analog scale (VAS) during patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) treatment 0 to 48 h after operation as well as the PCA press frequency and drug consumption of those patients who received PCA administration.</brief_summary>
