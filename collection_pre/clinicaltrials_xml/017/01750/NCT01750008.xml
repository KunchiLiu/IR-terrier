	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the outcomes of two uterine-conserving treatment alternatives for symptomatic uterine fibroids: laparoscopic myomectomy (LM) and global fibroid ablation (GFA) using the Halt System. Laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS) is a standard step prior to the GFA procedure but has not been a standard step prior to LM. Incorporating laparoscopic ultrasound as a first step prior to both treatments allows the surgeon to have equal access to valuable imaging information and to plan treatment accordingly. By randomizing the subject immediately after laparoscopic ultrasound, selection bias toward one treatment or the other following the LUS is eliminated.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Are ≥ 18 years old and menstruating Have symptomatic uterine fibroids Have a uterine size ≤16 gestational weeks as determined by pelvic exam Have fibroids that are less than 10 cm in any diameter Desire uterine conservation Have had a normal Papanicolaou test (PAP smear) (i.e. PAP I or PAP II) at the latest prestudy examination and no longer than 36 months before study entry. Are willing and able to comply with all study tests, procedures, and assessment tools Are capable of providing informed consent. Have contraindications for laparoscopic surgery and/or general anesthesia. Are expected to be high risk for, or are known to have, significant intraabdominal adhesions (defined as adhesions that would require extensive dissection to mobilize and view all surfaces of the uterus) Patients requiring major elective concomitant procedures (e.g., hernia repair, hysteroscopic resection, endometrial ablation, uterine artery ligation, etc.) that could confound the results of the study Are pregnant or lactating Have taken any depot Gonadotropinreleasing hormone (GnRh agonist within three months prior to the screening procedures Have an implanted intrauterine or fallopian tube device for contraception that cannot or will not be removed at least ten days prior to treatment Have chronic pelvic pain not due to uterine fibroids Have known or suspected endometriosis or adenomyosis Have active or history of pelvic inflammatory disease Have a history of, or evidence of, gynecologic malignancy or premalignancy within the past five years Have had pelvic radiation Have a nonuterine pelvic mass over 3 cm Have a cervical myoma Have one or more completely intracavitary submucous fibroids (Type 0) or only Type 0/1 submucous fibroids that are better treated via hysteroscopic methods In the medical judgment of the investigator should not participate in the study Are not willing to be randomized to treatment.</criteria>
