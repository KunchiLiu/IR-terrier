	<brief_summary>Patients with transfemoral amputations (TFA) frequently experience problems related to the use of socket-suspended prostheses 1-3. These problems increase with short or deformed stumps 4. The potential for improvement is substantial. Based on the very good long-term results with osseointegrated titanium implants for edentulous patients 5, osseointegrated hearing aids 6, cranio-facial prostheses 7 and prostheses for thumb-amputated patients 8, the clinical development of osseointegrated prostheses for TFA started in 1990, in Gothenburg, Sweden. The concept has gradually been modified and improved. In 1999, a prospective clinical trial began. The hypothesis is that the treatment will improve quality of life.</brief_summary>
