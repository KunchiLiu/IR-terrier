	<brief_summary>This is a an open-label, randomized, single dose, four-way crossover, multi-stage study enrolling 20 healthy adult male and female subjects per part. This study consists of two separate parts (Part A and B) with each part comprising four treatment periods. Each subject will participate in all four treatment periods per part; Subjects may not enrol in both Parts A and B. This study is being conducted to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of two extended release fixed dose combinations (FDC) oral formulations of metformin and glimepiride at two doses, 500mg/1mg and 1000mg/2mg, with each FDC formulation to be administered orally as a single dose and compared with the commercially available formulations of metformin extended release (XR) (GLUCOPHAGE ™ Sustained Release [SR]) and glimepiride immediate release (IR) (AMARYL ™). Part A of study will evaluate the bioavailability of a formulation comprising a film coated tablet containing release controlling polymers; and Part B will evaluate the bioavailability of a formulation comprising a tablet coated with release controlling polymers. In each part there will be 4 treatment periods. During each period, subjects will be randomized sequentially to receive a single dose of a reference treatment of 500 mg metformin XR / 1 mg glimepiride IR; and a reference treatment of 1000 mg metformin XR / 2 mg glimepiride IR; and an FDC tablet containing 500 mg metformin XR and 1 mg glimepiride XR; and an FDC tablet containing 1000 mg metformin XR and 2 mg glimepiride XR.Serial PK sampling for up to 36 hours and safety assessments will be performed. Each period will be separated by a washout period of at least 5 days and a follow-up visit will occur 14 days after the last dose of study drug.</brief_summary>
