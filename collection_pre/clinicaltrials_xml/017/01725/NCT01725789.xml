	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of Ferinject® in improving acute isovolemic anemia after gastrectomy for gastric cancer in terms of Quality of life(QOL )and objective measures (Hb and iron parameters). Furthermore, the tolerability and safety of Ferinject® treatment will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ferinject® Assessment In GastRectomy Patients With Acute Isovolemic Anemia (FAIRY)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized patient-blind placebo controlled study. Hb level of 10 g/dl will be used as a cut-off value for our study based on the guidelines published by American Society of Clinical Oncology and the American Society of Hematology for the treatment of cancer-related anemia, recommending Hb&lt;10 g/dl as a treatment threshold. Ferinject® to be administered based on Hb and body weight per approved summary of product characteristics (SmPC). 5 - 7 days after gastrectomy for gastric cancer, consented patients with 7g/dl≤Hb&lt;10g/dl will be administered Ferinject® or placebo (normal saline) based on the results of randomization. • Study Group Ferinject®to be administered as IV drip infusion or undiluted bolus injection with a minimum administration time of 15minutes (for 1000mg single administration) for body weight ≥50 Kg or 6 minutes (for 500mg single administration) for body weight &lt;50Kg . Note, Ferinject® should be administered to a maximum of 20mg iron/kg. Therefore in patients with a body weight &lt;50kg, administration of Ferinject® should be limited to 500mg at baseline . All patients with a serum ferritin value &lt;15ng/mL at week 4 visit that a second dose (of 500mg iron or equivalent placebo) will be given.(Study group: Ferinject®500mg, Control Group:Placebo) • Control Group Placebo will be in the form of normal saline administered over same time period as equivalent Ferinject® administration. IV drip infusion or undiluted bolus injection with a minimum administration time of 15 minutes (200mL as infusion or 20mL as bolus injection) for body weight ≥50 Kg or 6 minutes (100mL normal as infusion or 10mL as bolus injection) for body weight &lt;50 Kg.</detailed_description>
