	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the effect of deodorant and antiperspirant use and the presence of underarm hair on the absorption of testosterone. Each participant in this study will receive 6 single doses of 30 milligrams (mg) testosterone applied as a solution to each underarm. There is a minimum one day washout period between each dose. This study will last approximately 24 days not including screening. Screening is required within 30 days prior to the start of the study.</brief_summary>
