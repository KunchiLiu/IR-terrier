	<brief_summary>PURPOSE. After stroke many patients are unable to engage in normal upper limb functional activities, which may restrict them from participation in meaningful life roles. For many, conventional rehabilitation does not restore upper limb function to a useful level. The purpose of this research is to investigate the benefits of three promising motor learning interventions: focused intensive, motor learning (FIML); 2) robotics and motor learning (ROB-ML); and 3) functional neuromuscular stimulation and motor learning (FNS-ML).</brief_summary>
