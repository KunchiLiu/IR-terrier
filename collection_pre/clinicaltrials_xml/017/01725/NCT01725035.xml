	<brief_summary>Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is becoming the most common cause of liver disease in pediatrics, but little is known about its pathophysiology in children. While studies in obese adults with hepatic steatosis have described an increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) depending on the diet, there are no studies exploring the mechanisms by which excess hepatic triglycerides increases in obese youths, thus explaining the accompanying dyslipidemia and the metabolic syndrome. The central hypothesis of this study is that hepatic conversion of carbohydrates to lipid (DNL) is enhanced and associated with accumulation of excess liver fat, dyslipidemia and hepatic insulin resistance in obese youths with hepatic steatosis. The overall goal is to examine whether hepatic DNL is increased in obese youths with steatosis compared to matched controls without steatosis. Hypotheses: Hepatic conversion of carbohydrates to lipid (DNL) is enhanced and is associated with accumulation of excess liver fat, dyslipidemia and hepatic insulin resistance in obese youths with hepatic steatosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hepatic De Novo Lipogenesis (DNL)in the Pathogenesis of Hepatic Steatosis in Obese Youth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study obese youths (12-18 years) will undergo MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) measurement of liver lipid content to determine hepatic fat content. They will undergo a sugary drink (75 grams of glucose and 25 grams of fructose) challenge and Hepatic de novo lipogenesis will be determined as the incorporation of deuterium, from deuterium labeled water (D2O), into plasma triglycerides. Subjects will undergo a 6 hours study assessing de novo lipogenesis, an oral glucose tolerance test, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, magnetic resonance imaging, and Euglycemic-Hyperinsulinemic Clamp.</detailed_description>
