	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of an investigational/experimental drug called AIR001. To test the effectiveness, the study will evaluate how AIR001 affects the blood vessels in the lungs and the function of the heart. This will be done by monitoring changes in Pulmonary Vascular Resistance (PVR); from Baseline/Day 1 (start of study drug) to Week 16 of the study. PVR measures the resistance to flow in the blood vessels of the lungs. The study will include other assessments to evaluate the effect of the study drug on PAH, including measurements of exercise ability and evaluations of PAH disease symptoms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Study to Determine the Safety and Efficacy of AIR001 in Subjects With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of inhaled nebulized AIR001 administered, for 16 weeks, according to 3 treatment arms (80 mg once daily, 46 mg 4 times daily, or 80 mg 4 times daily) in subjects with World Health Organization (WHO) Group 1 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH), as determined by change in Pulmonary Vascular Resistance (PVR) from Baseline to Week 16 measured immediately post completion of AIR001 nebulization (as soon as feasible).</detailed_description>
