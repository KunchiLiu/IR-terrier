	<brief_summary>The Validation of a Digital Diet Method project is very innovative because it links three methods to address the gap in measuring food intake of HS preschool children. Data collection is based on EMA theory; participant burden is low, and the Food Image App decreases participant and staff burden even further. Data management and analysis are semi-automated and relies on advanced computer algorithms. A strength of this approach is its semi-automation, which allows us to leverage the strengths of human operators and computer automation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation of a Digital Diet Method for Use With Preschoolers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of the proposed research is to modify the Remote Food Photography Method (RFPM) for use with preschoolers. Primary caregivers (the majority will be mothers) and HS assistants will use a Smartphone to capture 24-hour images of HS children's food selection and plate waste. The RFPM, Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). and the Food Photography ApplicationÂ© will be used to estimate the energy and nutrient intake of preschoolers. The accuracy of the RFPM will be examined by determining the energy and nutrient intake (collectively referred to as food intake [FI]) to established methods: 1) actual gram (g) weights of laboratory-based test meals and 2) doubly labeled water (DLW) in a natural environment.</detailed_description>
