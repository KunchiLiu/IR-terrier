	<detailed_description>The accumulated neuro-image, hereditary and animal studies showed the correlation between glutamate transport dysfunction and ADHD psychopathology. However, there is limited clinical trial to testify the effect of modulating the NMDA receptor function of glutamate to treat ADHD. GlyTI-M is an endogenous Glycine transporter I inhibitor, and it acts on the glutamatergic synapse to modulate the neurotransmission of N-Methyl-D-Aspertate (NMDA) receptor. This study aims to explore the effect of GlyTI-M among children with ADHD.</detailed_description>
