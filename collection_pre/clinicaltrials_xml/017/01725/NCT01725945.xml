	<brief_summary>Dietary intervention efficacy trials are distinctly lacking in asthma research. This pilot study aims to provide effect size estimates and justification, clinical trial and intervention feasibility data, and procedural materials for a full-scale randomized controlled trial that will determine the efficacy and mechanisms of action of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)—a recommended dietary pattern based on proven cardiovascular benefits—as adjunct therapy to standard care for adults with uncontrolled asthma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The DASH Diet for Adults With Uncontrolled Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dietary intervention efficacy trials are distinctly lacking in asthma research. This pilot study aims to provide effect size estimates and justification, clinical trial and intervention feasibility data, and procedural materials for a full-scale randomized controlled trial that will determine the efficacy and mechanisms of action of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)—a recommended dietary pattern based on proven cardiovascular benefits—as adjunct therapy to standard care for adults with uncontrolled asthma. Eligible, consenting participants (n=90) will be randomized to receive usual care alone or combined with a DASH intervention. Follow-up assessments will occur at 3 and 6 months. By evaluating a dietary pattern approach to improving asthma control, this study could advance the evidence base for refining clinical guidelines and public health recommendations regarding the role of dietary modifications in asthma management.</detailed_description>
