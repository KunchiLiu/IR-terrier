	<brief_summary>The purposes of this study are to evaluate the acceptability and utility of a mind-body intervention on a convenience sample of Soldiers (n=120) who have screened positive through RESPECT-MIL for symptoms that may lead to post-traumatic stress and to test the effectiveness of this Relaxation Response (RR) intervention designed to decrease the physiological and psychosocial effects of stress and trauma. The study aims to enhance the psychological health of Soldiers with a RR intervention designed to promote self-awareness of physiological responses to stress and the ability to increase relaxation responses.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aims: 1. Demonstrate that trainers can be trained effectively to deliver the intervention, a mind-body skills training program based on the Benson-Henry Institute's standard RR training curriculum and tailored to a military population. 2. Evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and compliance to the training program in an active duty military population. 3. Compare outcomes on sleep disturbance, PTSD, stress-related symptoms, quality of life, and psychosocial variables related to resilience of Soldiers who receive the 6-week training program to promote the Relaxation Response to those Soldiers who do not receive the intervention.</detailed_description>
