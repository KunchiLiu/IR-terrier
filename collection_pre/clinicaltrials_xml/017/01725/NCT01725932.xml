	<brief_summary>While CBT (Cognitive Behaviour Therapy)has been found to be effective in treating depression in West, only limited amount of research has been conducted to find assess its effectiveness in low and middle income countries. We have developed culturally sensitive CBT during the last few years in Pakistan. Pakistan has high rates of depression. And there is currently a need to develop and test evidence based treatments which are culturally sensitive and cost effective. IN this project we will be assessing the effectiveness of a culturally sensitive CBT based self help intervention for depression in Pakistan against care as usual, using a randomized controlled design.</brief_summary>
