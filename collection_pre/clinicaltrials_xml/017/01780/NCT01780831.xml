	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PKs) of raltegravir (RAL) given to HIV-1-exposed newborn infants at risk of acquiring HIV-1 infection. (Pharmacokinetics are the various interactions between a drug and the body.) This study will also evaluate the appropriate dose of RAL to give to an infant to prevent the infant from getting HIV infection from its mother.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Raltegravir in HIV-1-Exposed Newborn Infants at Risk of Acquiring HIV-1 Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate the safety and PKs of RAL given to HIV-1-exposed newborn infants at risk of acquiring HIV-1 infection. The study also seeks to determine the appropriate dosing regimen of RAL that can be safely given to infants in the first 6 weeks of life. The study will enroll 50 mother-infant pairs. Mothers will be followed until discharge from the labor and delivery unit, and infants will be followed for 24 weeks after birth. Infants will be assigned non-randomly to 1 of 2 cohorts. Each cohort will include two groups of infants: a RAL-naïve group including infants born to mothers who did not receive RAL before delivery, and a RAL-exposed group including infants born to mothers who received at least one dose of RAL within 2 to 24 hours before delivery. A minimum of 12 infants will be enrolled into Cohort 1. All infants in Cohort 1 will receive RAL as oral granules for suspension as a single dose within 48 hours of birth, in addition to standard of care ARV drugs for PMTCT, and a second dose of RAL at 7 to 10 days of life. A minimum of 20 infants will be enrolled into Cohort 2. Within Cohort 2, RAL will be started within 48 hours of birth in the RAL-naïve infants and between 12 and 60 hours of birth in the RAL-exposed infants. Both the RAL-naïve and the RAL-exposed infants in Cohort 2 will receive RAL for 6 weeks, in addition to standard of care ARV for PMTCT. Dosing will be determined based on analyses of data generated from Cohort 1 and from other studies. Study visits for infants in Cohorts 1 and 2 will occur at study entry through Week 24 and include a medical history, physical exam, blood draw, and, at select study visits, PK samplings. Note: As of January 2017, enrollment and follow-up to Cohort 1 (RAL-exposed and RAL-naïve groups) and enrollment to Cohort 2 (RAL-naïve group) are complete.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Maternal Mother is either known to be HIV1 infected prior to labor or identified as HIV1 infected at the time of labor or in the immediate postpartum period. More information on this criterion can be found in the protocol. For Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 (RALnaive): Mother is at high risk of transmitting HIV to infant as evidenced by any of the following: Mother has not received any ARV therapy during the current pregnancy prior to the onset of labor and delivery; HIV RNA level greater than 1000 copies/mL within 4 weeks (28 days) prior to delivery; receipt of ARV for less than 4 weeks (28 days) before delivery; on ARVs for 4 weeks or longer but has not taken any ARV for more than 7 days prior to delivery; mother has documented drug resistant virus to at least one class of ARV drugs. Note: Mothers may have received prenatal and/or intrapartum ARVs. Note: For Cohort 2 RALexposed, there is no requirement that the mother be determined 'highrisk' of transmitting HIV to her infant. Maternal written informed consent for study participation Maternal Known maternalfetal blood group incompatibility as evidenced by the presence of an unexpected clinically significant maternal red cell antibody that is known to be capable of causing hemolytic disease of the fetus/newborn Mother receiving RAL as part of her combination antiretroviral (cART) regimen after delivery and intending to breastfeed her infant For Cohort 1 (up to 6 mothers only) and Cohort 2 RALnaïve: Mother who received RAL prior to and through delivery Infant For Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 (RALnaive): Fullterm infants exposed to HIV aged 48 hours or less. Infant may have received up to 48 hours of standard of care ARV prophylaxis before enrollment. For Cohort 2 (RALexposed): Fullterm infants exposed to HIV aged 60 hours or less. Infant may have received standard of care ARV prophylaxis/treatment before enrollment. Infant gestational age at birth at least 37 weeks No known severe congenital malformation or other medical condition not compatible with life or that would interfere with study participation or interpretation, as judged by the examining clinician Birth weight at least 2 kg Able to take oral medications Parent or legal guardian able and willing to provide signed informed consent For Cohort 2 RALexposed Group: Infants born to a mother who received at least one dose of RAL within 2 to 24 hours of delivery. Note: Based on mother's selfreport and confirmed by medical records if available. Note: For Cohort 1 RALexposed Group infants were born to mothers receiving RAL as part of their ARV regimen. Infant Infant with bilirubin exceeding the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for phototherapy, using the infant's gestational age and risk factors as described in the protocol Clinical evidence of renal disease, such as edema, ascites, or encephalopathy For Cohort 2 RAL naïve, and Cohort 1 (RALnaive and RALexposed): Receipt of disallowed medications (phenytoin, phenobarbital, or rifampin)</criteria>
