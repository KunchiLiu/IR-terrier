	<brief_summary>The primary aim of the pilot study is to provide data that can be used to better determine sample size for the design of a larger clinical trial. The pilot will evaluate the effectiveness of Lipoic Acid (LA) plus Omega-3 fatty acids (Omega-3) on preventing Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The investigators will also collect data to evaluate recruitment rate, safety, and compliance over the 12 month study period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study: Lipoic Acid and Omega-3 Fatty Acids for Alzheimer's Prevention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim is to collect data so that we can determine effect size between lipoic acid plus omega-3 fatty acids and placebo on the primary outcome measure Trails B (executive function). This is designed as a pilot randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a 12 month intervention period. Thirty participants diagnosed with hypertension that is treated (systolic blood pressure 90-160 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure 60-90 mm Hg) that have low omega-3 fatty acid levels, and normal cognitive function will be randomized to receive study drug or placebo.</detailed_description>

Screening laboratory values within normal limits or, if abnormal, deemed clinically insignificant by the investigator Sufficient English language skills to complete all testing Alzheimer's, Dementia or other neurodegenerative disease. Health conditions such as cancer diagnosed &lt; 5 years prior to enrollment (prostate cancer gleason grade &lt; 3 and non metastatic skin cancers are acceptable), liver disease, history of ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, major psychiatric disorder, central nervous system diseases (e.g. brain tumor, seizure disorder) Insulin dependent diabetes or uncontrolled diabetes (diabetes controlled on medications other than insulin are acceptable) Fish intake of one 6 ounce serving &gt; once a week less than 4 months prior to enrollment Omega3 fatty acid supplement intake (e.g. fish oil capsules, cod liver oil) less than 4 months prior to enrollment Lipoic Acid supplementation less than 1 month prior to enrollment Taking systemic corticosteroids, neuroleptics, antiparkinsonian agents, and/or narcotic analgesics. Low dose sinemet and dopamine agonist taken once a day for restless leg syndrome is not an exclusion. Contraindications to MRI, including: subjects with intrathecal pumps, stimulators, pacemakers, aneurysm clips, nonremovable hearing aids, or metal fragments in the eyes. Other exclusion criteria include the inability to lie flat on the back for 40 minutes at a time or a selfreported history of claustrophobia. Subjects with a history of hip replacement and those with welldocumented, verifiable, MRIsafe cardiac stents will not be excluded from the study. Enrollment in another treatment study</criteria>
