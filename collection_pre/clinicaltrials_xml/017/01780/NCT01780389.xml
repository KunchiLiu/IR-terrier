	<brief_title>Open-label Milnacipran for Persistent Knee Pain One Year After Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current study proposes to collect pilot data on the utility of open-label milnacipran for the treatment of pain and other outcomes in this unfortunate group of patients with chronic persistent pain after TKA. Among marketed serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), milnacipran has a unique property in that it blocks serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake equally. It is plausible that equipotent reuptake inhibition may confer greater analgesic benefit compared to other agents, and in preclinical animal models milnacipran has shown superior effects of ameliorating hyperalgesia and allodynia compared to some other antidepressant drugs. Additionally, milnacipran does not have inhibitory effects on cytochrome P (CYP) 450 enzymes, no binding affinity to neurotransmitter receptors liable to cause adverse events, and simple pharmacokinetics.</detailed_description>

Subject has taken an investigational drug or taken part in a clinical trial within 30 days prior to Screening. 10. Subjects treated with antidepressant medication within 4 weeks of screening visit (6 weeks for fluoxetine). 11. Subjects with known sensitivity to milnacipran. 12. Subjects with liver disease or reduced liver function 13. Subjects with obstructive uropathies 14. Subjects who consume alcohol in amounts viewed by the Investigator to be contraindicated 15.
