	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ASKP1240, an anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody, for the prophylaxis of organ rejection after kidney transplantation. This study will compare the efficacy of basiliximab induction, ASKP1240, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and steroids [calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) avoidance] to the standard of care immunosuppressive regimen (basiliximab induction + tacrolimus + MMF + steroids). In addition, the study will compare the efficacy of basiliximab induction, ASKP1240, tacrolimus and steroids [CNI minimization-MMF avoidance] to the standard of care immunosuppressive regimen (basiliximab induction + tacrolimus + MMF + steroids).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects will be followed for 6 months. Upon completion of the first 6 months of the study, subjects may participate in the Long Term Extension period of the study. Subjects will remain on their original treatment arm up to three years post-transplant (and / or Sponsor discontinues development or the subject no longer wishes to participate in the study).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject is a recipient of a de novo kidney from a living or deceased donor Subject has induction therapy, other than studyassigned basiliximab, planned as part of initial immunosuppressive regimen Subject has previously received or is receiving an organ transplant other than a kidney Subject will receive a solitary kidney from a deceased donor &lt; 5 years of age Subject will receive a kidney with an anticipated cold ischemia time (CIT) of &gt; 30 hours Subject will receive a kidney that meets both Extended Criteria Donor (ECD) and Donation after Cardiac Death (DCD) criteria. Note: a kidney that meets either ECD or DCD criteria is eligible for inclusion Subject will receive an ABO incompatible donor kidney Subject has a current calculated panel reactive antibody (cPRA) level &gt;50%</criteria>
