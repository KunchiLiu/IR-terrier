	<detailed_description>Participants will be randomized based on age, sex and BMI, and will consume a low-polyphenol diet 2 days prior to the intervention. On the day of the study, baseline blood and urine samples will be collected after an overnight fast. Participants will consume the assigned beverage within 15 minutes and blood collected at 2, 4, 8, and 24 h (10 mL/blood draw; total blood volume per period = 50 mL). Urine will be collected for polyphenol analysis during the following periods: 0-3, 3-6, 6-9, 9-12, 12-24 hours. After a one-week washout period, participants will receive their second and then the third beverage in a cross-over design; blood and urine sampling will be repeated at each of the 3 intervention periods.</detailed_description>
