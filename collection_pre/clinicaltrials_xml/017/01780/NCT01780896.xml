	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate visual and nonvisual topographic memory impairment and its relationship to vestibular function in humans. Topographic memory refers to the ability to remember current and past locations in topographic (navigational) space and to make and/or adjust to spatial transformations using such memories. Performance on each of these topographic memory tasks will be compared to performance on a set of comparable nontopographic memory tasks. Topographic impairments represent some of the earliest cognitive deficits observed in Alzheimer's Disease, and the brain areas involved in topographic memory are the first to show degenerative changes.</brief_summary>
