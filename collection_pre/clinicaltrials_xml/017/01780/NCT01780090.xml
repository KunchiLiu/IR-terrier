	<brief_summary>The proposed study will result in a software application compatible with the Apple iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch (hereafter termed "iOS devices") which addresses several aspects of prosodic deficits common in speakers with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) and other communication disorders, using a developmentally appropriate, intuitive interface that requires little technical skill and which can be managed by educators and parents. The program will contain elements that aid in tracking and maintaining individual student progress records, and will be designed for use in the classroom, at home, and in other environments. This study's intended focus is on the feasibility and usability of the software application.</brief_summary>
