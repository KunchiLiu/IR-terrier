	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate and compare two individualized ranibizumab treatment regimens in patients with neovascular (wet) AMD aiming to achieve and to maintain a maximum visual function benefit, while aiming to avoid unnecessary intravitreal injections. The results will be used to generate further recommendations on functional and anatomical monitoring of the disease and timing of treatment administration for patients with neovascular AMD. In this context, the study will investigate the utility of optical coherence tomography (OCT) to aid retreatment decisions with ranibizumab.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Two Treatment Regimens of 0.5 mg Ranibizumab Intravitreal Injections Guided by Functional and/or Anatomical Criteria, in Patients With Neovascular Age-related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During the course of the study, the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT)-guided therapy became a standard of care accepted by health authorities and the ophthalmology community in the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), Novartis decided on 08-Oct-2014 the early termination of the study. Therefore the 12-month cutoff date was not reached and the related analyses were not performed.</detailed_description>
