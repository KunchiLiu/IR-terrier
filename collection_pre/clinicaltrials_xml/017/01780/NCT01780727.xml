	<brief_summary>Elderly patients are the fastest growing surgical population and present with increased risk of postoperative cardiac problems, especially congestive heart failure. Diastolic dysfunction is common in the elderly population and increases the risk of major adverse cardiac events after surgery. This project will use dynamic measurements of diastolic filling pressures by echocardiography for goal-directed fluid and drug management during surgery to determine whether this reduces serious cardiac events related to diastolic dysfunction after surgery in this high-risk population.</brief_summary>
