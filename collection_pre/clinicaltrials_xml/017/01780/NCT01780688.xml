	<brief_title>Exploratory THS 2.1 Nicotine Pharmacokinetics and Safety Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 2-period 2-sequence cross-over clinical study intends to explore the profile of nicotine uptake (rate and extent of nicotine absorbed and associated variability) in healthy smokers switching from (CC) to THS 2.1 (single or ad libitum use) compared to smokers continuing to use CC, as a comparator. This study will serve to optimize blood sampling schedules and sample size estimation for further studies. This study will also provide preliminary information on the relationship between nicotine absorption and urge to smoke/withdrawal symptoms when using THS 2.1 as compared to CC, as well as the safety profile, which is related to the use of THS 2.1. After screening, enrolled subjects will be admitted to the clinic for 8 days. This study duration includes 2 consecutive periods. Each period consists of 1 day for single use of the product preceded by a 24-hour nicotine deprivation, and 1 day for ad libitum product use. After leaving the clinic, the subjects will be followed up for safety over a period of 7 days. This clinical study will be conducted in compliance with International Conference on Harmonisation of technical requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use (ICH Good Clinical Practice), the Declaration of Helsinki as amended in 2008, and the applicable regulatory requirements.</detailed_description>
