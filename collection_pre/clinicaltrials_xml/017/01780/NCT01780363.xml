	<brief_summary>Background: Genetics is suggested to play a critical role in the development of Behçet's disease (BD). Shared phenotypic features requires an approach to the differential diagnosis from periodic febrile syndromes particularly from mevalonate kinase deficiency related diseases. We planned to study for evaluating the frequency of mutations and their clinical significance in mevalonate kinase gene in Turkish patients with Behçet's disease.</brief_summary>
