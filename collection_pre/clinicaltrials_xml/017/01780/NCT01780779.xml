	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study was to investigate whether functional MRI imaging (diffusion weighted imaging) is useful for monitoring the therapeutic response of bone sarcomas in children and young adults. All patients will be scanned before, during and after chemotherapy. The findings on MRI will be correlated with histological finding after surgery. Second purpose : to define apparent diffusion coefficient value of the bone sarcoma. Third purpose : to try define prognostic factors, to investigate if there is a correlation between early treatment response and outcome.</brief_summary>
