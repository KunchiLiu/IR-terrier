	<brief_summary>Using Intensity Modulated radiotherapy it is possible to treat the entire brain to standard dosages of whole-brain radiation, while keeping the radiation dose to the hippocampus low. However, a clear relationship between radiation dose and damage to the hippocampal stem cells has not been established yet. This study is initiated to investigate the early and delayed neurotoxicity of PCI and to assess in a randomised design the benefits and risks of sparing the hippocampus in Small Cell Lung Cancer patients who receive PCI.</brief_summary>
