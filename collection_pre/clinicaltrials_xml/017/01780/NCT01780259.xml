	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability of Intranasally Administered Esketamine in Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-center study with 3 cohorts (groups). Approximately 58 participants will be enrolled in this study. In Cohort 1, approximately 16 participants will be enrolled for up to 78 days and they will receive 4 different single-dose regimens (Treatment A, B, C and D) of intranasal spray of esketamine solution in a crossover manner (participants will be switched from one single-dose regimen to another) and in an open label manner (both the investigator and the participant know the intervention received by the participant). In Cohort 2, approximately 14 participants will be enrolled for up to 35 days and they will receive 1 regimen of intranasal esketamine (Treatment D) in an open label manner. In Cohort 3, approximately 28 participants will be enrolled and they will be randomly assigned to receive either Treatment E (intranasal esketamine spray) or Treatment F (intranasal placebo spray) in a double blind manner (both the investigator and the participant do not know the intervention received by the participant). Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, targeted nasal examinations, laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, physical examination, pulse oximetery, and vital signs.</detailed_description>
