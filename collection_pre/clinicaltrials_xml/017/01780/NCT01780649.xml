	<brief_summary>Intracytoplasmic Morphologically Selected Sperm (IMSI) is a modification of IntraCytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) with a choice of the spermatozoon to be injected done at a 6000x magnification instead of 400x commonly used in ICSI. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficiency and the indications of IMSI through a multicentric randomised trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of IMSI to Treat Male Infertility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is largely used to treat male infertility. Usually, choice of the spermatozoon to be injected is done at a 400x magnification. Recently, a new microscopic technic (Intracytoplasmic Morphologically Selected Sperm Injection-IMSI) allows to make this choice at a 6000x magnification, which permits to identify sperm abnormalities such as nuclear vacuoles not seen in conventional ICSI. This selection may improve ICSI outcome. However only few data from randomised trials, have been published and the indications of IMSI remain to be identified. The present study aims to evaluate the efficiency and the indications of IMSI through a multicentric randomised trial. The patients enrolled in the study must present a male infertility and will have complete sperm examination, including morphology, DNA fragmentation and nuclear immaturity. The main endpoint will be the percentage of delivery.</detailed_description>
