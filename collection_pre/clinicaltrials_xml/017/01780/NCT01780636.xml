	<brief_summary>Non-relaxing puborectalis syndrome (NRPS) is an obstructive defecatory disorder that presents with chronic constipation, anismus, or a sensation of incomplete rectal emptying. The specific etiology of this syndrome is unknown. The true incidence of NRPS is unknown, but it is estimated that 4% of patients with defecatory disorders have NRPS. Previous therapies for non-relaxing PRS have included biofeedback, pelvic floor physical therapy, dietary changes, laxatives, enemas, and surgical division of the puborectalis muscle. Unfortunately, responses to these treatments have been variable at best. Direct injection of botulinum toxin (Botox) into the puborectalis muscle is an alternative approach for treating NRPS and has recently been reported in a limited number of studies. Botox blocks cholinergic nerve endings in the autonomic nervous system and has been used to weaken the puborectalis muscle in constipated patients. Our study aims to determine the efficacy of ultrasound and EMG guided Botox injections into the puborectalis muscle in women with NRPS. With use of this technique, we believe we will find that Botox injections decrease symptom severity and improve quality of life (QOL) in patients with NRPS. We plan to compare patient reported symptoms, symptom severity, and QOL prior to Botox injections with symptoms and QOL at 2-week, 3-month, and 6-month intervals after Botox injection into the puborectalis muscle in patients with NRPS. All enrolled patients will receive ultrasound and EMG guided Botox injections at three points along the puborectalis muscle. Post-injection data will be obtained with a defecation diary and questionnaire data at the 2-week, 3-month, and 6-month intervals. Additional injections will be offered to patients who fail the initial treatment.</brief_summary>
