	<brief_summary>This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of a combination kidney and bone marrow transplant from a haplo-identical related donor. An investigational medication and other treatments will be given prior to and after the transplant to help protect the transplanted kidney from being attacked by the body's immune system</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Male or female 1860 years of age Candidate for a livingdonor renal allograft with a one haplotype identical donor identified. First or second transplant with either a living donor or cadaveric transplant as the first transplant. Positive serologic testing for EBV indicating past exposure. Key ABO blood groupincompatible renal allograft. Evidence of antiHLA antibody within 60 days prior to transplant as assessed by routine methodology (AHG and/or ELISA) Positive testing for: HIV, hepatitis B core antigen, or hepatitis C virus or positivity for hepatitis B surface antigen. Cardiac ejection fraction &lt; 40% or clinical evidence of insufficiency. History of cancer other than basal cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Underlying renal disease etiology with a high risk of disease recurrence in the transplanted kidney (such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, type I or II nonproliferative glomerulonephritis). Prior doselimiting radiation therapy. Abnormal (&gt;2 times lab normal) values for (a) liver function chemistries (ALT, AST, AP), (b) bilirubin, (c) coagulation studies (PT, PTT).
