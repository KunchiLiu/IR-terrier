	<brief_summary>Despite recent advances in substance abuse interventions, a large percentage of clients entering residential treatment for substance use will drop out of treatment prematurely, and of the remaining, many will relapse soon after treatment completion. Previous research indicates that an individual's ability to withstand psychological distress is a key factor necessary to maintain drug and alcohol abstinence and to remain in substance use treatment without absconding. In previous work, Dr. Bornovalova developed a specific distress tolerance treatment called Skills for Improving Distress Intolerance (SIDI). This intervention features skills training in behavioral and acceptance strategies and intentional clinical exposure to emotional distress. SIDI was developed and piloted with a sample of urban drug users seeking treatment in a residential facility. Individuals receiving SIDI exhibited greater improvement in distress tolerance than those in two comparison groups (receiving treatment-as-usual and supportive counseling). Current study. The investigators received NIDA funding to conduct a randomized clinical trial with 325 clients entering a residential substance use treatment facility. Study participants will be randomized into two treatment groups: (1) those receiving SIDI and (2) those receiving Supportive Counseling (SC). Participants will receive 10 treatment sessions over a period of 4 months. Then, the investigators will follow clients for one year to examine treatment retention and abstinence.</brief_summary>
