	<brief_summary>This is a personalized anti-cancer vaccine protocol which includes an in-situ (in the body) cancer vaccine step which combines killing a single metastatic tumor lesion by use of cryoablation in order to cause the release of tumor-specific markers to the immune system and then injecting bioengineered allogeneic immune cells (AlloStim) into the lesion as an adjuvant in order to modulate the immune response and educate the immune system to kill other tumor cells where ever they reside in the body.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AlloStim® In-Situ Vaccine in Pre-Treated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the third most common cancer worldwide. Metastasis is the main reason of death in CRC patients. The current drugs used to treat colorectal cancer provide important treatment options for patients, their limitations including drug resistance, poor efficacy and severe side effects. Development of new therapeutic strategies for KRAS mutant as well as BRAF mutant tumors are therefore highly needed in order to offer a new category of drug (immunotherapy). This study targets the population of mCRC patients that have progressed after two lines of chemotherapy and are not eligible for targeted therapies due to a mutation in KRAS or BRAF. This is a Phase II/III, randomized, open-label, multicenter, controlled, two arm study designed to determine the efficacy in terms of OS and the safety of the InSituVax (AlloStim+ Cryoablation) personalized in-situ anti-cancer vaccine protocol (Treatment Arm) compared with Physician's Choice (PC) of Treatment + Cryoablation (Control Arm) in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer. Subjects are randomized 2:1 into the treatment or control arms.</detailed_description>

Bevacizumab (Avastin®) treatment within 6 weeks of scheduled cryoablation 9. No Regorafenib prior to or during the Study Period 10. Anticoagulant medication for concomitant medical condition (unless can be safely discontinued for invasive cryoablation, biopsy and intratumoral injection procedures) 11. Prior allogeneic bone marrow/stem cell or solid organ transplant 12. Chronic use (&gt;2 weeks) of greater than physiologic doses of a corticosteroid agent (dose equivalent to&gt;5 mg/day of prednisone) within 30 days of the 1st day of study treatment o Topical corticosteroids are permitted 13. Prior diagnosis of an active autoimmune disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune thyroid disease, uveitis). Well controlled Type I diabetes allowed. 14. Prior experimental therapy 15. History of blood transfusion reactions 16. Known allergy to bovine products 17. Progressive viral or bacterial infection o All infections must be resolved and the patient must remain afebrile for seven days without antibiotics prior to being placed on study 18. Cardiac disease of symptomatic nature 19. History of HIV positivity or AIDS 20. Concurrent medication known to interfere with platelet function or coagulation (e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen, clopidogrel, or warfarin) unless such medications can be discontinued for an appropriate time period based on the drug halflife and known activity (e.g., aspirin for 7 days) prior to cryoablation procedure 21. History of severe hypersensitivity to monoclonal antibody drugs or any contraindication to any of the study drugs 22. Psychiatric or addictive disorders or other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude study participation</criteria>
