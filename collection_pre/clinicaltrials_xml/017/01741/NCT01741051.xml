	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to use an air filter intervention to evaluate the relationship between particulate matter air pollution exposure during pregnancy and fetal growth. We hypothesize that: 1) portable high efficiency air (HEPA) filters will produce major reductions in home indoor concentrations of particulate matter and 2) pregnant women whose exposures to particulate matter are reduced by this intervention will give birth to children with greater mean body weight for gestational age.</brief_summary>
