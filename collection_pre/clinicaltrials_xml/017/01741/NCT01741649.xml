	<brief_summary>Many solutions are used for cleaning the skin of a patient previous to a surgery. Although the efficacy of clorhexidine has been proved in other surgical procedures, there is only a retrospective study in cesarean section (they report no benefit of one solution over the other). The investigators would like to evaluate the difference in surgical site infection in patients after cesarean section comparing preparation of the skin with clorhexidine versus povidone.</brief_summary>
