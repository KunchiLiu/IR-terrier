	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to estimate and compare the objective response rate of SPI-1620 administered in combination with docetaxel in patients with NSCLC and to determine the safety of SPI-1620 when administered in combination with docetaxel.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of SPI-1620 in Combination With Docetaxel Versus Docetaxel Alone for Patients With Non Small-cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a two part study. In Single Arm Part, patients will receive 11 μg/m2 of SPI-1620 IV followed by docetaxel 75 mg/m2 IV. Cycles will continue every 3 weeks until progression or intolerable toxicity. Overall 27 patients will be enrolled in the Single Arm Part. If 6 or more responses (CR/PR) are observed in this group then the Randomized Part will be initiated. In the Randomized Part approximately 200 patients (100 per arm) will be randomized to receive SPI-1620 plus docetaxel or docetaxel alone. In the experimental arm, patients will receive 11 μg/m2 of SPI-1620 IV followed by docetaxel 75 mg/m2 IV administered in 3-week cycles until progression or intolerable toxicity. In the control arm, patients will receive 75 mg/m2 docetaxel in 3-week cycles until progression or intolerable toxicity.</detailed_description>
