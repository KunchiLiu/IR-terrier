	<brief_summary>The metabolic syndrome is increasingly being recognized as a major threat to good health - especially cardiovascular health - and its frequency appears to be increasing in relation to the current epidemic of obesity. The objective of this study is to determine whether a program of enhanced lifestyle intervention can, compared to standard care, reduce the frequency and severity of the metabolic syndrome as assessed by clinical, metabolic, inflammatory and vascular outcome measures. EC will consist of a 17-session structured, lifestyle intervention plan, directed at achieving weight reduction and increasing physical activity change through education, behavior modification and stress management, and conducted in groups. It will comprise a 3-month Core Curriculum of 8 sessions, followed by a Maintenance phase with 9 monthly sessions delivered by lifestyle counselors, experienced in breaking through barriers in working with socioeconomically disadvantaged members of minority groups. All participants will have baseline, 6-monthly and 1-year assessments. This project, Project 2, entitled Community Health Approaches to Reducing Risk in the Metabolic Syndrome (CHARMS), seeks to study psychosocial and behavioral (lifestyle) variables that may contribute to the progression or amelioration of atherosclerotic processes underlying the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease (CHD).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The metabolic syndrome is increasingly being recognized as a major threat to good health - especially cardiovascular health - and its frequency appears to be increasing in relation to the current epidemic of obesity. The objective of this study is to determine whether a program of enhanced lifestyle intervention can, compared to standard care, reduce the frequency and severity of the metabolic syndrome as assessed by clinical, metabolic, inflammatory and vascular outcome measures. The project will compare the effects of Enhanced Care (EC) in 112 patients (80 completers) to Standard Care (SC) in 112 patients (80 completers) over a 12-month period. Following 3 run-in sessions given to both SC and EC participants, eligible subjects randomized to SC will receive lifestyle modification advice as recommended management of the metabolic syndrome and this will be administered at the baseline and the 6 month assessment visits. EC will consist of a 17-session structured, lifestyle intervention plan, directed at achieving weight reduction and increasing physical activity change through education, behavior modification and stress management, and conducted in groups. It will comprise a 3-month Core Curriculum of 8 sessions, followed by a Maintenance phase with 9 monthly sessions delivered by lifestyle counselors, experienced in breaking through barriers in working with socioeconomically disadvantaged members of minority groups. All participants will have baseline, 6-monthly and 1-year assessments. This project, Project 2, entitled Community Health Approaches to Reducing Risk in the Metabolic Syndrome (CHARMS), seeks to study psychosocial and behavioral (lifestyle) variables that may contribute to the progression or amelioration of atherosclerotic processes underlying the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease (CHD). Outcome variables will include measures of glycemic control/insulin resistance and/or dyslipidemia, oxidative stress, inflammation and overt manifestations of disease.</detailed_description>
