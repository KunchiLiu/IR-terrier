	<brief_summary>Braces have been used o treat stable (not requiring surgery) burst fractures with much success. Recently questions have been raised in regards to the importance of the brace. Some studies have results that suggest a brace is not important in having a good outcome. However, this has never been proven. This study is being conducted to see whether or not wearing a brace is important to having a good outcome.</brief_summary>
