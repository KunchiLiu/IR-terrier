	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of sitagliptin on overall blood glucose concentrations in Type I Diabetic subjects. The study also aims to evaluate post meal glucagon concentrations in Type I Diabetic subjects (a possible mechanism of reduced blood glucose concentrations) and indices of oxidation stress in the plasma of these subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sitagliptin in Type I Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis is that Sitagliptin will improve overall blood glucose, fasting blood glucose, and glycemic excursions in patients with Type I Diabetes. In addition, sitagliptin will likely suppress indices of oxidative stress in patients. The study will investigate proposed mechanisms of improved glucose concentrations, including enhanced effect of endogenous GLP-1 and suppression of glucagon.</detailed_description>
