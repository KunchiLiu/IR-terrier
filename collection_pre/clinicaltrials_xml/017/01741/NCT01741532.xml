	<criteria>Main Males or females 4 years of age and older at screening visit; Have PKAN, confirmed by genetic testing (supporting evidence required); BAD total score â‰¥ 3 at the screening visit; Patients who have Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) systems or baclofen pumps in place will be eligible for the study, but they must have had a stable setting for at least two months prior to the screening visit and stimulation parameters / pump settings must remain stable for the duration of the trial: Main Evidence of iron deficiency defined by Fe:TIBC ratio &lt;15%, or serum ferritin &lt;12 ng/mL; Treatment with deferiprone in the past 12 months; Previous failure of treatment with deferiprone, or previous discontinuation of treatment with deferiprone due to adverse events; Conditions known to contraindicate the use of deferiprone (history of agranulocytosis or recurrent episodes of neutropenia); A serious, unstable chronic illness not related to PKAN condition during the past 3 months before screening visit including but not limited to: hepatic, renal, gastroenterologic, respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrinologic, neurologic or immunologic disease; Evidence of abnormal liver or renal function (serum liver enzyme level(s) &gt; 3 times upper limit of normal at screening) or abnormal creatinine levels at screening visit; Disorders associated with neutropenia (ANC &lt; 1.5 x 10E9/L) or thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt; 50 x 10E9/L) in the 12 months preceding the initiation of the study medication. Exception: for patients whose neutropenia was attributed by the treating physician to episodes of infection or to drugs associated with a decline in the neutrophil count and in whom the ANC has fully recovered at the screening visit; History of malignancy; Other protocol inclusion or exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
