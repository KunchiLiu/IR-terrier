	<brief_summary>Experimental studies suggest that anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory drugs could reduce the inflammatory profile in acute ischemic disease and reduce the area of ischemia. Methotrexate is a drug that has shown promise in ischemic disease in animal studies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of mETHotrexate Therapy on ST Segment Elevation MYocardial InfarctionS (TETHYS Trial)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atherosclerosis and ischemic disease have clear association with inflammation. There is an anti-inflammatory action of methotrexate by increasing adenosine. Experimental studies demonstrate reduction of infarct induced in animals treated with methotrexate. We expect a reduction in the area under the curve of creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase MB fraction (CK-MB) and Troponin I high sensitive, decreased levels of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction.</detailed_description>
