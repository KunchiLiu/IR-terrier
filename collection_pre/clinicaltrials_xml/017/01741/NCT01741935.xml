	<brief_summary>An open, single group, single center Study to confirm CTC-Actiwiseâ„¢ as a means to record and monitor the progression of a patient's COPD. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) affects growing patient groups. Current knowledge about the disease limits the investigators ability to cure or interfere with the progression of the disease. COPD is often characterized by exacerbating infections requiring emergency care. The project aims to examine whether disease progression of COPD can be better controlled by continuously monitoring the patient's physical activity, along with the assessment of pulmonary symptoms and lung function. A key question is: can investigators find indicators that provides support for early intervention before severe symptoms arise. The patient carries a smartphone that records physical activity real-time, daily lung function measures, lung disease related symptoms, and use of medication. The experimental phase, the first part of the project, covers 25 COPD patients followed up to 12 weeks where the primary objective is to examine and verify both new investigational methodology and technology.</brief_summary>
