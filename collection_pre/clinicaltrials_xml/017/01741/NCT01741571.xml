	<brief_summary>Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial fine needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) techniques have not been well studied. The investigators will conduct a randomized study comparing the diagnostic yield and specimen quality of EBUS-FNA performed with and without suction applied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Endobronchial Ultrasound Guided Fine Needle Aspiration Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Consecutive patients with suspected malignant peribronchial masses or lymph nodes undergoing endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) will be enrolled. All participants will have 4 needle aspirations of each targeted peribronchial lesion. Two needle aspirations will be performed while applying suction and 2 needle aspirations will be performed without applying suction in random order. The investigators will compare the diagnostic yield and the quality of the specimens obtained using the two techniques.</detailed_description>
