	<brief_summary>To conduct a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of a community-friendly behavioral intervention designed to reduce HIV risk behavior among injection drug users (IDUs) in drug treatment by comparing risk-behavior outcomes of four weekly intervention sessions with a time-and-attention-matched control condition.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Testing a Community-Friendly Risk Reduction Intervention for Injection Drug Users</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study will test the effects of CHRP, a community-friendly risk reduction intervention, which is based on the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills model of health behavior change (IMB; Fisher &amp; Fisher, 1992), and, thus, is designed to enhance knowledge, motivation, and behavior skills for reducing drug- and sex-related HIV risk behaviors. Outcomes assessed will include urine toxicology screens, self-reported HIV drug- and sex-related HIV risk behavior, HIV/AIDS knowledge, risk reduction motivation, and risk reduction behavioral skills. To measure the effects of CHRP, the investigators are proposing a two-condition (standard of care plus the CHRP intervention vs. standard of care plus a time-and-attention matched control condition) randomized design, balancing for participant gender. The investigators will assess participants at baseline, immediately post-intervention (i.e., at 4 weeks), and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month measurement points following the intervention. This assessment approach will allow the investigators to examine the trajectory of HIV risk reduction change including the decay or emergence of intervention effects.</detailed_description>
