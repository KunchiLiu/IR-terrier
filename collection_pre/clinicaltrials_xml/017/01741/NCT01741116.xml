	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of Dovitinib(TKI258) in patients with castration resistant prostate cancer after failure of docetaxel-based chemotherapy. Further correlative study for metabolic response using PET image and change in serum fibroblast growth factor 23(FGF23) will be conducted.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dovitinib(TKI258) in Patients With Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Growth factor signals are important in carcinogenesis and progression of prostate cancer, and fibroblast growth factors (FGF) have important roles in this regard. FGF ligands (FGF1, -2, -6, -8, and -17) and FGF receptors (FGFR1 and FGFR4) have all shown to be significantly overexpressed in prostate cancer1-5. And, the recent studies have demonstrated that the critical roles of the FGF family members are mediated by the signaling between epithelial and stromal compartments, thus, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)6,7. Moreover, a recent study has shown that FGF-2 is a mediator of second wave angiogenesis and tumor progression in men during the formation of castration-resistant tumors. Therefore, inhibition of signaling via FGF axis might be a viable strategy for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer. TKI258, an oral multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor is known to potently inhibit the class III, IV, and V RTKs, showing biochemical 50 percent inhibitory concentration(IC50) values &lt;20 nmol/L for VEGFRs (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3); the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFR-β); fibroblast growth factor receptors 1, 2, and 3 (FGFR-1,2,3); fetal liver tyrosine kinase receptor 3 (FLT-3); and KIT Ret, tyrosine kinase A (TrkA), and csf-1 RTKs. Due to the unique inhibitory activity on FGF pathways, TKI258 has shown significant activity in a variety of tumor xenograft models in athymic mice, including acute myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma, and colon- and prostate-derived models9. Castration-resistant prostate cancers (CRPC) are one of the challenges in oncology practice. Although there have been advances in chemotherapy10, new hormonal agents11, and immunotherapeutics12, patients in this subgroup still have limited life expectancy. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify therapeutic targets and clinical development of target agents for the treatment of CRPC. For this end, sorafenib has been tested in multiple phase II studies earlier13-17; however, the clinical efficacy was very limited. The low efficacy of sorafenib might be partly explained by the lower potency in inhibition of RTKs. Considering nanomolar concentration range of IC50 for TKI258 compared with micromolar concentration for other multi-TKIs, the efficacy of TKI258 should be evaluated in CRPC patients.</detailed_description>
