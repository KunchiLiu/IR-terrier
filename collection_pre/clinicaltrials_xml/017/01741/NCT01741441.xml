	<brief_summary>After laparoscopic total fundoplication (LTF) 12-15% of patients have persistent reflux symptoms and 20-25% develop gas-related symptoms. Reflux symptoms, gas bloating and inability to belch occurring after surgery have been associated with mixed (acid and weakly acid) (MR) or weakly acidic reflux (WAR). To date, few studies have evaluated functional outcome after LTF in patients with MR or WAR, with the majority reporting only short-term results. It has been shown that delayed gastric emptying (DGE) might also be an important factor for abdominal distension and adverse outcome after LTF.9,10 However, the correlation between poor long-term outcome after LTF and DGE is controversial. In addition, the effect of DGE in patients with MR or WAR is poorly investigated.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In the last years the study of gastro-oesophageal reflux has been revolutionized by the development of combined 24-h esophageal pH and multichannel intraluminal impedance (MII) monitoring. Combined esophageal MII and pH-monitoring allow for the timed correlation of esophageal pH changes with reflux events and achieve high sensitivity for the detection of acid (pH &lt;4), weakly acidic (pH 4-7) and weakly alkaline (pH &gt;7) reflux episodes. Use of this technology is bringing into focus the potential role of weakly acidic and weakly alkaline reflux in symptoms that persist despite acid suppressive therapy or anti-reflux surgery.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The study population consisted of consecutive patients with weakly acidic gastroesophageal reflux (GER) confirmed by 24 hour pH and impedance monitoring and eligible for laparoscopic antireflux surgery (LARS). Exclusion criteria were presence of severe gastric emptying, functional heartburn, giant hiatal hernia, underlying primary esophageal motility disorder, American Association of Anaesthetists (ASA) score IV, previous upper abdominal surgery, and contraindications to pneumoperitoneum.</criteria>
