	<brief_summary>The study will compare the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and tolerability of long-term infusion of lyophilized landiolol (LDLL600) against esmolol (Brevibloc) by measurement of blood concentrations of landiolol, esmolol and their metabolites, and by monitoring systemic cardiovascular and local tolerability, blood pressure (BP), ECG including heart rate (HR) and adverse events (AEs).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-term PK and Safety/Tolerability Testing LDLL600 Against Esmolol in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>12 subjects will be administered LDLL600 and Brevibloc in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over setting. PK, systemic cardiovascular and local tolerability and safety of 24-hour long infusions of three dose levels of both Investigational Medicinal Products (IMPs) during each treatment period will be assessed. Each treatment period will consist of: Dose level 1 (LOW) for 2 hours (h) Dose level 2 (MEDIUM)for 2 hours Dose level 3 (HIGH)for 2 hours PK and tolerability observation at dose level 3, 2 or 1 will be continued for 18 hours in order to end up with a total infusion period of 24 h Post-infusion follow-up (FU)for 6 hours after infusion termination The duration of the wash-out period between treatment periods will be at least two days. Each subject, if confirmed eligible, will complete two treatment periods in total. In case of poor tolerability, alternative dosing schemes will be followed.</detailed_description>

Pregnancy and/or breastfeeding. History of serious clinical illness that can impact fate of drugs. Use of organ toxic drugs within 3 months before the first dose. Any drug with a welldefined potential for toxicity to a major organ or system is to be considered here. Systemic multiple dose treatment with drugs altering hepatic metabolism or monoamineoxidase (MAO) inhibitors within 30 days before the first dose. Donation of 1) 400 mL of blood or more within 60 days, or 2) more than 150 mL of blood within 30 days, or 3) plasma or platelets within 14 days before the first dose.
