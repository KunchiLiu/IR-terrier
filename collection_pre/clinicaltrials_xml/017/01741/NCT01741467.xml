	<brief_title>The Effect of Real Time Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Subjects With Pre-diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The protocol is a prospective, non-blinded, randomized controlled study in persons with newly diagnosed pre-diabetes comparing the effects of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RT-CGM) combined with diet and lifestyle education to those who have diet and lifestyle education alone. During a "wash-in" phase both groups will wear a masked CGM for 1 week at baseline and again after 12 weeks. Those randomized to the RT-CGM will wear it for 4 cycles of 2 week on/1 week off over the next 12 weeks. Both groups will follow-up with their primary care providers as clinically indicated over the next year with quarterly measurements of blood pressure, weight, and BMI. At the end of this period, they will wear a masked CGM for 1 week.</detailed_description>
