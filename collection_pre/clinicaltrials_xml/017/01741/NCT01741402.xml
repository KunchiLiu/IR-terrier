	<brief_summary>The objective of this work was to compare the effects of two balance training programs, one Nintendo Wii Fit-based and the other traditionally-based without the use of a gaming system, on the (1) balance, (2) gait, (3) functionality and (4) cognition ability in older adults. It is a prospective, single blinded, randomized clinical trial performed at Center of Research of the courses of Speech Therapy, Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy of São Paulo University. Thirty-two older adults are randomly in control and experimental group, 16 each one. The study includes only participants scoring at least 24 in the Mini-Mental State Examination to rule out effects of dementia; without the presence of depression, according to the Geriatric Depression Scale of Yesaváge - version 15 (GDS-15 ≤ 5) and scores on the Berg Balance Scale (EBB ≥ 41).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective of this work is to compare the effects of two balance training programs, one Nintendo Wii Fit-based and the other traditionally-based without the use of a gaming system, on balance, gait, functionality and cognition ability in older adults. It is a prospective, single blinded, randomized clinical trial performed at Center of Research of the courses of Speech Therapy, Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy of São Paulo University. Thirty-two older adults are randomly in control and experimental group, 16 each one. Both groups performed 14 training sessions, twice a week, for seven weeks. Each session is composed of a 30 minute-global-exercise series including stretching, muscle strength and axial mobility exercises. After this, both groups performed more 30 minutes of balance training: the control group performed balance exercises without external cues, visual or auditory feedbacks or cognitive stimulations; the experimental group performed the balance training with 10 Wii Fit games which stimulated motor and cognitive functions. The main outcome measures are: (1) Mini-BESTest of Dynamic Balance Evaluation; (2) Dynamic Gait Index (DGI); (3) Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); and (4) Falls Efficacy Scale - International (FES-I).</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Age 60 to 85 years. Absence of other neurological disorders or comorbidities that may affect gait; Absence of dementia (score above 24 on the Mini Mental State Examination MMSE); Absence of depression (score above 5 on the Geriatric Depression Scale of Yesaváge version 15); Score on the Berg Balance Scale above 41; Vision and hearing adequate or corrected to normal; Ability to walk independently; Biomechanical alterations (other pathologies) that could compromise the completion of training; Presence of any neurological, auditory or visual deficit that could compromise distracting task performance during balance and gait training;</criteria>
