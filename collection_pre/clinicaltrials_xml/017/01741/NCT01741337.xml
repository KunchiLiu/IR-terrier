	<brief_title>PAC-IC-SAS Pilot Study - Central Sleep Apneas Syndrome and Ventricular Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial is a pilot study, on patients with central sleep apneas syndrome and heart failure, undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery or other coronary reperfusion, and then randomized for the adaptive servo-ventilation treatment application or not after surgery. The first objective is to evaluate the effect of an early treatment of sleep-disordered breathing by adaptive servo-ventilation in heart failure patient, in terms of ventricular recovery (ejection fraction improvement). This treatment will be instaurated just after coronary artery bypass graft surgery or other coronary reperfusion. Secondary objectives : - Assessment of adaptive servo-ventilation effect on the endothelial function, the systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, the insulin resistance, after the surgery in comparison with non treated patient with heart failure and central sleep apneas. - Assessment of the impact of nocturnal desaturation level on the vascular reactivity and atherosclerosis of mammary vessels collected only during coronary artery bypass graft surgery. - Assessment of the impact of nocturnal desaturation level on the oxidative stress, inflammation and insulin sensitivity on abdominal and epicardiac adipose tissue collected during surgery.</detailed_description>
