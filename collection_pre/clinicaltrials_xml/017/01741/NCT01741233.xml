	<brief_summary>The overall purpose of the study is to investigate whether there is a relationship between 26 different single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the vitamin D pathway, ultraviolet B (UV-B) irradiation of the skin and vitamin D status. The hypothesis is that vitamin D status are influated by different genetic genotypes in the vitamin D pathway.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this study approximately 80 participants (over 18 years) are included. All the participants has previously participated in the VitmaD intervention study (NCT01184716) . Participants will in total receive 4 times UV-B irradiation (3 SED) with two day apart each time, to stimulate vitamin D production in the skin. The participants skintype will be measured. The study starts in January 2013 and runs to the end of Marts 2013. During this winter period, it is in Denmark not possible to produce vitamin D in the skin through sunlight exposure.</detailed_description>
