	<brief_summary>This study will explore safety and efficacy of allogeneic umbilical cord (UC) derived mesenchymal stem cells transplantation (MSCT) to treat patients with active and refractory systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who have been resistant to multiple standard treatments. The underlying hypothesis is that the active SLE condition is caused by an abnormal immune homeostasis that can be restored by MSCT.</brief_summary>
