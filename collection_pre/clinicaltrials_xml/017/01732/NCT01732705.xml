	<brief_title>High Intensity Interval Training (HIT) in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physical exercise increases insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle in healthy as well as in individuals with type 2 diabetes, but implies a considerable time commitment. High intensity interval training (HIT) is time-efficient exercise consisting of repeated bouts of short duration high intensive workloads. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of HIT in patients with type 2 diabetes, and to clarify the mechanisms of a possible positive effect of HIT. Exercise is performed as 2 weeks one-legged training on an ergometer bicycle. Thus one leg serves as a control leg. Insulin sensitivity in trained and non-trained muscle will be measured after completion of the overall training program by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp method and a-v catheterization of both legs. Muscle biopsies will be obtained during training period for measuring of muscle glycogen content, and muscle biopsies for further analysis obtained during the experimental day.</detailed_description>
