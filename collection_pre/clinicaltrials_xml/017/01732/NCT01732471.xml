	<criteria>Willing and able to provide written informed consent (for children under 18 years old the parent[s]/guardians give informed consent, subjects 1417 years old give additionally their own written informed consent) Age of 4 18 years, inclusive Confirmed clinical and biochemical hyperphenylalaninemia due to phenylketonuria documented by past medical history with at least 2 blood phenylalanine level greater than or equal to 400 micromole per liter obtained in 2 separate occasions Blood phenylalanine level at screening greater than or equal to 450 micromole per liter (mean of two measurements) For women of childbearing potential, a negative urine pregnancy test is required at screening and willingness to use a highly effective method of contraception is required while participating in the study Subject and/or the parent/guardian willing and able to comply with study procedures Subject and/or the parent/guardian willing to continue current diet unchanged during the 8 days response test and to adapt the diet according to phenylalanine therapeutic target range during the 6 week treatment period Subject already assessed for responsiveness to sapropterin dihydrochloride or other tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) Used any investigational agent other than Kuvan速 (sapropterin dihydrochloride) within 30 days of screening, or required any investigational agent or vaccine prior to completion of all scheduled study assessments Pregnant or breastfeeding, or considering pregnancy Concurrent disease or conditions that would interfere with study participation or safety (for example, seizure disorder, asthma or other condition requiring oral or parenteral corticosteroid administration, insulindependent diabetes, or organ transplantation recipient) Concurrent use of required concomitant treatment with any drug known to inhibit folate synthesis (for example, methotrexate), levodopa, phosphodiesterase type5 (PDE5) inhibitors (such as, sildenafil, vardenafil or tadalafil), medications that are known to affect nitric oxide synthesis metabolism or action Any conditions, that, in the view of the Principal Investigator renders the subject at high risk for failure to comply with treatment or to complete the study Clinical diagnosis of primary BH4 deficiency Known hypersensitivity to Kuvan速 (sapropterin dihydrochloride) or its excipients or to other approved or nonapproved formulation of tetrabiopterin</criteria>
