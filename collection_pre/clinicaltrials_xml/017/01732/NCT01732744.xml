	<brief_summary>To evaluate the efficacy of a castor bean-based solution (Ricinus communis) for removal of complete denture biofilm, comparing it with two products available on the market (sodium hypochlorite and alkaline peroxide). Fifty complete maxillary denture-wearers were instructed to brush their dentures after meals and once a day, for a period of 07 days, immerse them in the following solutions: A - Control: Physiological solution(20 minutes). B - Polident alkaline peroxide(3 minutes). C - 1% sodium hypochlorite(20 minutes). D - castor bean-based solution(20 minutes). The participants immersed their dentures in each of the solutions, according to a randomized sequence. For biofilm quantification, before (Baseline) and after the use of each product, the internal surfaces of maxillary complete dentures were revealed (1% neutral red), photographed and the stained biofilm was quantified with the aid of software (Image Tool 3.0). After concluding measurements of the areas (total and biofilm), the percentage of surface covered by biofilm of the complete denture was calculated .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study sought to minimize the occurrence of bias, and whenever possible sought to "blind" the parties involved (researchers, volunteers and statisticians), since none of them had knowledge of the allocation of treatments. The present study also followed the criteria described in the CONSORT Declaration</detailed_description>
