	<brief_title>A Phase-II Study Of Raltitrexed/Oxaliplatin Plus Radiotherapy Versus Radiotherapy In Subjects With Inoperable Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>108 patients were randomized to receive Raltitrexed/Oxaliplatin Plus Radiotherapy (Raltitrexed 2.5mg/㎡ d1,Oxaliplatin 100mg/㎡ d1,q21d Plus Radiotherapy 2.0Gy/day, 5 times/week,6 weeks.)or Radiotherapy ( Radiotherapy 2.0Gy/day, 5 times/week,6 weeks) in subjects with Inoperable esophageal cancer. All patients will receive therapy of six weeks unless disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients were evaluated every 3 months .Progression-Free-Survival was the primary endpoint. Response Rate, Overall survival, toxicity of the therapy are other second endpoint.</detailed_description>
