	<detailed_description>The descriptive study is two folded: 1) Description of the rehabilitation centers and the content the respective clinic presents as specialized rehabilitation. A description of the expected change this input will result in in form of patients change in ADL and life satisfaction, with repeated measurements: 2a) reports of change in activities of daily living from baseline, to one fixed time (18-22 days in rehab),at discharge (which will vary),6 and 12 months post discharge (relatively fixed time) . 2b) reports of possible change in life satisfaction at baseline, discharge, 6 and 12 months after discharge. Since the times for admission is expected to vary, which will be described under 1),we also want to measure if and how this difference might influence results. Therefore a fixed measure is inserted between admission and discharge. we have added a "relatively" fixed date at 6 months post stroke in order to see if change of function from specialized rehabilitation will differ in a longitudinal perspective, and if possible to see if the difference in time to admission (time from debut till admission in specialized rehabilitation)might influence results. 3) description of psycho- social factors at 6 and 12 months post discharge</detailed_description>
