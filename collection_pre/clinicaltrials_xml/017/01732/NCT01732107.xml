	<criteria>Histologically confirmed early stage urothelial carcinoma of the bladder defined as Ta, T1, or Tis stage. Presence of either an FGFR3 mutation or FGFR3 overexpression within bladder tumor tissue. Documented BCGrefractory disease defined as failure to achieve a tumor free state after at least 2 prior induction courses of intravesical BCG therapy. Medically unfit to undergo cystectomy or electively choosing to forego cystectomy Patients who give a written informed consent obtained according to local guidelines Patients with muscleinvasive (i.e. T2, T3, T4), locally advanced nonresectable, or metastatic urothelial carcinoma as assessed on baseline radiographic imaging obtained within 28 days prior to study registration. Patients with concurrent upper urinary tract (i.e. ureter, renal pelvis) noninvasive urothelial carcinoma. Patients with another primary malignancy within 3 years prior to starting study drug, with the exception of adequately treated insitu carcinoma of the uterine cervix, clinically localized prostate cancer, biochemically relapsed nonmetastatic prostate cancer (i.e., PSA only disease), or skin cancer (such as basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or nonmelanomatous skin cancer) Patients who have received the last administration of an anticancer therapy including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and monoclonal antibodies ≤ 4 weeks prior to starting study drug, or who have not recovered from the side effects of such therapy Patients who have received prior VEGFRtargeted or FGFRtargeted agents (i.e., sunitinib, pazopanib, sorafenib, bevacizumab, axitinib, etc.). Patients who have had radiotherapy ≤ 4 weeks prior to starting study drug, or who have not recovered from radiotherapy toxicities Patients who have undergone major surgery (e.g. intrathoracic, intraabdominal or intrapelvic), open biopsy or significant traumatic injury ≤ 4 weeks prior to starting study drug, or patients who have had minor procedures (i.e., TURBT), percutaneous biopsies or placement of vascular access device ≤ 1 week prior to starting study drug, or who have not recovered from side effects of such procedure or injury Uncontrolled hypertension defined by a systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 160 mm Hg and/or d iastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 100 mm Hg, with or without antihypertensive medication(s) Impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of dovitinib (e.g., ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small bowel resection) Cirrhosis, chronic active hepatitis or chronic persistent hepatitis Known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (HIV testing is not mandatory) Patients who are currently receiving anticoagulation treatment with therapeutic doses of warfarin. Fulldose anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin is permitted. Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled concomitant medical conditions (e.g., active or uncontrolled infection, uncontrolled diabetes) that could cause unacceptable safety risks or compromise compliance with the protocol Pregnant or breastfeeding women Women of childbearing potential, who are biologically able to conceive, not employing two forms of highly effective contraception. Highly effective contraception must be used throughout the trial and up to 8 weeks after the last dose of study drug (e.g. male condom with spermicidal; diaphragm with spermicide; intrauterine device). Oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives that may be affected by cytochrome P450 interactions are not considered effective for this study. Women of childbearing potential, defined as sexually mature women who have not undergone a hysterectomy or who have not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., who has had menses any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months), must have a negative serum pregnancy test ≤ 14 days prior to starting study drug. Fertile males not willing to use contraception, as stated above Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol</criteria>
