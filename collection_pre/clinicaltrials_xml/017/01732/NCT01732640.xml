	<brief_summary>Trial Objectives: The objective is to investigate the efficacy and safety of afatinib with induction chemotherapy in primary unresected patients with locally advanced, HPV-negative, stage III or IVa/b HNSCC including oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx. Primary Objective Phase I The primary objective of the phase I portion of the trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the recommended phase II dose of daily oral afatinib that is safe in combination with carboplatin AUC 6 and paclitaxel 175mg/m2 q 21 days as an induction regimen. Primary Objective Phase 2 The primary objective of the phase 2 portion of the trial is to estimate the objective tumor response rate and toxicity with induction therapy in patients treated on the afatinib dose determined in Phase I. Secondary Objectives The secondary objective of phase II is to estimate: 1) the overall response to entire treatment after completion of CRT, 2) progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 2 years, and 3) overall survival (OS) at 2 years.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Study Afatinib/Carboplatin/Paclitaxel Induction Chemotherapy In HPV-Negative HNSCC.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase I/phase II prospective multicenter trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of afatinib with induction chemotherapy in primary unresected patients with HPV-negative locally advanced SCC stage III or IVa/b of oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx. The primary endpoint is overall response rate after the completion of induction chemotherapy. Eligible patients will begin with a 14 day lead-in period with afatinib alone. This will be followed immediately by 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy with carboplatin AUC 6 IV, paclitaxel 175mg/m2 day 1, and afatinib as a continuous daily dosing. Each cycle is repeated every 21 days. All patients will receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy beginning 2-3 weeks after the completion of the second cycle of induction chemotherapy (Refer to Study Schema in page 8 of the protocol). During the period of induction chemotherapy, a complete history and physical (including weight) and tumor assessment by physical examination on Day 1 of each cycle will be performed and documented. Complete blood count with differential and a comprehensive metabolic profile will be performed weekly. After completion of induction chemotherapy, reassessment with blood work, physical exam, CT/MRI of neck and nasopharyngolaryngoscopy will be performed. After the completion of CRT, the patient will have a MRI, CT, or FDG PET approximately 12 weeks after CRT. Follow-up will be standard of care from this point onwards. Physical exam, blood work and AE assessments will also be frequently performed during entire treatment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma, operable or inoperable tumors, stage III (T3N01) and IVAB (T14 N23M0 or T4N01M0) of oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx. For patients with oropharynx primary, either HPV negative or HPV positive with a &gt; 10 pack year tobacco history or current smokers are eligible. HPV status should be determined before the enrollment in only nonsmokers with oropharynx primary by HPV insitu hybridization and/or p16 immunostain. 2. Patients must have measurable disease of primary, nodes or both by clinical and radiographic methods per RECIST v1.1.. 3. No prior therapy, including surgery with curative intent, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, EGFR targeted therapies, or any other investigational agents. 4. Age &gt;= 18 years. 5. ECOG performance status 01. 6. Patients must have normal hepatic, renal and bone marrow function. Absolute neutrophil count &gt;=1,000/ mm3 Count Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mm3 Count Total serum bilirubin =&lt; 1.5mg/dL Level: AST and ALT =&lt; 2.5 X ULN Alkaline Phosphatase =&lt; 2.5 X ULN Total calculated creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 mL/min 7. Patients with a history of a curatively treated malignancy must be diseasefree for at least two years except for carcinoma in situ of cervix and/or nonmelanomatous skin cancer. 8. Patients with the following within the last 6 months prior to preregistration must be evaluated by a cardiologist and/or neurologist prior to entry into the study. Congestive heart failure &gt; NYHA Class II CVA/TIA Unstable angina Myocardial infarction (with or without ST elevation) 9. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. 1. Any prior radiation above the clavicles. 2. Any prior invasive malignancy (unless nonmelanomatous resectable skin or the DFS is 2 years or more). 3. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biological composition to afatinib, or other agents used in study. 4. Cardiac left ventricular dysfunction with resting ejection fraction of less than institutional lower limit of normal ( if no lower limit of normal is defined in the institution, the lower limit is 50%) 5. Gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an inability to take or absorb oral or enteral medication. 6. Baseline significant gastrointestinal symptoms with diarrhoea as a major symptom or a CTCAE Grade &gt;1 diarrhoea of any etiology. 7. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. 8. Women of childbearing potential and sexually active males are strongly advised to use an accepted and effective method of contraception. 9. Known preexisting interstitial lung disease (ILD) 10. Pregnant women are excluded.</criteria>
