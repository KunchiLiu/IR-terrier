Participants in the standard split-dose regimen arm will prepare and take MOVIPREP® solution in split doses - ½ of dose (1 litre) the evening before + ½ of dose (1 litre) of MOVIPREP® preparation in the morning of the day of the colonoscopy. The study consists of three visits. Participation in the study lasts no more than 11 days; 3 days as minimum.
