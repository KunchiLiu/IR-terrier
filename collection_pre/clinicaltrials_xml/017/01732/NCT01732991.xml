	<brief_summary>The PVP by Greenlight laser 180W is becoming a potential therapeutic alternative in the treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) as recommended. The PVP creates a prostatic box after the vaporization of the prostatic tissue of BPH. The underlying prostatic tissue is the site of an ischemic necrosis secondary to the thermal effects of proximity of the PVP. We intend to measure by prostatic MRI and contrast-enhanced ultrasound the necrosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing the Impact of the PVP With Greenlight Laser Using Prostatic MRI and Contrast-enhanced Ultrasound</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The laser PVP with an optical fiber firing side carries out a vaporization of next prostatic tissue and a necrosis of underlying prostatic tissue which corresponds to a postoperative inflammatory area. One of the side effects of this technique is the irritative syndrome which may involve urinary frequency, urgency or burning urination in approximately 10 to 20% at 1 month. The current literature does report neither the analysis of the underlying inflammatory necrotic area in prostatic vaporized tissue, nor the analysis of the urinary irritative signs post-laser PVP. Progresses in the field of functional ultrasound imaging allow us to consider a study of evolution of the underlying necrotic area devoid of micro-vascularisation under effect of PVP laser. The parallel with results of MRI (radiological technique most referenced) during the same period would help to support the experimental results of prostatic contrast-enhanced ultrasound.</detailed_description>
