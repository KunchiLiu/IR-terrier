A prospective subject should not be included in the study until the condition has resolved or the febrile event has subsided Receipt of oral or injectable antibiotic therapy within 3 days prior to any blood draw. Should a subject receive oral or injectable antibiotic therapy within 3 days prior to any blood draw, the Investigator will postpone the blood draw until it has been 3 days since the subject last received oral or injectable antibiotic therapy. Postponement must still be within the timeframe for blood draw indicated in the Table of Study Procedures, when possible Identified as an Investigator or employee of the Investigator or study center with direct involvement in the proposed study, or identified as an immediate family member (i.e., parent, spouse, natural or adopted child) of the Investigator or employee with direct involvement in the proposed study.</criteria>
