	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to find out whether preterm infants are receiving enough of the essential and long chain fatty acids important for brain development and immune function. Our current intravenous (IV) fats do not contain the long chain fatty acids and different milk sources have different compositions. We would like to evaluate lactating mothers dietary intake and breastmilk level of fatty acid status by doing an analysis of their blood and breastmilk samples after they have been supplemented with a currently used fatty acid supplement (DHA- Martek Biosciences, now known as Dutch State Mines (DSM) Nutritional Lipid) The DHA supplement is available over the counter. The information learned from this research study may benefit other mothers and babies in the future. The information could help make sure premature babies are receiving the right nutrients they need for appropriate growth and development.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We designed a prospective, randomized trial to test the hypotheses that DHA supplementation to human milk providers will increase DHA concentration in milk and infant blood levels; and that infants receiving milk from DHA-supplemented providers will be receiving a more appropriate enteral intake to better mimic intrauterine accretion. In addition, we hypothesize that pro-inflammatory cytokines will be reduced in the mothers and infants receiving the higher DHA diet.</detailed_description>
