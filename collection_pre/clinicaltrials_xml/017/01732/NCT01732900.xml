	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the performance of a genetic assay, GemART, in cumulus cells predictive of embryo viability, and pregnancy success in women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). Performance is defined as success rate per embryo transferred, as measured by the implantation rate of embryos transferred.</brief_summary>
