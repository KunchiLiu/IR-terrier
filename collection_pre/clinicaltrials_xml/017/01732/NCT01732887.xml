	<brief_summary>In this study we are testing computer-based brain fitness exercises. The games are designed to improve people's cognitive abilities brain functions, like memory, concentration, and ability to do two things at once. We are testing whether this cognitive training brain exercises will improve understanding of spoken sentences speech comprehension in people who use cochlear implant and/or hearing aids. We predict that cognitive training will improve speech comprehension in cochlear implant and/or hearing aid users.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Short-term Effects of Computerized Brain Fitness Exercises in Adult Cochlear Implant and/or Hearing Aid Users</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aural rehabilitation is a life long process in spite of advanced innovative implant technology. Existing standard therapy is inadequate for some people, because even after years of surgery many implant users does not obtain significant benefits, like improved understanding of spoken sentences. In many cases it seems that the speech comprehension deficits are linked to particular cognitive functions in cochlear implant users, including memory and attention. In this study we will test whether a computer-based set of "cognitive fitness" or "brain training" games designed to improve memory and attention will help cochlear implant and hearing aid users to understand speech better. Cochlear implant and hearing aid users will complete 10 weeks of computer-based cognitive training on their home computers. Half of participants will do this training immediately after being enrolled in the study; the other half will receive the training beginning 10 weeks after they are enrolled. Speech comprehension and cognitive abilities will be assessed at baseline, 10, 20 and 30 weeks in all participants.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult cochlear implant users, and/or people with moderate/severe hearing loss using bilateral hearing aids, aged 19 or above Access to an internetconnect device that supports flash, and basic computer skills Medically stable patients Patients with epilepsy, severe visual and cognitive difficulties, chronic fatigue syndrome, and serious comorbid conditions which could be exacerbated by the computer training games will be excluded for safety reasons. Patients who are unlikely to adhere to the intervention due to dementia, Parkinson's disease, Parkinsonplus syndrome, movement disorders or disability that would impair the person's ability to perform the training (e.g., problems with attention, alertness, or learning disorders) Participants who cannot speak English (since study materials are only in English), or unable to give consent.</criteria>
