	<brief_title>Retinal Venous Pressure (RVP) in Normals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The retinal venous pressure (RVP) is an increasingly important dimension in the clinical assessment of retinal blood flow. In literature only very few and also divergent data on the retinal venous pressure in healthy volunteers are described.
