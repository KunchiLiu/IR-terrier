	<criteria>Patients 18 and older. Patients willing and able to sign consent. Patients with an organ confined renal mass planning to undergo a robotic assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN). Patient with Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) equal to or greater than 40. Patients under 18. Patients with Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) less than 40. Patients with nonorgan confined renal masses (invading renal vein, inferior vena cava, perirenal tissue, ipsilateral adrenal gland, or metastasis). Patients with bilateral synchronous renal masses. Patients who can not discontinue Plavix, Coumadin or other antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications. Patients with renal lesions determined to be too complex to perform a RAPN without clamp by the surgeon. (The renal mass may be deemed too difficult based on preoperatively radiological findings. The surgeon's decision to exclude a mass from a robotic assisted partial nephrectomy would be based on a higher risk of positive margin or complication if a RAPN was performed.)</criteria>
