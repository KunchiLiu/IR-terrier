	<brief_title>Study for Consolidation Period of Chronic Hepatitis B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According to practice guidelines of American Association of the Study of Liver Diseases, in patients of HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B, treatment should be continued until the patient has achieved HBeAg seroconversion and undetectable serum HBV DNA and completed at least 6 months of additional treatment after appearance of anti-HBe. Also several other current guidelines of anti-viral treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection suggest that nucleos (t) ide analogues treatment can be stopped following 6 to 12 months of consolidation therapy after HBeAg seroconversion. However, there is a paucity of data available about the long-term durability of Tenofovir induced HBeAg seroconversion as well as antiviral treatment associated resistance risk. 2. Primary end points: HBeAg seroconversion was defined as loss of HBeAg with concurrent appearance of HBeAb. Serological recurrence was defined as reappearance of HBeAg. Virological recurrence was defined as an increase of HBV DNA level to greater than 10,000 copies/mL after HBeAg seroconversion with previously HBV DNA levels less than 10,000 copies/mL. 3. Aims: To clarify the issue of adequate duration of consolidation period which could strike a balance between durable HBeAg seroconversion and avoiding long-term inevitable serological or virological recurrence. 4. Study design: A single-center cohort study which randomly allocating two different extended TDF treatment periods after HBeAg seroconversion - 12 months, and 18 months across patient groups. Then data will be collected about outcomes at a specific follow-up time.</detailed_description>
