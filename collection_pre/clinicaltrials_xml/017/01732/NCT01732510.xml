	<brief_summary>This is a 3-part study to assess the safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and immunogenicity of MK-8226 in participants with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Part 1 (multiple rising dose study) objectives were to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MK-8226 and to assess safety and PK. Part 2 objectives were to determine safety, PK, and preliminary efficacy. Part 3 objectives were to further define safety and PK, and explore MK-8226 PK/PD to model the optimal dose range for future studies. The study was terminated early due to business reasons on 08 May 2014; final results from an analysis for Part 1 (efficacy, PK, safety, immunogenicity) and Part 2 (safety, immunogenicity) are summarized.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Intravenous MK-8226 in Participants With Moderate-to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis (MK-8226-003)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part 1 of the study is a multiple rising dose assessment of the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of MK-8226 for a period of 12 weeks followed by a 20-week off-treatment follow-up period. Part 2 of the study is an assessment of the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of MK-8226 for 12 weeks followed by a 20-week off-treatment follow-up period. In Part 3 of the study, participants will be treated with MK-8226 for a period of 12 weeks followed by a 20-week off-treatment follow-up period to evaluate pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic correlations to assist with modeling the dose range planned for further studies.</detailed_description>
