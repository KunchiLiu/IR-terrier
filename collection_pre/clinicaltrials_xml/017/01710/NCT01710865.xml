	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a new hydrophilic sealant (Ultraseal XT Hydro) compared to the previously existing hydrophobic sealant materials (Ultraseal XT Plus) which requires prime and dry to dry the tooth surface.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Two Sealant Materials Over 5 Years</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The new hydrophobic sealant material eliminates the step of prime and drying the tooth which prevents from over drying the tooth surface and decreases chair time, which is important when working with children. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the materials. The alternate hypothesis is that the Ultraseal XT Hydro is a better material.</detailed_description>
