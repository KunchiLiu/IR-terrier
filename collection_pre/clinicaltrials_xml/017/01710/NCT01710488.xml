	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to determine the percentage of patients with "therapeutic success" at the end of the cycle of antibiotic therapy (10 days), in the two treatment groups (levofloxacin and prulifloxacin). The effect of study treatments will be evaluated on the basis of a score determined in relation to the signs-symptoms of acute exacerbation of COPD (sputum purulence, sputum volume, cough, dyspnea, fever)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Between Levofloxacin and Prulifloxacin, in Internal Medicine Patients With Acute Exacerbation of COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim of this study was to examine the effects of the use of fluoroquinolones a class of antibiotics introduced relatively recently, in a particular population of patients with acute exacerbation of COPD, previously treated unsuccessfully with other antibiotics, and hospitalized in Internal Medicine. These patients reflect the reality of patients admitted to Internal Medicine, they are characterized by a high frequency of advanced age, polypathology, with multiple treatments.</detailed_description>
