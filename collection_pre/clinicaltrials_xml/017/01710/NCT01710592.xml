	<brief_summary>Whilst oxaliplatin and docetaxel have established activity in the treatment of advanced gastro-oesophageal cancer, their role, however, in the management of this disease remains unclear. Furthermore it is unclear whether this disease is optimally treated with a combination of two or three cytotoxic drugs. This trial aims to determine whether the combination of oxaliplatin and weekly docetaxel warrants further investigation in a formal phase III trial. The combination of epirubicin, oxaliplatin and capecitabine will be the comparator arm for this evaluation. Primary Objective: Determine in a randomised study if the response rate to docetaxel and oxaliplatin (ElTax) is comparable to epirubicin, oxaliplatin and capecitabine (EOX) and warrants further evaluation in advanced gastro-oesophageal cancer. Secondary Objective: To examine the effect of treatment on time to progression, progression free survival, overall survival, quality of life, and the associated toxicity from treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial of Epirubicin, Oxaliplatin and Capecitabine (EOX) Versus Docetaxel and Oxaliplatin (ElTax) in the Treatment of Advanced Gastro-oesophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomised two-arm parallel group phase II study. 140 patients will be recruited over a period of 12 months, and will be randomised to receive either eight 3-weekly cycles of Epirubicin, Oxaliplatin and Capecitabine (EOX) or six 4-weekly cycles of Docetaxel and Oxaliplatin (EITax).</detailed_description>
