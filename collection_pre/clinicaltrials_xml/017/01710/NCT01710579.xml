	<brief_summary>Ano-rectal manometry is indicative in patients with either fecal incontinence or constipation. Recently anorectal 3D- high resolution manometry has been developed. Pressure variations are measured circumferentially along the anal canal. It may allow a better understanding of anorectal disorders by displaying anal pressure asymmetry and it could be useful to assess the functional anatomy of the pelvic floor better than conventional manometry.</brief_summary>
