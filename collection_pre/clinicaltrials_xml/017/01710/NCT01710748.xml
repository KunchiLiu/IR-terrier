	<brief_summary>This study is a prospective, randomized controlled, single blind, two-arm, multicenter clinical evaluation. Diabetic patients (n=112) with de novo coronary artery disease will be randomized to one of the 2 treatment arms: 1) Reservoir-Based Polymer-Free Amphilimus-Eluting Stent or 2) Polymer-Based Everolimus-Eluting Stent. The purpose of this study is to determine whether Polymer-Free Amphilimus-Eluting Stent implantation is effective in reducing neointimal hyperplasia as compared to Polymer-Based Everolimus-Eluting Stent in diabetic patients, using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) as the primary imaging modality.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reservoir-Based Polymer-Free Amphilimus-Eluting Stent Versus Polymer-Based Everolimus-Eluting Stent in Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), drug eluting stents (DES) have been shown to be associated with greater neointimal suppression than bare-metal stents. However, there is an ongoing debate on the optimal drug-eluting stent in diabetic patients. This study is a prospective, randomized controlled, single blind, two-arm, multicenter clinical evaluation. Diabetic patients (n=112) with de novo coronary artery disease will be randomized to one of the 2 treatment arms: 1) Reservoir-Based Polymer-Free Amphilimus-Eluting Stent or 2) Polymer-Based Everolimus-Eluting Stent. The purpose of this study is to determine whether Polymer-Free Amphilimus-Eluting Stent implantation is effective in reducing neointimal hyperplasia as compared to Polymer-Based Everolimus-Eluting Stent in diabetic patients, using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) as the primary imaging modality.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Clinical Subject is eligible for PCI. Subject has symptomatic coronary artery disease (stable/unstable angina or NonST elevation myocardial infarction). Subject has known DM. Angiographic Presence of 1 or 2 de novo native coronary artery lesions (maximum 1 lesion per epicardial coronary artery), with a visual estimation stenosis ≥ 50%. Target lesion length 1225mm, reference diameter 2.53.5mm. Clinical STsegment elevation myocardial infarction &lt;48h Presence of cardiogenic shock preprocedure Contraindications to dual antiplatelet therapy for 12 months Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction ≤30% GFR&lt;30 ml/min/m2 Target vessel has been treated previously Platelet count &lt;75000/mm3 or &gt;700000/mm3 Immunosuppressive therapy Has received or waiting list for any transplant Lifethreatening disease with a life expectancy of &lt; 12 months Pregnant or breast feeding patient Inability to provide informed consent Angiographic TIMI flow ≤ 1 prior to guide wire crossing There is an additional lesion within the target vessel planned to be treated within the next 12 months Target vessel is a saphenous vein graft Target vessel is the left main, ostial LAD and/or ostial LCX.
