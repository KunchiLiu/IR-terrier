	<brief_title>Open-label Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness of an Intramuscular Formulation of Aripiprazole (OPC-14597) as Maintenance Treatment in Patients With Bipolar I Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be an open-label, uncontrolled study which will enroll completers from Study 31-08-250 and new subjects not participating in Studies 250. The treatment history of subjects prior to enrolment in the open-label study will vary according to the design of the pivotal double-blind study (i.e 31-08-250). This open-label study will be comprised of phases similar to the pivotal double-blind study (i.e. Study 250): a screening phase (if applicable), a conversion phase (Phase A, if applicable), an oral stabilization phase (Phase B, if applicable), and an IM depot open-label maintenance phase (Phase C). Phase C will be a minimum of 28 weeks up to a 52-week treatment period with a 4 week follow up period. During Phase C (the open-label maintenance phase) rescue medication will be allowed for subjects who do not meet stability criteria.</detailed_description>
