	<brief_title>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in a Smoking Cessation Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a form of non-invasive brain stimulation that involves the application of brief weak electric current to the scalp. tDCS may induce neuroplasticity, thereby engaging some of the same systems that figure prominently in the pathological neuroplasticity caused by addictive drugs. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether tDCS delivered along with nicotine patch reliably increases a) quit rates, b) duration of abstinence, and c) percentage of participants abstinent at follow-up. METHOD: Active (20min; 2mA) and sham (30sec; 2mA) stimulation will be applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in both cerebral hemispheres. HYPOTHESES: 1. Active tDCS (20-min; 2 mA) will increase abstinence in a standard smoking cessation protocol relative to a sham procedure. 2. The benefits of active left anodal stimulation (anode-left/cathode-right) to the DLPFC will be greater than of active tDCS in the reverse configuration (cathode-left/anode-right).</detailed_description>
