	<criteria>Male of female; age over 18 years Dual chamber permanent pacemaker implanted Confirmed diagnosis of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with an AF burden of 1 to 50%, as derived from pacemaker diagnostic algorithms Able to have pacemaker antiarrhythmic algorithms turned off for the duration of the study Able to discontinue all Class I and III antiarrhythmic medication for the duration of the study Therapeutically anticoagulated with warfarin or dabigatran, and anticipated to be for duration of the study High sensitivity CReactive Protein (hsCRP) between 2 and 10 mg/L (inclusive) Clinically significant abnormalities in medical history, physical examination, or screening laboratory results that would render a subject unsuitable for inclusion NYHA class III/IV heart failure Impaired left ventricular function of less than 45% determined by echocardiography within 3 months of screening Moderate or greater mitral regurgitation assessed by echocardiography within 3 months of screening Permanent AF Continuous Amiodarone therapy within 90 days prior to Study Day 1 Treatment with another Study Drug, biological agent, or device within onemonth of screening, or five halflives of study agent, whichever is longer Use of systemic corticosteroids or other antiinflammatory medications including nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Use of statins, ACE inhibitors or ATreceptor antagonists unless on a stable regimen for at least 3 months prior to dosing and will remain on a stable regimen for the duration of the study Uncontrolled hypertension (BP &gt;160/100) Current or expected use of any anticoagulant apart from warfarin or dabigatran</criteria>
