	<brief_summary>Endometrial and cervical cancers are one of the most common malignancies seen in females. Identification of recurrent disease in early phases of treatment carries a primary importance on the outcome of patients. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) is a new technique recently started to be performed in body imaging and has potential ability to detect recurrent disease. The aim of this study is to investigate the diagnostic impact of DWI in detection of recurrent disease in patients treated with curative surgery in endometrial and cervical cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Value of Diffusion Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Detection of Recurrent Disease in Surgically Treated Cervical and Endometrial Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endometrial and cervical cancers are one of the most common malignancies seen in female genital tract. Although, surgical resection is the treatment of choice for both, adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy and curative radiotherapy are alternative treatment options depending on the stage. Identification of recurrent disease in early phases carries a primary importance on the prognosis. Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI), a new technique recently started to be performed in body imaging has potential ability to distinguish recurrent disease from normal tissue or fibrosis. Our aim in this study is to investigate the diagnostic impact of DWI in detection of recurrence rate in patients treated with curative surgery in endometrial and cervical cancer. All patients who had curative surgery due to endometrial or cervical cancer will be included to the study. Patients will be examined with DWI in addition to routine sequences including contrast enhanced dynamic studies. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy as well as positive and negative predictive values of the study will be investigated from the data derived from DWI studies and will be correlated with data obtained by conventional radiologic, nuclear imaging studies including PET-CT, as well as pathologic verifications during follow-up period.</detailed_description>
