Transvaginal ultrasound at screening (or within 14 days prior to screening) consistent with findings adequate for Assisted Reproduction Technology (ART) with respect to uterus and adnexa (peripheral reproductive organs). At least one cycle with no fertility medication prior to screening. Hysterosalpingography, hysteroscopy, sonohysterogram, or transvaginal ultrasound documenting a normal uterine cavity.

Subjects with a body mass index (BMI) of &gt;34 at time of Screening. Previous IVF or ART failure due to a poor response to gonadotropins*. * Defined as development of ≤2 mature follicles or history of 2 previous cycle cancellations prior to oocyte retrieval due to poor response.
