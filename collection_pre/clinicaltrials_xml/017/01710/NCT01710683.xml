	<brief_title>Early Mobilisation Following Discectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative pain is a major cause of delayed convalescence after discectomy. Different analgesic treatments with the use of local analgesics and steroid can reduce the immediate postoperative pain and convalescence after surgery. In orthopaedic and abdominal surgery accelerated stay programs with early mobilisation have reduced pain in the early postoperative periode. The late convalescence after discectomy for herniated disc disease can be reduced with the use of epidural steroids.</detailed_description>
