	<brief_title>Therapeutic Effects of Insoles on Patients With Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 90 patients will be collected. The participants will be randomized into two groups, including ready-made full-length lateral wedged shoe insoles group and customized full-length lateral wedged shoe insoles group. The psychological function (Hospital anxiety and depression scale, Graded chronic pain scale, Multidimensional fatigue inventory, Fear-avoidance belief questionnaire), physical activity (CHAMPS physical activity questionnaire), functional performance (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis index、Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) and quality of life (World Health Organization-Quality of life-Brief Vision、Osteoarthritis Quality of Life、Osteoarthritis- Knee and Hip Quality of Life) will be evaluated. Physical functional ability (10 meter normal and fast walk, up and down stairs, and 5 repeated chair-rising time), pain (Visual analog scale, pain pressure threshold ) and balance performance (static postural stability and dynamic stability by Biodex Stability System, including postural stability, dynamic limits of stability and fall risk) will be evaluated before and immediately after the ready-made full-length shoe insoles and customized full-length shoe insoles are prescribed. All the evaluations, including physical functional ability, pain, balance, psychological, physical activity, functional performance, and quality of life, will be re-evaluated at one month after and three months after modified shoe insoles wearing. Subjects and evaluator were both blinded to the group's classification during the whole course of study.</detailed_description>
