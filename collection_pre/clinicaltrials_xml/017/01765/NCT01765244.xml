	<brief_summary>Phase I- II clinical trial to evaluate the feasibility of the method and the absence of relevant side effects derived from product implant. HYPOTHESIS: Once designed the nanostructured artificial human corneas by the Tissue Engineering Group of the University of Granada, and after evaluating their suitable properties ex vivo and their in vivo utility by means of anterior lamellar keratoplasty in laboratory animals, it is necessary to proceed to clinical evaluation in human patients suffering from severe corneal pathology. The results obtained during pre-clinical study, both in laboratory and in experimental animals, suggest that nanostructured artificial human corneas could help to treat various corneal diseases that occur with any substance loss or serious structural alteration, with no relevant side effects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Allogeneic Tissue Engineering (Nanostructured Artificial Human Cornea) in Patients With Corneal Trophic Ulcers in Advanced Stages, Refractory to Conventional (Ophthalmic) Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I-II, controlled, randomized, multicenter clinical trial. The total number of patients to be included is 20. In an initial phase, will be included 5 patients sequentially (be subjected to the experimental treatment), with a month and a half safety period between patients. At random, 5 of these patients will be implanted cornea and 10 control patients will receive an amniotic membrane transplant as conventional treatment of corneal trophic ulcers in advanced stages. The study population consists of patients with severe corneal pathology (corneal ulcers refractory to conventional trophic treatment or sequels of previous ulcers having stromal fibrosis and / or limbal failure in the same eye) for which, there isn't currently an effective alternative therapeutic It is estimated that the inclusion period is approximately 36 months, and a follow-up period of 24 months for each patient. Thus the total duration of the study will be about 60 months from the inclusion of the first patient until the end of the follow-up period of the last patient included. To all patients enrolled in the trial, assigned to the experimental group will proceed to be implanted an anterior lamellar nanostructured artificial cornea with allogeneic cells from dead donors and biomaterials. The implant of this Advanced Therapy drug will cover defects or structural alterations existing in the affected cornea. In this phase of the study, it is aimed to assess the feasibility of the procedure and the biosafety of the implant once grafted in the patient's cornea. Patients who are randomized to the control group will be subjected to the usual treatment of their condition, consisting of amniotic membrane transplantation Once the artificial corneal graft or amniotic membrane transplantation in the affected eye is completed, will proceed with the monitoring and continuous assessment of each subject. For this, it will be used the usual revision methods used for the anterior pole of the eyeball in all hospitals involved in the study. Main objective: To evaluate the safety, feasibility and evidence of clinical efficacy of an anterior lamellar nanostructured artificial human cornea model, in a group of patients with severe corneal disease, for whom there are currently no effective therapeutic alternative. Secondary objectives: - To generate lamellar nanostructured artificial human corneas of allogeneic origin of dead donor, from sclerocorneal limbus and agarose-fibrin biomaterials. - To implant the nanostructured artificial human corneas of allogeneic origin of dead donor in a group of patients randomized to the experimental group, suffering from severe corneal pathology as a graft in the wound bed. - To assess Biosecurity the nanostructured artificial human corneas of allogeneic origin of dead donor implanted in patients to rule out relevant adverse reactions.</detailed_description>
