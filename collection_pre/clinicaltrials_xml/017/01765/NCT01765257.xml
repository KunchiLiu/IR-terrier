	<brief_summary>Among the psychiatric symptoms observed in the premotor phase of Parkinson's disease (PD) and/or in "de novo" patients, apathy is relatively frequent (estimated to 23%). However, the neuropathological bases of apathy are still unknown. However, recent data suggests that apathy could be linked to a more specific dopaminergic denervation in the ventral striatum. Rasagiline increases the bioavailability of striatal endogenous dopamine by blocking the MAO-B. Some recent data suggest rasagiline could be effective to improve apathy in Parkinson's disease. The primary outcome is to demonstrate a significant reduction of apathy using the Lille apathy rating scale (LARS) in drug naive patients with early diagnosed Parkinson's disease, using a treatment by rasagiline.</brief_summary>
