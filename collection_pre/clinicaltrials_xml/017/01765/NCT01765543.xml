	<brief_summary>This open-label, multi-center, three-period, one-sequence study will investigate the effect of rifampin on the PK of vemurafenib in participants with unresectable BRAFV600-mutation positive metastatic melanoma or other malignant tumor type that harbors a V600-activating mutation of BRAF without acceptable standard treatment options. Eligible participants will have the option to continue treatment with vemurafenib as part of an extension study GO28399 (NCT01739764).</brief_summary>
