	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to investigate whether or not platelet rich plasma (PRP) may help to improve tendon healing and decrease post operative pain in patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructive surgery using their own patellar tendons as autografts.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) on Post Operative Pain in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is currently a paucity of well-designed, prospective, randomized, blinded (Level 1) clinical studies that carefully and comprehensively investigate the role of PRP in ACL surgery. Specifically, ACL reconstruction using Bone Patellar Tendon Bone (BPTB) harvest and the role of PRP in decreasing postoperative pain at the donor site. Given the need for a highly powered study to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of PRP in ACL reconstruction, the investigators have designed a prospective, randomized, level 1, double-blinded study to evaluate the effects of PRP on the specific outcomes of donor site pain and radiographic measures of graft healing and incorporation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of intra-operatively applied autologous PRP in reducing donor site morbidity and increasing radiographic healing in ACL reconstruction using autologous BPTB.</detailed_description>
