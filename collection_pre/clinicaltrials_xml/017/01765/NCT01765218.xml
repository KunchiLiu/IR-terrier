	<brief_title>Topiramate in Neonates Receiving Whole Body Cooling for Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a devastating and unexpected disease in newborns that affects 1.5-2.6 per 1000 live births. Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy has a mortality rate of up to 30% and survivors are at significant risk for adverse long-term outcomes, including seizures, cerebral palsy, and developmental delay. The investigators propose a randomized controlled study comparing therapeutic hypothermia alone, or therapeutic hypothermia combined with topiramate. The investigators hypothesize that adjuvant therapy with topiramate will reduce short term severity of HIE including seizures (the primary outcome), a composite HIE severity score, and reduce the time of normalization of the amplitude integrated aEEG. The investigators further hypothesize, that it will improve longer term outcomes such as developmental outcome. The primary hypothesis is that seizures before hospital discharge (or before 4w post-natal age (which ever is earlier) will be significantly reduced in the topiramate group compared to the control group</detailed_description>

	<criteria>In order to be eligible for cooling the baby must meet all three of the following sets of criteria 1. Be near term (typically â‰¥34wks gestation) and be aged &lt; 6h old 2. Have signs of early perinatal depression (EITHER 10 minute Apgar score &lt; 5, OR pH &lt; 7.00 within 60mins of age, OR Base Excess &lt; 12 within 60mins of age, OR need respiratory support at 10min of age due to respiratory depression) 3. Have signs of moderate or severe encephalopathy based on either clinical examination or on amplitude integrated aEEG assessment 1. Known congenital myopathy 2. Known congenital neuropathy</criteria>
