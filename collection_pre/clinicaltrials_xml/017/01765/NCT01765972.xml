The subject's vertex corrected spherical equivalent distance refraction must be in the range of 1.00 to 6.00 D in each eye. 7. The subject's refractive cylinder must be no more than 1.00D in each eye. 8. The subject must have best corrected visual acuity of +0.14 logMAR (equivalent to 20/252) or better in each eye. 9. Subjects must own a wearable pair of spectacles and wear them on the day of the initial visit, during the washout before each phase and during the no lens wear phase. 10. The subject must have normal eyes (i.e., no ocular medications or infections of any type). 1. Are currently pregnant or lactating by self report (subjects who become pregnant during the study will be discontinued). 2. Have any ocular or systemic allergies or diseases that may interfere with contact lens wear. 3. Have any systemic disease, autoimmune disease, or use of medication, which may interfere with contact lens wear. This may include, but may not be limited to, diabetes. hyperthyroidism, recurrent herpes simplex/zoster, Sjogren's syndromes, xerophthalmia, acne rosacea, StevensJohnson syndromes, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, and tuberculosis. 4.

Have any grade 2.0 or greater slit lamp findings (e.g. edema, corneal neovascularization, corneal staining, tarsal abnormalities, conjunctival injection) on the Efron classification scale or any other ocular abnormality that may contraindicate contact lens wear. 8. Have any known hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to one of the study products. 9. Have any ocular infection. 10. Have any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable contact lens wear. 11. Have participated in any contact lens or lens care product clinical trial within 14 days prior to study enrollment. 12. Have any infectious disease (e.g. hepatitis, tuberculosis) or a contagious immunosuppressive disease (e.g. HIV by self report). 13. Currently wear their contact lenses on an extended wear basis. 14.
