	<brief_title>Comparison of the Efficacy of Two Rituximab Treatment Regimens in Patients With Lupus Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized, open, controlled, multicenter, clinical trial in patients with lupus nephritis previously treated with cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate. These patient can not have received Rituximab in the previous year. The number of patients estimated to reach statistical significance is 18 in each arm, a total sample size of 32 patients is needed. The hypothesis is that the alternative procedure (a second cycle of Rituximab)will reduce the relapse rate of lupus nephritis and the consequent deterioration of renal function. Besides it will reduce health care expenses(hospitalization, medication, hemodialysis and renal transplantation).</detailed_description>
