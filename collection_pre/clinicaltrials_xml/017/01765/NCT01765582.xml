	<brief_summary>This randomized, open-label, multicenter study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of folinic acid (leucovorin), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), oxaliplatin, and irinotecan (FOLFOXIRI) / bevacizumab regimens (concurrent and sequential) versus folinic acid (leucovorin), 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) / bevacizumab in first-line in participants with metastatic colorectal cancer. Participants will be randomized to receive bevacizumab 5 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) intravenously every 2 weeks with either concurrent or sequential FOLFOXIRI or with FOLFOX for 4 to 6 months of induction therapy, followed by maintenance therapy with bevacizumab plus either leucovorin/5-fluorouracil or capecitabine until disease progression occurs. After disease progression, participants will receive treatment with a fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab.</brief_summary>
