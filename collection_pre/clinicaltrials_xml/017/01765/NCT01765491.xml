	<brief_summary>Morning-only colonoscopy preparation may improve efficiency by allowing same-day patient preparation and colonoscopy. The aim of the investigators study is to compare the efficacy and tolerability of morning-only Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) to split-dose preparation in hospitalized patients undergoing colonoscopy. This is a single-center, prospective, endoscopist-blinded study in which hospitalized patients scheduled to undergo diagnostic colonoscopy were randomly assigned to receive one gallon of PEG either the morning of colonoscopy or as a split-dose (evening-morning). The primary end point is efficacy of colonoscopy preparation measured by the Ottawa scale. The investigators pre-specified a non-inferiority margin of 1.5 for the difference in Ottawa scale between arms. Secondary end points are patient compliance and tolerance.</brief_summary>
