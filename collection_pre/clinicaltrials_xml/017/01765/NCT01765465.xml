	<brief_summary>Postcholecystectomy syndrome (PCS) includes a heterogeneous group of diseases, usually manifested by the presence of abdominal symptoms following gallbladder removal. The pathogenesis of PCS has not been identified; therefore there is no consensus of medical treatment on PCS. The Action of Rowachol are to inhibit hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid(HMG)-coenzyme A(CoA) reductase, to inhibits cholesterol nucleation in bile from patients with cholesterol gallstones, and to promote biliary lipid secretion. The purpose of this study is to determine whether Rowachol is useful in the prevention of PCS and symptoms change after laparoscopic cholecystectomy</brief_summary>
