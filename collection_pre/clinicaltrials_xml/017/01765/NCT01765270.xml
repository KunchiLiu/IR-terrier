	<brief_summary>Individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at increased risk for cardiovascular events (for example, heart attack) and the risk is related to one's overall control of blood glucose levels. In this study the investigators will measure the effects of saxagliptin, compared to placebo, before, during, and after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. The investigators will use samples of the patients' blood and tissue to measure and evaluate indicators of the body's response to the treatment. This study is being done to evaluate the effect of saxagliptin on biomarkers of the heart to help us understand whether reducing or controlling a person's blood glucose levels during and after CABG surgery will produce better clinical outcomes (for example, better heart health).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanistic Assessment of the Properties of Saxagliptin in Subjects Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effect of saxagliptin on cardiac biomarkers of myocardial necrosis, cardiac function, inflammation, and apoptosis in subjects with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) undergoing CABG surgery (on pump, via a median sternotomy approach) as an integrated measure of the potential mechanistic effects of saxagliptin on prevention of cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. Approximately 74 subjects will be randomized and complete the study.</detailed_description>
