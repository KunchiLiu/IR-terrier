	<brief_summary>Hypothesis: Exercise will reduce morbidity and mortality rates in an elderly population. The extent of reduction will be intensity dependent. As part of the "Generation 100" study, this sub-study project will investigate the effect of exercise on blood volume, cardiopulmonary health and heart function in healthy aging. Objective is to determine the acute effect of one endurance training session on blood volume in healthy elderly. The working hypothesis is that one interval training session increases total blood volume by 10% in healthy elderly, and that there will be no change after moderate continuous training.</brief_summary>
