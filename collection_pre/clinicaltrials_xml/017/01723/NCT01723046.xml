	<brief_title>Therapeutic Effects of a New Upper Limb Robot Assisted Therapy Device for Persons After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The number of physically weak individuals is increasing, resulting in a higher burden on health care and health care workers. The use of robot assisted therapy (RAT) might partly solve this problem. Rehabilitation progress highly depends on training intensity and training duration, favouring the use of RAT. In this pilot study, the clinical effects of using a new upper arm RAT device for upper arm rehabilitation in patients with stroke is investigated. Myo-electrical signals will serve as input for the device, assisting the user in flexion and extension of the elbow. The device is coupled to a virtual environments, creating a stimulating therapy environment.</detailed_description>
