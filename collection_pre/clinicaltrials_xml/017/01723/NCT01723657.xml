	<brief_summary>The AML-03 regimen investigates the addition of G-CSF priming to both induction and consolidation chemotherapies administrated in the previous AML-99 trial (NCT01716793) refines risk-stratification based on biological characterization also the AML-03 trial incorporates novel approaches for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: such as Mylotarg™ "in vivo purging" in autografts, extends unrelated volunteers donors for allotransplants in high-risk patients, and introduces reduced intensity conditioning in patients with elder age (more than 50 years old). The aims of these modifications are to analyse eficacy and toxicity of this induction and consolidation therapy and to analyse the disease free survival in patients who achieved complete response following a risk adjusted therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Risk Adapted Treatment for Primary Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Induction chemotherapy: idarubicin (12mg/m2/day intravenous, days 1, 3 and 5), intermediate-dose cytarabine (500mg/m2/12h, intravenous, days 1, 3 and 5) and etoposide (100mg/m2/day, intravenous, from day 1 to 3) as in AML-99 trial (NCT01716793), with the addition of subcutaneous G-CSF from day 0 to the last day of chemotherapy. This induction therapy is repeated if complete remission (CR) is not achieved after the first course of treatment. Consolidation therapy (as in AML-99 trial): mitoxantrone (12mg/m2/day, intravenous, days 4 to 6) and intermediate-dose cytarabine (500mg/m2/12h from day 1 to 6). Risk-stratification according to cytogenetics, courses to CR and availability of an HLA-identical sibling: - Patients in the favorable cytogenetics group [t(8;21), inv(16) or t(16;16)] and Leukocyte index &lt;20 at diagnosis (LI=white blood cell count (WBC) x (blasts in bone marrow/100) are treated with one course of high-dose cytarabine (3g/m2/12h, intravenous, days 1, 3 and 5), but in case of LI&gt;20 at diagnosis the intention is to perform an autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation. - Patients in intermediate risk group, with normal karyotype, a single course of induction chemotherapy to achieve the CR, the absence of adverse molecular features (FLT3-ITD or MLL-PTD) and low minimal residual disease levels after consolidation (MRD&lt;0,1%) receive an autologous PBSC transplant, regardless of having an HLA-identical sibling. - The remaining patients defined as high-risk patients are treated with an allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Depending on the age, if the patient has an HLA-identical sibling donor, up to age of 50 years old it is performed with conventional conditioning therapy and positive selection of CD34+, older patients receive a reduced intensity conditioning regimen. - Very high risk patients without a sibling are allocated to unrelated donor (9-10/10). Patients with adverse cytogenetics and/or FLT3-ITD without an adequate donor received Mylotarg™ as "in vivo purging" followed by an autologous PBSC transplantation.</detailed_description>

Secondary AML which appears after cured malignant disease (for instance, Hodgking disease), and those who are still exposed to alkilant agents or radiation. Abnormal renal and hepatic functions with creatinin and/or bilirrubine 2 times higher than the normal threshold, except when the alteration should be attributed to the leukemia.
