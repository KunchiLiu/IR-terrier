	<brief_title>Impact of Omalizumab on Quality of Life Measures and Angioedema Occurrence in Patients With CSU Refractory to Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be conducted using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter design to investigate the impact of omalizumab on Quality of Life (QoL) in Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU) and will assess its effectiveness in reducing and/or inhibiting the occurrence, time-course and severity of angioedema episodes. Omalizumab is administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks as an add-on therapy to the current approved treatment of adult CSU patients. The treatment period is 28 weeks which is followed by an 8-week follow-up. The study aims to enroll approximately 70 patients. The study is divided into a 2-week screening period, a 28-week double-blind treatment phase with omalizumab or placebo-omalizumab, and an 8-week follow-up phase.</detailed_description>
