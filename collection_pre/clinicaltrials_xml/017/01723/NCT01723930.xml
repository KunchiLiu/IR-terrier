	<brief_summary>Get a better understanding of the pathophysiological processes of acute respiratory failure following cardiopulmonary bypass to initiate timely therapies targeted on a cell line. Demonstrate that there is a relationship between increased transpulmonary gradients of inflammation biomarkers (sRAGE, sICAM-1, SPB, PAI-1, ROS) and pulmonary vascular resistance on the one hand and alveolo-capillary gas exchange on the other hand after cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass.</brief_summary>
