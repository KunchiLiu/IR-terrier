	<brief_summary>A Phase II study to investigate the potential utility of PD 0332991 in the treatment of early stage ER+ Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)- breast cancer, to investigate whether the combination of PD 0332991 and anastrozole is able to: 1) improve the pathologic complete response rate when compared to the historical control of single agent aromatase inhibitors, 2) result in fewer patients with on therapy Ki67&gt;10% compared to historical control.</brief_summary>
