	<brief_summary>Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) is a marker for ovarian reserve. It is well known that ovarian surgery for endometriosis lowers Anti-Mullerian hormone, but little is known for other surgeries. We seek to investigate the hormone variations before and after an open myomectomy. Hypothesis: Anti-Mullerian hormone levels drop following surgery but return to normal levels in a few months</brief_summary>
