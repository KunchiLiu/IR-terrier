	<brief_summary>The goal of the project is to overcome some of the common barriers to treatment amongst recent survivors of traumatic events, by combining the world of evidence-based intervention with that of modern Internet technology. Specifically, it aims to test the feasibility and effectiveness of an Internet delivery of early-intervention trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for preventing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Over the course of the study the following objectives will be achieved: 1. The development of an Internet-based Virtual Reality intervention for preventing PTSD among patients who have recently experienced a traumatic event. 2. The evaluation of the feasibility of administering this intervention, and 3. The evaluation of the efficacy of this Internet based intervention in the prevention of PTSD in recent trauma survivors.</brief_summary>
