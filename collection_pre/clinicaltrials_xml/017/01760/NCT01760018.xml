	<brief_summary>Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and inhalation anesthesia are both widely and safely used, and there are many clinical trials comparing these on various aspects of anesthesia. However, there have not been studies comparing the quality of recovery from the different methods of general anesthesia. In this study, the investigators compare the functional recovery after general anesthesia in TIVA and inhalation anesthesia with QoR-40 questionnaire.</brief_summary>
