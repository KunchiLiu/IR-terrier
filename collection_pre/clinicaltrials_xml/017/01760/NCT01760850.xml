	<brief_title>Breast and Cervical Cancer Educational Intervention for Latinas in Western New York</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Investigate the extent of linguistic and cultural tailoring necessary to adapt Esperanza y Vida outreach programs for Hispanics in Western New York. II. Evaluate the effectiveness of the Esperanza y Vida program intervention to increase breast and cervical cancer knowledge and screening behaviors in Hispanic participants compared to a control health education program on diabetes. III. Determine the factors associated with and/or predictive of screening of Hispanics in Western New York (WNY) as compared to New York City (NYC) and Arkansas to describe how the intervention impacts barriers and motivations for screening in diverse Hispanic populations. OUTLINE: Key informant interviews with local "gatekeepers" of Hispanic culture groups in WNY and focus groups with Hispanic cancer survivors with screened and unscreened participants are conducted during the first phase of research. Participants are then randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM I: Participants engage in the Esperanza y Vida educational information session for breast and cervical cancer. ARM II: Participants engage in an educational information session for diabetes. After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 2 and 8 months.</detailed_description>
