	<brief_title>Effects of Intraarticular Botulinum Toxin A in Ankle Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent pilot studies report that intraarticular injection of Botulinum Toxin A into painful joints of patients with various types of arthritis leads to significant and durable improvement in pain and function and is safe to use. To date, there is no published literature that evaluate the effects of intraarticular Botulinum Toxin A in the treatment of ankle OA. Sun el al reported that 3 or 5 weekly injection of hyaluronate may improve pain and physical function in patients with ankle OA and the treatment effects may last for 6 months. The effect of one injection of hyaluronate plus exercise had never been studied. The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of intraarticular Botulinum Toxin A versus intraarticular hyaluronate plus rehabilitation exercise for patients with ankle OA.</detailed_description>
