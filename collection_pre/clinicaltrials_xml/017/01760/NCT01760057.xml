	<brief_summary>The proposed study is designed to develop and test the effectiveness of a novel web-based HIV intervention to motivate HIV testing among men who have sex with men (MSM). The intervention arm includes the delivery of videos tailored to the reasons MSM have for not getting tested for HIV, as well as HIV testing motivational messages sent via mobile-phone text messaging, e-mail or instant messaging. The intervention and assessments will be guided by the Information-Motivation-Behavioral skills model, the Health Belief Model and the Stages of Change theory. The control intervention will be a health promotion message (similar in content to other Peruvian websites) with an invitation for free HIV testing. Testing will be offered at the Via Libre and Epicentro clinic, and at a mobile unit whose location will be determined based on participants' demand. The outcomes evaluated will be intention to get tested and actual HIV testing among MSM of each of the trial arms.</brief_summary>
