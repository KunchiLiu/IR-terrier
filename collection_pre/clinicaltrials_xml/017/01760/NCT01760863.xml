	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of this study is to compare the re-infection rates in patients undergoing 2-stage revision arthroplasty who receive additional oral antibiotic therapy to those patients who received in-hospital perioperative antibiotic only. Patients will be monitored for re-infection following hospital discharge, defined as deep infection of the joint space/capsule that requires return to the operating room within 24-months of the re-implantation procedure.</brief_summary>
