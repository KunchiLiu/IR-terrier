	<brief_summary>This project is being used to assess the utility of intravenous acetaminophen in the pediatric population undergoing palate repairs. This study is a prospective randomized double blinded placebo controlled study. The investigators will have two arms, one group of patients will receive intravenous acetaminophen and one group that will receive a placebo at a total of four doses over 24 hours. The results of this study may affect the intraoperative anesthetic management as well as post-operative surgical management of this specific patient population. The goal is to determine the benefit of adding a non-opioid analgesic and hypothesizing that it may reduce the amount of narcotic consumption in the post anesthesia care unit as well as during the post-operative stay.</brief_summary>
