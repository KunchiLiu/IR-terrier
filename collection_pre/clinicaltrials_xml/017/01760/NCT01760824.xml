	<brief_summary>Helicobacter pylori (HP), a bacterium present in many people's stomachs, is one of the major causes of ulcers and cancers. Up to 20% of patients infected with H. pylori may develop peptic ulcers. However, failure rate is rising due to multiple resistant H. pylori infection. The eradication rate of first line clarithromycin based therapy has fallen to below 80%. Both quadruple and sequential treatment regime has been proposed as the first-line empirical regime. Nevertheless, comparison in terms of efficacy and side effects between the two regime remained unknown. The aim of this clinical trial is to compare the efficacy and tolerability of H. pylori eradication with a 10-day quadruple therapy versus sequential therapy as empirical first and second line treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Helicobacter pylori (HP), a bacterium present in many people's stomachs, is one of the major causes of ulcers and cancers. Up to 20% of patients infected with HP may develop peptic ulcers. However, failure rate is rising due to multiple resistant HP infection. The eradication rate of first line clarithromycin based therapy has fell to below 80% and increasing number of patients also failed the second line quadruple therapy. The aim of this clinical trial is to compare the efficacy and tolerability of H. pylori eradication with a 10-day quadruple therapy versus sequential therapy as empirical first and second line treatment. Methods: Eligible H. pylori positive patients were randomized to receive either QUAD (esomeprazole 20mg twice daily, bismuth subcitrate 120mg four times daily, tetracycline 500mg four times daily and metronidazole 400mg four times daily) for 10 days or SEQ (esomeprazole 20mg twice daily for 10 days, amoxicillin 1g twice daily for first 5 days, clarithromycin 500mg twice daily and metronidazole 400mg four time daily for the subsequent 5 days). All patients returned 8 weeks after completing the treatment for a Urea Breath Test (UBT) to confirm eradication. Patients who failed their respective therapy were crossover to receive the alternative regimen.</detailed_description>
