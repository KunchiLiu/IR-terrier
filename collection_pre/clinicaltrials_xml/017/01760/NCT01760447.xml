	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the addition of sitagliptin (administered as MK-0431A XR) compared with the addition of placebo to therapy with extended-release metformin (metformin XR) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in pediatric participants with inadequate glycemic control on metformin therapy (alone or in combination with insulin). The primary hypothesis is that the addition of sitagliptin reduces hemoglobin A1c (A1C) more than the addition of placebo after 20 weeks of treatment.</brief_summary>
