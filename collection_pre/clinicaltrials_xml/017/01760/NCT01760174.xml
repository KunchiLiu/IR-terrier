	<brief_summary>This study compares the effect on postoperative pain of bolus administration of ropivacaine in Transversus abdominis plane catheter and continuous bupivacain-infusion in epidural catheters following open gynecologic surgery.The study is double blind. The hypothesis is that the effect of the two modes of pain treatment are equal.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing the Effect of TAP-catheter and Epidural Catheter on Postoperative Pain After Open Gynecologic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients for open gynecologic surgery will all receive both an epidural catheter and bilateral transversus abdominis plane (:TAP) catheters. After randomization in to two groups the patients receive either 1) intermittent boluses of ropivacaine in the TAP-catheters and isotonic potassium chloride-infusion i the epidural catheters or 2) intermittent isotonic potassium chloride-boluses i the TAP-catheters and bupivacain-infusion in the epidural catheters. The investigators record pain-score and consumption of opioids in the first 24 hours postoperatively as well as thermoanalgesia at dermatome-levels th10-th12. The investigators assume that the effect on postoperative pain after open gynecologic surgery is equal in the two groups.</detailed_description>
