Medical history, vital signs, physical examination, standard 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and laboratory investigations must be clinically acceptable or within laboratory reference ranges for the relevant laboratory tests, unless the investigator considers the deviation to be irrelevant for the purpose of the study. 5. Nonsmoker or mild to moderate smoker (≤ 10 cigarettes daily). 6. Females, if: Serum folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) ≥ 25.8 mIU/mL AND a serum estradiol level of ≤ 54.7 pg/mL at screening. Not of childbearing potential, e.g., has been surgically sterilized, undergone a hysterectomy, amenorrhea for ≥ 12 months and considered postmenopausal. Note: In postmenopausal women, the value of the serum pregnancy test may be slightly increased, but if not increasing upon repeat, the female will be included in the study. • Not on thyroid hormone replacement therapy or on stable thyroid hormone replacement therapy for at least 3 months before the first administration of IMP. Not on statin therapy or on stable statin therapy for at least 3 months before the first administration of IMP. • Blood pressure measurements are within the acceptable ranges; or, if diagnosed with hypertension, are on stable therapy for at least 3 months before the first administration of IMP. Note: Treatment with calcium channel blockers is NOT allowed. 7. Written consent given for participation in the study. 1. Evidence of psychiatric disorder, antagonistic personality, poor motivation, emotional or intellectual problems likely to limit the validity of consent to participate in the study or limit the ability to comply with protocol requirements. 2. Current alcohol use &gt; 21 units of alcohol per week for males and &gt; 14 units of alcohol per week for females. 3. History of regular exposure to substances of abuse (other than alcohol) within the past year. 4. Use of any medication, prescribed or overthecounter or herbal remedies, within 2 weeks prior to the first administration of IMP, except for medication allowed per inclusion criteria (Section 7.3.1) or if the medication will not affect the outcome of the study in the opinion of the investigator. 5. Female hormone replacement therapy (or other medicine containing estrogen, including health food products for menopausal symptoms, as these may contain natural estrogens), within 2 weeks prior to the first administration of IMP. 6. Participation in another study with an experimental drug, where the last administration of the previous IMP was within 8 weeks before the first administration of IMP in this study. 7. Donation or loss of blood equal to or exceeding 500 mL during the 8 weeks before the first administration of IMP. 8. Treatment within the previous 3 months before the first administration of IMP with any drug with a welldefined potential for adversely affecting a major organ or system. 9. A major illness during the 3 months before commencement of the screening period. 10. History of hypersensitivity or allergy to the IMP or its excipients or any related medication. 11. History of bronchial asthma or any other bronchospastic disease within the past 5 years. 12. History of epilepsy. 13. History of porphyria. 14. Relevant history or laboratory or clinical findings indicative of acute or chronic disease, likely to influence study outcome. 15. Systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg or &lt; 95 mmHg, and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 95 mmHg or &lt; 50 mmHg in either the supine or standing position at screening. 16. Resting pulse of &gt; 100 beats per minute or &lt; 45 beats per minute in either the supine or standing position at screening. 17. Positive serology testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C or syphilis. 18. Positive urine screen for drugs of abuse. 19. Positive pregnancy test. 20. Female subjects of premenopausal endocrine status, including pregnant and lactating women. 21. Clinically diagnosed peptic ulceration within the past 5 years. 22. History of bleeding disorders. 23. Vegetarian or any abnormal diet (for whatever reason). 24. Any specific investigational product safety concern.</criteria>
