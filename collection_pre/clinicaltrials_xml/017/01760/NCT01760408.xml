	<brief_summary>The American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) developed a Web-based registry for nutrition care launched in early 2011, initially focusing on the home parenteral nutrition (HPN) patient population. The purpose of Sustain is to collect information regarding the patients and populations who require HPN in the United States, measure outcomes associated with HPN, allow institutional benchmarking against the aggregate data, and publish the findings to improve the quality of care for patients receiving HPN. The registry is open to all sites (hospital and home based) who care for new or existing HPN patients.</brief_summary>
