	<brief_summary>The main purpose of this study is to find out more about how PV-10 works in melanoma tumors. Researchers also want to find out if there are changes in the body's immune cells (cells that fight infection and illnesses) after PV-10 is given, both inside the melanoma tumors and circulating in the blood.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients who are diagnosed with metastatic melanoma, or who are suspected to have metastatic melanoma and are subsequently proven to have metastatic melanoma by biopsy Patients who are planned to undergo surgical resection of at least two foci of palpable cutaneous or subcutaneous metastatic melanoma, for either palliative or therapeutic intent and who consent for preoperative core biopsies of at least two of the resectable lesions prior to surgery Patients who have given informed consent to participate in the study Patients who decline consent for this study Patients who have previously received PV10 therapy Patients who were suspected to have metastatic melanoma but are not proven by preoperative biopsy will be replaced and not counted against the accrual goal Patients who do not undergo surgical resection of at least two metastatic melanoma lesions including the PV10 treated lesion will be replaced and not counted against the accrual goal. Patients whose melanoma lesions are contiguous with, encompass or infiltrate a major blood vessel Patients with an allergy to shellfish due to reported crossreactivity to PV10 Patients with previous sensitivity to iodide Patients who do not have a treatable target lesion on a portion of the body other than the head or neck Concurrent or Intercurrent Illness: Patients with a condition of impaired wound healing (such as uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or immunosuppressive steroid dependence) such that in the opinion of the PI it is unsafe for the patient to undergo intralesional PV10 treatment Patients with severe peripheral vascular disease (i.e., claudication occurring after less than 200 meters of walking, rest pain, ischemic ulceration or gangrene) Patients with significant concurrent or intercurrent illness, psychiatric disorders, or alcohol or chemical dependence that would, in the opinion of the principal investigator (PI), compromise their safety or compliance or interfere with interpretation of study results Patients with uncontrolled thyroid disease, goiter, partial thyroidectomy, previous radioiodine or surgicallytreated Graves' hyperthyroidism or cystic fibrosis Patients with clinically significant cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, peripheral vascular, renal, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, immunological, endocrine, bone marrow or central nervous system disorders that have required hospitalization within the past 12 months Pregnancy Female patients who have a positive pregnancy test or are lactating. Fertile patients who do not agree to use effective contraception (i.e., oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices, double barrier methods such as condoms and diaphragms, abstinence or equivalent measures) beginning at the time of signing consent until after surgery. Patients who are dependent upon concomitant medications that predispose to photosensitivity who cannot stop the medication(s) from the period starting 24 hours prior to and ending 24 hours after PV10 treatment will be excluded.</criteria>
