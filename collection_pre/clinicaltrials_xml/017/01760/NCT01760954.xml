	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Long-Term Safety and Efficacy of Elagolix in Subjects With Moderate to Severe Endometriosis-Associated Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 3 multicenter, double blind randomized study to assess the continued safety and efficacy of two doses of elagolix (Dose 1 and Dose 2) in premenopausal women with moderate to severe endometriosis-associated pain who completed the 6 month treatment period in the pivotal study M12-665 (NCT01620528). Approximately 500 subjects are expected to enroll at approximately up to 200 sites. The study consists of 2 periods: 1.) a 6 month Treatment Period and 2.) a post treatment Follow-up period of up to 12 months (if applicable). An electronic diary will be used to collect endometriosis-associated pain, uterine bleeding, and analgesic medication use for endometriosis associated pain on a daily basis. Pregnancy testing will be performed monthly throughout the study. Subjects will be required to use non-hormonal dual contraceptive during the study and will be counsel on appropriate and effective forms of birth control to promote pregnancy prevention.</detailed_description>
