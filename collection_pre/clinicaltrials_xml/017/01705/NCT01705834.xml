	<brief_title>Dataglove to Measure Joint Stiffness in Patients With Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We will use a dataglove to record joint movements in a small number of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The aim of the study is to find out if changes in dynamic movements measured by the glove will correlate with symptoms of joint stiffness in the hands of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.</detailed_description>
