	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD), of ivacaftor in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) who are 2 through 5 years of age and have a CF Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gating mutation in at least 1 allele. Part A is designed to evaluate the safety and PK of multiple-dose administration of ivacaftor in participants 2 through 5 years of age and to confirm the doses for Part B. Part B is designed to evaluate the safety, PK, PD, and efficacy of ivacaftor in participants 2 through 5 years of age.</brief_summary>
