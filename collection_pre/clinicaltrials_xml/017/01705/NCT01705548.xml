	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of hypofractionated radiosurgery in treating patients with large brain metastasis. Stereotactic radiosurgery can send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery may kill more tumor cells</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery in Treating Patients With Large Brain Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To demonstrate the safety and feasibility of treating brain metastases or resection cavities greater than 3 cm with hypofractionated radiosurgery and to determine the maximum-tolerated radiation dose for hypofractionated radiosurgery (HR) delivered in 5 fractions, 2-3 fractions per week. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients undergo hypofractionated stereotactic radiosurgery 2-3 times weekly (5 fractions total) for 2-3 weeks. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month and then every 3 months thereafter.</detailed_description>
