	<brief_summary>NSABP FB-9 is a Phase II, multi-center, randomized study of eribulin or weekly paclitaxel followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) as neoadjuvant therapy for women with HER2-negative, operable and locally advanced breast cancer (stage IIb and III). Patients in the control arm will receive neoadjuvant weekly paclitaxel (WP) followed by AC. The primary aim of the study is to determine the pathologic complete response (ypCR) in breast and axillary lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant therapy. The secondary aims include determination of the ypCR in axillary nodes, clinical complete response (ycCR) rate after eribulin or paclitaxel and after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, two-year recurrence-free interval, two-year overall survival, and toxicity of the neoadjuvant regimens.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy With Weekly Paclitaxel or Eribulin Followed by A/C in Women With Locally Advanced HER2-Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be randomized to one of two neoadjuvant therapy regimens. Patients in Arm 1 will receive WP 80 mg/m2 for 12 doses followed by standard AC every 21 days for 4 cycles. Patients in Arm 2 will receive 4 cycles of eribulin 1.4 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle followed by standard AC every 21 days for 4 cycles. As soon as possible following recovery from chemotherapy, the patient will have either lumpectomy or mastectomy and axillary staging. In both arms, clinical response will be assessed by physical exam on day 1 of each study therapy cycle. MRI of the breast is required within 4 weeks prior to randomization and following completion of eribulin or WP (before starting AC). Following recovery from surgery, patients will receive radiation therapy and hormonal therapy as clinically indicated. Other postoperative therapies are prohibited. Patients will be randomized to the control arm (Arm 1) and to the investigational arm (Arm 2) in a 1:2 ratio. The sample size will be up to 50 patients with about 30 patients in Arm 2 and about half that number in Arm 1. Accrual is expected to occur over 15 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients should have a life expectancy of at least 10 years, excluding their diagnosis of breast cancer. (Comorbid conditions should be taken into consideration, but not the diagnosis of breast cancer.) Patients of reproductive potential must agree to use an effective nonhormonal method of contraception during therapy and for at least 6 months after the last dose of study therapy. The patient must have consented to participate and must have signed and dated an appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB)approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines. Patients must be female. Patients must be &gt; 18 years old. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status must be 0 or 1. The diagnosis of invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast must have been made by core needle biopsy or by limited incisional biopsy. Patients must have ER analysis performed on the primary tumor prior to randomization. If ER analysis is negative, then Progesterone Receptor (PgR) analysis must also be performed. (Patients are eligible with either hormone receptorpositive or hormone receptornegative tumors.) Clinical staging, based on the assessment by physical exam, must be American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage IIB, IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC: cT2 and cN1, cT3 and cN0 or cN1, Any cT and cN2 or cN3, cT4 The patient must have a mass in the breast or axilla measuring greater than or equal to 2.0 cm by physical exam, unless the patient has inflammatory breast cancer, in which case measurable disease by physical exam is not required. At the time of randomization, blood counts performed within 4 weeks prior to randomization must meet the following criteria: Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) must be greater than or equal to 1200/mm3; Platelet count must be greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3; Hemoglobin must be greater than or equal to 10 g/dL. The following criteria for evidence of adequate hepatic function performed within 4 weeks prior to randomization must be met: total bilirubin must be less than or equal to Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) for the lab unless the patient has a bilirubin elevation &gt; ULN to 1.5 x ULN due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of bilirubin; and alkaline phosphatase must be less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab; and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) must be less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab. Patients with alkaline phosphatase &gt; ULN but less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if liver imaging (CT, MRI, PET, or PETCT scan) performed within 4 weeks prior to randomization does not demonstrate metastatic disease and the requirements in the criteria below for unexplained skeletal pain are met. Patients with either unexplained skeletal pain or alkaline phosphatase that is &gt; ULN but less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if a bone scan, PETCT scan, or PET scan performed within 4 weeks prior to randomization does not demonstrate metastatic disease. Patients with suspicious findings on bone scan or PET scan are eligible if suspicious findings are determined to be benign by xray, MRI, or biopsy. Serum creatinine performed within 4 weeks prior to randomization must be less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab. Serum potassium and serum magnesium performed within 4 weeks prior to randomization must be Within Normal Limits (WNL). The Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) assessment by 2D echocardiogram or Multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan performed within 90 days prior to randomization must be greater than or equal to 50% regardless of the facility's Lower Limit of Normal (LLN).
