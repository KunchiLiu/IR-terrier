	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to investigate the metabolic effects during acute inflammation with and without the nutritional supplement of amino acids. E. Coli Endotoxin (LPS, lipopolysaccharide) is used to initiate an inflammatory response. The study is an interventional randomized placebo study including 8 healthy male subjects. Each subject participates 3 times (different days) and are given one of following interventions: - Placebo (NaCl) - Endotoxin, US standard reference E.Coli + Placebo (NaCl) - Endotoxin, US standard reference E.Coli + Amino acids (intravenously) It is our hypothesis that the nutritional intervention during acute inflammation plays an important role in lipid and protein metabolism.</brief_summary>
