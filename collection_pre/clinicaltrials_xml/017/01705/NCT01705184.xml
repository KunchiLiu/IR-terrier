	<brief_summary>At present, the treatment of non-squamous cell lung cancer is based on chemotherapy with platinum eventually associated with bevacizumab. A new treatment begins at progression. In colo-rectal metastatic cancer, it was demonstrated that the first-line of treatment could be administered according to a stop and go strategy respecting therapeutic breaks between sequences of identical treatment. During these therapeutic breaks, a treatment of maintenance is possibly better than an absence of treatment. These plans benefit to the patients in terms of efficiency but also in terms of toxicity, in particular neurological. The question is to know if this strategy is feasible in lung cancer.</brief_summary>
