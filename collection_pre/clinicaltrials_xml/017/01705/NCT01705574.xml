	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of a regimen containing elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Stribild®; E/C/F/TDF) fixed-dose combination (FDC) versus ritonavir (RTV)-boosted atazanavir (ATV) plus emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada®; FTC/TDF) in HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral treatment-naive adult women. This study will consist of two phases: Double-Blinded Treatment Phase (48 weeks) and Open-Label Extension (OLE) Phase (48 weeks). After 48 weeks of blinded treatment, participants will continue to take blinded study drug for 12 weeks and return for an Unblinding Visit at Week 60. Participants who are virologically suppressed at Week 48 during the Double-Blinded Treatment Phase will have the option to enter the OLE Phase.</brief_summary>
