	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ASP9853 combined with docetaxel or with paclitaxel in subjects with advanced non-hematologic malignancies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1, Dose Escalation Study to Assess the Safety and Tolerability of ASP9853 With Either Docetaxel or Paclitaxel in Patients With Advanced Non-hematologic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a two part study. Part 1 will test increasing dose levels of ASP9853 in combination with docetaxel. Part 2 will test increasing doses of ASP9853 combined with paclitaxel. Each part will determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase 2 dose for ASP9853 in combination with each taxane. Preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of ASP9853 in combination with docetaxel or with paclitaxel also will be explored.</detailed_description>
