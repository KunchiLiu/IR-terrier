	<brief_title>Myocet ® - Carboplatine in Ovarian Cancer in Relapse, Sensitive to the Platinum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In front of a shortage of Caelyx, the implementation of an alternative treatment must be considered to treat patients with ovarian cancer in relapse, sensitive to platin: associate the carboplatin with another drug of the family of the doxorubicin: liposomal doxorubicin (Myocet®).</detailed_description>
