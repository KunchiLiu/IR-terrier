	<brief_summary>This is a Phase I, multi-center, Dose-Escalating, Safety Study of an Intravenously Administered Pegylated Liposomal Mitomycin-C Lipid-based Prodrug (PL-MLP, PROMITIL) in Cancer Patients with Solid Tumors. The study comprised of: Escalated cohorts A-H: 27 male or female participants, ages 18-80, BMI 18-36 diagnosed with inoperable, recurrent or metastatic malignant solid tumors, deemed incurable, and who have failed to respond to standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy is available. Eligible subjects will be assigned, successively in order of accrual, to one of eight cohorts, to receive escalating doses of intravenously infused PROMITIL. PROMITIL will be administered as an intravenous infusion. Dose escalation will only proceed in the absence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). For this purpose, each cohort will only begin its first cycle of PROMITIL when the cohort preceding it has successfully completed its first 4-week cycle without any signs of DLT. Expanded cohort: 17 adult patients with metastatic CRC. The purpose of this expanded cohort is to further evaluate the safety of Promitil and to search for signs of antitumor activity of Promitil in this specific patient population. Combination Cohort (Promitil concomitantly with Capecitabine): 23 adult patients with metastatic CRC.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For all cohorts, PROMITIL will be administered as an intravenous infusion at an initial rate of 0.25mg/min followed by gradual increase to a maximal rate of 2mg/min until completion of dosing, if absence of infusion reactions is established and in line with most updated version of IFU available for this study. For each subject, subsequent dosing will take place 28 days after the previous treatment, provided they are deemed fit to be dosed again. Patients will return to the study center on days 8, 15, 22 of cycle 1, and on day 15 of cycles 2 and 3, for monitoring assessments. All patients will be followed-up for survival and post-Promitil treatment. Patients who did not received 3 cycles of PROMITIL will be followed up only until PD.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients diagnosed with inoperable, recurrent or metastatic malignant solid tumors, deemed incurable, and who have either: Failed to respond to standard therapy or For whom no standard therapy is available or Refuse to receive standard therapies 2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of solid tumor on file. 3. Age 1880 years 4. BMI: 1836 5. ECOG Performance Status ≤ 2 6. Estimated life expectancy of at least 3 months 7. Adequate bone marrow function (an absolute neutrophil count ≥1500/mm3, hemoglobin ≥9.5 g/dl, HgbA1C≤7%, and a platelet count ≥100,000/mm3( 8. Adequate liver function (serum bilirubin ≤2.0 mg/100 ml; alanine aminotransferase ≤2× ULN) 9. Adequate renal function (serum creatinine ≤1.5 mg/100 ml or creatinine clearance ≥45 ml/min/1.73m2) 10. No prior intravenous treatment with MitomycinC either alone or in combination 11. No other myelosuppressive treatment within 4 weeks before start of the study drug. 12. No other anticancer treatment within 2 weeks before start of the study drug 13. No prior extensive radiotherapy (e.g., whole pelvis total neuroaxis or greater than 50% of neuroaxis, whole abdomen, whole body or halfbody) or bone marrow transplantation with high dose chemotherapy and/or total body irradiation. Reirradiation of a field in abdomen/pelvis will be considered as extensive radiotherapy, excluding such patients from the study. 14. Women of child bearing potential practicing an acceptable method of birth control. 15. Understanding of study procedures and willingness to comply for the entire length of the study and to give written informed consent. 16. Additional criteria only for the Expanded Cohort: Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed recurrent and/or metastatic measurable or nonmeasurable CRC, with tissue or cytological diagnosis of cancer on file. 17. Patients who have received past treatment with oxaliplatin, irinotecan and fluopyrimidinebased chemotherapy, and, in the case of Kras wild type tumors, received antiEGFR antibodies (Cetuximab, Panitumumab). Patients who demonstrated either progression or intolerance when treated with the above. Prior treatment with Bevacizumab is allowed but not required. 18. A ≥ 21 day treatmentfree interval from chemotherapeutic treatment, with the exception of Capecitabine and biological therapies, where ≥14day treatmentfree intervals suffice. (this is also relevant for patients in the Combination Cohort that are currently taking Capecitabine prior to enter the study). 19. Additional criteria only for the Combination Cohort: Clinical decision made to initiate treatment with Capecitabine prior to enrollment in the study. Treatment with Capecitabine can be started either prior to or after signed ICF. 1. Known hypersensitivity to the study drug or to any of its components 2. CHF (NYHA = Class IV) or LVEF≤40% 3. COPD &gt; Stage 3 (FEV1&lt;50%, FEV1/FVC&lt;70%); 4. Cirrhosis (ChildPugh Class C score); 5. Serum Albumin level &lt; 3 g/dl 6. Any other severe concurrent disease which in the judgment of the investigator would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study 7. History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection 8. History of chronic active hepatitis including subjects who are carriers of hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). 9. Presence of uncontrolled infection. 10. Evidence of active bleeding or bleeding diathesis 11. Brain metastases in symptomatic patients requiring ≥4 mg dexamethasone/day. However, patients with treated brain metastases by surgery or radiation who are stable and symptomfree (&lt;4 mg dexamethasone/day) for a minimum period of 4 weeks posttreatment are eligible. 12. Pregnant or lactating 13. Treatment with other investigational drugs within 14 days of start of the study drug for nonmyelosuppressive agents, and within 28 days of start of the study drug for myelosuppressive agents. 14. Additional criteria only for the Expanded Cohort: Patients with prior treatment with Regorafenib are excluded from entering the Expanded Cohort. 15. Additional criteria only for the Combination cohort: Uncontrolled ascites (defined as 2 or more palliative taps in the last 30 days before screening).</criteria>
