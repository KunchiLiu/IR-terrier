	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to measure the presence of HMGB-1 and other proteins in the blood across five time points after stroke, and to determine if their presence correlates with rate of stroke recovery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role of HMGB-1 in Chronic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke, cerebrovascular accident, is the leading cause of brain injury and the leading cause of permanent disability. The acute pathophysiology of stroke depends on the innate immune response, which arises from mostly pro-inflammatory cascades. The chronic pathophysiology of stroke is less clear as the innate inflammatory response fades and matures into an adaptive immune response. HMGB-1 is a serum cytokine that has been found with persistent elevated levels for weeks to months after neurological insult in preclinical experiments, and may retard functional recovery. Elucidation of the relationship between HMGB-1 levels and the rate of functional recovery after stroke could lead to a better understanding of the systemic inflammatory response and more targeted therapeutic interventions.</detailed_description>
