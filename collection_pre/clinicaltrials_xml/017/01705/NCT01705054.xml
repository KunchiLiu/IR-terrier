	<detailed_description>The primary goals in the management of stable coronary artery disease (CAD) are to reduce risk factors for heart attack and to control the symptoms of angina (chest pain). Ideally angina is well controlled with medications alone, but invasive procedures are a valuable option for patients with persistent angina. The amount of angina among patients with stable CAD in the outpatient setting, however, is unknown. An Australian study reported that almost 1 in 3 patients with stable angina being treated by primary care doctors had angina at least once a week, which was associated with worse quality of life. We propose to examine the burden of angina in outpatients with stable CAD who are being medically managed by cardiologists in the United States through administration of a one-time survey. The information from this study could ultimately help improve management of stable CAD and angina and illuminate potential underuse of revascularization. While cardiologists are generally expected to provide better angina control than primary care doctors, establishing the prevalence of angina among the best providers will help with a framework for interpreting symptom control among other practitioners.</detailed_description>
