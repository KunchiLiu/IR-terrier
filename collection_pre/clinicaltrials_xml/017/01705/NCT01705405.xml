	<brief_title>Merging of Endoscopic and Ultrasound Images for Laparoscopic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order to help the surgeon to remove the prostate during a laparoscopic intervention, our goal is to provide an innovative medical device that merges intra-operative ultrasound and endoscopic images. We have already achieved the proof of concept of a device that merges ultrasound and endoscopic images. The objectives of this clinical trial are to accompany the maturation of the fusion device and to make the initial assessments of its Medical Service. The main difficulty is to visualize markers (surgical needles) under both modalities , in order to merge them.</detailed_description>
