	<brief_summary>The overall purpose of this study is to describe the trajectory of early survivorship in individuals with colon cancer who undergo both surgical and medical management of colon cancer. The primary question is whether or not there is an interaction between type of surgery and changes in quality of life, sexual function, peripheral neuropathy, and demands of illness following curative resection and adjuvant chemotherapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The prospective design with three cohorts of participants will describe the changes in quality of life, sexual function, peripheral neuropathy and demands of illness following curative resection and adjuvant chemotherapy (Aims 1-4). An analysis of the interaction between time (four measurement occasions) and surgical type (open resection, laparoscopic resection, robotic resection) by mean values of quality of life, sexual function, peripheral neuropathy, and demands of illness will examine the central thesis question (Aim 5). Specific Aims 1. Describe the demographic and disease characteristics of the sample. 2. Examine the relationships among quality of life, sexual functioning, peripheral neuropathy, and demands of illness for the sample-as-a-whole and by type of surgical resection (open, laparoscopic, robotic). 3. Examine within-subject changes in the mean values of scores for quality of life, sexual functioning, peripheral neuropathy, and demands of illness across four measurement occasions. 4. Examine between-group differences in mean values of scores for quality of life, sexual function, peripheral neuropathy, and demands of illness at four discrete measurement occasions. 5. Examine the interaction between time (four measurement occasions) and surgical type (open resection, laparoscopic resection, robotic resection) by mean values of quality of life, sexual function, peripheral neuropathy, and demands of illness.</detailed_description>
