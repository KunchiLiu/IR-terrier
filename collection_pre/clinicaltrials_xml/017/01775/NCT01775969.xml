	<brief_summary>Outpatient antibiotics are frequently prescribed from the emergency department, and limited health literacy may impact compliance with recommended treatments. The investigators are looking to determine if patient preference for multimodality discharge instructions for outpatient antibiotic therapy varies by health literacy level, and if modality effected patient-reported antibiotic compliance and 72-hour antibiotic pick-up.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Modality on Discharge Instruction in Patients Receiving Outpatient Antibiotic Prescriptions From the Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective randomized trial that includes consenting patients discharged with outpatient antibiotics. Health literacy is assessed using a validated health literacy assessment, the Newest Vital Sign (NVS). Patients are randomized to a discharge instruction modality: 1) standard of care, typed and verbal medication and case-specific instructions; 2) standard of care plus text messaged instructions sent to the patient's cell phone; or 3) standard of care plus voicemailed instructions sent to the patient's cell phone. Antibiotic pick-up is verified with the patient's pharmacy at 72 hours. Patients are called at 30 days to determine antibiotic compliance.</detailed_description>
