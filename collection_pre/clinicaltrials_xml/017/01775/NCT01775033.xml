	<brief_title>Regionalized Pediatric Emergency Care in Rural Pennsylvania</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The OUTREACH project will develop, implement and evaluate an organized system of regional pediatric emergency care in rural western Pennsylvania. Toward that end the investigators have developed three broad goals: (1) to define the key barriers and potential solutions to regionalized pediatric emergency care through community stakeholder engagement; (2) to implement a regionalized system of pediatric emergency care using education, community outreach and telemedicine; and (3) evaluate the impact of the system on health care access and outcomes for rural children. The investigators will implement the intervention in a sample of rural hospitals in Pennsylvania using a staggered roll-out design, and compare outcomes of children seen in these hospitals to similar matched hospitals in the state, using Pennsylvania state Medicaid data to evaluate the impact of the intervention.</detailed_description>
