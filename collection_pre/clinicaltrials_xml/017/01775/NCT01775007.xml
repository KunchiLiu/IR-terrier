	<brief_summary>A Brillouin ocular analyzer uses a low-power near infrared laser light to probe the viscoelastic properties of the cornea and crystalline lens in the eye. The study hypothesis is that the instrument can measure the Brillouin light scattering spectra from the eye safely and effectively from human subjects.</brief_summary>
