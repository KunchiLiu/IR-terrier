	<brief_summary>Study part 1 and 2 Assessment of Zn absorption from regular and biofortified wheat: stable isotope absorption studies in women of childbearing age consuming test meals prepared from either the biofortified Zn wheat, regular wheat or post-harvest fortified wheat at two different extraction rates. Study part 3 Assessment of Zn absorption from intrinsically and extrinsically labeled wheat: stable isotope absorption studies in women of childbearing age, or men, consuming test meals prepared from either intrinsically labeled Zn biofortified wheat, regular wheat or post-harvest fortified wheat extrinsically labeled immediately before consumption.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Human Zinc Absorption From Wheat-based Meals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall goal of study part 1 and 2 is to evaluate and compare the fractional and absolute Zn absorption from biofortified wheat cultivar (60 ppm Zn) to regular wheat (28 ppm Zn) and to post harvest fortified wheat (60 ppm Zn) for a total of 3 test meals per study. The studies will be conducted with products based on wheat with high extraction rate (study part 1) and medium extraction rate (study part 2) in two separate groups of women of childbearing age. The goal of study part 3 is to investigate the difference of absorption measurements between intrinsically and extrinsically labeled biofortified wheat. The label of the test meals will have the same nature as the fortificant itself (extrinsic vs intrinsic), for a total of 3 test meals.</detailed_description>
