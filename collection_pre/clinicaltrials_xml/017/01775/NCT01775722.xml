	<brief_summary>Port wine stain Birthmark is a congenital, progressive vascular malformation of human skin. However, even though the pulsed dye laser is considered as the treatment of choice for Port wine stain Birthmark the degree of fading can remain variable and unpredictable after laser treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combined Bipolar Radiofrequency&amp;Pulsed Dye Laser Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The researcher want to use the combination of radiofrequency electrical energy with pulsed dye laser light energy which can improve therapeutic outcome of Port wine stain Birthmark. This investigational device is essentially a combination of two commercially available systems cleared for marketing (K044351 and K052324) provided by Candela Laser Corporation.</detailed_description>
