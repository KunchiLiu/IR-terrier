	<brief_summary>Pilot data in patients and data from pig studies indicate that arginine-NO metabolism is impaired in sepsis with changes in splanchnic metabolism and function, and reduced survival at low nitrate levels. Prolonged intravenous supplementation of L-arginine proved effective in pigs for increasing NO production, restoring gut function, and inhibiting an increase in pulmonary arterial pressure, without any deleterious systemic side effects. Prolonged intravenous L-arginine supplementation could therefore be useful in septic ICU patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Written informed consent from close relative Age &gt; 18 years Patient meets the general criteria for severe sepsis or septic shock, diagnosed less than 48 h prior to study inclusion (see appendix A; in Dutch). Patient must be relatively hemodynamically stable, defined as stable blood pressure (variation in mean arterial pressure &lt;15 mm Hg) during 2 h without necessity of increasing the vasopressor dose, inotropic support or rate of fluid administration. Systemic and pulmonary arterial catheters in place with continuous pressure monitoring. Patients in whom the clinician is prepared to provide full life support during the duration of the study, including a life expectance of &gt; 24 h.
