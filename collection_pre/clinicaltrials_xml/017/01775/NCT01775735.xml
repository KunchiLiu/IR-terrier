	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) using the Boston Scientific Corporation (BSC) Precision™ System in the management of intractable chronic migraine, when used in conjunction with anti-migraine medications.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Occipital Nerve Stimulation (ONS) for Migraine: OPTIMISE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Initial reports of managing migraine headache with ONS described a technique in which electrical leads were implanted in the subcutaneous space transverse to the occipital nerve, in the back of the head, under x-ray guidance. The leads were tunneled under the skin to an implantable pulse generator (IPG) implanted in the chest wall or abdomen. The OPTIMISE Trial is designed to be a pivotal study of the Boston Scientific PRECISION neurostimulation system, when the system is used for ONS. The PRECISION System has been previously been approved for Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS).</detailed_description>
