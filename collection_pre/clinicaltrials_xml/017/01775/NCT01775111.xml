	<brief_summary>The aim of this randomized, observer-blind, controlled intervention study with parallel groups is to study the effect of strength training (2x/week for 6 months) with and without additional dietary supplementation (protein-enriched) on muscle strength, function and mass, oxidative stress parameters and the immune system in elderly institutionalized persons. The participants (n = 120) are recruited from Viennese senior residencies (Kuratorium Wiener Pensionistenwohnheime). After a pre-participation screening participants will be distributed randomly but stratified by sex and age to one of the 3 intervention groups (cognitive training, strength training, strength training + supplement). Study participants are eligible if they are male or female with an age over 65 years and if their cognitive status as well as their physical fitness level allows to participate at the strength training sessions. Exclusion criteria comprise chronic diseases which contraindicate the medical training therapy, serious cardiovascular disease, diabetic retinopathy and manifest osteoporosis, medication with anticoagulants or cortisone drugs and also regular strength training during the last six months. Primary outcome measure is the change in isokinetic torque of knee extensors. Secondary outcome measures comprise anthropometric data, functional performance tests, immunological and oxidative stress parameters. The change in muscle signaling pathways will be assessed from muscle biopsies.</brief_summary>
