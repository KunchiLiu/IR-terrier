	<brief_summary>In patients with aortic stenosis the valve through which blood is pumped out of the main heart chamber is narrowed. This results in heart muscle working harder to open the valve so blood can circulate around the body. The muscle adapts to the increased pressure load to maintain efficiency. This can cause long-term muscle damage. To predict when this deterioration will require a valve replacement is difficult and untimely operation exposes patients to unnecessary risk. We aim to compare all validated techniques looking at different aspects of heart muscle strain in these patients. These will be a blood sample measuring a specific hormone (BNP) and enzyme (Troponin), a nuclear scan to assess nerve activation, an MRI identifying scarring and an exercise echocardiogram that measures heart muscle response and pressure changes across the valve. Tests will be performed at recruitment and either after one year or after valve replacement, which ever comes first. In comparing these different imaging techniques we aim to identify patients who will benefit from an early operation, those whose muscle is likely to recover back to normal and which patients it is safe to wait longer for the surgery, avoiding unnecessary risk. The results of the study will benefit patients as it will help doctors more accurately assess the timing of valve surgery and improve their prediction of long term heart muscle recovery. It may also increase convenience in clinical management by reducing unnecessary tests and hospital trips. This would translate into cost savings for the NHS.</brief_summary>
