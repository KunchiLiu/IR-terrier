	<brief_summary>Many patients on hemodialysis experience high rates of symptom burden, such as pain, depression, anxiety and difficulty breathing. This study seeks to reduce these symptoms by modifying the usual guidelines used to manage patients on hemodialysis. For example, rather than trying to keep serum phosphorus below 5.5, patients enrolled in this study may have treatment goals of less than 6.5, in order to reduce the number of pills they need to take and potentially reduce harmful side effects. Blood pressure and serum parathyroid hormone goals will also be modified, to see if these modifications help hemodialysis patients feel better.</brief_summary>
