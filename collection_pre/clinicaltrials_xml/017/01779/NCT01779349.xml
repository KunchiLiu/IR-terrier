	<brief_summary>Current gold standard of bladder outlet diagnosis is pressure flow study. This study is invasive time consuming and requires expensive and complex set-up. In this study the investigators plan to evaluate an alternative technology that presumably is able to diagnose bladder outlet obstruction using a Dynamic Urine Vibration "Holter" based on a Urine Flow Vibration Analysis technology. The acoustic vibration sensor is a small device that records the vibration due to urine flow. The patient attaches the sensor to the penis using a disposable sensor patch for the duration of approximately one minute during one urination. The analysis is performed off-line and the results are compared to the results of a standard pressure flow study and to the standard free flowmetry test. The innovative technology for the diagnosis of bladder outlet obstruction is noninvasive, rapid and does not involve complex setup.</brief_summary>
