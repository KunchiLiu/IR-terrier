	<brief_summary>The goal of this project is to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of using remote compliance monitoring in buprenorphine (Suboxone®) treatment for opiate dependence. To that end, 10 opiate dependent subjects will be recruited through the University of Pennsylvania's Treatment Research Center, an outpatient substance abuse treatment facility. All subjects will receive buprenorphine (Suboxone®) (16 mg/day, adjusted as needed according to individual requirements).</brief_summary>
