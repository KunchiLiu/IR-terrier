	<brief_summary>1. MAIN OBJECTIVE : To assess the consequences of a maternal hyperthyroïd during pregnancy on intellectual development of the child from 6 to 9 years 2. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : 1. To assess the consequences of a maternal hyperthyroïd during pregnancy on the capacities of attention, learning process and the degree of hyperactivity of the child from 6 to 9 years. 2. To study if it exist differences of intellectual development, capacities of attention, learning process, and degree of hyperactivity in the child from 6 to 9 years, born to hyperthyroid mother during pregnancy, according to: - the etiology of the maternal hyperthyroïd (transitory gestation hyperthyroid versus disease of Basedow), - the use or not of a anti-thyroid treatment, - the rate of TSH néonatal (measured with the blotter by tracking with J3 at all the new born ones).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1. INCLUSION CRITERIA : - Old from 6 to 9 years included - Age of gestation between ≥37 and &lt;41 weeks of amenorrhoea - Born from a mono-foetale pregnancy - Euthyroïd at the time of the entry in the study - Provided education for at the elementary school on a level adapted to its age 2. NON INCLUSION CRITERIA : - Presenting a congenital hypothyroïd or a known thyroid dysfonction at the time of the entry in the study - Carrier of a chronic pathology (organic or psychological) or malformative severe - Presenting an antecedent of Deficit of the Attention-Hyperactivity to the 1st degree 3. EXCLUSION CRITERIA : o Discovered of a thyroid dysfonction at the time of the entry in the study 4. STRATEGIES / PROCEDURES : Multicentric, comparative study of a troop of child born to hyperthyroïd mothers during pregnancy (children exposed to the maternal hyperthyroïd) and children born to euthyroïd mothers during pregnancy (nonexposed children with the maternal hyperthyroïd). - 1st part of the study: Retrospective analyze of the files of symptomatic hyperthyroid mothers during pregnancy. - 2nd part of the study: Assessment of intellectual development, capacities of attention, learning process and degree of hyperactivity of the children between 6 and 9 years. The exposed children (born to hyperthyroïd mothers during pregnancy) will be compared with nonexposed children (born to euthyroïd mothers during pregnancy).</detailed_description>
