	<brief_summary>A new, more specific skin test to detect tuberculosis has been developed by Statens Serum Institut in Denmark. The new skin test is named C-Tb and like the current Tuberculin a positive test result will show as redness and/or induration at the injection site, while a negative test will leave no reactions. The aim of this study is to address if the size of induration and the sensitivity of C-Tb is influenced by concomitant injections of C-Tb and Tuberculin. Furthermore, the intention is to evaluate the safety of C-Tb when injected alone or concomitantly with Tuberculin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Investigating if Concomitant Injections of C-Tb and 2 T.U Tuberculin Affect Induration Responses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The TESEC-07 trial is a GCP double blind randomised controlled phase II/III trial investigating if concomitant injections of the diagnostic agents C-Tb and 2 T.U Tuberculin PPD RT 23 SSI affect the induration responses in combination with a safety assessment of C-Tb. TESEC-07 is a multi-centre trial and will be conducted in South Africa in patients recently diagnosed with TB comprising 360 HIV negative and 90 HIV positive adults allocated to 3 trial groups. - A within group paired comparison of 0.1 Î¼g/0.1 mL C-Tb and PPD RT 23 in 150 TB patients. The C-Tb and PPD RT 23 agents are given concomitantly to each volunteer in the RIGHT AND LEFT forearms according to a randomisation scheme. - A group of 150 TB patients will only receive the C-Tb agent randomised to either RIGHT or LEFT forearm. - A group of 150 TB patients will only receive the reference agent PPD RT 23 randomised to either RIGHT or LEFT forearm.</detailed_description>
