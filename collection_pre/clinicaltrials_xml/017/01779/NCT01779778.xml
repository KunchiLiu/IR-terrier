	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to determine the diurnal and nocturnal effects of Travoprost with SofZia (Travatan Z) on intraocular pressure and ocular perfusion pressure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diurnal and Nocturnal Effect of Travatan With SofZia Preservative on Intraocular Pressure and Ocular Perfusion Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators hypothesize that Travatan Z will significantly lower intraocular pressure and increase ocular perfusion pressure during both the diurnal and nocturnal period, during a 24-hour evaluation, compared to baseline. The investigators further hypothesize that the medication effects will persist at 72 hours after discontinuation of the drug.</detailed_description>
