	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this crossover trial is to compare the 3-month, mean 24-hour intraocular pressure (IOP) control and safety obtained with two popular fixed combinations in glaucoma patients insufficiently controlled with latanoprost monotherapy. This study will compare the 24-hour efficacy of travoprost/timolol fixed combination without benzalkonium chloride given once in the evening, versus the latanoprost/timolol fixed combination given in the evening. It is assumed that travoprost/timolol fixed combination will provide better quality of 24-hour pressure control.</brief_summary>
