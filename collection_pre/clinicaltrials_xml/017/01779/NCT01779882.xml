	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis, that the order of application of Busulfan (BU) and Cyclophosphamide (CY) has an impact on toxicity after allogeneic Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and that CY-BU reduces liver toxicity compared to BU-CY.</brief_summary>
