	<brief_summary>Using a protective ventilation strategy during general anesthesia from pre-oxygenation to emergence and selecting patients without risk of a difficult airway or intubation, a lower fraction of inspiratory oxygen (FIO2) can be used during extubation. This might reduce the postoperative area of atelectasis without desaturations becoming more common.</brief_summary>
