	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that the use of heparin-grafted membrane versus conventional membrane in critically-ill patients with bleeding-risk undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy, will effectively prolong the circuit lifespan, without worsening of the systemic APTT or underlying bleeding risk.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Heparin-grafted Membrane for CRRT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims and objectives: We aim to compare the performance and safety of heparin-grafted AN69 membrane (oXiris, Gambro) with the conventional AN69 membrane (M150, Gambro) without systemic anticoagulation during continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), who has moderate bleeding risk and in whom systemic anticoagulation is contraindicated.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult patients (age 21 and above) who are admitted to ICUs or CCU and requiring CRRT for acute kidney injury or ESRD Patients who has moderate bleeding risk (see below definitions) Patients with NO systemic or regional circuit anticoagulation Informed consent taken from the patient, or proxy if the former is unable to sign due to medical reasons Anticipated need for prolonged CRRT &gt; 3 days (Moderate bleeding risk criteria:) Moderate bleeding risk is defined by any of the following: 1. Platelet count &lt; 100 x 109 mm3 (but &gt; 50) 2. INR &gt; 1.5 (but &lt; 2.5) 3. APTT &gt; 50 seconds (but &lt; 75) 4. Postsurgery for &lt; 48 hours 5. Postinvasive procedures (eg. Pericardiocentasis) &lt; 24 hrs 6. Post major artery puncture or catheter removal from major arteries (carotids, subclavian, or femoral) &lt; 24 hours 7. Recent internal or gastrointestinal bleeding within 48 hours (should be secured bleeding with no relapse noted) Patients with very high bleeding risk (for which they should also fall outside of the below inclusion criteria see below) Patients who are known to have heparininduced thrombocytopenia or allergic to heparin Patients with other medical conditions for which heparin is contraindicated. Patients who require systemic anticoagulation for medical indications (We will accept patients who are on prophylactic doses of anticoagulation for DVT prophylaxis) Patients who are pregnant Patients/legally accepted surrogate who decline to consent</criteria>
