	<brief_summary>Various kinds of intermittent pneumatic compression devices (IPC) with particular ways of compression have been developed and used for prevention of deep vein thrombosis. There are still some controversies about the physiologic properties and clinical impact of numerous issues including the variety of the cuff length, inflation rate, compression sequence, compression-relaxation cycle rate, and pressure generation characteristics. This study is designed to compare clinical efficacies as well as venous hemodynamic improvements between Simultaneous bilateral compression with fixed venous refill time versus alternate compression with adjusted refill time</brief_summary>

	<criteria>the patients who undergo total knee replacement arthroplasty (1) chronic superficial or deep venous insufficiency, (2) venous anomalies like duplication of the superficial femoral vein, (3) previous venous thromboembolism history, (4) being under anticoagulation therapy, (5) severe arteriosclerosis obliterans without palpable dorsalis pedis pulse, (6) open fracture, hemorrhagic condition, or extensive dermatitis at lower legs, (7) congestive heart failure. Additional exclusion criteria included a documented malignant tumor, because pharmacologic prophylaxis with anticoagulants would be more reasonable in this case.</criteria>
