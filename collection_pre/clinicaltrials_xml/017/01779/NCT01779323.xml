	<brief_summary>The hypothesis is men with stress urinary incontinence, including those following radical retropubic prostatectomy and other prostate surgery, have preoperative urethral mobility as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that improves significantly following sling placement. The investigators theorize that the sling helps with primary hypermobility of this pathophysiologic cause of stress urinary incontinence.</brief_summary>
