	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to establish the effect of ET blockade on vascular adaptations during an 8-week exercise program in subjects with T2DM. We hypothesize that combining ET - blockade with exercise training leads to an acute increase of exercise induced blood flow when compared with exercise alone. We expect that this will lead to an optimization of vascular training effect in T2DM.</brief_summary>
