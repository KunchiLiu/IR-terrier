	<brief_summary>Purpose: The aim of this observational study (registry) is to document the use of insulin pump therapy (CSII) and sensor augmented pump therapy (SAP) before, during and after pregnancy in women with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus benefiting from the Orchestra donation of Paradigm REAL-Time and Paradigm Veo pumps in Poland. Objectives: To assess the benefits of CSII and SAP on the maternal glycemic control; To assess the prevalence of pregnancy complications (rates of preterm delivery, infant birth weight, neonatal care admissions) from preconception phase, throughout pregnancy, during delivery and after delivery during lactation phase (up to 6 weeks); To report and assess the potential benefits of SAP or CSII on neonatal outcomes</brief_summary>
