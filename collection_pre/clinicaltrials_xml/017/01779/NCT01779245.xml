	<brief_summary>A high-calcium intake can accelerate fat loss under energy-restricted diets. Part of this may be due to a shift in substrate metabolism where there is an increase in the rate of fat oxidation. However, whether high-calcium intake can influence substrate metabolism during exercise is not known. Accordingly, we aim to investigate the effect of 2 weeks of high-calcium intake on substrate metabolism during exercise.</brief_summary>
