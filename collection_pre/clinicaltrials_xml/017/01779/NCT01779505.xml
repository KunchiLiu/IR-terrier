	<brief_summary>This trial will be test the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of GS-4774 (GI-13020) in various doses and dosing regimens in healthy adults at one center in the US. Subjects will be enrolled into 3 arms using a dose escalation scheme and randomized into one of two dosing regimen cohorts. There will be 10 subjects per arm/cohort (total of 60 subjects to achieve 48 evaluable subjects enrolled), with study completion in 9-12 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1a Trial Assessing the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of GS-4774 (GI-13020) at Various Dose Levels and Regimens in Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HBV specific T cell responses have been shown to have a positive association with infection status in patients with chronic HBV, with the weakest T cell responses in patients with untreated chronic active infection and the strongest T cell responses in patients who have achieved seroconversion or cure (4). We have generated a Tarmogen expressing well conserved regions of the HBV X, S, and core antigens (GS-4774). GS-4774 is immunogenic in murine models and has also been used to stimulate human immune cell samples ex vivo to elicit HBV specific T cell responses which could predict the immune responses in patients dosed with GS-4774. GS-4774 will be evaluated in this healthy volunteer study to assess its safety, tolerability, and ability to elicit HBV specific T cell responses. In the future GS-4774 could be used in combination with HBV antivirals, such as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, in an attempt to improve HBsAg seroconversion (cure) rates in patients with chronic HBV infection.</detailed_description>
