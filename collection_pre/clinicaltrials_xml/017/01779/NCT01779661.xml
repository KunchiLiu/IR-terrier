	<brief_summary>The objective of this research is to examine the effect of Infant Aquatics on the development of and neurodevelopment of preterm and near-term infants, using the GM as prognostic estimation of future development. Preterm infants, a continuously growing population, are at high risk for neurodevelopment impairments ranging from minor neurological dysfunction (MND) to cerebral palsy (CP), mainly due to developmental brain injury. Infant Aquatics have been found to benefit and promote infant development. The support and sensory stimulation of the water may improve the development the sensory, motor, as well as, autonomic system of preterm infants. The study will compare intervention by Infant Aquatics to infant massage. The intervention in both methods will start at 36 weeks gestational age for 3 months and will consist of sessions with a therapist every 2 weeks. Development will be assessed and compared at 3, 8 and 18 months using Infant Motor Pattern method, Griffith developmental scales and Vineland adaptive behavior scales.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Major inclusion criteria: Infants who are hemodynamic stable, no seizures or apnea attacks, IVH/PVH grade &lt; 3, without diagnoses of chromosomal abnormalities, infants whose parents want to cooperate, will be included. These criteria follow our aim to include vulnerable groups of infants for which research results may dramatically promote development. infants whose parents are not able to understand research goals and refuse to cooperate, infants with seizures or apnea attacks, IVH/PVH grade &gt;or =3, with diagnoses of chromosomal abnormalities.</criteria>
