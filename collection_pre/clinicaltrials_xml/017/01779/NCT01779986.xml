	<brief_summary>The use of CT Coronary Angioscan (CT-AS) is gaining popularity, but its exact value as evaluation of CAD requires confirmation. We intend to compare the results of CT-AS and convention coronary angiogram results in patients who are scheduled for an ascending aorta aneurysm reparation surgery. These examens are standard of care before this surgery, so there is no additional danger or disadvantage for the patient. We hope to confirm that CT-AS is a reliable screening test for CAD in patient undergoing heart surgery for other reason than CAD.</brief_summary>
