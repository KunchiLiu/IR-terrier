	<brief_summary>Due to CT screening, a lot of peripheral nodule not accessible to conventional endoscopy will be found. Electromagnetic navigation directed bronchoscopy (ENB) is a new technique needing validation. the primary aim of the study is to compare ENB to radiologically guided bronchoscopy, considered the standard comparator.</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Multiple Pulmonary Nodules</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Presence on a conventional or low dose chest CT at least one lung nodule 520 mm in its largest axis, of indeterminate nature; the nodule must be positive at PETCT examination (in case of PETCT negative, only followup is proposed) The pulmonary nodule(s) must be known for less than 6 months The nodule appearance can be solid, presents as a ground glass opacity with solid component or as pure ground glass opacity Availability for participating in the detailed followup of the protocol Signed informed consent. Age &gt; 18 years Nodules found in the context of an active infection or for whom, the clinical context and/or additional available investigations (serology, microbiological samplings, immune abnormalities) show that cancer diagnosis is unlikely Nodules found in the context of an active previously documented disease that can be associated with pulmonary nodules (anthracosilicosis, histoplasmosis, tuberculosis, autoimmune or rheumatoid diseases …) Calcified nodule Anticoagulation therapy of any type that cannot be suspended for the duration of the investigation Respiratory failure, recent myocardial infarction (less than 3 months prior to the date of lung nodule screening), uncontrolled angina pectoris, congestive cardiac failure, cardiac arrhythmia, uncontrolled infectious disease or any other physical, biological or psychological factor which may prevent adherence to the study protocol or which may impair the patient's tolerance to the endoscopy and/or the general anaesthesia Presence of a implanted cardiac device (pacemaker, defibrillator, …) Pregnant women</criteria>
