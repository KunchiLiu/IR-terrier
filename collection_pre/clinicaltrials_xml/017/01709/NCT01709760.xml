	<brief_title>A Phase III Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of ENIA11 in Combination With Methotrexate Versus Methotrexate Alone in Patients With RA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objectives of the study are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ENIA11 in combination with methotrexate versus methotrexate alone in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ENIA11 in combination with methotrexate versus methotrexate alone in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Subject participation duration: A total of 28 weeks, including: 2 weeks of screening, 24 weeks of treatment and 2 weeks of follow-up</detailed_description>
