	<brief_summary>Nocturnal leg cramps (NLC) are painful, involuntary contractions of muscles occurring at rest, mostly at night. A Cochrane review on leg cramps in pregnancy showed some potential benefits in trials of magnesium. This is a single center, prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial that aims to investigate the effect of treatment with Magnox 520® (un-organic granular magnesium complex, composed of Magnesium Oxide &amp; Magnesium Oxide Monohydrate 865mg, Provides 520 mg of free elemental Mg++) on frequency and severity of NLC, quality of sleep and quality of life. Hypothesis: Magnox 520® may reduce the number and severity of NLC; an improvement in the quality of life and quality of sleep may ensue.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ads in the local media and pharmacies will invite individuals afflicted by NLC to participate in the study. Each participating individual will undergo two weeks of eligibility screening followed by 4-week double-blind treatment. The number, severity and duration of NLC will be measured daily as documented in a designated, structured sleep dairy. Quality of life and quality of sleep will be assessed by SF-36 and PSQI questionnaires, respectively, to be completed twice - at enrollment and within one week of the end of the treatment period.</detailed_description>
