	<brief_title>Strength Training Study for Survivors of Breast and Gynecologic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As a result of cancer and its treatment, survivors of breast and gynecologic cancer are reported to have deficits in both physical and psycho-social health. In cancer survivors exercise has been shown to improve fitness, increase bone density and lean body mass, enhance self-esteem, and reduce fatigue. These changes have a positive effect on the survivor's physical functioning and quality of life. However, there are few studies which have examined the effects of strength training or studies aimed at determining optimal exercise prescription in this population. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to compare two strength training prescriptions (once-a-week vs. twice-a-week strength training) to determine which prescription (if any) results in greater benefit for survivors. It is hoped that the results of this study will lead to a better understanding of how strength training improves the health of survivors and will help inform future exercise guidelines for this population.</detailed_description>
