	<brief_summary>Its main objective is to evaluate the clinical outcome (including patient reported outcomes) and health economic assessment (HTA) of a new re-usable system for Single Port Laparoscopic Surgery - ENDOCONE SYSTEM developed by Prof Cuschieri by undertaking a randomised controlled prospective clinical trial (RCT) on specific operations performed (on a random allocation basis) by either the traditional multi-port laparoscopic approach or the Single Port- ENDOCONE system by Karl Storz. To this effect, 300 patients meeting the trial inclusion criteria will be randomised over a three year period to have the operation by either of the two approaches.</brief_summary>
