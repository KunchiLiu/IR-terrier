	<brief_title>Short and Medium-term Effects of Manual Therapy on Latent Myofascial Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myofascial pain syndrome is a common non-articular musculoskeletal chronic pain which has not been yet fully understood. It is characterized by myofascial trigger point. This trigger point is clinically classified as active or latent. Some studies have demonstrated the potential relevance of latent trigger point. In fact, its presence may cause muscle activation pattern alterations, increase nociceptive sensitivity and cause sympathetic activity alterations. Nevertheless, the vast majority of individuals, even asymptomatic, have latent trigger point. High prevalence of myofascial trigger points subsists at cervical and scapular regions. There is few data regarding myofascial trigger point physiopathology. Furthermore, a diversity of therapeutic interventions consisting of trigger point inactivation and interruption of the vicious cycle is suggested in literature. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of these different interventions in trigger points and the duration of the effects are not yet fully clarified.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>volunteers with 18 or more years of age with a palpable latent trigger point in the fibbers of the upper trapezius muscle with an average time of computer work of at least 2h/day. with a body mass index (BMI) equal or higher than 31 kg/cm2 with bilateral latent triggers in the fibers of the upper trapezius muscle have done any pharmacological therapeutic during any of the 7 days before the study or anticoagulant therapeutics have done any treatment at cervical region during the month before the study having cardiorespiratory, neurological, neuromusculoskeletal, oncologic or systemic pathologies having cognitive deficits or psychologic/psychiatric disturbances be pregnant having a clinical history of cervical, high dorsal, shoulder or cranial surgery or trauma during the prior 12 months.</criteria>
