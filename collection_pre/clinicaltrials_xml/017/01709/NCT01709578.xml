	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To demonstrate that sarilumab added to disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is effective for: - reduction of signs and symptoms at Week 24 and - improvement of physical function at Week 12 in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who are inadequate responders or intolerant to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) antagonists. Secondary Objectives: The secondary objectives are to investigate the effects of SAR153191 (REGN88) when added to DMARD therapy, in patients with active RA who are inadequate responders or intolerant to TNF-α antagonists, for: - Reduction of signs and symptoms at 12 weeks. - Improvement in physical function at Week 24. - Improvement in disease activity score as measured by other American College of Rheumatology derived components at Weeks 12 and 24. - Improvement in quality of life as measured by patient reported outcomes (PROs) at intermediate visits and Week 24. To assess the safety of sarilumab in this population. To assess the exposure of sarilumab added to DMARD therapy in this population.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Total study duration is up to 34 weeks: Screening up to 28 days, Treatment phase of 24 weeks, and post-treatment follow-up of 6 weeks. After completion of the treatment phase of this study, patients are eligible to enter a long term safety study (LTS11210) for active treatment wit SAR153191 (REGN88).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis ≥6 months duration, according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) 2010 Rheumatoid Arthritis Classification Criteria. ACR Class IIII functional status, based on 1991 revised criteria. AntiTNF therapy failures, defined by the investigator as patients with an inadequate clinical response, after being treated for at least 3 consecutive months, and/or intolerance to at least 1 antiTNF blocker(s), resulting in or requiring their discontinuation: TNFblockers may include, but are not limited to, etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab and/or certolizumab. Moderatetoseverely active rheumatoid arthritis. Continuous treatment with one or a combination of DMARDs (except for simultaneous combination use of leflunomide and methotrexate) for at least 12 weeks prior to baseline and on a stable dose(s) for at least 6 weeks prior to screening: Methotrexate 6 to 25 mg/wk orally or parenterally Leflunomide 10 to 20 mg orally daily Sulfasalazine 1000 to 3000 mg orally daily Hydroxychloroquine 200 to 400 mg orally daily. Exclusion criteria: Patients &lt;18 years of age or legal adult age Past history of, or current, autoimmune or inflammatory systemic or localized joint disease(s) other than RA. History of juvenile idiopathic arthritis or arthritis onset prior to age 16. Severe active systemic RA, including but not limited to vasculitis, pulmonary fibrosis, and/or Felty's syndrome. Treatment with antiTNF agents, as follows: Within 28 days prior to the baseline visit etanercept Within 42 days prior to the baseline visit infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, certolizumab pegol Treatment with previous RAdirected biologic agents with other than TNF antagonist mechanisms: Within 28 days prior to the randomization (baseline) visit anakinra Within 42 days prior to the randomization (baseline) visit abatacept Within 6 months prior to the randomization (baseline) visit any cell depleting agents including but not limited to rituximab without a normal lymphocyte and CD 19+ lymphocyte count. Treatment with any DMARD other than those allowed per protocol and limited to the maximum specified dosage within 12 weeks prior to baseline. Treatment with prednisone &gt;10 mg or equivalent per day, or change in dosage within 4 weeks prior to baseline visit. Any parenteral or intraarticular glucocorticoid injection within 4 weeks prior to baseline. Prior treatment with antiIL6 or IL6R antagonist therapies, including tocilizumab or sarilumab, participation in a prior study of sarilumab, irrespective of treatment arm. Prior treatment with a Janus kinase inhibitor (such as tofacitinib). New treatment or doseadjustment to ongoing medication for dyslipidemia within 6 weeks prior to randomization, ie, stable dose for at least 6 weeks prior to randomization. Participation in any clinical research study evaluating another investigational drug or therapy within 5 halflives or 60 days of first investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration, whichever is longer. History of alcohol or drug abuse within 5 years prior to the screening visit. Patients with a history of malignancy other than adequatelytreated carcinoma insitu of the cervix, nonmetastatic squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma of the skin, within 5 years prior to the randomization (baseline) visit. Nonmalignant lymphoproliferative disorders are also excluded. Patients with active tuberculosis or latent tuberculosis infection.
