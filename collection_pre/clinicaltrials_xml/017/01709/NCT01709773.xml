	<brief_summary>This is a pilot cohort study of women undergoing focal ablation for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (HGCIN). The cohort was recruited from the UCSF Dysplasia Clinics. The standard treatment involves treatment of the entire cervix. Women with HGCIN meeting inclusion criteria were recruited for enrollment into the pilot study of focal treatment. Upon enrollment, they underwent focal ablational treatment rather than standard ablational treatment of the cervix. Follow-up visits were conducted at 2 weeks and 6 months to assess safety, feasibility, and acceptability. The 6-month recurrence rate of HGCIN will be calculated.</brief_summary>
