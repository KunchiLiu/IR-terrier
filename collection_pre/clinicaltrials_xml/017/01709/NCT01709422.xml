Propofol is increasing used for sedation in gastrointestinal procedure owing to its rapid recovery profiles but the complications associated with propofol are not negligible.The investigators prospectively compare the efficacy, induction time, recovery time, patient satisfaction and side effect between propofol based and conventional sedations in patients undergoing ERCP.</detailed_description>
