	<brief_summary>This study proposes to evaluate the effects of guanfacine extended release on brain activation during fMRI in children and adolescents with ADHD between the ages 8-15 and ADHD subjects randomized to placebo treatment. This study also proposes to collect DNA on study participants, to examine the genetic underpinning of the observed fMRI activation profiles at baseline and in response to treatment. The purpose is to examine polymorphisms of the adrenergic 2A gene (and other related targets) for genetic biomarkers in association with the fMRI findings of this study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neurobiological Basis of Response to Guanfacine Extended Release in Children and Adolescents With ADHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study proposes to evaluate the effects of guanfacine on brain activation during fMRI in 12 children and adolescents ages 8 - 15 with ADHD treated with once-daily INTUNIV(TM) (guanfacine; GXR) extended release tablets and 12 ADHD subjects randomized to placebo treatment. Children will be comprehensively assessed using a variety of clinical and neuropsychological measures. They will be scanned at baseline while performing both the go/no-go task (a well validated task for measuring inhibitory control (Durston et al., 2002, 2003)) and the Stay Alert task - a new task designed to measure the arousal component of attention, which was used successfully in a recent fMRI study of guanfacine in healthy adults (Clerkin et al., 2009). They will then be treated with GXR or placebo for 6 - 8 weeks in accordance with titration and dosing strategies used in recent Phase III dose optimization trials (e.g., up to 4 mg/day), and re-scanned while performing the same two tasks. The fMRI scans will be conducted using a dedicated research 3.0 T Siemens scanner.</detailed_description>
