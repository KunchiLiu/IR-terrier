	<brief_summary>Migraine imposes a substantial burden on patients in terms of diminished daily functioning, quality of life, and financial loss. Pain severity and duration correlates with reduced measures of daily functioning, and overall health status. The sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) has been implicated in a variety of cephalalgias. This has been well represented in the literature dating back over a century. Access to this structure can be gained via a small area of mucosa just posterior and superior to the tail of the middle turbinate on the lateral nasal wall. At this aspect, there is no bony boundary to the SPG. Blocking the SPG using local anesthetics relieves pain. Unfortunately, many current interventions are cumbersome, invasive, and expensive. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the Tx360™, a new nasal applicator device, in the treatment of head and face pain and to examine the economic implications. The Tx360™ is a single use device designed to deliver a topical local anesthetic to the specific area of mucosa associated with the SPG. A total of 42 study participants will be accepted into this double-blind placebo-controlled study. 28 will receive SPG blocks using a 0.3 mL of a 0.5% solution of Marcaine delivered by the Tx360™ while 14 will receive a placebo of saline substituted for the Marcaine. Both patient sets will also be given a piece of lemon hard candy as a taste distractor. Participants must have a chronic migraine history with over 15 symptomatic days per month over the past three months. The treatment plan consists of six weeks of treatment, two times per week. Short and longer term assessments will be retrieved and analyzed as detailed in the Study Design.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of the Tx360 Nasal Applicator in the Treatment of Chronic Migraine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>42 study participants will be included in this double-blind placebo-controlled study. Following enrollment of 42 subjects and completion of the 6-week Treatment Period by all active subjects, an analysis of the treatment effect will be performed for a reassessment of sample size and, if deemed appropriate, the study will continue with enrollment of additional subjects to ensure a more statistically robust interpretation of the data. The results of the statistical analysis will be blinded from Investigators and coordinators. The procedure will be delivered to all subjects who agree to participate, meet inclusion criteria, and sign informed consent. At Visit 1 following Informed Consent, a physical exam and vital signs will be completed. A medical, headache, and medication history (to include age, sex, height and weight, and duration and location of headache pain, as well as history of ER visits) will be collected on all subjects. Eligible subjects will be provided with a Baseline Headache Diary and instructed to treat migraines for the following month in their usual manner with their usual treatment. The daily Diary will document headache, acute treatment and response, and migraine associated symptoms (nausea, vomiting, light sensitivity, or sound sensitivity) to establish a Baseline number of headache days and severity. Visit 2 will be scheduled for 1 month following Visit 1. Following Visit 1, Visits 2-13 (treatment visits) will be scheduled to occur twice weekly (during the regular Monday - Friday work week) at least 2 days apart. Treatments should not occur on consecutive days. At Visit 2, the Baseline Headache Diary will be reviewed and those subjects continuing to meet eligibility will be dispensed a 6-week Treatment Period Diary and complete Before Procedure questions to include the Pain Intensity Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), the Modified Pain Characteristic Questionnaire, and a baseline Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6), have vital signs completed, and the medical, headache, and medication history updated. Subjects will be randomized 2:1 to Group A or Group B. Group A will receive treatment with 0.3 mL of 0.5% Marcaine delivered bilaterally with the Tx360™ device to the mucosa associated with the SPG. Group B will receive saline substituted for Marcaine delivered bilaterally with the Tx360TM device to the mucosa associated with the SPG. To maintain the blinding of the treatment groups, neither the Investigator nor research personnel who are involved in evaluating the subject should prepare the study medication. An independent research staff person with no involvement in the study conduct will place study medication (either Marcaine for a subject randomized to Group A or Placebo/saline for a subject randomized to Group B) in a 1cc Luer Lok tip syringe and assemble the syringe and Tx360TM catheter as instructed in training. A label with the subject Drug Number will be placed on the device at that time. The research staff person administering the study medication will verify that the Drug Number assignment is correct. Both Groups will be given a piece of lemon hard candy as a taste distractor. At each treatment visit (Visits 2-13), in addition to Before Procedure questions, subjects will complete 15-minute and 30-minute After Procedure questionnaires to include the NRS and, at 30 minutes, the Patient's Global Impression of Change (PGIC). Subjects will take home a questionnaire to include the NRS, PGIC, satisfaction question, and the Modified Pain Characteristic Questionnaire to be completed at 24 hours following treatment and be instructed to return the 24-hour After Procedure questionnaire to the clinic at the next visit. At Visits 2-15 vital signs will be completed, medications will be updated, and Non-Serious Adverse Events will be collected after the first treatment. Serious Adverse Events will be collected once the informed consent has been signed and throughout the study. At Visits 5, 8, and 11, the Treatment Period Headache Diary will be collected, reviewed, and re-dispensed. At Visit 13, the 1-Month Post-Treatment Period Diary will be dispensed. The subject will return to the clinic at Visit 14 between 24 and 96 hours following the final treatment at Visit 13 to return the 24-hour After Procedure Questionnaire and complete the 1-Month Treatment Period HIT-6. The Treatment Period Diary will be collected. At Visit 15, 1 month following the final treatment, each subject will return to the clinic and complete a 1-Month Follow Up HIT-6 and the 1-Month Follow Up Questionnaire. The 1-Month Post-Treatment Period Diary will be collected. At 6 months following the final treatment, each subject will be phoned to complete the 6-Month Follow Up Questionnaire to include the NRS, PGIC, satisfaction question, the Modified Pain Characteristic Questionnaire, and a 6-Month Follow Up HIT-6. Treatment Medication Subjects randomized to Group A will be administered 0.3 mL of 0.5% Marcaine delivered bilaterally with the Tx360™ device to the mucosa associated with the SPG. Twelve treatments will be administered over a period of 6 weeks. Subjects randomized to Group B will be administered saline substituted for Marcaine delivered bilaterally with the Tx360TM device to the mucosa associated with the SPG for treatment of chronic migraine. Twelve treatments will be administered over a period of 6 weeks. Rescue Medication Subjects will be allowed to rescue with medication mutually agreed upon by subject and Investigator at the time of screening.</detailed_description>
