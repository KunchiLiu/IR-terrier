	<brief_summary>This study will assess if corifollitropin alfa (MK-8962), when administered in combination with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), will increase testicular volume in men with HH who remain azoospermic after treatment with hCG alone. Hypothesis: The lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for the geometric mean increase in testicular volume from Day 1 to Week 52 is greater than one.</brief_summary>
