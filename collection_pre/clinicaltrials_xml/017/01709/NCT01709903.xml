	<brief_title>A 26-week Treatment Randomized, Double-blind, Double Dummy Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of QVA149</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To demonstrate the non-inferiority of QVA149 110/50 µg o.d. to fluticasone/salmeterol 500/50 µg b.i.d. in terms of trough Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) (mean of 23 hours 15 min and 23 hours 45 min post QVA149 dose) following 26 weeks of treatment in patients with moderate to severe COPD. The study population will consist of approximate 736 male and female adults (age 40 years and greater) with a clinical diagnosis of stable COPD [GOLD (2010)] and a smoking history of at least 10 pack years. It is anticipated that approximately 981 patients will need to be screened in order to randomize 736 patients into 2 treatment arms of the study with an equal randomization ratio, meaning QVA149 (368 patients), fluticasone/salmeterol (368 patients). Treatment randomization will be stratified by current/ex-smoker status and prior ICS use. It is intended that 552 patients will complete the study at Week 26 without major protocol deviations. Dropouts will not be replaced. This will be a multi-national study, including China, and at least two other countries. Standardization FEV1 AUC0-12h will be performed in a subgroup of around 100 patients (50 patients per treatment arm) in pre-selected centers.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients with moderate to severe stable COPD (Stage II or Stage III) according to Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Guideline. Current or exsmokers who have a smoking history of at least 10 pack years. Patients with a postbronchodilator Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) ≥ 30% and &lt; 80% of the predicted normal, and postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt; 0.7. Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) grade of at least 2 at Visit 2. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) laboratory test. Patents with narrowangle glaucoma, symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), bladderneck obstruction, moderate to severe renal impairment or urinary retention. BPH patients who are stable on treatment can be considered. Patients with a history of long QT syndrome or whose QTc measured at runin (Visit 2) (Fridericia method) is prolonged (&gt;450 ms for males and females) as confirmed by the central Electrocardiogram (ECG) assessor. Patients with Type I or uncontrolled Type II diabetes. Patients who have not achieved spirometry result at Visit 2 in accordance with American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) criteria for acceptability and repeatability. Patients with, a) any history of asthma or, b) onset of respiratory symptoms prior to age 40 years. Patients with concomitant pulmonary disease (e.g. lung fibrosis, primary bronchiectasis, sarcoidosis, interstitial lung disorder, pulmonary hypertension). Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
