	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, parallel-group, multi-national, multi-center study to compare alirocumab (REGN727/SAR236553) versus ezetimibe in participants with primary hypercholesterolemia and moderate, high, or very high CV risk, who are intolerant to statins. An atorvastatin arm is added to determine that the population selected in the study is a truly statin intolerant population by assessing skeletal muscle-related adverse events.</brief_summary>
