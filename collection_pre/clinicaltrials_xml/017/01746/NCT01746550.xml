	<criteria>Key Rutherford Category 24 (mild intermittent claudication (pain while walking)to ischemic pain (pain due to decreased blood flow) at rest). The target lesion(s) has evidence of narrowing or blockage and can be stented. The total length of the lesion or series of lesions is estimated to be less than or equal to 150 mm. The target vessel reference diameter is greater than or equal to 4.0 mm and less than or equal to 6.5 mm Key The subject has a known reaction (including allergic reaction) or sensitivity to blood thinning medications, or study device materials (nickel, titanium or tantalum) The subject has a known sensitivity to medical imaging substances (contract media) that cannot be pretreated with medications (steroids or/and antihistamines) The subject has a history of bleeding disorders (diatheses or coagulopathy). The subject has kidney failure or is having dialysis treatment. The subject has insufficient liver function, swelling of vein(s) caused by blood clot (thrombophlebitis), uremia, systemic lupus, or deep vein blood clots. Subject has Acute Limb Ischemia (a sudden loss of blood flow to the limb). Subject has a history of bypass surgery on the study vessel. Subject has a history of heart attack or stroke within 6 months of study procedure. The subject is receiving immunosuppressive therapy (medications that lower the body's normal immune response). The subject is diagnosed with a severe infection (septicemia). Principal investigator determines the subject's condition would prevent the subject from undergoing the study procedure or cannot support a vascular bypass graft. The subject with a stent previously implanted into the target vessel. Subject has disease in both legs where both limbs meet the inclusion criteria and it is planned to treat both limbs within 30 days. Pregnant, possibly pregnant and/or nursing female subjects are excluded, as are female subjects who are willing to have a baby during the trial. The subject is participating in an investigational drug or another investigational device study. Subject has a large amount of blood clot next to the study lesion.</criteria>
