	<brief_title>Remifentanil Versus Propofol for TCI Sedation of Patients Undergoing Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The administration of sedation with target controlled infusion (TCI) systems could offer a safe alternative for the management of discomfort of patients undergoing endoscopic gastrointestinal procedures. However, what medication from those available for TCI would be the most appropriate is not known. Sixty-nine patients requiring a gastrointestinal endoscopic procedure were randomly assigned to receive a TCI effect site (e) of remifentanil (n=30) or propofol (n=39). The primary outcome was patient satisfaction. Secondary outcomes included gastroenterologist satisfaction, the proportion of adverse events between the two groups were compared (occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias, mild respiratory depression, major respiratory depression, bradycardia, hypotension, pain, nausea or vomiting, and lack of amnesia), and the level of consciousness.</detailed_description>
