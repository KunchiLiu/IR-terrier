	<brief_title>LifeCourse: A Supportive Care Approach for Patients Late in Life</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>LifeCourse is a late life care approach that promotes whole person care through a structured approach built upon an expanded set of palliative care domains and chronic illness care practices. It includes a trained lay healthcare worker as the primary contact who follows the patient across care settings and over time. The care guide asks patients and caregivers to articulate individualized goals and take part in decision making, and uses a family-oriented approach to understand needs, leverage strengths, and empower families to effectively support the individual living with serious illness.</detailed_description>
