	<brief_summary>Atypical Facial Pain is a chronic condition and presents controversies during diagnostic and treatment, between specialist not have consensus about the pathophysiology. It is possible consider this entitie a potential neuropathic cause without pathological signs. It knows the repetitive transcranial magnetic presents good results in the treatment of chronic pain coditions. The aim this study is evaluated the thresholds and excitability cortical in patients with AFP and verify the patterns of improvement in pain for patients undergoing rTMS compared to controls, as well as the therapeutic response to neuromodulation procedures. This enroll 20 patients with DAF and 20 controls treated with rTMS (5 sessions) and evaluated through questionnaires (EDOF clinical record, McGill Pain Questionnaire, Visual Analogue Scale, Inventory of symptoms of neuropathic pain, neuropathic pain DN4 questionnaire, SF -36, brief pain inventory). At the end of the data will be statistically analyzed and expressed as mean and standard deviation, and analyzed by Student's t test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), Tukey-Kramer and Pearson correlation. The level of significance is 5%. The results will be published in journals indexed in the area both nationally and internationally and presented at conferences and scientific meetings.</brief_summary>
