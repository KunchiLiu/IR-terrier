	<brief_summary>To evaluate the efficacy of combination therapy with ranibizumab (RBZ) and panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) versus PRP alone in patients with treatment-naive bilateral proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) as measured by mean change in visual acuity (VA), mean change in central retinal thickness (CRT) as measured by time-domain optic coherence tomography (TD-OCT) and incidence of vitreous hemorrhage (VH).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravitreal Ranibizumab Combined With Panretinal Photocoagulation in Patients With Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Comparative efficacy of combined treatment including intravitreal injection of 0.5 mg of Lucentis (ranibizumab) and laser photocoagulation for patients with Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR). Objectives: Primary objective: The primary objective will be to evaluate the efficacy of combined treatment with ranibizumab and laser photocoagulation versus laser photocoagulation alone in patients with severe PDR by the mean change in BCVA at V7/M6 compared to baseline. The Best Visual Acuity (BCVA) measured by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (EDTRS). Secondary objectives: To evaluate differences in Optic Coherence Tomography (OCT) retinal thickness and total macular volume of combined treatment regiment including intravitreal injection of 0,5 mg of Lucentis (ranibizumab) and laser photocoagulation for patients with PDR at visit 7 compared to the baseline assessments. To evaluate the percentage of patients that present with vitreous hemorrhage after the beginning of the laser treatment at visit 7 compared to the baseline assessments. Strategic goal: The main goal of this study is to evaluate if the use of intravitreal ranibizumab in eyes submitted to Pan-Retinal Photocoagulation (PRP) due to PDR induces less macular edema and less vitreous hemorrhage and therefore leads to a better visual outcome</detailed_description>
