	<brief_summary>The study hypothesis is that managed referral of patients at community level (from drug stores) increases uptake of reproductive health (RH) services at dispensary and health centre levels. The intervention is currently being implemented in 2 districts (Magu and Sengerema) in Mwanza Region on the northwest shore of Lake Victoria. It is nested within the IntHEC Community Randomised Trial which aims to evaluate the impact of a complex RH intervention on the uptake and integration of reproductive health services in 2 Regions in Tanzania (Mwanza and Iringa) and Niger (Say and Aguie) respectively. 18 wards per region were stratified according to geographical and economic criteria and randomly assigned to intervention or comparison wards. The SMS intervention is being implemented in 9 intervention wards in Mwanza Region only. 9 wards are followed for comparison.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mobile Phone Text Messaging Referral</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The SMS intervention was developed in 2 phases: (i) stakeholder consultation and (ii) technical design. Twenty-three consultation meetings were held with 78 drug store owners and attendants, 45 dispensary and health centre clinical officers and nurses, and 148 adolescents in communities. These stakeholders prioritised key deficiencies in existing RH provision and preferred strategies to address them. Detailed methods and results of these consultations are presented elsewhere (Consultation Paper in preparation). In brief government health facilities wanted an intervention that allows dispensaries and health centres to take charge of STI treatment and provide skilled service for other RH needs. Drug stores wanted an intervention that recognises and integrates their contribution to the health system, while adolescents wanted an intervention that promotes accessibility, confidentiality and trust of service providers. Through subsequent meetings, an SMS intervention strategy was identified because all clinical officers and drug store attendants demonstrated use mobile phones on a day-to-day basis. The intervention design prioritised patients' ease of access to service: when a patient comes to a drug store to buy medicines for a RH related problem that may require a prescription drug, the drug store explains the referral system. If the patient accepts, the drug store sends a text message with the patient details to a toll-free number connected to a web-system. The system processes and forwards the patient details including a password to a dispensary matched with the referrer drug store. At the same time, that password is sent back to the referrer drug store so that it can be passed on to the patient. While at dispensary, patients with a password are received, matched with details received in text messages, and given fast track RH service, after which the dispensary sends a text message to the toll-free number confirming the completeness of patient treatment. This intervention is implemented in all 9 intervention wards in Mwanza. No intervention is implemented in the 9 comparison wards.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Only patients attending services at the drug store. Only patients seeking reproductive health care services. Only resident in study wards. Patients nonresidence in study wards. Patients seeking nonreproductive health care services. The primary and secondary outcomes will be measured in people aged 1519 (our definition of adolescent), but the intervention accepts all agegroups during implementation.</criteria>
