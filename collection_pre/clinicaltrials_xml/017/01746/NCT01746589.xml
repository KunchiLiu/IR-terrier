	<brief_summary>Evaluate visual outcomes and contrast sensitivity for subjects undergoing bilateral myopic LASIK procedure using the 200 kHz WaveLight® FS200 Femtosecond Laser and the WaveLight® Allegretto Wave® Eye-Q Laser. The use of advanced technology may decrease the loss of contrast sensitivity and improvement of postoperative visual acuity results.</brief_summary>

Patient must be willing to comply with study dosing and complete the entire course of the study. EXCLUSION CRITERIA A patient with evidence of keratoconus, corneal irregularity, or abnormal videokeratography in either eye A patient seeking monovision A patient with a known hypersensitivity to any of the components of the procedural or postLASIK medications A patient requiring the use of any ocular drop(s) and/or medication(s) in either eye during the study period with the exception of ocular drops and/or medications provided by the investigator A patient having any surgical procedure within a week preceding the scheduled LASIK surgery A patient with any UNCONTROLLED systemic disease (i.e., a potential patient in whom therapy for a systemic disease is not yet stabilized ) A patient with a history of prior intraocular or corneal surgery (including cataract extraction), active clinically significant ophthalmic disease or abnormality (including, but not limited to, blepharitis, recurrent corneal erosion, dry eye syndrome, neovascularization &gt; 1mm from limbus), clinically significant lens opacity, clinical evidence of trauma (including scarring) inside the visual axis, or evidence of glaucoma or propensity for narrow angle glaucoma in either eye A patient with a significant history or current evidence of a medical, psychological or other disorder that, in the investigator's opinion, may increase the risk associated with study participation or may interfere with the interpretation of study results A patient with a history of any of the following medical conditions, or any other condition that could affect wound healing: uncontrolled diabetes, collagen vascular disease, autoimmune disease, immunodeficiency diseases, ocular herpes zoster or simplex, endocrine disorders (including, but not limited to unstable thyroid disorders and diabetes), lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis Current participation or participation within 30 days prior to the start of this study in a drug or other investigational research study.</criteria>
