	<brief_summary>Effective evidence-based interventions exist for smoking cessation delivered over the Internet, but consumer acceptance and adherence remains low. Scalable and efficient mechanisms to disseminate these interventions online are needed, and existing online social networks provide a potential mechanism. This is a proposal for a randomized, factorial trial of the dissemination of an evidence-based intervention through the massive Facebook social network, with the goal of determining intervention characteristics that drive viral spread.</brief_summary>
