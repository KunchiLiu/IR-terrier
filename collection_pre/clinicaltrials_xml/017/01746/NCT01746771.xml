	<brief_title>A Phase I-II Study of HM781-36B Combined With Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab in HER-2 Positive Advanced Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Besides the main objectives, there are other objectives as follows: [Phase I] 1. To assess the pharmacokinetic profile of HM781-36B(Poziotinib) combined with Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab 2. To evaluate anticancer activity of HM781-36B(Poziotinib) combined with Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab in patients with HER-2 positive advanced gastric cancer 3. To evaluate PFS(Progression-Free Survival), TTP (Time To Tumor Progression), and DOR (Duration of Overall Response) [Phase II] 1. To assess the safety, tolerability of HM781-36B(Poziotinib) combined with Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab 2. To evaluate tumor response through determination of disease control rate , PFS(Progression-Free Survival), TTP (Time To Tumor Progression), and DOR (Duration of Overall Response)</detailed_description>
