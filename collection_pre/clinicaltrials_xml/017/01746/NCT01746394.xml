	<brief_summary>The Delta Healthy Sprouts Project is a randomized, controlled trial evaluating the enhancement of an existing Mother, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program in 150 African American women in their early second trimester of pregnancy. The control arm, Parents as Teachers, is an evidence-based approach to increase parental knowledge of child development and improve parenting practices. The experimental arm, Parents as Teachers Enhanced, builds on the Parents as Teachers curriculum by including nutrition and physical activity components specifically designed for the gestational and postnatal periods. Both arms of the intervention will be implemented by community-based, trained Parent Educators. The comparative effectiveness of the two intervention arms on weight status, dietary intake, and health behaviors of mothers and their infants will be assessed. The Delta Healthy Sprouts Project will determine if a novel, scalable, lifestyle intervention can improve the health of African American women and their children at high-risk for obesity and chronic disease.</brief_summary>
