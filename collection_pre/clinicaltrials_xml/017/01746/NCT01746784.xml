	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of N6022, and to obtain descriptive information on the effect of N6022 on biomarkers of CFTR function and inflammation in adult cystic fibrosis subjects who are homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Pharmacokinetic Study of N6022 in Subjects With Cystic Fibrosis Homozygous for the F508del-CFTR Mutation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, sequential dose-escalation study which will occur in two parts. All selection criteria, assessments and procedures described in this protocol will be applied to both parts. Up to 5 cohorts will be studied with a total of 67 patients at approximately 18 clinical sites in the United States.</detailed_description>
