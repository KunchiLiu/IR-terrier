	<brief_summary>The ALLIVE (ALLogeneic Iron inVEstigators) trial aims at quantifying the extent and dynamic change of LPI occurrence during conditioning and at identifying LPI-predictive peri-transplant parameters. Further points of interest are the improvement of systemic iron overload (SIO) diagnostics and the correlation of different SIO parameters with outcome after transplantation. The results of this trial will help to design prospective interventional studies addressing therapeutic options in patients at risk for SIO-associated toxicity during allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (allo-SCT).</brief_summary>
