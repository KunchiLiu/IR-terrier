	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Azacitidine and Sargramostim as Maintenance Treatment for Poor-Risk AML or MDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose a phase II study to determine the impact of maintenance therapy with 5-azacytidine and GM-CSF in patients with poor-risk AML or MDS, who are in remission after definitive treatment with either stem cell transplant or cytarabine-based consolidation chemotherapy. In order to precede relapse and to avoid lead time bias, treatment would need to commence within 185 days of definitive therapy. Furthermore, approximately 50% of relapses occur within the first year and up to 80% within two years after SCT, therefore we would limit the duration of maintenance therapy to one year, followed by two years of follow-up.</detailed_description>
