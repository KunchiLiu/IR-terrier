	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of MK-8237 (SCH 900237) in the treatment of House Dust Mite (HDM)-Induced Allergic Rhinitis/Rhinoconjunctivitis (AR/ARC) in children and adults. The primary hypothesis of this study is that administration of MK-8237, compared to placebo, results in significant reduction in the average total combined rhinitis score (TCRS).</brief_summary>
