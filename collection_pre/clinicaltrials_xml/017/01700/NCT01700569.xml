	<brief_summary>O6-méthylguanine méthyltransférase (MGMT) is the main repair gene after DNA lesion induced by Temozolomide in combination with radiation therapy of Glioblastoma (GBM) in Stupp.R et al published regimen. In preclinical models, it has been demonstrated that MGMT methylation (which is silencing the DNA repair process) is achievable by folic acid. About half of the patients with operated GBM have an un-methylated MGMT gene status and therefore a poorer prognosis. A phase-1 dose escalation study is proposed with pharmacologic doses of folinic acid in combination with temozolomide and radiotherapy of operated GBM.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase-1 Study of Folinic Acid to Modulate MGMT Gene in Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glioblastoma treated by Stupp regimen (Temozolomide + radiation therapy) have a different outcome depending on the methylation status of MGMT gene: when the gene is unmethylated, the repair process is active and the prognostic poor. In pre-clinical models, it has been demonstrated that Folic acid could re-methylate the MGMT gene and therefore the repair process to radiation and temozolomide could be limited, allowing a better prognosis. The proposed phase-1 study will explore the safety and efficacy of escalated doses of oral Folinic acid concomitantly with Stupp regimen. To determine the MTD is the main objective of the study, then the toxicty profile, the RDP2 and the methylation process efficacy at the MGMT gene level.</detailed_description>
