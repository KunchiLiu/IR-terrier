	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and effectiveness of oral vismodegib therapy in the treatment of different 'histologic subtypes' of basal cell skin cancer (BCC). The term 'histologic subtype' refers to how the cells and tumor tissue looks under the microscope. Three different 'histologic subtypes' of basal cell skin cancer (infiltrative/morpheaform, nodular and superficial) will be examined in this study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and effectiveness of oral vismodegib therapy in the treatment of different 'histologic subtypes' of basal cell skin cancer (BCC). The term 'histologic subtype' refers to how the cells and tumor tissue looks under the microscope. Three different 'histologic subtypes' of basal cell skin cancer (infiltrative/morpheaform, nodular and superficial) will be examined in this study. Each subtype has a characteristic look under the microscope, which is related to how the tumor will behave and grow. The histologic subtype can also help give your doctor information on how quickly your basal cell skin cancer will grow, if it will come back or if it will spread to other parts of your body. ERIVEDGE (oral vismodegib capsule) has been approved for use in the United States for treatment of metastatic BCC tumors (mBCC), tumors that have spread further into the skin, bones or other tissues, or spread to other parts of the body and locally advanced basal cell skin cancer (laBCC), cancers that have come back after surgery or that the healthcare provider thinks cannot be treated with surgery or radiation. It works by blocking the signal, called Hedgehog, which basal cell skin cancer cells need to grow. It has been given to about 800 people during clinical trials. Data from previous studies is mostly based on a subtype of BCC made up of little round collections of cancer cells, called "Nodular". There is almost no data on the use of vismodegib in other subtypes of BCC that that tend to extend deep into the skin ("Infiltrative" subtype), or spread widely near the surface of the skin ("Superficial" subtype). We know that the subtype of BCC 'can affect response to other types of treatment. A total of 36 subjects will be enrolled in the study. All study participants will receive oral vismodegib treatment. At the Week 12 visit, skin biopsies will be performed to give us more information on how your tumor is responding to vismodegib. If there is no evidence of tumor on the biopsy, you will be eligible to end treatment early and enter the Observation period. During this time you will be followed clinically every 3 months for up to 1 year. For all other subjects, if any evidence of tumor is seen on biopsy at week 12, you will continue treatment for the full 24 weeks. At week 24 visit, skin biopsies will be performed again to see if there is any tumor left. If there is no evidence of tumor on the biopsy, you will be eligible to end treatment early and enter the Observation period. If there is tumor left, you will be referred for surgery or other standard of care treatment to remove the tumor.</detailed_description>
