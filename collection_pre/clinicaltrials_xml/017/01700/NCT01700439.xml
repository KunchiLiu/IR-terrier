	<brief_title>Surgical Treatment of Aortic Stenosis With a Next Generation, Rapid Deployment Surgical Aortic Valve</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center trial. Up to 950 subjects will be enrolled at up to 35 centers in the US. After re-placement of their aortic heart valve with the EDWARDS INTUITY valve system, each patient will have routine follow-up tests at the following intervals: discharge, 3 months, 1 year, and annually the-reafter for a minimum of five years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Subjects will be required to meet all inclusion criteria: 1. Male or female, age 18 years or older 2. Has aortic stenosis or stenosisinsufficiency of an aortic valve requiring a planned replacement as indicated in the preoperative evaluation 3. Is scheduled to undergo planned aortic valve replacement with or without concomitant coronary bypass surgery 4. Provide written informed consent 5. Geographically stable and agrees to attend followup assessments until all subjects have completed 5 years of follow up Exclusion Criteria Subjects will not be eligible for trial participation if any of the following criteria are present: 1. Pure aortic insufficiency 2. Requires emergency surgery 3. Previous aortic valve replacement 4. Had prior mitral, tricuspid or pulmonic valve surgery, which included implant of a bioprosthetic valve, mechanical valve, or annuloplasty ring that will remain in situ 5. Requires multiple valve replacement/repair 6. Requires a surgical procedure outside of the cardiac area (e.g., vascular endarterectomy, vascular bypass, tumor removal) 7. Aneurysm of the aortic root and/or ascending aorta requiring surgical intervention 8. Active endocarditis/myocarditis or endocarditis/ myocarditis within 3 months prior to the scheduled AVR surgery 9. Myocardial infarction (MI) within thirty (30) days prior to valve replacement surgery 10. Renal insufficiency as determined by creatinine ≥ 2.5 mg/dL at screening or endstage renal disease requiring chronic dialysis 11. Hyperparathyroidism 12. MRI or CTscan confirmed cerebrovascular accident (CVA), or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 6 months (180 days) of the procedure 13. Presence of noncardiac disease limiting life expectancy to less than 12 months 14. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) 15. Left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 25% 16. Documented history of substance (drug or alcohol) abuse within the last 5 years 17. Echocardiographic evidence of an intracardiac mass, thrombus, or vegetation 18. Hemodynamic or respiratory instability requiring inotropic support, mechanical circulatory support, or mechanical ventilation within 30 days prior to the procedure 19. Pregnancy, lactation, or planning to become pregnant; 20. Currently incarcerated or unable to give voluntary informed consent 21. Leucopenia (WBC &lt; 3.5x 103/µL), or acute anemia (Hgb &lt; 10.0 gm/dL or 6 mmol/L), or thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt; 50x 103/µL), or history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy 22. History of myxomatous disease/connective tissue disorders (e.g., Marfan's Syndrome) 23. Current or recent participation (within 6 weeks prior to surgery) in an investigational drug or device trial _____ Intraoperative Exclusion Criteria 24. Anatomic variances which contraindicate implant of the trial valve, such as: 1. anomalous coronary arteries 2. annular deformation or extensive calcification of the annulus or aortic root which cannot be removed 3. significant calcium on the anterior mitral leaflet 4. pronounced septal calcification 5. position of coronary ostia relative to Model 8300ACD valve that would result in obstruction of blood flow 25. Available devices are not suitably sized for the subject's annulus</criteria>
