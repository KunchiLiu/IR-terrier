	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to test a new medical device for optimizing treatment of heart failure and compare its effect on outcome of patients with a recent hospitalization for worsening heart failure</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Integrated Telemonitoring and Nurse Support Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients after an episode of acute heart failure have an increased risk of rehospitalisation and impaired prognosis for survival. Neither a sole mobile nurse support nor a sole telemonitoring system has been able to provide consistent data on a beneficial influence on prognosis. Furthermore, the influence of frequent measurements of NT-pro-BNP in a home setting of heart failure patients has not been investigated so far. This study will test a new medical device (software) for optimizing treatment of heart failure patients and evaluate its impact on outcome of these patients.</detailed_description>
