	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is two-fold: 1. to test 3-dimensional reconstruction of leg-edema in patients hospitalized for acute heart failure with leg-edema. 2. to measure changes in QRS-morphology in a simulation of conventional blood-pressure measurement in patients hospitalized for acute heart failure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>3-dimensional Sensor Technology to Quantify Leg-edema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Leg-edema are common in patients with worsening heart failure. Apart from using a measuring tape there is no standardized tool to quantify leg-edema. Consequently, in patents with heart failure early detection of leg-edema is quite difficult. From earlier pacemaker-studies it has been shown that an increase of afterload changes ECG-signals. Currently it is unknown how simple diagnostic procedures such as measuring blood-pressure affect QRS-morphology in patients with heart failure.</detailed_description>
