	<criteria>Isolates derived from patients' clinical material will be included in the study Isolates collected retro and prospectively will be included in the study (from 01.01.2008 till 31.12.2012) Isolates, allocated of a clinical material of adult patients (&gt; 18 years), should make not less than 70 % from total number of included isolates) All included isolates should be unique: only one isolate can be included in the study of each biological type from each patient All isolates should correspond to cliniclaboratory criteria of the etiologic importance, i.e. should be derived from patients with infection symptoms from the corresponding clinical material Case report form (CRF) (Appendix 1) should be correctly completed for each isolate ESBLproducing representatives of Enterobacteriaceae (ESBLExtendedspectrum betalactamase) Isolates, arrived in the central laboratory contaminated or unviable</criteria>
