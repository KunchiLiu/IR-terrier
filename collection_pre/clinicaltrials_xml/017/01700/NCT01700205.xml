	<brief_summary>The overarching goal of the research we propose here is to conduct a randomized clinical trial to specify the physiologic and behavioral mechanisms by which infant-formula composition affects all aspects of energy balance and growth during the first years of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>"Watch Your Baby Grow" Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized clinical trial of infants whose parents decided to formula feed them; mother-infant dyads will be randomized when infant is 2 weeks of age to one of 2 groups. The groups will differ in the composition of the formula fed to the infant during the first year of life.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1. A healthy, term (≥37 and ≤42 week gestation at birth), singleton infant. 2. Birth weight between 2500 4500 grams. 3. At the time of enrollment, infant must be ≤14 days old (Date of birth=day 0). 4. Mother must be 18 years or older. 5. Infant must be consuming a standard cow's milk protein infant formula and have been receiving a standard cow's milk protein infant formula for at least the past 2 days prior to enrollment. Exclusion Criteria 1. Mother had gestational diabetes during pregnancy 2. Infant has condition requiring infant feedings other than feeding cow milk formula from a bottle. 3. Infant has major congenital malformations (i.e. cleft palate, hemangiomas, extremity malformation). 4. Infant has suspected or documented systemic or congenital infections (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus, cytomegalovirus). 5. Infant has evidence of significant cardiac, respiratory, endocrinologic, hematologic, gastrointestinal, or other systemic diseases. For example, infant must not be receiving insulin or growth hormone. 6. Dyad be the relative (son, daughter, niece, nephew, cousin, aunt, uncle, sibling) of ancillary personnel connected with the study.</criteria>
