	<brief_summary>Various issues had been pointed out when undergoing the anesthesia for elderly patients with sevoflurane, such as delayed emergence, post-operative trouble with swallowing. Desflurane, which has a lower blood/gas partition coefficient, is expected to contribute the better emergence, along with the recent progress on optimization of delivered amount of anesthesia. The purpose of this study is to compare the time to emergence in long elderly patient cases with desflurane or sevoflurane, with the recently developed drug-delivery optimization system "Aisys®" (GE Healthcare Japan).</brief_summary>
