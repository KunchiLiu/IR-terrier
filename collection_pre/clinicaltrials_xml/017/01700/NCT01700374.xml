	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine how difficult life-events that women experienced during their childhood might affect their babies. Women who are asked to participate in this study will fill out forms about their physical and mental health, have 3D ultrasounds of their baby's adrenal gland, have their stress responses measured and have their baby's development and stress responses assessed.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of maternal psychosocial stress and physiologic arousal on fetal adrenal gland volume across pregnancy. Maternal stress may have an adverse impact on the developing fetus by causing abnormal programming of the fetal Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis which could lead to medical and behavioral health problems later in life. Non-invasive measurements of fetal adrenal gland volume by 3-D ultrasound may allow us to understand if maternal stress can impact fetal adrenal gland size. In addition, the investigators can begin to discern whether fetal adrenal size has behavioral ramifications for the offspring through assessment of the infants HPA axis response to novelty. This study presents a non-invasive, novel approach to understanding the impact of maternal stress on fetal and infant developments.</detailed_description>
