	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritis is a common disease that causes muscle weakness, stiffness and instability. The disease reduces the opportunities for an active lifestyle. Exercise Therapy provides a well-documented effect on pain and function in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip. It is sought an optimal dose of exercise, in which this study will help to investigate. We hypothesize that an exercise program designed to have a high number of repetitions will benefit the outcome of the training in a more positive way than a low-repetition based program.</brief_summary>
