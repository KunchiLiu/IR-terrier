	<brief_summary>Contractures and broad scars of the axilla, anterior chest wall and neck have detrimental effects on functional, physical and psychological development of children. Perforator flaps have already been shown to be reliable options for the reconstruction of contractures but there have been no reports demonstrating the value of preexpanded perforator flaps of dorsolateral trunk region in treatment of extensive contractures and scars of pediatric patients. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate these techniques by a case series formed of pediatric patients with broad scars and contractures of anterior chest wall, axilla, neck and breasts. Seven pediatric patients (mean age, 11,6 years) who were treated by preexpanded perforator flaps are presented. By this means, clinical experience on intercostal artery perforator (ICAP) flap, thoracodorsal artery perforator (TDAP) flap, circumflex scapular artery perforator (CSAP) flap and lumbar artery perforator flap was shared. Flaps as large as 20,5x10,5 cm in size could be successfully transferred in pediatric patients. Broad scar tissues were resurfaced with broad flaps carrying similar characteristics with the uninjured anterior chest wall and neck skin in six of our patients. In one patient with partial necrosis, full thickness skin graft was used for the residual defect. The mean duration of postoperative (after flap transfer) follow-ups was 17,2 months. The preexpanded TDAP, ICAP and CSAP flaps are revealed to be useful reconstructive options for the treatment of scars and contractures of anterior chest wall, axilla, neck and breast in pediatric patients.</brief_summary>
