	<brief_summary>Early detection of lung cancer and early removal of the cancer nodules facilitates the diagnosis and treatment. However, not all nodules are malignant. Currently the standard method to diagnose lung cancer is to remove any suspicious nodules from the lung in a surgical procedure. This study is being conducted to evaluate the performance of a laboratory test to detect changes in lung cells that might be an early indicator of lung cancer. The test uses mucus (sputum) which is collected in a non-invasive method. This study will compare the results of the lung biopsy with the laboratory test to determine if the test can detect cancer or the lack of cancer. The laboratory test will not be shared with the treating physician or the patient as the current standard for lung cancer diagnosis is a biopsy. Approximately 330 patients will be enrolled in the study. There is one visit involved and includes the collection of a sputum specimen by coughing into a cup. The medical records of patients who are negative for cancer by biopsy will be reviewed for 2 years to detect any changes in diagnosis.</brief_summary>
