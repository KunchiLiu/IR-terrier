	<brief_summary>This study was done to determine if the use of a combination of preoperative rectal misoprostol 400µg used with intraoperative perivascular vasopressin is better than perivascular vasopressin used alone to decrease bleeding at myomectomy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Use of Misoprostol to Decrease Bleeding During a Myomectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A myomectomy is a fertility sparing procedure in which fibroids are removed from the uterus. This procedure can be associated with significant blood loss which can result in significant morbidity and mortality. The drug misoprostol which has been been use in the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage was given to subset of patients who were scheduled to undergo elective myomectomy at the University hospital of the West Indies and from the private practice of the participating doctors who were invited to participate in the study. Patients were randomized to receive or not to receive pre-operative rectal misoprostol 400µg, 60 minutes before surgery. Twenty five patients received misoprostol and twenty patients did not.</detailed_description>
