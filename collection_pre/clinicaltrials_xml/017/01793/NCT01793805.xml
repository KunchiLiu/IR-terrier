	<brief_summary>This is a study to collect and analyze tissue specimens from metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients for the development of a molecularly profiled tissue repository for the primary purpose of maintaining a patient registry for future clinical trials based on the molecular profile of the tumors. The main purpose of testing these tissue specimens is to identify genetic alterations or biomarkers associated with colorectal cancer such that if new agent(s) become available, particularly those that target these genetic alterations/biomarkers, participants may be offered the opportunity to take part in a National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) treatment protocol.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NSABP Patient Registry and Biospecimen Profiling Repository</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tissue blocks from the primary tumor site and an uninvolved margin of resection (normal tissue) from consenting patients will be submitted and stored at the NSABP Division of Pathology, in the NSABP Biospecimen Profiling Repository. Tissue specimens will be used to profile molecular characteristics, including actionable mutations most commonly identified in colorectal cancer. Specimens may be further interrogated by other methods to discover additional mechanisms and targetable genetic alterations that may predict sensitivity or resistance to drug therapies. The repository will be populated, maintained, and analyzed through continuous patient recruitment. Patient tumor specimens will be interrogated to characterize an individual's molecular profile. At a future date for discovery purposes, the normal tissue may be profiled for comparison with the profile of the tumor tissue. NSABP will hold a database with molecular profiles and relevant patient information. As agents become available for clinical study, particularly those matching specified profiles, the treating physician will be contacted so that the patient may be offered participation in that trial via a separate consent process. Each NSABP trial will have a defined molecular profile for entry which will be specific to the agent(s) under study. The MPR-1 patient registry and tissue repository and all treatment protocols associated with MPR-1 are being developed as part of the NSABP Oncology-Genome Assessment Guided Medicine (N-GAMe) Program. This registry and repository platform uses a translational science approach for more personalized therapy for patients with mCRC. This analysis provides an individual molecular profile in an attempt to direct each patient's treatment based on the pattern of genetic alterations. These efforts also may aid in the discovery of with or without new gene targets for future drug development. Approximately 1000-2000 tumor (with or without) normal tissue specimens from living mCRC patients will be collected, stored, and analyzed as part of this biospecimen repository. It is anticipated that 200-400 participants will be registered within the first year.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Colorectal Neoplasms</mesh_term>
	<criteria>The patient must have a diagnosis of metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma. Representative formalinfixed paraffinembedded (FFPE) tissue blocks from the primary colorectal tumor surgery with corresponding pathology report must be available for release by the local pathology department (an adequate amount of tumor tissue is required for analysis). If available for release, a separate FFPE tissue block from an uninvolved margin of colorectal resection (normal tissue) is also requested. The patient must have a lifeexpectancy of greater than or equal to 6 months. History of nonCRC malignancy unless the patient is considered by the physician to be diseasefree and at low risk for recurrence. Known comorbid medical conditions that would preclude investigational treatment (e.g., active hepatitis B or C; symptomatic cardiac disease; renal insufficiency; bone marrow impairment). Psychiatric or addictive disorders or other conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude investigational treatment. Colonoscopy biopsies or diagnostic core biopsy procedures without surgery or resection.</criteria>
