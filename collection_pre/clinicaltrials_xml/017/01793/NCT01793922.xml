	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to compare the efficacy of per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) to the efficacy of pneumodilation as the initial treatment of symptomatic idiopathic achalasia. It is hypothesized that POEM has a higher long-term efficacy than pneumodilation in treatment of therapy-naive patients with idiopathic achalasia.</brief_summary>
