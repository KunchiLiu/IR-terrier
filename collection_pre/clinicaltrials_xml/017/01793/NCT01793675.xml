	<brief_summary>Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the only curative treatment for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), especially for advanced MDS (blast &gt;5%). However, many patients cannot find an HLA-matched donor. haploidentical donor is an alternative stem cell source. the study hypothesis: Haploidentical/mismatched hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can improve the survival of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome</brief_summary>
