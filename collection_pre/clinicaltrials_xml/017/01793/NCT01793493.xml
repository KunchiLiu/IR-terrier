	<brief_summary>The Allena-Mente study is a randomized, controlled, single-blind trial assessing the efficacy of cognitive stimulation (CS) compared to an active control group, participating to sanitary education lessons (AC). This non-pharmacological intervention is delivered to Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and cognitively healthy individuals with first-degree relative with dementia (NDFAM).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The experimental protocol was set up with a pilot study on healthy elderly individuals. Data from this pilot study will be excluded from the statistical analysis. Sample size: a priori power analysis was performed to evaluate the sample size required for the study. MCI and NDFAM were considered separately for sample size calculation. For power calculation a two-tailed test was used and a significance level (α) and test power (1-β) were set at 0.05 and 0.8/0.9, respectively. Randomization: The individuals belonging to MCI and NDFAM subgroup were randomly assigned to CS or AC group. The randomization was performed by a statistician blind to participants characteristics using the Random Allocation Software. Allocation ratio was set at 1:1, stratification was performed for birth cohort (≤1937 and ≥1938), education level (years of education ≤5 years and &gt;5 years). Participants provided written informed consent before study participation.</detailed_description>
