	<brief_summary>This is a multicentric, randomized, open-label, phase IIIb national study, to evaluate the clinical effects (success/failure) of methadone for the treatment of cancer-related-pain in patients with inadequate pain relief or intolerable side effects when treated with level 3 opioid. Principal objective is to compare the clinical effects (success/failure) of two methods of methadone titration in patients with cancer-related pain inadequately relieved or with intolerable side effects after treatment with level 3 opioid. Secondary objectives are : Overall safety of methadone during the study, to describe the patients' characteristics, to describe the effects of methadone on pain relief, to describe the methadone administration, to evaluate patient's quality of life, to evaluate the prescriber's opinion regarding the handling of methadone initiation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety of Two Methadone Titration Methods for the Treatment of Cancer-related Pain With Inadequate Pain Relief or Intolerable Side Effects When Treated With Level 3 Opioids.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The randomisation (1:1) will consider the two titration methadone switching methods: - Group A: patient-controlled dose of methadone with no overlapping with the previous opioid treatment - Group B: fixed-dose of methadone with overlapping with the previous opioid treatment Study Description: Screening visit (Visit 1) within 48 hours before the inclusion Inclusion visit (Visit2) and randomisation on Day 1 Visit 3 from Day 2 to Day 7 (hospitalisation for all patients). Four follow-up visits on Day 14 (Visit 4), Day 21(Visit 5), Day 28 (Visit 6), Day 42 (Visit 7) End of study visit on Day 56 Follow-up phone contact on Day 84.</detailed_description>
