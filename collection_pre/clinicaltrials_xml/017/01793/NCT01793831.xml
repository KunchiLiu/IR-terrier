	<brief_summary>The gut microbiota is considered to constitute a "microbial organ" which has pivotal roles in the intestinal diseases and body's metabolism. Evidence from animal and human studies strongly supports the link between intestinal bacteria and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Dozens of studies reported its efficacy in treatment of severe Clostridium difficile colitis. Preliminary studies using FMT for Ulcerative Colitis (UC), Crohn's diseases (CD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and constipation have also met with some success. However, the results on CD is very limited. This is an initial step into investigating the potential efficacy of fecal bacteriotherapy for CD, the investigators propose to determine the efficiency, durability and safety of FMT in a series of 30 patients with CD (included cased according Montreal classification: Age &gt; 14 years old, Location L1-3, Behavior B1-3 but without perianal diseases).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Standardized Fecal Microbiota Transplantation for Crohn&amp;Apos;s Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present clinical trial aims to re-establish a gut functionality state of intestinal flora through FMT as a therapy for CD. We established a standard bacteria isolation from donated fresh stool in lab. Then the bacteria is transplanted to mid-gut (at least below the duodenal papilla) through regular gastroscope. Patients from multi-clinical centers in this study will be assigned to receive FMT only once or traditional treatments according to associated guidelines and follow-up for at least one year. Blood tests, abdominal X-ray, endoscopy and questionnaire will be used to assess participants at study start and at study completion.</detailed_description>
