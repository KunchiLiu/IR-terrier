	<brief_title>Pilot Study on the Effectiveness of a TAP-block for Inguinal Hernia Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hernia inguinal repair is the most common operation performed by general surgeons in the Netherlands. On of the most common complications after hernia repair is postoperative and chronic pain. Postoperative pain is an expected but undesirable effect after an operation, which can result in an prolonged hospital stay or longer time to return to full normal daily activities. There are indications that an insufficient treatment of postoperative pain is a risk factor for persistent or chronic pain after open inguinal hernia repair. Chronic pain is not uncommon after hernia repair, with an incidence of 11%. The objective of this study is to determine, whether the use of an perioperative echo guided unilateral TAP block has an superior effect on postoperative pain after open hernia inguinal repair compared to wound infiltration with a long acting local anesthetic. There will be no further analysis in this study regarding the incidence of open hernia inguinal repair and chronic pain.</detailed_description>
