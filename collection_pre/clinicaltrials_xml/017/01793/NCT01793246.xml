	<brief_summary>Patients will be enrolled that are undergoing bronchoscopy for diagnosis of discrete lung lesions or for detection of acute rejection following lung transplants. The hypothesis is that bronchoscopy together with probe-based endomicroscopy (pCLE)results in improved and/or incremental diagnostic yield (definitive diagnosis) over conventional bronchoscopy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Registry Trial to Determine pCLE Image Interpretation Criteria and Preliminary Accuracy in the Lung</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim of this study is to develop the criteria to differentiate healthy versus diseased tissue in patient with discrete lung lesions or to characterize acute lung rejection in patients with transplanted lungs. Once these criteria have been defined, the diagnostic parameters and the reproducibility of pCLE will be assessed.</detailed_description>
