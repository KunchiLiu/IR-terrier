	<brief_summary>This will be the first study to assess the clinical feasibility of dose escalation with simultaneous integrated boost intensity-modulated radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced cervical cancer. Following screening to confirm eligibility patients will commence a six week treatment period. After this, patients will be followed up by visits to clinic every 3 months for a period of 24 months (2 years). End of study is defined as 24 months after treatment. Patients will be followed up for a minimum of 5 years (as per local policy) after treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1. Primary objective - To determine the feasibility of dose escalation with simultaneous boost intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in locally advanced cervical cancer 2. Secondary Objectives - To assess objective response rates - To assess local control - To correlate toxicity with dose-volume histogram data 3. Primary endpoint - Grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity at 6 months as defined by CTCAE v3.0 (Common Terminology for Adverse Events) 4. Secondary endpoints - Response rate assessed radiologically at 3 months and 12 months - Local control at 2 years - Late toxicity at 2 years as defined by CTCAE v3.0</detailed_description>
