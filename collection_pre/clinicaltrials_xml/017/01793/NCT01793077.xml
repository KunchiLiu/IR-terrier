	<brief_summary>Tremodi is an observational, non-interventional, prospective, open-label, non-comparative study that will collect real life data of a treatment with Depo-Eligard® in 3 different administrations in male prostate cancer patients. Once the examining physician has decided on the therapeutic approach and if the selection criteria are fulfilled, he will propose the patient to participate in the study. An informed consent form will be collected for all participants in the study. There are 2 possible study visits that coincide with a routine consultation, namely visit 1 (inclusion visit) and visit 2 (end of study visit). On both visits, Adverse Drug Reactions (adverse event caused by Depo-Eligard®) are collected and the patient will be asked to complete a Quality Of Life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). At visit 2, the examining physician will give a global evaluation of the treatment with Depo-Eligard® and assesses the treatment benefit of the patient. Testosterone and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) blood values are collected during both visits, if available.</brief_summary>
