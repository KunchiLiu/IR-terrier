	<brief_summary>This study should evaluate whether newborns during cesarean section are endangered to get hypothermic while bonding on the mothers chest. Therefore, the investigators want to investigate the effects of active cutaneous warming of the mothers and babies during intraoperative bonding. The investigators plan to enroll 40 parturients scheduled for elective caesarean section to receive passive insulation or forced-air skin surface warming. The investigators will measure core temperature of the newborns and their mothers. The investigators hypothesize that newborns became most often hypothermic without active warming during the bonding procedure and that active warming will be able to decrease the number of hypothermic newborns significantly.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Incidence and Prevention of Hypothermia in Newborns Bonding During Caesarean Section</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Little is known about the thermoregulatory effects on babies when bonding on the chest of the mother during caesarian section. The aim of our study is to evaluate whether newborns during cesarean section are endangered to get hypothermic while bonding on the mothers chest. The investigators want to investigate the effects of active cutaneous warming of the mothers and babies during a 20 min intraoperative bonding period. The investigators plan to enroll 40 parturients scheduled for elective caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia to receive passive insulation or forced-air skin surface warming. The investigators will measure core temperature of the newborns and their mothers. The investigators hypothesize that newborns became most often hypothermic without active warming during the bonding procedure and that active warming will be able to decrease the number of hypothermic newborns significantly.</detailed_description>
