	<brief_summary>The goal of the study is to determine the effect of different doses of caffeine on intraocular pressure. We hypothesized that higher dosage of caffeine would increase intraocular pressure more than lower doses. Eligible subjects will be randomized into three groups: 1. group 1: intake of decaffeinated coffee 2. group 2: intake of coffee with lower caffeine dose 3. group 3: intake of coffee with higher caffeine dose Intraocular pressure will be measured at 0, 30, 60 and 90 minutes after coffee intake.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>decaffeinated coffee contains 0.5-2 mg of caffeine regular dose coffee contains 91.8 mg of caffeine high dose coffee contains 144 mg of caffeine all three groups' intraocular pressure will be measured with the Goldmann applanation tonometer at 4 timepoints: 1. 0 minutes (baseline) 2. 30 minutes after intake 3. 60 minutes after intake 4. 90 minutes after intake</detailed_description>
