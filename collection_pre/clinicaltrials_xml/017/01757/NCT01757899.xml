	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of prolonged low-dose methylprednisolone infusion on pulmonary function (LIS and ventilation-free days), extra pulmonary organ function (PMODS score), inflammatory markers - RCP (Reactive C Protein), IL6 (Interleukine 6), TNFα (Tumor Necrosis Factor), IL8 (Interleukine 8), IL10 (Interleukine 10) and length of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) stay in early ALI/ARDS in children.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects and Safety of Infusion of Low-Doses of Methylprednisolone in Early ALI and ARDS in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Scientific background. Dysregulated systemic inflammation - characterized by protracted elevation of inflammatory cytokines in the circulation - is a key pathogenetic mechanism for morbidity and mortality in ALI/ARDS, and is associated with tissue insensitivity and/or resistance to inappropriately elevated endogenous glucocorticoids. In one study, prolonged methylprednisolone treatment of ARDS patients resulted in rapid and sustained reduction in circulating and pulmonary levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and procollagen. Preliminary work. Two recent metanalysis evaluating the use of low doses of corticosteroids in acute lung injury/ARDS in adults reported a significant physiological improvement, a sizable reduction in duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay and reduction in mortality. Hypothesis. We hypothesized that prolonged administration of low doses of methylprednisolone in pediatric ALI/ARDS is safe and downregulates systemic inflammation and leads to earlier resolution of pulmonary and extra pulmonary organ dysfunction and a reduction in duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. Objective. To investigate the effects of prolonged low-dose methylprednisolone infusion on pulmonary function (LIS and ventilation-free days), extra pulmonary organ function (PMODS score), inflammatory markers - RCP (Reactive C Protein), IL6 (Interleukine 6), TNFα (Tumor Necrosis Factor), IL8 (Interleukine 8), IL10 (Interleukine 10) and length of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) stay in early ALI/ARDS in children. Study design. Prospective randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of ALI/ARDS within the first 72 hours based on all of the following criteria: Respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation via endotracheal intubation or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation; Acute onset of bilateral pulmonary densities on chest radiograph in the context of appropriate predisposing injury or illness with no evidence of left ventricular failure; Ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2:FiO2 ) ≤ 300 (criteria for ALI) or 200 (criteria for ARDS) with FiO2 ≥ 0,5 and PEEP = 5 cmH2O. To sign the Informed Consent to participate. ALI/ARDS with more than 72 hours of diagnosis Failure to obtain written informed consent to participate in the study; Condition requiring &gt; 0.5mg/Kg/day of prednisone equivalent (i.e., acute asthma or bronchopulmonary dysplasia) Patients enrolled in another experimental (interventional) protocol within the past 30 days, which might adversely impact on the results of this study as determined by the investigators; Primary or secondary neuromuscular dysfunction Patients using aminoglycosides combined with neuromuscular blockers Cardiopulmonary arrest within 7 days or anytime during present hospitalization prior to enrollment; Irreversible cessation of all brain function; Immunosuppression, including HIV+ status, history of bone marrow or solid organ transplantation, current malignancy, neutropenia, receiving cytotoxic therapy for any reason, and acute burn injury; Severe chronic liver disease (ChildPugh Class C score &gt; 10 points).</criteria>
