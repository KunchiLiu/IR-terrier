	<criteria>Provision of informed consent prior to any study specific procedures. Female or male aged =18 years and =70 years. Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (haematemesis, melaena or haematochezia) or such signs within the last 24 hours as judged by the investigator. One endoscopically confirmed bleeding gastric or duodenal peptic ulcer, at least 5 mm in diameter, classified as Forrest Ia, Ib, IIa, or IIb. Photo documentation of the source of bleeding should be provided. Successful haemostasis (which is considered to have been established if bleeding has stopped and, if applicable, formerly bleeding vessels are flattened or cavitated) achieved by endoscopic treatment and confirmed by site staff. Endoscopic suspicion of gastric malignancy or juxta pyloric stenosis as judged by the investigator. Sign of multi PUB or concomitant other gastro bleeding from esophageal varices, reflux esophagitis, gastritis, Mallory Weiss rifts, ulcus simplex, Dieulafoy's lesion, colon, small bowel, or ulcer distal to the stom in Billrothresected patients. Need for treatment during the first 7 days of the study with NSAIDs, Cyclooxygenase2 (COX2) inhibitors, acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) (including low dose) or clopidogrel. Planned treatment with: warfarin (including other vitamin K antagonists), cisapride, phenytoin, atazanavir, nelfinavir, digoxin, methotrexate, clopidogrel, tacrolimus, theophylline, lidocaine, nifedipine. Chemotherapy or radiation therapies within 2 weeks prior to randomisation or planned during the course of the study.</criteria>
