	<brief_summary>In this three-armed dose-finding trial 3 AK 3012 topical formulations shall be investigated with respect to safety and efficacy in order to identify the optimal concentration in the topical formulation. The main objective of the trial is to determine the optimal concentration of the active agent in the topical formulation as quantified by the change of the number of skin alterations in pre-defined areas in a time period from inclusion in the trial until the end of treatment (3 months) or prior complete healing.</brief_summary>
