	<brief_title>Evaluation of Oxygen Consumption and Energy Expenditure During Spontaneous Breathing Trial.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients is going to submit to the 2 spontaneous breathing trial ( Automatic tube compensation plus continuous positive airway pressure and continuous positive airway pressure without automatic tube compensation. The oxygen consumption and energy expenditure is going to measure during the spontaneous breathing trial by indirect calorimetry.</detailed_description>
