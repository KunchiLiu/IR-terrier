	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the Puff City web-based behavioral intervention of asthma management program in a clinical setting. This study also examines and evaluates the cost and efficiency of patient eligibility determination methods, patient recruitment, study monitoring (compliance with study regimen, participant retention and follow-up), and the collection of clinical endpoints.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Web-Based and Tailored Asthma Management Intervention (Puff City) in Teens With Asthma Attending Urban Clinics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma continues to be a major public health problem in the US with high economic and social costs. Vulnerable ethnic communities are disproportionately affected by asthma as demonstrated by higher morbidity and mortality for these groups. We have completed two school-based, randomized trials of a web-based, computer-tailored asthma management intervention that targets urban teens (Puff City). The current study, Puff City in the Clinic, will be evaluated as a clinical tool by initiating the web-based behavioral intervention of asthma management in a clinical setting. However, the current paradigm for conducting such a trial is costly with respect to patient recruitment, intervention delivery, and data collection and management. To address these high costs, the study utilizes comparative effectiveness research (CER) pragmatic approaches to design a randomized controlled trial for patient recruitment and determination of eligibility, study monitoring (compliance with study regimen, participant retention and follow-up), and collection of clinical endpoints.</detailed_description>
