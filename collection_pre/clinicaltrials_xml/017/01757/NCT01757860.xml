	<brief_summary>Study Phase: Phase 1 Primary Objective: • To evaluate the safety and tolerability of single ascending oral doses of CARD-024 in healthy subjects Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of CARD-024 following ascending single oral doses of CARD-024 - To evaluate the effect of CARD-024 on cardiovascular indices including plasma renin activity (PRA) and blood pressure (BP), biological markers of activity, following ascending single oral doses of CARD-024</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Pharmacokinetics Study of CARD-024 in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design: This is a single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of single oral doses of CARD-024. Four planned cohorts of 8 subjects each will be dosed sequentially and randomized to receive a single dose of active drug (6 subjects) or placebo (2 subjects). Cohort 4 will have 10 subjects randomized to receive active drug (7 subjects) or placebo (3 subjects). Each cohort will be divided into at least 2 groups; the first group will have 2 subjects, 1 receiving active drug and 1 receiving placebo. Dosing of the remaining 6 subjects in each cohort will be completed in a manner agreed upon by the Sponsor and the Principal Investigator in keeping with the randomization schedule and blinded conditions. The planned cohorts are: Cohort CARD-024 Dose* 1. 3 μg 2. 9 μg 3. 27 μg 4. 81 μg</detailed_description>

Willing and able to stay in the clinic for the inpatient activities required by the protocol for all visits. 1. Evidence of clinically relevant pathology that could interfere with the study results or put the subject's safety at risk. 2. Current or recurrent disease that may affect the action, absorption, or disposition of the study treatment, or clinical or laboratory assessments. 3. Current or relevant previous history of serious, severe, or unstable (acute or progressive) physical or psychiatric illness, any medical disorder requiring treatment or that may make the subject unlikely to fully complete the study, or any condition that presents undue risk from the study treatment or procedures. 4. History of febrile illness within the 5 days prior to the first dose. 5. Positive Hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg), Hepatitis C antibody or Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) test result at Screening visit. 6. Use of any prescription medication or overthecounter (OTC) medication within 7 days or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of trial medication or during the study. As an exception, acetaminophen may be used at doses up to 1 g/day. 7. Use of any herbal supplements (including herbal weightloss or "metabolism booster" therapies) within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial medication. 8. Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to similar study drugs or excipients, closely related compounds or any of their stated ingredients. 9. Positive screen for alcohol or drugs of abuse during Screening visit or at study checkin for Day 1 dosing. 10. Participated in a clinical study involving an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to study drug administration. 11. Blood donation of 1 pint or more within 56 days of the start of the study. 12. Plasmapheresis or plasma donation within 30 days of the start of the study. 13. Single 12lead ECG demonstrating QTc &gt;450 msec at Screening, and or history or evidence of long QT syndrome. A single repeat ECG may be done at the Principal Investigator's discretion. 14. Any condition that in the opinion of the Principal Investigator would complicate or compromise the study or the wellbeing of the subject. 15.
