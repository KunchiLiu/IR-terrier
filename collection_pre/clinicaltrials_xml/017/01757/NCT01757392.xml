	<brief_title>Candin Safety &amp; Efficacy Study for the Treatment of Warts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety of Candin® (Candida albicans Skin Test Antigen) at either 0.3 mL dose levels at up to 6 monthly injections (a maximal, cumulative dose of 1.9 mL, including the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) test) for treating common warts (Verruca vulgaris). A secondary objective is to understand the relative effectiveness of the 0.3 dose level for treating common warts, both those that were injected and those that were not injected as well as other types of warts that were not injected to allow a determination of appropriate dose levels to use in a future dose-ranging efficacy trial.</detailed_description>
