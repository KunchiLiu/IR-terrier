	<brief_summary>Intracoronary abciximab administration during primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) could offer clinical advantages over the intravenous route. The aim of this study was to assess whether abciximab administration route could influence its anti-inflammatory effects. 87 consecutive STEMI patients candidate to pPCI were randomized to receive an intracoronary or intravenous abciximab bolus. The primary endpoint was the extent of inflammation, measured by C-reactive protein (CRP), VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 levels.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anti-inflammatory Effects of Intracoronary and Intravenous Abciximab Administration During Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND: intracoronary abciximab administration during primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) could offer clinical advantages over the intravenous route. Besides antiplatelet effects, abciximab can modulate inflammation via cross-reactivity with GPIIb/IIIa, avb3, and aMb2 receptors. The aim of this study was to assess whether abciximab administration route could influence its anti-inflammatory effects. METHODS: 87 consecutive STEMI patients candidate to pPCI were randomized to receive intracoronary (Group A, 47 patients) or intravenous (Group B, 42 patients) abciximab bolus. The primary endpoint was the extent of inflammation, measured by C-reactive protein (CRP), VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 levels.</detailed_description>
