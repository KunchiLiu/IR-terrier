	<brief_summary>The proposed Phase I/II clinical trial will be used to determine the safety and toxicity of direct administration of the vector AdVEGF-All6A+ to the ischemic myocardium and to generate preliminary evidence regarding whether direct administration of AdVEGF-All6A+ to the ischemic myocardium will induce growth of collateral blood vessels and improve cardiac function. This is a three-part, multinational/multi-center, placebo controlled study.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Males and females, age 18 to 90 Demonstrable reversible left ventricular ischemia in viable myocardium as assessed by ST segment/T wave abnormalities detected by exercise testing with 99mTcsestamibi singlephoton emission computed tomography (SPECT) prior to and following the exercise test Individuals who have coronary artery disease (CAD) but have angina refractory to medical therapy Individuals who experience angina class IIIV as defined by the Canadian Cardiovascular Society Individuals who have had a coronary angiogram in the prior 6 months demonstrating diffuse coronary artery disease and are not considered to be eligible for coronary artery bypass surgery, stents, or angioplasty, because of the lack of suitable target lesions Individuals must be medically capable of undergoing open thoracotomy Individuals must have neutralizing antiadenovirus serotype 5 titer ≤160; this criteria is based on the knowledge that some individuals have high anti Ad5 neutralizing antibody titer which may limit efficacy Hematocrit &gt;30% WBC &lt;10,000 Normal prothrombin, partial thromboplastin time (excluding IV heparin therapy) Normal liverrelated serum parameters Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &gt; 30 ml/min No evidence of active infection of any types, including adenovirus, hepatitis virus (A, B or C) or human immunodeficiency virus No evidence of central nervous system, major psychiatric, musculoskeletal or immune disorder No allergy to the vehicle used to suspend the virus or contrast materials used in radiographic procedures Fertile or infertile individuals; it will be recommended that fertile individuals utilize barrier birth control measures to prevent pregnancy during and for 2 months following the administration of the vector Individuals not receiving experimental medications or participating in another experimental protocol for at least 4 weeks prior to entry to the study. Individuals must be able to exercise for at least 90 seconds but no more than 15 min on a modified Bruce protocol exercise treadmill test while exhibiting angina with concurrent 1 mm horizontal or downsloping STsegment depression The study individual must be able to undergo the procedures in the protocol Willingness to participate in the study Capable of providing informed consent Individuals who do not meet the inclusion criteria will be unable to participate in the protocol Individuals in whom participation in the study would compromise the normal care and expected progression of their disease Individuals receiving corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications Individuals with uncontrolled diabetes Diabetic individuals with significantly abnormal ophthalmologic exam (moderate or greater disease severity) Individuals with hypercholesterolemia (LDL above 190 mg/dl or total cholesterol above 240 mg/dl) Body mass index &gt;35 Recent (&lt;6 wk) cerebral vascular accident Recent (&lt;6 wk) transmural myocardial infarction Evidence of infection defined by elevated white blood cell count, temperature &gt;38.5ºC, infiltrate on chest xray Unable to undergo cardiac MRI with gadolinium contrast Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values 2.5 greater than normal limits Prior cardiac transplantation Electrocardiograph abnormalities that would interfere with STsegment analysis Untreated malignant ventricular arrhythmia Valvular heart disease requiring surgical intervention Preoperative congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Function Class III or IV or ejection fraction (EF) &lt;25% Uncontrollable asthma or COPD Greater than first degree heart block or sinus node dysfunction without a functional pacemaker Systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg Known hypersensitivity to adenosine Pregnancy or currently lactating Prior participation in cardiac gene and/or cardiac cell therapy</criteria>
