	<brief_summary>In this study, the investigators want to see if Bacteriotherapy (also referred to as stool transplantation) improves the symptoms and decreases inflammation in children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Examples of IBD are Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. Additionally, researchers want to learn whether this experimental therapy delays the need for starting additional medications to treat pediatric IBD.</brief_summary>
