	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the bioavailability of acetate, propionate and butyrate in healthy humans using a stable isotope technology. In addition the level of acetate, propionate and butyrate production from inulin will be determined using the principle of isotope dilution.</brief_summary>
