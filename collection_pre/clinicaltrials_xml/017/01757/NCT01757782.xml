	<criteria>Newborns were diagnosed with MAS if any of the two of the following three criteria were present. (1) Meconium staining of liquor or staining of umbilical cord or skin or nails. (2) Respiratory distress, within one hour of birth. (3) Radiological evidence of aspiration pneumonitis (atelectasis and/or hyperinflation). Newborns with MAS diagnosed with clinical PPHN were enrolled in the study for drug trial. PPHN was determined either clinically by loud P2(second component of second heart sound), 10% or greater pre/post ductal difference in arterial oxygenation (obtained by acid base gas analysis) or upper limb lower limb SpO2 difference (obtained by pulse oximetry). (a) babies with congenital heart disease (b) congenital anomalies particularly those which were incompatible to life or which was the cause for respiratory distress e.g. diaphragmatic hernia (c) Respiratory morbidities such as hyaline membrane disease, congenital pneumonia (d) Babies with PPHN secondary to MAS admitted after 12 hours of delivery (e) Non availability of consent of guardian for interventional procedures</criteria>
