	<brief_summary>The objective of the PAS-01 study is to assess the safety of the intraocular as measured by the cumulative incidence of patients who within 5 years after implantation experience persistent vision-impairing corneal edema (corneal edema leading to persistent loss of best corrected distance visual acuity &gt;2 lines from pre-surgery baseline level). The study will test the null hypothesis that the percentage of patients who experience persistent vision-impairing corneal edema is &gt;17% against the alternative that the percentage is &lt;17%. The null hypothesis will be rejected if the upper bound of the two-sided 95% confidence integral for the observed percentage is &lt;17%.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>ECD sub-study. At investigative sites participating in the ECD Sub-Group study, corneal endothelial cell density will be measured by non-contact specular microscopy in a subgroup of 150 patients enrolled in the IMT-PAS-01 in the eye schedule for and implanted with the intraocular telescope at study entry, 3 months, 12, months, 24 months, 36 months, 48 months and 60 months.</detailed_description>
