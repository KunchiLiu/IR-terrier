	<brief_summary>Pain is the most common presenting symptom in medical outpatients, and depression and anxiety are the two most common mental disorders. All three conditions are often inadequately treated and result in substantial disability, reduced health-related quality of life, and increased health care costs and utilization. Additionally, pain, anxiety, and depression (PAD) are frequently comorbid with one another and have reciprocal negative effects on treatment response and additive effects on adverse health outcomes. The PAD triad is especially burdensome in Veterans, with their high prevalence of chronic pain, depression, PTSD, and other anxiety disorders. The Comprehensive vs. Assisted Management of Mood and Physical Symptoms (CAMMPS) study is a randomized comparative effectiveness trial designed to test the relative effectiveness of a lower-resource vs. a higher-resource enhancement of usual primary care in the management of Veterans suffering from with pain plus comorbid anxiety and/or depression.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Comprehensive vs. Assisted Management of Mood and Physical Symptoms (CAMMPS) study is a randomized comparative effectiveness trial designed to test the relative effectiveness of a lower-resource vs. a higher-resource enhancement of usual primary care in the management of Veterans suffering from with pain plus comorbid anxiety and/or depression. This is a single-site study enrolling Veterans. Patients followed in primary care clinics at the Roudebush VAMC will be eligible if they have clinically significant levels of pain plus comorbid anxiety and/or depression. A total of 300 eligible patients who provide informed consent will be randomized to one of two treatment arms. One group (n=150) will receive assisted symptom management (ASM) consisting of automated symptom monitoring by interactive voice recording or Internet and prompted pain self-management guided by symptom levels. The second group (n=150) will receive comprehensive symptom management (CSM) which combines ASM with optimized medication management delivered by a nurse-physician specialist team and facilitated mental health care. This team will partner with both VA primary care physicians and psychologists embedded in primary care to monitor and adjust treatments using evidence-based analgesic and antidepressant algorithms, reinforced self-management, and care coordination. The investigators postulate that although both interventions are likely to be beneficial, CSM will be superior to ASM. In short, this trial compares: 1) usual care plus assisted symptom management (ASM) vs. 2) usual care plus ASM plus optimized medication and care management and facilitated mental health care (CSM). Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. The primary outcome is a composite pain-anxiety-depression severity score. Secondary outcomes include individual pain, anxiety, and depression scores; functional status and health-related quality of life; treatment satisfaction; and perceived barriers and facilitators of the CSM and ASM interventions. The rationale for ASM is preliminary evidence of its effectiveness and its lower use of resources. The rationale for CSM is that the addition of optimized medication management, facilitated mental health care, and coordination with both primary care physicians/Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACTs) and psychologists for the PAD symptoms should substantially enhance the benefits of ASM.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Individuals must be patients of the Richard L. Roudebush VAMC in Indianapolis, Indiana Individuals will be eligible if they have pain plus comorbid anxiety and/or depression. Pain must: be musculoskeletal, either localized (in the arms, legs, back, or neck) or widespread (fibromyalgia) have persisted 3 months or longer despite a trial of at least one analgesic medication at least moderate in severity, defined as a Brief Pain Inventory average severity score of 5 or greater Depression must be of at least moderate severity, defined as a PHQ8 score of 10 or greater with either depressed mood and/or anhedonia being endorsed, OR Anxiety must be of at least moderate severity, defined as a GAD7 score of 10 or greater, OR A composite mood score (anxiety and depression) of sufficient severity, defined as a GAD7 + PHQ8 score of 12 or greater. Individuals will be excluded if they: do not speak English have moderately severe cognitive impairment as defined by a validated 6item cognitive screener have schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or other psychosis have other severe mental illness and/or high risk of suicide are pregnant have an anticipated life expectancy of less than 12 months. Patients who are on antidepressants but still meet the PHQ9 and/or GAD7 entry criterion for clinical depression and/or anxiety may still be eligible if they have been on an adequate dose of the antidepressant for an adequate duration of time (i.e., 12 weeks).</criteria>
