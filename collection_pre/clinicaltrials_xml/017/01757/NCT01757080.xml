	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVE: To analyze the influence of lipid control during a cardiorespiratory exercise test in two subgroups. DESIGN: Parallel trial study. PARTICIPANTS: The sample consisted of 40 elderly people, male and female, divided into two groups: 20 hypertensive (G1; 68.50 ±5.85 years) and 20 diabetic-hypertensive (G2; 68.95 ±6.79 years). MEASUREMENTS: Nutritional status; glucose and lipid controls - postprandial glucose (PPG), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein (LDL-C), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL-C), high density lipoprotein (HDL-C); blood pressure, and cardiorespiratory performance. The significance level was set at p&lt;0.05.</brief_summary>
