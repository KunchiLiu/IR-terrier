	<brief_summary>The objective of this trial is to confirm that the modifications to tissue processing, valve sterilization and packaging do not raise any new questions of safety and effectiveness in subjects who require replacement of their native or prosthetic aortic or mitral valve.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Multicenter, prospective, single arm trial - Up to seven hundred (700) aortic valve replacement (AVR) subjects and up to one hundred seventy-five (175) mitral valve replacement (MVR) subjects at up to forty (40) clinical sites will be enrolled. The trial will include male and female patients, 18 years or older, requiring replacement for a diseased, damaged, or malfunctioning native or prosthetic aortic or mitral valve. Patients will be followed and assessed after implant for up to 5 years.</detailed_description>
