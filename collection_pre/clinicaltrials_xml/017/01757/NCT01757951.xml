	<brief_summary>A one third of all ankle fractures are bi- or trimalleolar. Traditionally these fractures are treated by both medial and lateral osteosynthesis, sometimes accompanied by osteosynthesis of the posterior malleolus. There is significant evidence that fractures of the lateral malleolus can be treated conservatively if the medial side is stable. However, there isn't a single study comparing standard bi- or trimalleolar fixation with only medial side osteosynthesis and postoperative immobilization with a cast.</brief_summary>
