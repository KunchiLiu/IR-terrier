	<brief_summary>The prognostic value of inflammatory markers in acute coronary syndrome has been extensively demonstrated, however it is still unknown whether there is an association between circulating and local (thrombus) inflammatory molecules, and the subset of molecules that provide better prognostic information in patients with ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>They include patients of both sexes, without limits of age, with a diagnosis of STEMI within 12 hours after the beginning of symptoms. STelevation myocardial infarction was defined in the presence of symptoms consistent, persistent elevation (&gt; 20 min) ST segment â‰¥ 1 mm in at least two contiguous leads or in the presence of left bundle branch block presumably new onset and cardiac troponin I elevation Injury significant common core of left coronary artery (stenosis greater than or equal to 50% of the vessel lumen). PreFibrinolysis percutaneous coronary intervention. Previous coronary bypass surgery. Thyrotoxicosis. Having an inflammatory systemic or local inflammatory process. Malignant neoplasm. Any disease that seriously compromise the prognosis and / or systemic inflammatory response generated. No thrombotic material obtained in the thrombus or insufficient for performing biochemical determinations.</criteria>
