	<brief_title>The Difference in Cerebral Oxygenation Between Propofol and Sevoflurane</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>the purpose of this study:(1) to investigate the incidence of preoperative cerebral oxygenation abnormity (SjvO2 &lt;55%) and its relationship with intraoperative cerebral desaturation and POCD. (2) To investigate the change of intraoperative cerebral oxygen supply and demand balance and the incidence of cerebral desaturation in patients with abnormal preoperative cerebral oxygenation during sevoflurane anesthesia. (3)To investigate the incidence of early POCD in patients with abnormal preoperative cerebral oxygenation during sevoflurane and propofol anesthesia.</detailed_description>
