	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see if using a form of imaging during surgery helps the doctors to guide the placement of radiation catheters more accurately. This method, called "image-guided surgical navigation" may allow the doctors to deliver radiation to the tumor that the patient needs and decrease the amount of radiation delivered to the nearby areas.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Patients must have histologic proof of a malignancy suitable for radiation therapy. Patients must have received prior external beam radiation therapy to the region proposed for HDR brachytherapy treatment; evaluation of doses previously delivered to spinal cord/cauda equine, pelvis, and other critical structures (bowel, kidneys, rectum) will be taken into consideration. If repeat irradiation would exceed any normal tissue constraint set by MSKCC Radiation Oncology Department dose constraint criteria, the patient will potentially be eligible. If the total prior radiation dose to the cord or pelvis exceeds 100 Gy BED equivalent, the patient will be potentially eligible, where a total of 100 BED Gy equivalent is determined by the biological equivalent dose (BED) calculation; BED = nd(1 + d/α/β), where n = number of fractions and d = dose per fraction; α/β is the constant for spinal cord late effect and equals 2. [Rades 2005, Nieder 2005, Sahgal 2012] KPS ≥ 60 Age ≥ 18 years old Patients who may receive therapeutically effective doses via an external beam approach to the lesion of interest as specified by MSKCC Radiation Oncology Department dose constraint criteria. Patients with kyphoplasty cement or hardware that would preclude effective catheter placement. Patients with paraspinal extension of disease with visceral involvement. Abnormal complete blood count. Any of the following: Platelet count &lt; 75,000/ml Hb level &lt; 9gm/dl WBC &lt; 3.5/ml Abnormal coagulation profile: INR &gt; 2.5 and/or PTT &gt; 80 Patients who are on anticoagulation medication that may not be safely held for the procedure (≥ 5 days for antiplatelet agents and warfarin; ≥ 24 hours for lowmolecular weight heparin formulations) will be excluded. Contraindications to general anesthesia</criteria>
