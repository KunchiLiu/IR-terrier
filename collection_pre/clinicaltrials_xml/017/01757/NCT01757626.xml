	<criteria>Diagnosis of NB as defined by a) histopathology (confirmed by the MSKCC Department of Pathology), or b) BM metastases or MIBGavid lesion(s) plus high urine catecholamine levels. Patients must have highrisk NB (including MYCNamplified stage 2/3/4/4S of any age and MYCNnonamplified stage 4 in patients greater than 18 months of age) AND: Phase I: Patients must have refractory or relapsed NB, resistant to standard therapy*. *For NB, standard therapy includes intensive induction chemotherapy, followed by a variety of consolidation or salvage therapies, depending on response. Phase II: Patients must have primary or secondary refractory disease in BM, defined as morphologic evidence of NB in BM and/or abnormal 123IMIBG uptake in osteomedullary sites, OR patients are in ≥2nd CR/VGPR Patients must be older than 1 year of age. Prior treatment with murine and humanized 3F8 is allowed. Patients with prior m3F8, hu3F8, ch14.18 or hu14.18 treatment must have HAHA antibody titer ≤1300 Elisa units/ml. Human antimouse antibody positivity is allowed. White blood cell count ≥1000/ul (phase I only) Absolute neutrophil count ≥500/ul (phase I only) Absolute lymphocyte count ≥500/ul (phase I only) Platelet count ≥25,000/ul (phase I only) No chemotherapy or immunotherapy for a minimum of three weeks prior to start of hu3F8 Women of childbearing potential must be willing to practice an effective method of birth control while on treatment Signed informed consent indicating awareness of the investigational nature of this program. Existing major organ dysfunction &gt; grade 2, with the exception of hearing loss and hematologic toxicity (defined as suppression of all subtypes of WBCs, RBCs, and platelets). Active lifethreatening infection. Pregnant women or women who are breastfeeding. Inability to comply with protocol requirements, including PK studies and genetic studies (phase I only) History of allergy to mouse proteins. Human antihu3F8 antibody (HAHA) titer &gt;1300 Elisa units/ml. History of allergy to GMCSF</criteria>
