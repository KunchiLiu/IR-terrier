	<brief_summary>The investigators propose this phase I/II study to use weekly Nab-Paclitaxel (Abraxane) and carboplatin with concurrent radiation in local-regionally advanced lung cancer. There are no published human studies combining Nab-Paclitaxel (Abraxane) with radiation. The investigators will first confirm the tolerated dose (TD) of concurrent Nab-Paclitaxel (Abraxane) at 50mg/m2, and then will begin enrolling patients into the phase II component using either Nab-Paclitaxel (Abraxane) at the TD with carboplatin concurrent with daily radiation or paclitaxel with with carboplatin concurrent with daily radiation.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically documented NSCLC; Patients must be M0. Patients with T1T2 with N2 or T3N12 are eligible, if inoperable. Patients with T4 with any N or any T with N2 or N3 disease are eligible if unresectable. Patients with tumors adjacent to a vertebral body are eligible as long as all gross disease can be encompassed in the radiation boost field. The boost volume must be limited to &lt; 50% of the ipsilateral lung volume. Patients with Zubrod performance status 01 Adequate hematologic function FEV1 with ≥ 1200 cc or ≥ 50% predicted Prior systemic chemotherapy (for lung cancer) and/or thoracic/neck radiotherapy for any reason and/or surgical resection of present cancer Exudative, bloody, or cytologically malignant effusions Prior therapy with any molecular targeted drugs (for lung cancer) Active pulmonary infection not responsive to conventional antibiotics Clinically significant cardiovascular event (e.g. myocardial infarction, superior vena cava syndrome (SVC), New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of heart disease &gt;2 (see Appendix B) within 3 months before entry; or presence of cardiac disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator, increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia.
