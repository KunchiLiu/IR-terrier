	<brief_title>Study of Topical Superoxide Dismutase to Treat Radiation Induced Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the effect of topical Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) on the radiation induced fibrosis in head and neck cancer patients. A prospective, blinded, two group control design will be used with pretest and post test quality of life as well as objective fibrosis assessment. Patients will be randomized to alternatively receive topical SOD or placebo as instructed on twice daily use for 3 months. Pre and post treatment quality of life surveys and objective assessment will determine if the topical SOD improves neck fibrosis/function and global quality of life. This study will increase clinical trial awareness and participation while potentially improving the long term functional outcomes of head and neck cancer patients.</detailed_description>
