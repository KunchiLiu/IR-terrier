	<brief_summary>Elevated subconscious nervous system activity is a characteristic of the obese state and contributes importantly to the risk of heart disease and diabetes. This project will compare sympathetic nervous system activity and function in a group of obese persons with differing levels of sugar tolerance (normal, impaired and type 2 diabetic). Inter-relationships with insulin action, blood pressure, heart and kidney function will be determined before and after a 4-month weight loss and 3-month weight loss maintenance program. It is hypothesized that the transition from normal sugar tolerance to impaired sugar tolerance to type 2 diabetes will be accompanied by escalating sympathetic nervous system dysfunction. Furthermore, that weight loss will favorably improve sympathetic function, with greatest benefits occurring in those subjects who are insulin resistant with high blood insulin concentration.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects of Weight Loss on Neuroadrenergic Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The twin epidemics of obesity and diabetes represent a major public health problem worldwide. There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that autonomic dysfunction, comprising elevated sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity and blunted sympathetic neural responsiveness plays a role in both the pathogenesis and target organ complications of obesity and diabetes. The proposed project will undertake a detailed comparative analysis of neuroadrenergic function along the diabetes continuum, its inter-relationship with insulin sensitivity and secretion, and target organ function, and the benefits of active weight loss and weight loss maintenance within different strata of metabolic risk.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men and postmenopausal women (n=120), untreated, weightstable, nonsmoking, aged 4565 years, BMI 2745 kg/m2, will be recruited. Glucose tolerance status will be determined by a 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), using WHO criteria (53): normal glucose tolerance, fasting plasma glucose &lt; 7.0 mmol/L and 2h plasma glucose &lt; 7.8 mmol/L; IGT, fasting plasma glucose &lt; 7.0 mmol/L and 2h plasma glucose &gt; 7.8 and &lt; 11.1 mmol/L; T2D, fasting plasma glucose &gt; 7.0 mmol/L or 2h plasma glucose &gt; 11.1 mmol/L. Hyperinsulinemia will be defined as an insulin area under the curve during OGTT &gt; 8000 mU/L ∙ min1 and hypoinsulinemia as &lt; 8000 mU/L ∙ min1. Prior history of cardiovascular disease (previous myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, heart failure, secondary hypertension), renal (serum creatinine &gt;0.12 mmol/L or estimated GFR &lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m2) or hepatic disease or diseases which may affect measured parameters (e.g. thyroid disease); severe hypertension; a history of surgical weight loss; CPAP therapy; and &gt;4 alcoholic drinks/day. T2D individuals with moderate hyperglycemia (HbA1c &gt;9%) will be excluded so that hypoglycaemic pharmacotherapy may be instituted (54). Participants will be sought through newspaper advertising and poster displays in primary health care centres (General Practices). Newly diagnosed T2D subjects</criteria>
