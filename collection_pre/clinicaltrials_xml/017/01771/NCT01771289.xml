	<criteria>Patients aged 18 years older. Present with histologically proven or cytological diagnosis of NSCLC Stage IIIA as defined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Criteria for Lung Cancer, that is amenable to surgery. No prior systemic chemotherapy or targeted therapy for lung cancer before screening. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Life expectancy ≥12 weeks. Adequate hematological function:Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5 x 109/L, and Platelet count ≥100 x 109/L, and Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL (may be transfused to maintain or exceed this level). Adequate liver function: Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN);Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN in subjects without liver metastases; ≤ 5 x ULN in subjects with liver metastases. Adequate renal function:Serum creatinine ≤ 1.25 x ULN, and creatinine clearance ≥ 60 ml/min. Female subjects should not be pregnant or breastfeeding. Patients with prior exposure to agents directed at the HER axis (e.g. erlotinib, gefitinib, cetuximab, trastuzumab). Patients with prior chemotherapy or therapy with systemic antitumour therapy (e.g. monoclonal antibody therapy). History of another malignancy in the last 5 years with the exception of the following:Other malignancies cured by surgery alone and having a continuous diseasefree interval of 5 years are permitted; Cured basal cell carcinoma of the skin and cured in situ carcinoma of the uterine cervix are permitted. Any unstable systemic disease (including active infection, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within the previous year, serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication, hepatic, renal, or metabolic disease). Known hypersensitivity to Tarceva or gemcitabine or cisplatin. Eye inflammation or eye infection not fully treated or conditions predisposing the subject to this. Evidence of any other disease, neurological or metabolic dysfunction, physical examination or laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicated the use of an investigational drug or puts the subject at high risk for treatmentrelated complications.</criteria>
