	<brief_summary>Objective: To determine whether antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in kidney transplant recipients could be useful to prevent pyelonephritis in these patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antibiotic Treatment Versus no Therapy in Kidney Transplant Recipients With Asymptomatic Bacteriuria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design: Randomized prospective study. Setting: University Hospital with an active kidney transplantation program. Patients: Adult kidney transplant recipients. Interventions: Kidney transplant recipients with asymptomatic bacteriuria will be randomly assigned to be treated with antibiotics or to be followed without antibiotic therapy. Measurements: Urine cultures will be collected weekly during the first month after transplantation, every 2 weeks until three months after transplantation, every month until 6 months after transplantation and every 3 months until 12 months after transplantation. Urine culture will be as well collected if urinary symptoms appeared. Primary end points: To determine in both groups: the incidence of pyelonephritis. Secondary end points: To determine outcomes in both groups (renal function, hospitalization, rejection, graft loss, opportunistic infections and mortality) and infection by multiresistant microorganisms.</detailed_description>
