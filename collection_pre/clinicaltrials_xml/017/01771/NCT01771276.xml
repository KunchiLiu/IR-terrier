	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to help find out more about how the Primary Obesity Surgery Endoluminal (POSE) procedure makes patients feel less hungry and fuller faster, leading to weight loss. In this study, USGI Medical wants to see if stomach emptying and gastro-intestinal hormone levels change after a POSE procedure with an increased (as compared to typical) number of anchors placed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ULTIMATE Study for Weight Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will use the USGI Medical Incisionless Operating Platform (IOP) to determine the affects of placing more Suture Anchors per patient (as compared to the current practice) in Primary Obesity Surgery Endoluminal(POSE). USGI wants to see if placing more anchors (particularly in the distal body/antrum region) significantly impacts primary weight loss, satiety, and metabolic outcomes.</detailed_description>
