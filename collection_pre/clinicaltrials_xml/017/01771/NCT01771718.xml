	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pilot study is to employ multiphoton microscopy to non-invasively image in-vivo pigmented and non-pigmented human skin lesions for characterization of their morphologic and functional features. .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study on In-vivo Non-invasive Skin Imaging Using Multiphoton Microscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is performed using a multiphoton microscopy-based tomograph (MPTflex) developed by JenLab, GmbH (Germany) to image non-invasively normal and lesional skin. Skin lesions are imaged by multiphoton microscopy and images are compared to those obtained from histopathology through standard of care processed skin biopsies. Any biopsies will be performed by the health care provider as a standard of care procedure.</detailed_description>
