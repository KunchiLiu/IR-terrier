	<brief_summary>Regional tissue oxygenation (cStO2) can be monitored by near infrared spectroscopy. The commercial device INVOS 5100 (COVIDIEN, Mansfield, MA, USA) and the prototype OxyPrem vs. 1.2 (Biomedical Optics Research Laboratory, Zurich, Switzerland) will be used simultaneously to test for their relative sensitivity for low oxygen levels just after birth on term infants born by elective caesarean section. Reproducibility will be examined by replacements of the sensors six times the next day when the infant is stable and quiet. The Adult Somasensor (INVOS) will be used together with the OxyPrem sensor.</brief_summary>
