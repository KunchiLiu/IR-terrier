	<brief_title>Impact of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on Language Functions in Mild Cognitive Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous studies showed that anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS) can have beneficial effects on word-retrieval in healthy younger and older subjects. The present study aims to extend these findings by assessing whether atDCS can also improve known impairments of word-retrieval in Mild Cognitive Impairment. atDCS will be applied to the left inferior frontal gyrus in a sham controlled cross-over within subjects design. Simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will assess underlying neural effects of the stimulation.</detailed_description>
