	<brief_summary>Introduction: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refers to two chronic diseases that cause intestinal inflammation, ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The conventional treatment is not effective; therefore, alternative therapies may be effective specially in UC patients. Fatty acid (FA) may have a beneficial effect on some UC patients. The increasing incidence and prevalence of UC and ineffective treatments in some patients, allows search coadjuvant therapies. Objective: Quantification of differences between patients with and without FA. Methods: In two groups of patients with UC is administered FA and placebo. We will measure the changes clinical, endoscopic and histological in both groups, before and after treatment.</brief_summary>
