	<brief_summary>Background : The use of suction drains in thyroid surgery is common practice in order to avoid haematoma or seroma, as well as to identify promptly the onset of haemorrhaging that might compromise the patient's airway. The aim of this study to determine the effects of routine drainage compared to no drainage in thyroidectomy patients. Study Design : Total of 400 patients who undergoing total thyroidectomy or lobectomy for thyroidal disorders will be randomly allocated to be drained or not. Postoperative ultrasonographic (USG) neck examination will be performed for all patients on postoperative 24th hour by the same ultrasonologist each time. Postoperative pain, complications and hospital stay will be recorded. The statistical analysis will be performed and p&lt;0,05 will be accepted as an important statistical value (SPSS 16.0 for Windows).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Is the Use of Drain for Thyroid Surgery Realistic?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will include in the study will randomly allocate to drain and non-drain group on the basis of computer generated random number table. Patients with substernal goitre or non differentiated cancer will exclude from the study. According to the thyroidal disorder, total thyroidectomy or lobectomy plus isthmectomy will be performed. The operating time will be defined as the time from the first incision to the last suture's placement. 4/0 polypropylene sutures will be used subcutaneously for wound closure. In the drain group a closed suction drain with negative pressure (HemovacÂ®) was brought out through a separate wound.</detailed_description>
