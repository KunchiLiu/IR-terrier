	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate if there is a relationship between the take of fat grafts with and without ADSCs and the presence of specific surface markers on the cells of the stromal vascular fraction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunophenotyping of Fresh Stromal Vascular Fraction From Adipose Derived Stem Cells (ADSC) Enriched Fat Grafts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two groups of patients will be studied. The control will receive centrifuged fat grafts while the other group will receive centrifuged enriched fat grafts with ADSCs. The performance of both grafts will be assessed through volume measurement employing MRI before and after 6 months post-op.</detailed_description>
