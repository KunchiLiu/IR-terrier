	<brief_summary>This randomized clinical study investigates the efficiency of plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF-Endoret) in combination with bone grafts in the healing of bone and soft tissues after the performance of lateral sinus floor elevation. The hypothesis of this study is that the use of PRGF-Endoret will produce similar bone formation regardless the type of bone graft.</brief_summary>
