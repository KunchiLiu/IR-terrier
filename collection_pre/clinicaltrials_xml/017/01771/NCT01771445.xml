	<brief_summary>Aim: Evaluate the regulation of muscle derived Interleukin-6 (IL-6)during exercise and in particular whether it is regulated by the Interleukin-1 (IL-1) system. Rationale: It has been shown that IL-1 antagonism improves glycemia and insulin secretion in patients with type 2 Diabetes. However, IL-1 antagonism also decreases IL-6 levels. The effect if IL-6 on the glucose metabolism has been unclear in the past and subject to intense debate, with recent evidence indicating a beneficial role in regulating glucose metabolism. However little is known about regulation of muscle-induced IL-6 produced during exercise. It is therefore our aim to investigate whether exercise induced increases in IL-6 are dependent on the IL-1 system. If IL-1 antagonism does decrease IL-6 and along with it, the beneficial potential of IL-6, this may require additional medication like IL-6 substitution or dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV)antagonists. In addition, the investigators will assess the effect of IL-1 antagonism on insulin and Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion as well as muscle soreness,fatigue and vascular function in response to an acute exercise bout.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a randomized placebo-controlled, double blind, cross-over, proof-of-concept study. The study will consist of one screening visit followed by 3 study visits. During the first two study visits, the subjects (20 apparently healthy, lean men) will perform a submaximal exercise bout on a treadmill for 60 minutes. Subjects will be randomly assigned into two groups consisting each of 10 subjects receiving study medication in a double-blinded, crossed over manner.</detailed_description>
