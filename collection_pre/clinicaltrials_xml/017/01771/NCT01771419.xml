	<brief_summary>Selective cannulation of common bile duct (CBD) by insertion of a guide-wire seems to be associated with fewer complications and post-ERCP (Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) pancreatitis (PEP) rate than the conventional biliary tree access with cannulotome (CT-25 Cook Medical) with contrast injection even if results are conflicting. the aim of our study is to test a new guide-wire (loop-tip wire), with a loop in the tip, for the prevention of PEP and biliary tree access, in PEP high-risk patients.</brief_summary>
