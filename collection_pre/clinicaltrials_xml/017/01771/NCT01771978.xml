	<brief_summary>Less oxidative stress occurs during off-pump than on-pump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery but warm ischaemia-reperfusion injury may occur following transient coronary artery clamping. The aim of this study was to compare the preventive effects of diltiazem and N-acetylcysteine (NAC), alone or in combination, on biomarkers of myocardial damage and oxidative stress during off-pump CABG surgery.</brief_summary>
