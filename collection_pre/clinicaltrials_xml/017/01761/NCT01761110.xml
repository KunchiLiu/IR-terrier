	<brief_summary>The main goal of this study is to pilot test the community-based buprenorphine treatment (CBBT) intervention, examining buprenorphine treatment initiation, opioid use, and HIV risk behaviors. Two groups of participants will be followed for 60 days, with 3 research visits. One group will be enrolled prior to the CBBT intervention (pre-intervention), and one group after the CBBT intervention (post-intervention). Data sources will include questionnaires, urine toxicology tests, and medical record data. We hypothesize that compared to the participants in the pre-intervention group, participants in the post-intervention group will be more likely to initiate buprenorphine treatment, reduce opioid use, and reduce high-risk HIV risk behaviors.</brief_summary>
