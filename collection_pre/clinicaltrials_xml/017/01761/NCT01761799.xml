	<detailed_description>The primary research aim of this project is to test the effectiveness of a comprehensive, evidence-based vaccine promotion package implemented in the obstetric setting on increasing the likelihood that a pregnant woman in Georgia will receive an influenza vaccine and/or Tdap vaccine before delivery. A secondary research aim assesses whether the comprehensive package improves maternal knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs regarding maternal and infant vaccination. The intervention package will include evidence-based components aimed at the practice-level, provider-level, and patient level and will be tested through a cluster-randomized trial design. The primary outcome measure is influenza vaccine receipt during pregnancy. The secondary outcomes include 1) receipt of pertussis (Tdap) vaccination during pregnancy, and 2) changes in maternal knowledge, attitudes and beliefs regarding maternal and infant vaccination. The primary hypothesis is that implementation of a comprehensive vaccine promotion package in the obstetric setting will increase the likelihood that a pregnant woman receives an influenza and/or pertussis vaccination.</detailed_description>
