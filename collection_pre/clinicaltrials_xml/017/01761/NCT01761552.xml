	<brief_summary>To demonstrate that the use of Sugammadex enables physicians to perform early extubation in the operating room in ASA 4 &amp; 4E patients Primary endpoint: • Extubation in the operating room before transfer to the PACU or ICU versus keeping the patient intubated when transferred. Secondary endpoints: • Time to extubation - measure the difference in time from application of the surgical dressing until extubation. Atelectasis - comparison of chest x-rays (CXR): prior to surgery, on admission to PACU or ICU and 24 hours after admission to PACU or ICU (This is the routine practice at Hadassa hospital for ASA IV patients.)</brief_summary>
