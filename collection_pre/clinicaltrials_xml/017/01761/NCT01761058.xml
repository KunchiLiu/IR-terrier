	<brief_summary>The overall goal of this proposal is to better understand the basis of airway remodeling in severe asthma and how remodeling changes overtime. The investigators propose to study a well characterized cohort of individuals with severe asthma using a multidisciplinary state-of-the-art-approach.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Through innovative metabolomics and redox biochemistry, methodologies that are a strength and unique to our collaborative efforts, the investigators identified clinically relevant phenotypes of asthma. The phenotypes are defined by biomarkers specific to underlying biochemical mechanistic abnormalities, including eosinophil-mediated oxidation, depletion of antioxidants and protective airway S-nitrosothiols, and airway acidification. Here,the investigators propose to study a new component that is informative for longitudinal assessment of severe asthma phenotypes: gender effects. The investigators reason that identification of the metabolic mechanism(s) underlying onset of severe asthma in young women during adolescence, and resolution of severe asthma in boys, will reveal fundamental pathophysiology of severe asthma. Importantly, we aim to develop clinical testing procedures to accurately assign metabolic asthma phenotypes; and to follow patients in each phenotype to uncover clinical longitudinal outcomes. At the conclusion of the project, we anticipate that we will have 1) developed clinically relevant tests to identify severe asthma phenotypes; 2) determined the longitudinal outcome of the phenotypes; and 3) identified the mechanisms underlying the preponderance of women in the severe asthma population. This application will focus on the development or clinically relevant metabolic tests to identify subphenotypes of adults and children with severe asthma and will lead to new targeted innovative treatments.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Physician diagnosis of asthma • Age 6 years to 17 years old Evidence of historical reversibility, including either; 1. FEV1 bronchodilator reversibility greater than or equal to 12%, or 2. Airway hyperresponsivesness reflected by a methacholine PC20 less than or equal to 16 mg/ml. Exclusion criteria include any of the following: 1. Pregnancy during the characterization phase*, 2. Current smoking, 3. Smoking history &gt; 10 pack years if ≥30 years of age, or smoking history &gt; 5 pack years if &lt;30 years of age (Note: if a subject has a smoking history, no smoking within the past year), 4. Other chronic pulmonary disorders associated with asthmalike symptoms, including (but not limited to) cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic bronchitis, vocal cord dysfunction (that is the sole cause of respiratory symptoms and at the PI's discretion), severe scoliosis or chest wall deformities that affect lung function, or congenital disorders of the lungs or airways, 5. History of premature birth before 35 weeks gestation, 6. Unwillingness to receive an intramuscular triamcinolone acetonide injection. 7. Evidence that the participant or family may be unreliable or poorly adherent to their asthma treatment or study procedures, 8. Planning to relocate from the clinical center area before study completion, 9. Any other criteria that place the subject at unnecessary risk according to the judgment of the Principal Investigator and/or attending physician(s) of record, or 10. Currently participating in an investigational drug trial.</criteria>
