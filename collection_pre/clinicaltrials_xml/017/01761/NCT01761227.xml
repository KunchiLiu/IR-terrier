	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Fufangdanshen Tablets in Mild to Moderate Vascular Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Fufangdanshen Tablets in patients with vascular dementia. All patients will initially receive placebo for a 2 weeks period and then will receive Fufangdanshen Tablets or placebo for 6 months. The primary measures of effectiveness include the change from baseline to the end of treatment in the ADAS-cog/11 score (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale: sum of 11 cognitive items) and the CIBIC-plus score (Clinician's Interview Based Impression of Change - Plus Caregiver Input). Additional measures of effectiveness include the change from baseline to the end of the treatment in the MMSE score (Mini-mental State Examination), the ADL (Ability of Daily Living) score. Safety evaluations (incidence of adverse events, electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical examinations, laboratory tests) will be performed throughout the study. Patients who complete the double-blind portion of the study will be followed up 12 weeks. Effectiveness will be assessed at 12 weeks, 24weeks and 36 weeks. Safety evaluations (incidence of adverse events, ECGs, physical examinations, laboratory tests) will be performed at 12 weeks, 24weeks and 36 weeks of the study. The study hypothesis is that Fufangdanshen Tablets will be effective in the treatment of patients with vascular dementia and will be well tolerated. Double-blind: Fufangdanshen Tablets: 3 tablets per time, 3 times per day, and placebo : 3 tablets per time, 3 times per day. The placebo has similar smile and appearance as the Fufangdanshen Tablets.</detailed_description>
