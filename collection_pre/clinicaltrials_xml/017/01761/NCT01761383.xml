	<brief_title>Role of Nintendo Wii in Improving Negative Symptoms and Quality of Life in Chronic Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study seeks to determine whether any benefit in daily functioning and quality of life can be gained from using the Nintendo Wii video game console in chronic mental illness, namely schizophrenia. There is a small research base on the use of the Wii console in elderly nursing home residents as a means of increasing mobility, with attendant benefits in areas such as falls, quality of life, and relief of subsyndromal depression. For individuals with schizophrenia, adjunct exercise therapy has been associated with gains in both psychiatric and physical symptoms. However, people with schizophrenia face physical and functional barriers in initiating and continuing organized activity programs. Thus, the Nintendo Wii Fit Plus interactive fitness video game is being proposed as a novel way of introducing and engaging people with schizophrenia in various forms of physical activity. As the first study to assess the use of the Nintendo Wii in chronic mental illness, the purpose of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility and the capacity of the Nintendo Wii in improving the health and functioning of people with severe, chronic schizophrenia. Although it is hypothesized that Nintendo Wii use will lead to gains in these domains, the information gained from this study will be used to determine specific areas of benefit and to assess whether any observed differences in outcome measures are sufficient to warrant a full-scale study. Furthermore, this initial study aims to pilot the interview schedule, clarify wording on the questionnaires, ensure that all important areas have been covered by the questionnaires, and determine whether participants are capable of meeting the demands of the study.</detailed_description>
