	<brief_summary>Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) has been considered as an effective modality for renal replacement therapy in hemodynamically unstable patients within intensive care unit (ICU) except for the necessity of anticoagulation. The severity and peculiarities of ICU patients often make it equivocal to use anticoagulation. This is a prospective randomized controlled study to show the difference in filter life span and adverse event between HF1000 (nafamostat mesilate) group and M100 (heparin-free) group.</brief_summary>
