	<brief_summary>Influenza is an important and potentially preventable cause of morbidity and mortality, yet only 46% of U.S. adults were vaccinated by the end of the 2011-12 influenza season despite influenza vaccination being widely recommended, effective, and safe. Influenza vaccination rates are even lower in racial/ethnic minority groups. In order to address the problem of low influenza vaccination rates in minority adults, we plan to build on the well-accepted practice of immunization recall-reminders and the emerging practice of using text message to pilot the feasibility of using text messaging to improve influenza vaccination coverage rates in a low health literacy, largely minority, publicly insured adult population.</brief_summary>
