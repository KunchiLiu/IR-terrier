	<brief_summary>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography(ERCP) and related procedures can cause abdominal pain and discomfort. Some clinical trials have indicated, using the visual analogue scale (VAS) score, that CO2 insufflation during ERCP ameliorates the suffering of patients without complications, compared with air insufflation. However, differences in patient suffering between CO2 and air insufflation after ERCP depending on sedation protocols have not been reported. We therefore planned prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled study with CO2 and air insufflation during ERCP depending on sedation protocol.</brief_summary>
