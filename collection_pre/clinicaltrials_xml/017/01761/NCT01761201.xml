	<brief_summary>A multicenter, prospective, non-inferiority, randomized and open clinical trial comparing levofloxacin with isoniazid in the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection in patients eligible for liver transplantation. Patients over 18 years of age on the waiting list for liver transplantation. Sample size: n=870 patients. HYPOTHESIS Levofloxacin treatment of latent tuberculosis infection, begun while on the waiting list for liver transplantation, is safer and not less effective than isoniazid treatment begun after transplantation when liver function is stable.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>"Efficacy and Safety of Levofloxacin vs Isoniazid in Latent Tuberculosis Infection in Liver Transplant Patients".</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective 1. To demonstrate that the incidence of tuberculosis in patients with latent tuberculosis infection and treated with levofloxacin is not higher than that observed in patients treated with isoniazid. Secondary Objective 2. To demonstrate that the efficacy of levofloxacin is not limited by adverse effects, paying particular attention to hepatotoxicity.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Liver transplantation candidates with age â‰¥ 18 years, no clinical or radiological evidence of active tuberculosis and negative pregnancy test (if applicable)who must meet one or more of the following criteria: PPD skin test (initial or after a "booster effect") &gt;5 mm. Alternatively, the determination may be made by the interferon gamma (IFNg) production in PPDstimulated lymphocytes using the QuantiferonTB or ELISPOT assays. Past history of tuberculosis not properly treated. Past history of contact with a patient with active TB. Chest xray consistent with past untreated TB (apical fibronodular lesions, calcified solitary nodule, calcified lymph nodes or pleural thickening). The patient must give their written informed consent. Lack of consent to participate in the study. Intolerance or allergy to levofloxacin or to isoniazid. Documented contact with tuberculosis resistant to levofloxacin or to isoniazid. Treatment in the previous month with drugs with potential activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, (especially quinolones).</criteria>
