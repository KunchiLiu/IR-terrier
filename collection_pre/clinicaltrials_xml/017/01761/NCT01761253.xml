	<brief_summary>This study will involve the evaluation of the cost profile of about approximately 241,000 patients (15,000 who are members of the Generations Plus/ Northern Manhattan Health Network AND 226,000 members of a large self insured union trust fund). We will test the hypothesis that as comorbidity scores exceed three-four, patients will have an exponential increase in average yearly cost with a parallel exponential increase in cost variability. We will examine the relationship between comorbidity and health insurance costs and variability in costs among patients enrolled in health plans.</brief_summary>
