	<brief_summary>A randomized controlled, open-label, multi-centre study evaluating if Isolated Hepatic Perfusion (IHP) increases Overall Survival compared with Best Alternative Care (BAC) in patients with isolated liver metastases from uveal melanoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Scandinavian Randomized Controlled Trial of Isolated Hepatic Perfusion for Uveal Melanoma Liver Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults. Despite successful control of the primary tumor, metastatic disease will ultimately develop in approximately 50% of the patients. The liver is the most common site for metastases, and about 50% of the patients will have isolated liver metastases. These metastases are generally refractory to systemic chemotherapy and the median survival for patients with liver metastases is about 6 months. Regardless of treatment, the mortality rate is approximately 90% at 2 years with only about 1% of the patients surviving more than 5 years. Isolated hepatic perfusion (IHP) is a regional treatment that was first performed more than 40 years ago (Aust and Ausman 1960). During IHP, the liver is completely isolated from the systemic circulation, allowing a high concentration of chemotherapy to be perfused through the liver with minimal systemic exposure. In a previous study from our institution, IHP was analysed based on improvements in the procedure and the results showed an improved outcome together with minimized morbidity and mortality over time. A phase II follow-up study confirms that IHP is a promising technique with tolerable morbidity. There are yet no randomized trials comparing overall survival in IHP, but in an attempt to answer this question the investigators did a register study showing a 14 months increased survival when comparing the patients treated with IHP with the longest surviving patients in Sweden during the same time period.</detailed_description>
