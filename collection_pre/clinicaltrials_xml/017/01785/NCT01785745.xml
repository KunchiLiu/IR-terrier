	<brief_summary>It is a single-blind randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of neurocognitive therapeutic exercise in subjects affected by shoulder impingement syndrome in comparison with traditional therapeutic exercise. The traditional exercise protocol contains mainly strengthening exercises, stretching exercises, Codman's pendulum exercises and exercises against elastic band resistance. The neurocognitive exercise protocol contains ten exercises involving specific instruments (e.g., table inclined with a board with five concentric circles, sponges of various texture). Each subject, randomly assigned to either neurocognitive therapeutic exercise (group 1) or traditional therapeutic exercise (group 2), will be submitted to one-hour session for three times a week for five weeks. The outcome measures used will be the Quick-DASH questionnaire, the Constant-Murley shoulder outcome score, the ASES score, a visual analogic scale (VAS) and the assessment will be performed at baseline (T0), at the end of treatment protocol (T1), at 3 months (T2) and 6 months (T3) from the end of treatment.</brief_summary>
