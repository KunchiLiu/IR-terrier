	<brief_summary>This is a non-interventional diagnostic, international, multicenter and non-comparative study of EGFR mutation status in aNSCLC patients (locally advanced and/or metastatic disease) with adenocarcinoma and non-adenocarcinoma histologies. This study will be conducted in Japan and Europe and will assess the concordance of EGFR mutation status derived from tumour samples and blood based circulating free DNA. The data generated will inform the use of less-invasive sample types in diagnostic practice. The study also aims to assess the current status of EGFR mutation testing across Japan and Europe and gaps in currently available data including EGFR mutation frequency in particular populations and demographic subgroups, EGFR mutation frequency in histological subtypes of NSCLC, EGFR mutation test process and methodology, utility of multiple sample types in the assessment of EGFR mutation status, and impact of EGFR mutation status on therapy choice. The data may be used to drive improvements to the EGFR mutation testing process, ensuring that patients have access to testing and are treated appropriately on the basis of the molecular features of their disease.</brief_summary>
