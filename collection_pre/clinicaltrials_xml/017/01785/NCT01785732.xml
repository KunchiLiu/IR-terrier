	<brief_summary>Hypertension is a major risk factor for stroke and cardiovascular mortality. Catheter- based renal denervation causes substantial and sustained blood- pressure reduction in patients with resistant hypertension. The purpose of RENSYMPIS is to study the effects of renal denervation on: 1. Cardiovascular function 2. Metabolic factors 3. Inflammatory and endocrine factors 4. Coagulation 5. Sleep</brief_summary>
