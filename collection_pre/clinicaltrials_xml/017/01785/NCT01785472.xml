	<criteria>Patients with mildtomoderate hypertension, untreated or currently taking antihypertensive therapy. Treated patients (using antihypertensive treatments within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1) must have an msSBP≥150 mmHg and &lt;180 mmHg at the randomization visit (Visit 201) and msSBP≥140 mmHg &lt;180 mmHg at the visit immediately preceding Visit 201 (Visit 102 or 103). Untreated patients (newly diagnosed with essential hypertension or having a history of hypertension but have not been taking any antihypertensive drugs for at least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1) must have an msSBP≥150 mmHg and &lt;180 mmHg at both Visit 1 and Visit 201. Patients must have an absolute difference of ≤15 mmHg in msSBP between Visit 201 and the immediately preceding visit. Patients with severe hypertension (msDBP ≥110 mmHg and or msSBP ≥180 mmHg). History of angioedema, drugrelated or otherwise, as reported by the patient. History or evidence of a secondary form of hypertension, including but not limited to any of the following: renal parenchymal hypertension, renovascular hypertension (unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis), coarctation of the aorta, primary hyperaldosteronism, Cushing's disease, pheochromocytoma, polycystic kidney disease, and druginduced hypertension. Patients who previously entered a LCZ696 study and had been randomized or enrolled into the active drug treatment epoch. Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
