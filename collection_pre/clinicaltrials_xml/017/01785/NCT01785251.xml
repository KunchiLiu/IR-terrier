	<brief_summary>Patients post total hip arthroplasty (THA) remain at high risk of developing Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) during the recovery period following surgery despite the availability of effective pharmacological and mechanical prophylactic methods. The use of calf muscle neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) during the hospitalised recovery period on this patient group may be effective at preventing DVT. However, the haemodynamic effectiveness and comfort characteristics of NMES in post-THA patients immediately following surgery have yet to be established. The main objectives are: 1. To establish if patients in the early post-operative period have tolerance for NMES. 2. To determine if applying NMES to patients immediately post-THA increases venous outflow from the lower limb over resting conditions.</brief_summary>
