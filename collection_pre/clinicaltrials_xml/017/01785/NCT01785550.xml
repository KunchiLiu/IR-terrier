	<brief_summary>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive fatal neurodegenerative disease affecting motor neurons. Early diagnosis is essential for the success of clinical trials and objective biomarkers are needed for monitoring disease progression. Nerve and muscle ultrasound may provide this information. This study will collect pilot data to evaluate the value of muscle and nerve ultrasound to identify and monitor disease progression in ALS.</brief_summary>
