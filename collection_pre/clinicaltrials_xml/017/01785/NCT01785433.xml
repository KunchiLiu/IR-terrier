	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to assess and compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Tiotropium delivered via Breath Actuated Inhaler (BAI) (4.5 mcg/day or 9.0 mcg/day), SPIRIVA®, HandiHaler®, (18 mcg/day) and Respimat® Soft Mist™ Inhaler (SMI) (5.0 mcg/day) following repeat dosing for 7 days in subjects with COPD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>To Compare the Pharmacokinetics of Tiotropium in Subjects With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter study consists of a Screening Visit (3 to 14 days prior to randomization); 4 multiple-dose (7-day) Treatment Periods, each consisting of a 2-night/3-day inpatient stay (Day 6 to Day 8); and a Final Visit. A washout period of at least 21 days will occur between each Treatment Period. The Final/ Early Termination Visit will occur 6-8 days following the last Treatment Period or upon early discharge from the study.</detailed_description>

Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 19881994 (NHANES III) predicted values will be used and adjustments to predicted values will be made for AfricanAmerican subjects. 6. A measured postbronchodilator (ipratropium bromide) FEV1/Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) &lt;0.70 at the Screening Visit (SV) 7. If female, is currently not pregnant, breast feeding, or attempting to become pregnant (for 4 weeks before the Screening Visit (SV) and throughout the duration of the study), and is of Nonchildbearing potential, defined as: ≥1 year postmenopausal or Surgically sterile (tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, salpingectomy, or hysterectomy) or is of Childbearing potential, has a negative serum pregnancy test, and is willing to commit to using a consistent and acceptable method of birth control as defined below for the duration of the study: Systemic contraception used for ≥1 month prior to screening, including birth control pills, transdermal patch, vaginal ring, implants, or injectables or Double barrier methods (condoms, cervical cap, diaphragm, and vaginal contraceptive film with spermicide) or Intrauterine device (IUD) with a low failure rate defined as &lt;1% per year (use of copper IUDs are excluded) or is of Childbearing potential and not sexually active, has a negative serum pregnancy test, and is willing to commit to using a consistent and acceptable method of birth control as defined above for the duration of the study, in the event the subject becomes sexually active 8. Current or exsmoker with ≥10 packyear smoking history 9. Subject is free of any concomitant conditions or treatment that could interfere with study conduct, influence the interpretation of study observations/results, or put the subject at increased risk during the study 10. Able to perform technically acceptable and reproducible spirometry per study guidelines as defined in the protocol and study procedures manual. 11. Able to demonstrate the proper inhalation techniques required for correct use of all delivery devices required in the study 12. Capable of understanding the requirements, risks, and benefits of study participation, and, as judged by the investigator, capable of giving informed consent and being compliant with all study requirements 1. Pregnancy, nursing, or plans to become pregnant or donate gametes (ova or sperm) for in vitro fertilization during the study period or for 30 days following the subject's last study related visit (for eligible subjects only, if applicable). 2. History or current evidence (as determined by medical history, physical examination, clinical laboratory assessments and ECG) of a clinically significant or uncontrolled disease including, but not limited to: cardiovascular (e.g., uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure, known aortic aneurysm, clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia or coronary heart disease), hepatic, renal, haematological, neuropsychological, endocrine (e.g., uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled thyroid disorder, Addison's disease, Cushing's syndrome), gastrointestinal (e.g., poorly controlled peptic ulcer, gastroesophageal reflux disease) or pulmonary (other than COPD such as asthma, sarcoidosis, noncystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia or a diagnosis of alpha 1antitrypsin deficiency). Significant is defined as any disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk through participation, or which could affect the endpoint analysis if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study. 3. History of and/or current diagnosis of asthma 4. History of a lifethreatening COPD exacerbation defined for this protocol as a COPD episode that required intubation and/or was associated with hypercapnia, respiratory arrest or hypoxic seizures 5. Thoracotomy with pulmonary resection 6. Current congestive heart failure, history or current evidence of myocardial infarction (within 3 yrs of the Screening Visit [SV]), or history or current evidence of ischemic heart disease, including a diagnosis on screening ECG. 7. History or current evidence of clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia, including a diagnosis on screening ECG. 8. Presence of angleclosure glaucoma 9. History of malignancy (excluding basal cell carcinoma) within the past 5 years, regardless of the clinical significance or current stability of the disease 10. Known history or any current evidence of renal impairment or urinary retention (e.g., bladder outlet obstruction). This includes abnormal renal function test results at screening. 11. Presence of symptomatic prostatic hyperplasia 12. History of silent infections, including positive tests for human immunodeficiency virus 1, human immunodeficiency virus 2, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, or tuberculosis. 13.

Note: An exacerbation of COPD is defined as any worsening of the subject's baseline COPD symptoms requiring any treatment other than rescue albuterol/salbutamol/ipratropium or the subject's regular maintenance treatment. This includes requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids and/or emergency room visit or hospitalization, a change in subject's regular, or the addition of other medications used to treat COPD symptoms. 15.

Treatment with βadrenergic receptor antagonists (e.g. nonselective βreceptor blocking agents like βblocking antihypertensive products) administered by any route. The single exception is that cardioselective β1adrenergic receptor antagonists (e.g. atenolol, metoprolol, bisoprolol) are permitted provided that subjects have been on a stable dose for at least 1 week prior to the screening visit and subjects are expected to be able to maintain the same dose throughout the study. 23.

Treatment with any known cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 or cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., quinidine, ketoconazole and gestodene) within 30 days prior to the Screening Visit (SV) 25. Initiation or change in dose of inhaled corticosteroids within the last 6 weeks prior to the Screening Visit (SV), and /or not expected to maintain a stable dose of inhaled corticosteroids during the course of the study. 26. Initiation or change in dose of oral or systemic corticosteroids within the last 6 weeks prior to the Screening Visit (SV) , unable to maintain a stable dose of oral or systemic corticosteroids during the course of the study, or a dose of oral or systemic corticosteroids in excess of the equivalent of 10 mg of prednisone per day. [Note that oral steroid bursts completed 6 weeks or more prior to screening are acceptable.] 27. Exposure to any investigational drug within 30 days or six halflives (whichever is greater) prior to the Screening Visit (SV) 28.
