	<brief_summary>The propose of the study is to validate in Mexico a spanish translation of the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM) Version III, in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). Internal consistency, reproducibility and reliability will be addressed scoring the results of the translated version at two time frames and also of the same patients by different examiners (physicians, nurses and technicians).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation of a Translation Into Spanish (Mexico) of the Spinal Cord Independence Measure III</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The worldwide estimated annual incidence of SCI has a broad spectrum, ranging from 236 to 1009 cases per million of people. In Mexico there is an estimate of 18.1 cases per million people, affecting primary men in their productive age (25-34 years old). Most of the patients have disabilities after the injury, and become dependent of their families or professional care providers. The cornerstone treatment in the long therm is rehabilitation and the main goal is to achieve patient independence. Over the last two decades many disability measure instruments have been developed, like the Functional Interdisciplinary Measure (FIM). This scale though it is very useful for patients' general outcome, it does not grade patients' independence entirely. In 1997, Dr. Amiram Catz developed the first version of the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM). Since its first version, it showed to be a very powerful tool to assess patients' independence. Recently, the SCIM-III has been validated in a multicenter study, showing validity, reliability and internal consistency. The aim of this study is to perform a translate and trans-cultural adaptation of the SCIM-III into Spanish and to perform also its validation in Mexican population.</detailed_description>
