The investigators have in a pilot study investigated if removal of abdominal fat (visceral) in addition to weight loss has additional beneficial effects on the metabolic profile and weight loss. This study aims to further investigate if removal of abdominal fat (major omentum) leads to beneficial metabolic effects.</brief_summary>
