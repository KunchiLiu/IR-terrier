	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate safety and efficacy of intravenously injected 0.4% 13-C-Methacetin solution for the determination of liver function with the LiMAx-test on patients with partial liver resection. The LiMAx-test is compared with an untreated control group and post-surgical management of both groups is investigated.</brief_summary>
