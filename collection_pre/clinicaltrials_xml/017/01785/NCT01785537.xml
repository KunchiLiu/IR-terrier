	<brief_summary>The main aim of this multicentric 5-year follow-up study is to evaluate for the first time the long-term efficacy and safety (in terms of smoking-related serious diseases requiring hospitalization) of e-cigarette smoking, comparing its health effects with those of traditional cigarette smoking and mixed electronic and traditional cigarette smoking. The study will also permit to evaluate, over a 5-year follow-up, the self-reported quality of life, and the reported adverse events according to current and past smoking habit. Finally, the study will also explore the long-term adherence to e-cigarette smoking and its efficacy of e-cigarettes in reducing and/or quitting traditional cigarette smoking.</brief_summary>
