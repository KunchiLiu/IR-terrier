	<brief_title>Couple-Based Intervention for Patients With Head and Neck Cancer and Their Partners</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This intervention will adapt a well-validated cognitive-behavioral therapeutic approach in a four-session intervention to teach patients and partners specific couple-based cancer-focused support skills. In addition, in order to gather information on outcome variables, couples will complete three assessments during the course of treatment (pre-treatment, following treatment, and six month follow-up). These assessments will include questionnaire measures as well as couple communication whereby couples will participate in two videotaped conversations whereby one partner of the couple discusses a concern and the other member of the couple provides support. We also will implement a "daily diary" assessment whereby day-to-day psychological and physical symptoms experienced by the patient and partner will be assessed and daily effects of the intervention can be analyzed. Patients and partners will participate in the daily diary portion of the study following the post-assessment. They will be emailed an electronic link to a brief questionnaire daily for 7 days. The items in this daily assessment will comprise questions that are part of the general assessment measures such as dyadic coping, spousal support, and relationship satisfaction. The patient will also complete questions about pain and fatigue.</detailed_description>
