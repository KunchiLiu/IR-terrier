	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IV administration of VX15/2503 in patients with multiple sclerosis. The escalation part of the study will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the Maximum Administered Dose if no MTD is found.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>VX15/2503-N-101 is a single ascending dose-escalation, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IV-administered VX15/2503 in patients with multiple sclerosis. This will be accomplished by using a dose escalation procedure starting at a low dose of VX15/2503 and will continue based on predefined parameters until the maximum tolerated dose is identified. Patients will be randomized at a 4:1 ratio to receive VX15/2503 to placebo. The patients and the study team will be blinded to the treatment that each patient receives. The study drug, VX15/2503, is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the semaphorin 4D (SEMA4D; CD100) antigen. Experimental evidence suggest that antibody neutralization of SEMA4D may represent a new therapeutic strategy for treating multiple sclerosis.</detailed_description>
