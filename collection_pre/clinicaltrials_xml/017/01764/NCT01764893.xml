	<brief_summary>The null hypothesis for this study is that the combination of solifenacin and Percutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation (PTNS) is not different from PTNS alone. However the investigators anticipate a 20% improvement in patients receiving combination therapy as measured by the OAB-q (Overactive Bladder questionnaire) scores.</brief_summary>
