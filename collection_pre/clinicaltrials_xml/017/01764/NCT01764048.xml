	<brief_summary>Cesarean deliveries are prevalent. Unlike other operations, quick recovery is required for the mother to nurture the newborn child and establishing an appropriate mother-child bonding. Therefore, effective pain management is crucial. In this study we would like to compare between two pain relievers' administration protocols: (1) pain relievers' administration in fix protocol (type of medications, dose and intervals) or (2) pain relievers' administration following demand (the same type and doses, however, medications will be given only following patient's request). The primary outcome will be patient satisfaction, pain control and the necessity of additional medications (rescue doses). The protocols will be used for the first 48 hours following surgery.</brief_summary>
