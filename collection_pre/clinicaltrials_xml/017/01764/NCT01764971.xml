	<brief_summary>Intracranial hemorrhage despite being rare, several chronic ITP patients experience moderate to severe behavioral problems including learning difficulties, memory affection .These changes could be due to the presence of minute capillary dysfunction</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cerebral Dysfunction in Chronic ITPwith High Risk of Serious Bleeding Excluding Intracranial Hemorrhage.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- First identify the presence of cognitive, behavioral and/or minimal neurological deficit in patients with chronic ITP and correlate these changes with radiological evidence of minimal CNS bleeding. - Second investigate the correlation between these behavioral and/or minimal neurological deficits and duration, site and severity of bleeding (a total of 200 patient of persistently low platelet count &lt; 20x 10 9 for at least more than one month duration). - The aim is to assess the behavioral changes in chronic ITP patients, and to assess the possible relation of such changes to duration and recurrence of very low platelet count as well as pattern of bleeding excluding frank intracranial hemorrhage.</detailed_description>
