	<brief_summary>Laboratory studies suggest that the study drug may stop cancer cells from growing by affecting an interaction between proteins in the cells referred to as cAMP-response element-binding protein and ß-catenin. The purpose of this research study is to determine the highest safe dose of study drug that may be used when it is given together with a chemotherapy drug to patients with cancer of the pancreas.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of PRI-724 Plus Gemcitabine in Subjects With Advanced or Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRI-724 is a small molecule antagonist that binds to the co-activator CBP thereby specifically inhibiting the subset of Wnt/β-catenin-driven genes that are up-regulated in cancer cells. PRI-724 is being developed as a potential antineoplastic agent. Purpose: To determine the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of sequential escalating doses per cohort of PRI-724 administered in combination with gemcitabine to patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas that is locally advanced, metastatic, or otherwise inoperable, who are candidates for second-line therapy after failing first-line therapy with FOLFIRINOX (i.e., folinic acid [leucovorin], fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin) - PRI-724: 320, 640, 905 mg/m2/day, continuous intravenous (CIV) infusion over 24 h, daily × 7 days, 1 week on with 1 week recovery × 2 (4 weeks equals 1 cycle) - Gemcitabine: 1000 mg/m2 IV over 30 minutes; 3 weeks on with 1 week recovery (4 weeks equals 1 cycle) Patients with documented, measurable or evaluable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas that is locally advanced, metastatic, or otherwise inoperable, who are candidates for second-line therapy after failing first-line therapy with FOLFIRINOX, will be entered into this phase 1b, multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation per cohort study. The trial is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, DLT(s), and MTD of escalating doses of PRI-724, a CBP/ β- catenin inhibitor, when administered in combination with a standard dose of gemcitabine. Correlative studies include characterization of the PK profiles of PRI-724 and gemcitabine, evaluation of the utility of potential PD markers of PRI-724 activity, as well as preliminary assessment of the antineoplastic activity of PRI-724 plus gemcitabine in this patient population.</detailed_description>
