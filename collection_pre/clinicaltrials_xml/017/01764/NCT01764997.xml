	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To demonstrate the treatment effect of sarilumab and methotrexate (MTX) compared to etanercept and methotrexate (MTX) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and an inadequate response to adalimumab and methotrexate by evaluation of the Disease Activity Score for 28 joints (DAS28). Secondary Objectives: To assess the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients taking sarilumab in combination with methotrexate (MTX). To assess the quality of life of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) taking sarilumab in combination with methotrexate (MTX). To assess the safety and tolerability of sarilumab in combination with methotrexate (MTX) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) &gt;/= 3 months duration. Continuous treatment of methotrexate (MTX) 10 25 mg/week (or per local labeling requirements if the dose range differs) for at least 12 weeks before screening visit and on a stable dose for 8 weeks before screening visit. Active disease defined as: at least 6/66 swollen and 8/68 tender joints and high sensitivity Creactive protein &gt; 10 mg/L. Exclusion criteria: Age &lt; 18 years. Use of parenteral corticosteroids or intraarticular corticosteroids within 4 weeks of the screening visit. Use of oral corticosteroids in a dose higher than prednisone 10 mg or equivalent per day, or a change in dosage within 4 weeks of the screening visit. Prior treatment with a TNF (tumor necrosis factor)alpha inhibitor, or other biological disease modifying antirheumatoid drug (DMARD) or Janus Kinase inhibitor. New treatment with or doseadjustment of ongoing nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or cyclooxygenase2 inhibitors (COX2 inhibitors within 4 weeks of the screening visit. Treatment with traditional oral diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) /immunosuppressive agents other than MTX within 4 weeks or 12 weeks before the screening visit, depending on DMARD.
