	<brief_summary>Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent among those with substance use disorders, but the majority of addictions treatment centers provide little to no evidence-based treatment for anxiety disorders. Furthermore, tension reduction models suggest that treating anxiety should also improve substance use outcomes. This study is aimed at improving symptoms for people who have substance use and anxiety problems. The study is comparing regular Intensive Outpatient treatment for addiction to Intensive Outpatient treatment for addiction plus treatment for anxiety disorders. Clinicians at a community addictions clinic will participate by receiving training in delivering cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders and will deliver the treatment to the patient participants. They will also complete some questionnaires. Patient participants will be asked to complete a baseline assessment. Those who are eligible will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups. Those who are assigned to addiction treatment as usual will continue their regular care at the Matrix Institute. Participants who are assigned to also receive the anxiety treatment will be asked to participate in 6, 90-min treatment sessions and an orientation session. All participants will be asked to complete post-treatment and follow-up assessments. The assessments should take approximately 1 hour, and the follow-up assessment will be completed 6 months after treatment is over. It is hypothesized that those who get the additional anxiety disorder treatment will show greater improvement in anxiety and substance use outcomes than those who get Intensive Outpatient Program without the anxiety disorder treatment.</brief_summary>
