	<brief_title>Stress Reduction in Improving Quality of Life in Patients With Recurrent Gynecologic or Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To refine the intervention. II. Test the acceptability, feasibility, and clinical appropriateness of the intervention. III. To provide a preliminary test of its efficacy. OUTLINE: Patients participate in a multi-component intervention based on cognitive and behavioral principles comprising mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), an intervention to promote hopefulness, and a problem solving approach which navigates around obstacles or generates alternatives when goals become blocked. Additional topics may be covered as indicated by clinical need and patients goals. Biobehavioral components include addressing social and disease-specific quality of life, and pain education. Intensive treatment sessions continue weekly for 16 weeks followed by 2 biweekly and 2 monthly maintenance sessions. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 weeks.</detailed_description>
