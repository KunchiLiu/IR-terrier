	<brief_summary>The goal of the study is to use graph theory to examine how the organization of the functional brain network may be altered by the administration of methylphenidate. This effect is to be compared between methylphenidate intake and placebo intake, as well as between healthy adult males and adult males with a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.</brief_summary>
