	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to provide proof-of-concept that directional stimulation, in an intraoperative setting, is perceivable in a subject and is different from omnidirectional stimulation. The tests will be performed using a dedicated DBS lead connected to external neurostimulator.</brief_summary>
