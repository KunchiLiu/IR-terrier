	<brief_summary>ImmuKnow detects cell-mediated immunity in solid-organ transplant recipients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy. Increasing ImmuKnow values indicate a decrease of immunosuppression and decreasing ImmuKnow values suggest an increase of immunosuppression. The test measures the amount of ATP produced in CD4+ lymphocytes as a biomarker of lymphocyte activation. This study uses the ImmuKnow assay to proactively adjust immunosuppressive therapy in adult liver transplant recipients to reduce the risk of adverse events</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial of ImmuKnow in Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We performed a randomized prospective interventional trial where the Interventional group had immunosuppression modified according to ImmuKnow values. Immunosuppression was decreased by 25% if ImmuKnow values were less than 130 ng/mL ATP. Similarly, immunosuppression was increased by 25% if ImmuKnow values were greater than 450 ng/mL ATP. Immunosuppression of the Control group was managed by the Standard of Care at our institution. ImmuKnow was performed before liver transplant, after surgery and at each clinic visit with the approximate schedule: day 1; weekly, weeks 1-4; week 6; week 8; monthly, months 3-6; and months 9 and 12. ImmuKnow testing was repeated within 7 days of a suspected/confirmed rejection or infection and again within 1 week of resolution.</detailed_description>
