	<brief_summary>The purpose of this Phase 3b study is to assess the effects of combination therapy with naltrexone SR/bupropion SR (NB) used in conjunction with a comprehensive lifestyle intervention (CLI) and in a manner consistent with its intended use after marketing approval, on body weight and cardiovascular risk factors compared to the effects of Usual Care in subjects who are overweight with dyslipidemia and/or controlled hypertension or obese. Subjects in the NB and CLI group are required to undergo an evaluation to continue treatment at Week 16. Subjects are to be discontinued from full participation if they do not lose at least 5% of their body weight relative to baseline and/or are experiencing sustained increases in blood pressure (systolic or diastolic) of ≥10 mmHg above baseline. At Week 26, subjects originally assigned to Usual Care switch to treatment with NB and CLI, and subjects assigned to NB and CLI continue treatment for the duration of the study (78-weeks treatment period).</brief_summary>
