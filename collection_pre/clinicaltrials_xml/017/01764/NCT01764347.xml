	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) fusion image-guided prostate biopsy following radical prostatectomy in patients with prostate cancer. Diagnostic procedures, such as MRI-TRUS fusion image-guided prostate biopsy may help find and diagnose prostate cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Transrectal Ultrasound Fusion Image-Guided Prostate Biopsy Following Radical Prostatectomy in Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate accuracy of the new image-guided targeted needle biopsy using the ex-vivo human prostate as obtained from fresh radical prostatectomy specimens. OUTLINE: Patients undergo robotic radical prostatectomy, followed by 3 MRI-TRUS fusion image-guided prostate biopsies.</detailed_description>
