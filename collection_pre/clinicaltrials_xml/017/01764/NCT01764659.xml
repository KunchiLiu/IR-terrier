	<brief_title>4D-CT for Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma in Radiotherapy Simulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Compared with current clinical practice, the individually optimized CE 4D-CT can potentially provide much improved tumor-to-parenchyma conspicuity of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This will help the radiation oncologists or radiologists to contour the tumor with higher precision and confidence, and compute the tumor volume and tumor motion more accurately.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients 18 years old or older 2. Patients with PDA who have not had surgical removal of their tumor and who are planned for treatment with radiotherapy in the Radiation Oncology Department at the University of Maryland. 3. Patients who have signed the contrast consent form and have been recommended by physicians to have contrastenhanced CT scans. 4. Patients who have signed the consent form for this study 1. Pregnant or breastfeeding women. 2. Patients with severely decreased renal function1921. 3. Patients with known severe allergic reactions to contrast. 4. Patients who have difficulty lying flat on their back for extended periods of time. 5. Patients with breaths per minute (BPM) rate less than 10, due to the limitation of 4DCT image reconstruction software.</criteria>
