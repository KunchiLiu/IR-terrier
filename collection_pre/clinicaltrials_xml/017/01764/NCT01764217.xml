	<brief_summary>Observational study based on the routine clinical treatment and diagnostic course, to correlate imaging features with outcome objectives. Outcome will evaluated as clinical response to the standard treatment and as recurrence and survival in the follow up. The study hypothesis is that data extracted form FDG-PETCT used in the routine clinical practice can predict outcomes following standard treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prediction of Clinical Response and Outcome in Uterine Cervix Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will prospectively collect patients undergoing to the standard diagnostic and treatment protocol in Maastro Clinic. Any difference in the normal procedure will be adopted. The aim is to extrapolate form the PET images some features of the metabolic tumor activity to associate with different outcomes and tumor behaviours.</detailed_description>
