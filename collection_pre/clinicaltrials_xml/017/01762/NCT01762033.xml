	<brief_summary>This Phase 2a study will investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ASONEP™ (sonepcizumab/LT1009) when administered intravenously once a week, every 4 weeks (or cycle), to subjects with refractory renal cell carcinoma (RCC) until the disease progresses. Subjects who have failed 3 prior treatments for RCC including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and/or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors or who have tumors that cannot be surgically removed will be eligible for screening.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Study of ASONEP™ to Treat Unresectable and Refractory Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>LT1009-Onc-002 is a Phase 2a open-label, multi-center study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ASONEP (sonepcizumab/LT1009) monotherapy in subjects with advanced, unresectable, refractory RCC who have previously failed up to 3 therapies, including VEGF and/or mTOR inhibitors. Two cohorts will be enrolled for a total of up to 39 subjects. Subjects will receive an intravenous (IV) infusion of ASONEP™ over 90 minutes at 24 mg/kg once a week and progression-free survival (PFS) will be assessed after 8 weeks of treatment. Cohort 1 will enroll approximately 22 subjects. A second cohort of up to 17 subjects will be enrolled if at least 12 out of 22 subjects from Cohort 1 demonstrated PFS at 8 weeks. Weekly dosing will take place from the date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first.</detailed_description>
