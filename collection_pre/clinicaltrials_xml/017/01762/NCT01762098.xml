	<brief_summary>Chronic endometritis is a persistent inflammation of the endometrium. Chronic endometritis is asymptomatic or little symptomatic. Sometimes, patient with chronic endometritis can have genital bleeding, pelvic chronic pain, pain during sexual relations, persistent vaginal white loosing. The hysteroscopy can detect the presence or absence of chronic endometritis. Some studies showed that the endometritis could have an impact on the embryo implantation and could explain recurrent miscarriages or repeated embryo implantation failures. The goal of this study is to evaluate the frequency of the chronic endometritis in patients with recurrent miscarriages or repeated embryo implantation failures</brief_summary>
