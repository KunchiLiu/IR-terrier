	<detailed_description>This study will be a single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel design study with an open label positive-control moxifloxacin arm to evaluate the effect of supratherapeutic dose of oritavancin on the QT and QTc intervals.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Able to give written informed consent before initiation of any study related procedures and willing to comply with all required study procedures. 2. Healthy, male and female between 18 and 60 years old, BMI between 18 kg/m2 and 30 kg/m2 3. In good health based upon results of medical history, physical examination, no clinically significant 12lead ECG results, and laboratory test results. 4. Serum magnesium and potassium levels within the normal range at screening. 5. Agree to abstain from alcohol, caffeine, and xanthinecontaining products, all kind of energy drinks and the consumption of grapefruit juice and orange juice from 48 hours before study drug administration until completion of the followup visit. 1. History of immunerelated hypersensitivity reaction to glycopeptides (such as vancomycin, televancin, daptomycin, or teicoplanin) or any of their excipients. Note: patients who have had histaminelike infusion reactions to a glycopeptide are not excluded 2. A resting pulse rate &lt; 50 beats per minute (bpm) or &gt; 100 bpm 3. Systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &lt; 50 mmHg 4. A QTcF &gt;450 msec (males) or &gt; 470 msec (females) 5. Respiratory difficulties, or a history of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 6. Use of any prescription drug or overthecounter (OTC) medications or herbal preparations within 14 days or 5times the elimination halflife (whichever is longer) prior to starting the study (except for acetaminophen; birth control pills; implantable or injectable birth control; and estrogen, testosterone, and/or progesterone replacement in menopausal women) 7. Unwilling to abstain from smoking for the duration of the study. 8. Any clinicallysignificant, underlying abnormalities in rhythm, conduction, or morphology of the resting ECG that may interfere with the interpretation of QTc interval changes 9. Positive result for the urine or serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test administered at screening (females with child bearing potential) 10. A past medical history of clinically significant ECG abnormalities or a family history (grandparents, parents, or siblings) of either a long or a short QT syndrome 11. Personal history of unexplained syncope. 12. Women who are pregnant or nursing, or who are of childbearing potential and unwilling to use at least 2 acceptable methods of birth control (eg, prescription oral contraceptives, contraceptive injections, contraceptive patch, intrauterine device, barrier method(s) or male partner sterilization). Women â‰¥2 years postmenopausal or surgically sterile are exempt from this exclusion 13. A history of hypersensitivity to moxifloxacin or any member of the quinolone class of antimicrobial agents 14. Positive virology screen for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B or C virus (HBV or HCV, respectively) 15. Participated in other clinical research studies involving the evaluation of other investigational drugs or devices within 30 days of enrollment 16. Any condition, which in the opinion of the investigator would put the subject at increased risk from participating in the study.</criteria>
