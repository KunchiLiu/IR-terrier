	<brief_summary>Currently there are few options for skin antisepsis, commercially antiseptic triclosan is mainly used. To have more options, this study is necessary, where investigators will determine the residual effect of 2% chlorhexidine in 70% isopropyl alcohol and 1% triclosan in 70% isopropyl alcohol and choose the one with the best characteristics for skin antisepsis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Residual Effect of Chlorhexidine-alcohol Compared to Triclosan-alcohol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>2% chlorhexidine has been used as an antiseptic for invasive procedures, such as the skin preparation for surgery or insertion of intravascular catheters, thereby decreasing the incidence of infections. The preparation of the skin with antiseptics, helps mechanically clean the surface of the skin to be subjected to surgical intervention, removing fat, sweat, dead cells and kill bacteria that are in the skin. It has been shown that 2% chlorhexidine in solution with 70% isopropyl alcohol has greater activity than chlorhexidine in aqueous solution. The constant use of triclosan causes resistance of some microorganisms on some antibiotics.It has been shown that 0.5% of triclosan in 60% alcohol isopropyl chlorhexidine is more effective than alcohol. The aim of the study is to know if 2% chlorhexidine has more residual effect than triclosan 1%, both antiseptic diluted in 70% isopropyl alcohol.</detailed_description>
