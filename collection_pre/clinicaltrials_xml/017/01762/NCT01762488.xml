	<brief_summary>The purpose of this double-blind, randomized and sham controlled study is to investigate the blood pressure lowering effect of renal denervation by catheter based ablation in the renal arteries in patients with milder forms of treatment resistant hypertension. The effect on blood pressure will be evaluated by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurements at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of follow up. Secondary endpoint evaluation comprises hemodynamic assessment by applanation tonometry and the cold pressor response.</brief_summary>
