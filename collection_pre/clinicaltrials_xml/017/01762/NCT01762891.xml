	<brief_summary>Coumadin drug-drug interactions (DDI) are frequent. Patients in permanent use of coumadin are advised to avoid traditional nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs to avoid risk of bleeding. New selctive cyclooxygesase 2 inhibitors arisen as potential option for treating pain and inflamation in these patients once interactions with coumadin are supposed to be lower. The CI(R)CA study was made to evaluate in a prospective fashion the occurrence of DDI with new cyclooxygenase antiinflammatory drugs and coumadin when compared to acetaminophen and placebo.</brief_summary>
