	<brief_summary>Thirteen hospitals in China will participate in the study, which aims to provide data on serum bilirubin levels in the first 168 hr after birth in term and late-preterm neonates, and estimate the incidence of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and the underlying causes. We hypothesize that the study can be value in identifying and implementing strategies for risk reduction.</brief_summary>
