	<brief_title>Glucocorticoid Induced Whole Body Catabolisme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Long-term treatment with glucocorticoid induces a general state of catabolism and increases insulin resistance. The underlying mechanisms are insufficiently characterized, however glucocorticoid induced changes of Growth Hormone (GH) and the Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) appear to be of outmost importance. We wish to investigate the mechanism behind glucocorticoid induced catabolism and insulin resistance. More specific we wish to investigate: - Whether glucocorticoid induces IGF-I inhibiting substances in serum or interstitial fluid that block the ability of IGF-I to phosphorylate its receptor in vitro - Whether glucocorticoid inhibits intracellular IGF-I and insulin signaling in vitro and in vivo - The mechanisms by which growth hormone counteracts the CG-mediated inhibition of IGF-I action</detailed_description>
