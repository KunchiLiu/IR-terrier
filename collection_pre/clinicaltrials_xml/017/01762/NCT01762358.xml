	<brief_title>Khalifa Effectiveness Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mohamed Khalifa, a therapist from Hallein (Austria), has been working since 30 years with a self-developed manual technique for treating injuries of the musculoskeletal system especially of the knee by applying high pressure to the skin in the area of the injury. This pressure is applied in various amplitudes and frequencies. International top athletes from various disciplines reported a rapid pain relief, and even full recovery, immediately after his one hour treatment. Prior to the investigators' study, the investigators evaluated one pilot patient with a complete ACL rupture after a soccer game with Magnet-Resonance-Imaging (MRI) and clinical tests. This patient was physically immobile and reported pain especially when stretching and bending the knee. After one hour of treatment from Khalifa the signs of the injury like the stretching / bending inhibition and pain were gone immediately. Three months after the treatment, an evaluation of the knee with MRI showed an end-to-end continuous ACL with homogeneous signal and the clinical tests confirmed the stability of the knee. With this study the investigators will evaluate the possibility of influencing the healing of a completely ruptured ACL of the knee by one single special local pressure treatment to the skin for 60 min.</detailed_description>
