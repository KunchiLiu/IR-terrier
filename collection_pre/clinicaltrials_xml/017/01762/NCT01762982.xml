	<brief_title>Patch Test of Benzalkonium Chloride Disinfectant Spray</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Benzalkonium chloride is recognized as safe and effective for short term use as first aid antiseptic drug products. In this study, benzalkonium chloride disinfectant spray will be compared to a positive control, and two negative control for irritancy potential on normal skin according to Chinese Patch Test Guideline (China Health Authority 2002). The skin irritation assessment will characterize the test products individually in terms of symptomatology using a 5-point categorical scale ranging from 0 (no visible reaction) to 4 (Erythema,edemaË› extreme blistering).</detailed_description>
