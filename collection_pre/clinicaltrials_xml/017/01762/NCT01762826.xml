	<brief_title>Myo-inositol, D-chiro-inositol, and D-chiro/Myo-inositol in Gestational Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators compared outcomes from metabolic and obstetric point of view in GDM pregnant non-obese patient with different stereoisomears of inositol supply. Dietary control and placebo or inositol steroisomears were administered starting at the enrolling time (first fasting oral glucose above 92 mg%; usually before 20 weeks gestations') till the delivery and/or pregnancy end/termination. Oral glucose tolerance test results at 24-28 weeks' gestation was evaluated (as glucose values and oGTT screening). Fetal growth, delivery data, obstetric outcomes and necessity of insulin therapy were taken into account.</detailed_description>
