	<brief_summary>The main clinical study will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, long term study involving a 100 week treatment period. The purpose of this study is to test for superiority of treatment with belimumab 10 mg/kg plus supportive therapy compared to placebo plus supportive therapy in idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN). The purpose of this study is also to investigate the effect of initiating earlier treatment with belimumab compared to delayed treatment with current immunosuppressive treatment regimens. The study will also determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of belimumab and further explore the mechanism of action of Belimumab as well as effects on quality of life. All subjects (on either active treatment or placebo) will receive background supportive therapy throughout the main clinical study, which includes angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) unless contraindicated and may include statins, diuretics, dietary salt restriction but excludes immunosuppressants (except low dose corticosteroids). Screening will be done within 5 to 2 weeks before the first scheduled dose of study treatment. A total of 94 evaluable subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio such that 47 subjects receive intravenous belimumab 10 mg/kg and 47 receive intravenous placebo. Subjects will be dosed on Days 0, 14, 28 and then every 4 weeks through to, and including, Week 100, resulting in a total of 27 doses (giving 104 weeks of drug exposure). The dosing frequency will be adjusted to every 2 weeks if the subject's proteinuria as assessed by urinary protein creatinine ratio (PCR) is greater than 1000mg/mmol (greater than 10 g/24 h), to compensate for loss of belimumab in the urine. Subjects who are withdrawn from study treatment at any time during the study, eg for rescue therapy, will participate in follow-up visits every 12 weeks up to week 104. A subject will be regarded as having completed the main clinical study if they complete all phases of the main clinical study (screening, treatment period, 4 week and 16 week post last dose short term safety follow-up). Subjects who complete the main clinical study will therefore participate in the main clinical study for approximately 28 months. After the main clinical study, there will be a 5 year (long term) follow-up phase to assess long term outcomes.</brief_summary>

Histological diagnosis: Have clinical diagnosis of IMN, as verified by biopsy (either by light microscope with immunofluorescence, or by electron microscope) in the last 3 years (biopsy results [and slides where possible] should be available for independent evaluation). For patients with relapsed disease, a biopsy should be available within the preceding 7 years. Proteinuria: Have clinically active disease (nephrotic range proteinuria) for at least 3 months prior to screening and no improvement (&lt;30% reduction), despite supportive therapy (which must include maximal tolerated doses of ACE inhibitor or ARB unless contraindicated, and may include statins, diuretics, dietary salt restriction). During screening proteinuria must be &gt;400 mg/mmol by uPCR (or &gt;4.0 g per 24 hrs) as measured from a 24 hrs urine collection and/or spot urine sample (early morning where possible) on 2 occasions at least 7 days apart. Proteinuria in patients with relapsed disease: Patients who previously achieved proteinuria &lt;2 g per 24h for at least 6 months and have subsequently relapsed with proteinuria levels as documented above, may be eligible providing recurrence has been within the previous 3 years and patient is known to be antiPLA2R positive. Female Subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or nursing; is nonchildbearing potential. Females of childbearing potential must agree to use one of the approved contraception methods for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimise the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until 16 weeks after the last dose. French subjects: In France, a subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if either affiliated to or a beneficiary of a social security category. Inclusion Criteria for Long Term Followup: Subjects who have signed informed consent for the Long Term Followup and have completed 2 years study treatment and the 16 week followup visit, or who have withdrawn early from study treatment but completed the Week 104 Withdrawn visit.
