	<brief_summary>Body contouring surgery has a higher potential for postoperative pain and wound healing complications. The purpose of this study is to determine if pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) devices can reduce the pain and complications associated with this type of surgery. Pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) devices have been shown to be effective treatments to decrease healing time in nonunion fractures and pressure ulcers, and to reduce pain in whiplash injuries, persistent neck pain, and chronic lower back pain. These devices have been FDA approved for treatment of pain and edema (510(k) number: K070541). More recently, PEMF devices have been shown to decrease postoperative pain and narcotic use in breast augmentation patients. This study seeks to determine if PEMF will also cause similar effects in the more complex procedures performed on body contouring patients. The specific aims of this study are: 1. Evaluate if adjunct PEMF therapy will accelerate the rate of postoperative pain reduction in abdominal body contouring patients. 2. Evaluate if adjunct PEMF therapy will decrease the postoperative use of narcotic pain relievers in abdominal body contouring patients. PEMF devices have been shown to be effective in reduction of pain and pain medication use in breast augmentation patients. No literature has shown if PEMF is an effective adjunct to decrease pain or pain medication use in the abdominal body contouring patient. A decrease in pain would result in a better experience for patients and a reduction in pain medication may decrease complications associated with these medications. The PEMF therapy device being used in this study is a non-significant risk device because it is noninvasive and does not present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.</brief_summary>
