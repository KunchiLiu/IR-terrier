	<criteria>Age 21 years or older with type 1 diabetes for at least one year Stimulated Cpeptide &lt; 0.1 nmol/L at 90 minutes after liquid mixed meal by the DCCT protocol Diabetes managed using an insulin infusion pump and rapid or veryrapidacting insulins including insulin aspart (NovoLog), insulin lispro (Humalog), and insulin glulisine (Apidra) for at least three months prior to enrollment Otherwise healthy (mild chronic disease such as asthma, hypertension, and depression will be allowed if well controlled) Unable to provide informed consent Unable to comply with study procedures Total daily dose (TDD) of insulin that is &gt; 1.5 U/kg Pregnancy (positive urine HCG), breast feeding, plan to become pregnant in the immediate future, or sexually active without use of contraception. Hypoglycemia unawareness (selfreported lack of hypoglycemia symptoms when BG is &lt; 50 mg/dl) End stage renal disease on dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis). Any known history of coronary artery disease (CAD) Abnormal EKG suggestive of coronary artery disease or increased risk of malignant arrhythmia Congestive heart failure (established history of CHF, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or orthopnea). History of TIA or stroke. History of pheochromocytoma. Fractionated metanephrines will be tested in patients with history increasing the risk for a catecholamine secreting tumor Untreated or inadequately treated mental illness Current alcohol abuse or substance abuse Electrically powered implants (e.g. cochlear implants, neurostimulators) that might be susceptible to RF interference. Use noninsulin, injectable antidiabetic medications or oral antidiabetic medications History of adverse reaction to glucagon (including allergy) besides nausea and vomiting Unwilling or unable to completely avoid acetaminophen ALT &gt; 3fold upper limit of normal Albumin &lt; 3 g/dl Body mass index less than18 or greater than 35</criteria>
