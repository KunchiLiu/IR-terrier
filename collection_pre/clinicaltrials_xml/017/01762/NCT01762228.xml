	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate with videofluoroscopy (radiologic method to study the deglutitive physiology) the effect on the deglutition of two therapeutic treatments with the duration of 2 weeks, based on the increase of the sensorial stimuli in older patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia: 1. Stimulation of Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) oropharynx chanels using a natural agonist administrated in the alimentary bolus. 2. Stimulation of the sensorial neurons of the pharynx and larynx using transcutaneous electrical stimuli. Moreover, with an electroencephalographic study we will assess the effect of both treatments in the cortical neuroplasticity.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study will evaluate with videofluoroscopy (radiologic method to study the deglutitive physiology) the effect on the deglutition of two therapeutic treatments with the duration of 2 weeks, based on the increase of the sensorial stimuli in older patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia: 1. Stimulation of Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) oropharynx chanels using a natural agonist administrated in the alimentary bolus. 2. Stimulation of the sensorial neurons of the pharynx and larynx using transcutaneous electrical stimuli. The study will last 5 weeks per patient. At the beginning of the study, patients will receive a videofluoroscopic evaluation and an electroencephalography (evoked potentials) to asses dysphagia and cortical activity of deglutition. After that the first day of the third week they will begin the treatment (group a or b) during 2 weeks. Finally in the fifth week an evaluation of dysphagia will be performed the same way as in week 1 to asses the effects of the treatments.</detailed_description>
