	<brief_summary>The primary hypothesis is that Khalifa's therapy has different acute effects in various organ systems i.e. proprioceptive, neuro-muscular, endogenous dopamine system, etc. These effects might indicate the pathway of the therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Khalifa Acute Effects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According to our previous study that evaluated the efficacy of Khalifa's therapy the investigators have seen that the therapy has acute effects which resulted in better knee function and later even in better healing of the ACL injury. This study should clear exactly which effects and pathways are involved in the therapy from multiple (interdisciplinary) point of views. Therefore the investigators will measure parameters that might be associated with this special technique directly before and after the therapy.</detailed_description>
