	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the effects of a computerized, self-directed Motivational Enhancement Therapy program for adolescent substance use (iMET), in comparison to clinician-delivered MET and Treatment As Usual (TAU), on treatment engagement and substance use. The investigators hypothesize that both iMET and MET will be more effective than TAU in engaging/retaining patients in treatment and in reducing substance use during a 12-month follow-up period. The investigators also hypothesize that Self-directed iMET will be as effective as the clinician-guided MET in increasing treatment engagement and abstinence during the 12-months follow-up period.</brief_summary>
