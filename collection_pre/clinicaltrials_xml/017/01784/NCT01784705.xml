	<brief_summary>Bright light therapy (BLT) has been found to be effective in treatment of seasonal affective disorder (SAD). The mechanism of action of conventional BLT in the treatment of SAD is under debate. Recently, transcranial bright light (TBL) via ear canals has been proved to modulate the neural networks of the human brain and improve cognitive performance in healthy subjects. Moreover, TBL has been found to alleviate symptoms of SAD in open trial. In this case the investigators will study the effect of transcranial bright light treatment via ear canals on depressive and anxiety symptoms in patients suffering from SAD in randomized controlled double-blind study design.</brief_summary>
