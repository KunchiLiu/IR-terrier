	<brief_summary>The study has been designed to evaluate the clinical application of the new virtual bronchoscopy (VB) -based system for transbronchial sampling of the mediastinal masses or enlarged lymph nodes. The software uses data from thorax CT scan and enables airway segmentation and reconstruction simultaneously with predefined mediastinal targets. The most suitable sites for transbronchial needle aspiration are displayed on the internal surface of the airways showed in VB mode. The diagnostic yield of the new system-assisted TBNA will be compared to the reference method (EBUS-TBNA). The study group includes patients with mediastinal mass or lymph node enlargement in whom diagnostic bronchoscopy and TBNA can be applied as diagnostic methods. Both, virtual bronchoscopy guided transbronchial needle aspiration (VB-TBNA) and EBUS-TBNA of the mediastinal targets are performed during the same diagnostic bronchoscopy. Cytologic material from VB-TBNA and EBUS-TBNA is evaluated by two independent pathologists blinded to the method used to obtain the sample. Diagnostic yield and adequacy of aspirates obtained with the two methods will be assessed and compared.</brief_summary>
