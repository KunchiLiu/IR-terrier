	<brief_title>Peristeen Bowel Irrigation System in Cauda Equina</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People with spinal cord injury (SCI) often have severe problems with management of bowel function, including incontinence, impaction, lengthy bowel routines and extremely slow transit times.The anal irrigation system is a recently available system to help patients with bowel dysfunction empty their bowels by using pulse water irrigation.
