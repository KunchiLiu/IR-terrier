	<brief_summary>Muscle performance is largely influenced by modulations in gene expressions of muscle tissue. In this context, low-level laser therapy has been used to improve muscle performance in experimental models and human researches. Thereby, the investigators examined modulations on global gene expression of muscle tissue influenced by exercise associated to low-level laser therapy.</brief_summary>
