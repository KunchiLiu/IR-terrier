	<brief_summary>The goal of this project is to test the effectiveness of a computer-facilitated alcohol screening and brief intervention (c-ASBI) system for 12- to 18-year-old primary care patients in a multi-site, randomized comparative effectiveness trial. The investigators hypothesize that, among 12- to 18-year olds patients coming for annual well-care, those receiving c-ASBI will have lower rates of any alcohol use at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups compared to Treatment As Usual (TAU).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Specific Aims are to 1) Test the effects of c-ASBI on any alcohol use; 2) Test the effects of c-ASBI separately as a prevention, therapeutic, and risk-reduction intervention; 3) Test the effects of c-ASBI separately on cannabis and tobacco use; explore its effects on other drug use; and 4) Assess potential moderators (e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity, substance use history +/-, parent/sibling/peer substance use), mediators (e.g., Youth to Provider Connectedness,20 perceived harmfulness of alcohol and drug use), and explore c-ASBI's mechanism of action.</detailed_description>
