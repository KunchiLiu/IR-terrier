	<brief_summary>This study aims to compare the Connective Tissue Motion Measure (CTMM) in low back pain and no-low back pain subjects, evaluate the reliability of the CTMM, and examine the correlation of CTMM with low back pain symptoms, disability, and functional measures. The investigators hypothesize that CTMM will be reduced, on average, in low back pain subjects, that CTMM will be reliable with an intra-class correlation greater than 0.8, and CTMM will negatively correlate with low back pain symptoms, disability and functional measures.</brief_summary>
