	<brief_summary>This trial aims to determine whether dopamine D3 receptors are elevated in smokers versus nonsmokers and whether correlations exist between D3 receptor binding potential (BP) and functional MRI (fMRI) reactivity to smoking cues, which has been associated with smoking relapse vulnerability. Neuroimaging measures of D3 BP and smoking cue fMRI reactivity will be collected concurrently in otherwise healthy nicotine-dependent smokers and age-matched nonsmokers using a 3 Tesla MRI scanner configured to conduct fMRI and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). We will measure D3 receptor BP using radiolabeled [11C]-(+)-PHNO, which has a relatively higher affinity for D3 versus D2 receptors. We hypothesize that D3 BP will be elevated in smokers versus nonsmokers and that in smokers, there will be a positive correlation between smoking cue fMRI reactivity and D3 BP.</brief_summary>
