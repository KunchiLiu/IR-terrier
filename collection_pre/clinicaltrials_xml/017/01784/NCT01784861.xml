	<criteria>Phase I and PK Expansion Cohort Inclusion Criteria Phase I Patients: Histologic documentation of a solid malignancy and has exhausted available standard medical treatments or has no standard treatments currently available. This includes primary brain tumors. PK Expansion Patients: Histologic documentation of locally unresectable or metastatic renal cell carcinoma not currently amenable to surgery, radiation, or other therapy with curative intent. Measurable or nonmeasurable disease per RECIST 1.1 criteria. ECOG performance status of 01 At least 18 years of age. Normal bone marrow and organ function as defined below: Granulocytes ≥ 1,500/mcL Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN (≤ 5 x ULN if liver metastases are present) Urine protein ≤ 1+ OR urine protein to creatinine ratio ≤ 1; if UPC ratio is &gt; 1 on urinalysis, then 24hour urine collection for protein must be obtained and level must be &lt; 1,000 mg for patient enrollment. QTcF &lt; 450 ms. Normal LVEF. Recovery from any major or minor surgeries. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician immediately. Ability to swallow and retain oral medication. Able to understand and willing to sign written informed consent document. Phase II Inclusion Criteria Histologic documentation of well differentiated or moderately differentiated locally unresectable or metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor from either a primary or metastatic site with documented disease progression ≤ 12 months prior to enrollment whose disease is not currently amenable to surgery, radiation, or other modality therapy with curative intent. If different histologic classification schemes are used, equivalent histologic classifications (for example "grade 1," "low grade," or "intermediate grade") are allowed. There must be histologic documentation of a pancreatic primary site or clinical evidence of a pancreatic neuroendocrine primary tumor as determined by the treating physician. Documentation from a metastatic site is sufficient if there is clinical evidence of a pancreatic primary site. In the case of discordant pathology, patient eligibility will be determined by the PI after review of available records. Patients with neuroendocrine tumors (e.g., gastrinoma, VIPoma) in whom a pancreatic or peripancreatic primary site is strongly suspected are also eligible. Evidence of measurable disease per RECIST 1.1. Measurable disease is defined as lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ 2 cm with conventional techniques or as ≥ 1 cm with spiral CT scan. There is no limit on the number of prior chemotherapy regimens allowed. Any prior treatment (with the exception of lanreotide or octreotide) must be completed at least 4 weeks prior to initiation of treatment. Prior treatment with embolization or ablative therapies is allowed if measurable disease remains outside of the treated area or if there is definite progression of the treated lesions. There is no limit on the number of prior procedures. ECOG performance status of 01 At least 18 years of age. Normal bone marrow and organ function as defined below: Granulocytes ≥ 1,500/mcL Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ALT and AST ≤ 2.5 x ULN (≤ 5 x ULN if liver metastases are present) Urine protein ≤ 1+ OR urine protein to creatinine ratio ≤ 1; if UPC ratio is &gt; 1 on urinalysis, then 24hour urine collection for protein must be obtained and level must be &lt; 1,000 mg for patient enrollment. QTcF &lt; 450 ms. Normal LVEF. Patients with fasting serum cholesterol &gt; 300 mg/dL OR &gt; 7.75 mmol/L AND fasting triglycerides &gt; 2.5 x ULN should initiate lipid lowering medications. Recovery from any major or minor surgeries. Patient must be 4 weeks postmajor surgery and 2 weeks postminor surgery. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician immediately. Ability to swallow and retain oral medication. Able to understand and willing to sign written informed consent document. Phase I and PK Expansion Cohort Exclusion Criteria Active or severe liver disease (acute or chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis). Patients currently receiving cancer therapy (i.e., chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, hormonal therapy, surgery and/or tumor embolization). Receiving any other investigational agent(s) within 21 days or 5 halflives (whichever is shorter) prior to the first dose of study drug. A minimum of 10 days between termination of the investigational drug and administration of study drug is required. Any radiotherapy or immunotherapy within the last 3 weeks (limited palliative radiation is allowed ≥2 weeks). Chemotherapy regimens with delayed toxicity within the last 4 weeks (or within the last 6 weeks for prior nitrosourea or mitomycin C). Chemotherapy regimens given continuously or on a weekly basis with limited potential for delayed toxicity within the last 2 weeks. Major surgery within the last 4 weeks; minor surgery within the last 2 weeks. Immunization with any attenuated live vaccine within 1 week prior to registration. Concurrent condition resulting in immune compromise, including chronic treatment with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents. History of allergic reactions attributed to, or intolerance of, or other significant toxicity with, compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to X82 or everolimus. Patients with fasting serum cholesterol &gt; 300 mg/dL OR &gt; 7.75 mmol/L AND fasting triglycerides &gt; 2.5 x ULN who would need to initiate lipid lowering medications. Concomitant use of drugs with a risk of causing prolonged QTc and/or Torsades de Pointes, or patients with a history of risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (e.g., familial long QT syndrome, heart failure, left ventricular hypertrophy, slow heart rate (&lt;45 beats per minute)).
