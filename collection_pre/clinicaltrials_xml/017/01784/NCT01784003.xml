	<brief_summary>The proposed study aims to characterize biological ankle joint function during walking and running on slopes in order to further develop advanced powered ankle-foot prostheses. Ankle joint torque and angle data will be collected from non-amputees while walking and running at multiple speeds and slopes. This data will be used to develop control parameters for a powered ankle-foot prosthesis. Then, these parameters will be implemented and tested in a powered prosthesis worn by people with below the knee amputations.</brief_summary>
