	<brief_summary>This study investigates the medication isradipine, which is currently approved by the FDA to treat high blood pressure, in the treatment of depression in bipolar disorder. Isradipine or placebo (contains no active medication) will be used as an "add-on" to lithium, valproate, and/or atypical antipsychotics for individuals currently experiencing a major depressive episode. Our hypothesis is that isradipine will be superior to placebo in improving depressive symptoms.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Aim: To estimate the antidepressant efficacy of isradipine versus placebo as an adjunct to lithium, valproate, and/or other atypical antipsychotics among individuals with bipolar I disorder in a nonpsychotic major depressive episode. Hypothesis: Isradipine will be superior to placebo in improvement of depressive symptoms assessed by the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).</detailed_description>

Excluded medications: antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants (other than valproate), which could influence calcium signaling or impact mood; other calcium channel blockers; any other antihypertensive because of the risk of cause hypotension; any other drug known to interact with isradipine. Benzodiazepines or other sedativehypnotic agents (e.g., zolpidem) may not be initiated after study entry; subjects requiring these agents will be removed from the study. Allowed: Sedativehypnotic agents if dosage has been stable for 4 weeks prior to study entry; thyroid or estrogen replacement provided dosage has been stable for 3 months. Acceptable anticonvulsants include lamotrigine, valproate, gabapentin, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, carbamazepine.</criteria>
