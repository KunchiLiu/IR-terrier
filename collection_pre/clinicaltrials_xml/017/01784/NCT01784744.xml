	<brief_summary>The febrile hypothesis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) stems from the observation that clinical symptoms improve during fever. This fever induced amelioration of symptoms could be due to one of three possible causes, (1) the direct effect of temperature; (2) a resulting change in the immune inflammatory system function associated with the infection or fever; and/or (3) and increase in the functionality of a previously dysfunctional Locus Coeruleus-Noradrenerigic (LC-NA) system. Little has been done to explore the potential direct effect an increased body temperature may have on autism symptomology. Parental reports have demonstrated that during febrile episodes children with ASD have improved social cognition and language skills, and decreased disruptive behaviors. In order to further explore the direct temperature effect, further investigation is needed, which the investigators propose below. The investigators propose to complete a one year double blind crossover study with 15 children with ASD between the ages of 5 and 17 years old. Five children with ASD will complete a control protocol prior to beginning the full protocol with 10 additional ASD children. This will allow for any needed amendment of protocol parameters prior to completion of the full protocol.</brief_summary>
