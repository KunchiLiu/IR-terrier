	<brief_summary>The proposed study addresses a significant public health threat of Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among drug involved women on probation, parole or other community supervision. This randomized controlled trial aims to test the efficacy of a multimedia version of a 4-session, gender-specific, integrated drug use and HIV/STI prevention intervention (Multimedia Women On the Road To Health (WORTH)) in increasing condom use and decreasing the incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among 420 drug-involved, female offenders in a large community court setting in New York City, compared to a non-media version of the same intervention (Traditional WORTH) and to a 4-session Wellness Promotion condition.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While it is clear that women inmates in jails and prisons bear a high burden of Human immunodeficiency virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS), the effective development of prevention interventions for this high-risk group require an understanding of HIV risk context, sexual behaviors and attitudes for women while they are still in the community and before they become heavily involved in the criminal justice system. HIV prevention interventions must focus on women at early points of entry into the criminal justice system, when they are still in the community and at higher risk of engaging in unsafe sex and drug behaviors. This study focuses on a population of drug-involved women who have been arrested and given a court sanction, but are still living in the community.</detailed_description>
