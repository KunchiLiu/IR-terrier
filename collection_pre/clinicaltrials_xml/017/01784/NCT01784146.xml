	<brief_summary>Objective: To assess the influence of nebulization with bronchodilators carried by the heliox coupled to PEP in the distribution of compartimental lung volumes in asmathic adults and to correlate with pulmonary function data. Methods: A controlled randomized trial involving 27 patients divided into four groups: heliox + PEP, oxygen + PEP, heliox and oxygen. After the initial evaluation, it was placing 89 reflective markers attached to the surface of the trunk and images acquired by optoelectronic plethysmography (OEP) of six cameras. Three slow vital capacity maneuvers and quiet breathing regarded as phase control. After the control phase, all patients underwent nebulization with a distribution noninvasive system, semi-closed using 10 drops of Fenoterol Bromide and 20 drops of Ipratropium.</brief_summary>
