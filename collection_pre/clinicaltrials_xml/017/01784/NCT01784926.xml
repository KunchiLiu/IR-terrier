	<brief_summary>In this prospective, randomized study The investigators will include 80 patients with late intraocular lens (IOL) dislocation in the capsular complex, after cataract surgery. To obtain normal visual function, these patients needs surgery. Today, there are two different methods used for this condition; scleral suturing of the capsular complex or exchange of IOL to an iris-fixated IOL (Verisyse). In this study the investigators will look for advantages and dis-advantages for these two methods.</brief_summary>
