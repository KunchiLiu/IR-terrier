	<brief_summary>Exploratory study with double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, full cross-over design. The main objective is to identify one or two flour compositions in a carbohydrate-based food that produce a significant difference (alpha =0.2) in the time to reach 50% of cumulative absorption of exogenous glucose compared to the control.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Twelve volunteers will participate in the study; each person will be studied on three different occasions at least one week apart, consuming the three different test products in a randomized order. Test products are carbohydrate-based food made from different flour mixes differing in their expected rate of intestinal starch digestion. The products are labeled with 13C starch.</detailed_description>
