	<brief_summary>Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is an important adjunct for management of wounds, and promotes granulation tissue and angiogenesis. Despite these known means for facilitation of wound management, further research is needed to examine whether this modality is superior to other currently used options, thus defining clear indications for and benefits of NPWT. This would also help establish the role of combination therapy, using NPWT with simultaneous irrigation or other forms of dressings. This study aims to compare treatment efficacy of NPWT, NPWT plus proprietary simultaneous irrigation, and traditional hospital standard of care for treatment of grade III &amp; IV pressure ulcers. Primary endpoint of this study is comparison of reduction of wound volume between the three treatment arms; and secondary endpoints include bacterial load, rate of wound healing, preparation for grafting, and pain.</brief_summary>
