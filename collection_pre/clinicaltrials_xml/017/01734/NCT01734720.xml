	<brief_summary>The aims of this study were to 1. investigate what measures were taken when common bile duct stones (CBDS) were found intraoperatively in Sweden during the period May 2005 to December 2009 by using data from this population-based nationwide registry, and 2. analyze the outcome in terms of complications and success rates of bile duct clearance in relation to various stone sizes and interventions used. In order to further characterize the natural course of CBDS of various sizes, particular interest was focused on patients with positive findings where no peroperative measures to clear the bile ducts were taken or planned postoperatively.</brief_summary>
