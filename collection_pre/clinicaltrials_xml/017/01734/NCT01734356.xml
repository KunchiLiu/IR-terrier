	<brief_summary>The recent developments of research on iPS (induced pluripotent stem) cells lead to the establishment of mature cell lines such as cardiomyocytes or valvular interstitial cells with genetic and cellular characteristics of the donors. These cells represent a biological material more readily available to identify the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the diseases of BrS or ERS patients, which will lead to the identification of genetic markers.</brief_summary>
