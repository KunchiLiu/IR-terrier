	<brief_summary>This multicenter, open-label, single arm, interventional, long-term extension (LTE) study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab (TCZ, RoActemra/Actemra) in French participants with moderate to severe RA who have completed the Week 97 visit of WA22762 LTE study (NCT01194414) (EudraCT Number 2010-018375-22). Participants from France, who completed the Week 97 visit of the WA22762 LTE study and considered as responders (defined as having improvement in disease activity score based on 28-joint count [DAS28] of greater than [&gt;] 1.2 points) will continue TCZ treatment within this local LTE study for a maximum of 156 weeks of subcutaneous (SC) TCZ treatment, or until SC TCZ becomes commercially available, whichever occurs first.</brief_summary>
