	<brief_summary>This proposal examines use of a clinical reminder to the primary provider of patient with a high B type natriuretic peptide but no prior imaging. Electrical Medical Record-based Intervention to Determine whether Clinical Reminders Improve Heart Failure Management in Patients with High BNP Values and Unknown LVEF.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Provider Notification for High B-type Natriuretic Peptide Values</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale: B type natriuretic peptide is known to be elevated (&gt; 100 pg/ml) in patients with heart failure. Furthermore, treatments are available to improve survival and reduce hospitalization if the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is &lt; 40%. Accordingly, guidelines recommend an LVEF measure for patients with suspected heart failure. Prior work has demonstrated that patients with high BNP values do not always have a measure of left ventricular ejection. Hypothesis: A reminder to patients with BNP and no imaging may prompt providers to order appropriate imaging potentially leading to 1) identification of unsuspected depressed ejection fraction and 2) more appropriate treatment.</detailed_description>
