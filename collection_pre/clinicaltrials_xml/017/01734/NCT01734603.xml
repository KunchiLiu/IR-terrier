	<brief_summary>Rehabilitation is the first intention treatment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) with claudication. Initially proposed in the sixty's, rehabilitation programs dedicated to patients with PAD have recently been proved effective and defined in many guidelines. Supervised walking training on treadmill is recommended. Usually patients walk up to a mild or moderate pain (evaluated at 3 or 4 on the claudication pain scale; maximum pain =5), then stop until pain completely subsides and walk again . The Artex study assesses the efficacy of a fractionated mode of training avoiding pain by alternating short sequences of intensive training and active recovery (without rest).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intensive Rehabilitation in Peripheral Arterial Disease With Claudication: Effects of a Treadmill Training With Active Recovery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fractionated mode of training with active recovery has been proved effective in sport training as well as in Cardiac rehabilitation. We hypothesized it might be also interesting in the rehabilitation of patients with a peripheral arterial disease. The active recovery period might magnified the beneficial effect of a short intensive training.</detailed_description>
