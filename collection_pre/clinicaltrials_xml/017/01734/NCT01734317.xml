	<brief_summary>Approximately 10 subjects from one clinic having sustained a burn injury covering 1-25% or the Total Body surface Area (TBSA)and assessed as superficial partial-thickness or superficial deep-partial-thickness. The subject will be assessed once a week for a maximum of 3 weeks or until the burn is healed if that occurs earlier. . The dressing Mepilex Transfer Ag will be used as wound contact layer and gauze rolls and compression as second dressing.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open Single-centre Investigation Evaluating Efficacy in Second Degree Partial Thickness Burns Using a Silicone Contact Layer Containing Silver.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 10 subjects from one site will be evaluated provided they fulfill the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria and gives a signed and dated consent. Subjects may have sustained a burn injury covering 1-25% of the Total Body Surface Area (TBSA)and assessed as superficial partial-thickness or superficial deep-partial thickness in dept. Each subject will be followed one time per week for a maximum of 3 weeks or until the burn is healed if that occurs earlier. Healing is defined as â‰¥95% epithelialisation. Percent (%) healed epithelialization will be measured by photo analysing using the PictZar program. Dressing changes will be performed at each visit and in between if deemed necessary by the investigator.Gauze rolls and compression will be used as secondary dressing.All dressing changes will be registered in a log. Pain before, during and after removal will be assessed.</detailed_description>
