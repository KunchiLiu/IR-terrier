	<brief_summary>Radical Cystectomy is still the standard treatment in muscle-invasive Bladder cancer. Local recurrence is still the major cause of failure together with distant metastasis. postoperative radiotherapy succeeded to decrease the local recurrence and hence improved the overall survival. Adjuvant chemotherapy has also improved the survival in different studies. This study is performed to test the efficacy and toxicity of adding the two modalities together compared to each modality alone.</brief_summary>
