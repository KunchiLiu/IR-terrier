	<brief_summary>The purpose of this open-label study is to assess the safety, antiviral activity, and pharmacokinetics of 9 subcutaneous injections of miravirsen monotherapy (5 weekly doses over 5 weeks, followed by a further 4 doses once every other week over 7 weeks) over a total of 12 weeks of treatment. The subjects enrolled in this study are chronically infected with HCV genotype 1 and are null responders to treatment with peg IFNÎ±/RBV therapy.</brief_summary>
