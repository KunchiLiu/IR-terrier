	<detailed_description>Patients, who are randomly assigned to the "Lightening arm" will have the circadian light for the whole ICU stay. Light levels at the patients bedside will be measured continuously: embedded light sensors provide irradiance and luminous lux recordings in red, green, and blue color bands and a white light measurement in lux</detailed_description>
