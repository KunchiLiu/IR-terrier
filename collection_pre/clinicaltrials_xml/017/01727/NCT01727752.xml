	<brief_summary>A Randomized, Blinded Comparison of Surgical Intervention with the Coflex® Interspinous Implant versus Surgical Decompression for Patients with Intermittent Neurogenic Claudication caused by Lumbar Stenosis</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Surgical Decompression With an Interlaminar Implant in Patients With Intermittent Neurogenic Claudication Caused by Lumbar Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this investigation, it will be investigated whether the effectiveness of surgical intervention with Coflex® is equivalent to surgical decompression after 12 months in people with intermittent claudication. The main advantage of coflex® might be a faster recovery after surgery, but after long term follow-up it is unknown if this treatment effect remains. Therefore in addition, it will be investigated whether surgical intervention with coflex® is more effective than surgical decompression on short-term follow-up (8 weeks to 6 months) and whether surgical intervention with coflex® is more cost-effective after 12 months than surgical decompression.</detailed_description>
