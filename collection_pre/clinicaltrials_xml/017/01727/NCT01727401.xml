	<brief_summary>Fondaparinux is a parenteral anticoagulant drug approved for the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in high risk medical patients. A relevant proportion of these patients have renal insufficiency and/or thrombocytopenia which represent independent risk factors for bleeding. The risk of bleeding may be increased when fondaparinux is administered to patients with a reduced renal function and/or low platelet count. A lower dose of fondaparinux, 1.5 mg daily, has been approved for patients with renal insufficiency defined by a creatinine clearance between 20 and 50 mL/min. However, to our knowledge, there are no clinical studies that have specifically evaluated prophylaxis with fondaparinux in acutely-ill medical patients with a moderate to severe thrombocytopenia. The scope of this study is to evaluate the safety of fondaparinux in high risk hospitalized medical patients with a moderate to severe thrombocytopeniada defined by a platelet count between 100,000/uL and 30,000/uL.</brief_summary>
