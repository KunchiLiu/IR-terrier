	<brief_summary>This study will compare monotherapy with tenofovir to sequential therapy with pegylated interferon alpha-2b (pegIFN-2b) followed by tenofovir, and to combination therapy with pegIFN-2b + tenofovir, in participants with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive chronic hepatitis B and elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT). All enrolled participants will be be administered tenofovir alone for 8 weeks and then will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 treatment arms.</brief_summary>
