	<brief_summary>This is a pharmacokinetic study to determine the safety and tolerability of pregabalin in healthy lactating women. The objectives are to determine whether pregabalin is secreted in breast milk and if so, to characterize pregabalin pharmacokinetics in breast milk. Other objectives are to estimate potential infant exposure to pregabalin if administered to lactating women and to characterize the safety and tolerability of pregabalin in lactating women.</brief_summary>
