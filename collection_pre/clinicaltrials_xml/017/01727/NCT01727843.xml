	<brief_summary>Tranexamic acid (TA) is a synthetic antifibrinolytic agent. It prevents degradation of fibrin and delays the breakdown of hemostatic clots. It has been demonstrated in multiple studies and meta analyses to decrease blood loss in elective hip and knee arthroplasty. However, concerns about the prothrombotic side effects of systemic administration of TA has hindered the widespread adoption of this medication in orthopaedic patients due to their high risk for thrombotic complications such as deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism Topical application of tranexamic acid has been proposed as a way to mitigate the potential prothrombotic effects of TA. Topical application of TA has been demonstrated to be beneficial in oral and cardiac surgery. Plasma levels of TA have been found to be minimal following topical application, minimizing its potential systemic thromboembolic side effects. TA has been used topically in total knee arthroplasty, with significant reductions in blood loss and no increase in thromboembolic complications8,10. Data on the use of TA in hip fracture surgery is limited, and there are no studies examining topical use of TA in hip fracture surgery. Our study question is: Does topical tranexamic acid decrease blood loss following hemiarthroplasty of the hip for femoral neck fractures?</brief_summary>
