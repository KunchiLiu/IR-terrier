	<brief_title>COPD Assessment Test Can Predict Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is aimed to investigate the association between the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) and depression in stable COPD patients. Stable COPD patients will be enrolled from the tertiary hospitals. All patients will undergo lung function tests. The Korean versions of the CAT (COPD assessment test) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) will be used to assess COPD symptoms and depressive disorder, respectively. We will compare the depresssion frequency among GOLD classifications of airway limitation and among the four CAT groups. And. we will also investigate which items of the CAT are the strongest indicators of depression.</detailed_description>
