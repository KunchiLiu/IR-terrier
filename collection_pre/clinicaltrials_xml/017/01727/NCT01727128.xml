	<criteria>Subjects should be in good health (except for additional/ specific inclusion criteria related to hepatic impaired subjects) as determined by past medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram, and laboratory tests of no significance at screening Subjects must weigh at least 45 kg to participate in this study, and must have a body mass index (BMI) from (18.535.0 kg/m2) Subjects must be able to communicate well with the investigator, to understand the requirements of the study and agree to use strict contraception for 16 weeks after the last BKM120 dose Additional inclusion criteria Group 1 control healthy subjects Subjects should be matched to the hepatic impaired subjects of group 2 in gender, age (± 10 years), weight (± 20%), and BMI (±5%) Additional inclusion criteria Group 2 hepatic impaired subjects Subjects with physical signs consistent with stable hepatic impairment ChildPugh Clinical Assessment Score consistent with degree of hepatic impairment (mild , moderate or severe) Subjects must be free of significant medical disorders unrelated to the subject's hepatic disorder as judged by the investigator. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109 /L Platelet count ≥ 50 x 109 /L serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Significant illness, including infections, or hospitalization within the 2 weeks prior to dosing, except for the hepatic impaired subjects who due to their liver disease may be affected by significant medical problems which require frequent hospitalizations. Invasive systemic fungal infections need to be fully resolved prior to study entry Use of tobacco products within 2 weeks prior to dosing or during the study. Consumption of alcohol within 2 days prior to dosing or during the study Subjects with known ongoing alcohol and or/drug abuse within 1 month prior to dosing, or evidence of such abuse as indicated by the laboratory assays conducted during screening and/or at baseline Subjects not willing to avoid certain study prohibited food, drink, over the counter medicines and supplements Any surgical or medical condition which might significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs, or which may jeopardize the subject in case of participation in the study. Medical history of cardiac disease and/or clinically significant ECG abnormalities. History of clinically significant hematologic, renal, endocrinologic, pulmonary cardiovascular, hepatic, or allergic disease medically documented Medical history of relevant psychiatric disorders Subjects with Diabetes Mellitus or subjects with glucose levels out of normal range as judge by the investigator History of immunodeficiency diseases, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), as confirmed by (HIV1, HIV2) test Additional exclusion criteria Group 1 (matched healthy control subjects) History or presence of liver disease or liver injury as indicated by an abnormal liver function profile A positive Hepatitis C test or a positive Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) Additional exclusion criteria Group 2 hepatic impaired subjects Subjects with clinically significant abnormal findings, not consistent with clinical disease, upon physical examination, ECG or laboratory evaluation Any evidence of progressive liver disease (within the last 4 weeks prior to the screening visit) as indicated by liver transaminases, alkaline phosphatase and GGT or a ≥ 50% worsening of serum bilirubin or prothrombin time Total bilirubin &gt; 6mg/dl Subject has ascites requiring intervention</criteria>
