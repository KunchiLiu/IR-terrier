	<brief_summary>Neck and shoulder pain (NSP) is fairly common among high school students in Korea. Presumably, the high prevalence of NSP in Korean adolescents is a consequence of an inappropriate static position for a prolonged period of time. We suspect that proper education and posture correction for Korean adolescents may decrease the prevalence or severity of NSP. Although several studies have focused on the etiology of NSP during adolescence, few studies have addressed the management or prevention of NSP in adolescents, despite its high prevalence in this age group. The aims of this prospective study was to identify the effects of education, in terms of recognition of this issue and posture correction, on prevalence and severity of NSP in Korean adolescents</brief_summary>
