	<brief_summary>Patients with advanced coronary artery disease usually undergo incomplete myocardial revascularization due to the extension and diffuseness of the disease, with very poor distal arterial beds unsuitable for direct revascularization. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that direct, intramyocardial injection of autologous bone marrow cells may further improve myocardial perfusion in patients undergoing incomplete bypass surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cell Therapy in Severe Chronic Ischemic Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All eligible patients will undergo coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and, in previously identified areas of viable, ischemic myocardium unsuitable for direct revascularization, be randomized to either placebo (saline) or intramyocardial injection of bone marrow-derived cells (BMC) during surgery. During follow-up, myocardial perfusion assessment will be performed to determine the improvement in treated areas compared to non-treated segments.</detailed_description>
