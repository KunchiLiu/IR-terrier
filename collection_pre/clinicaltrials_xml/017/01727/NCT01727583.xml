	<brief_summary>This pilot study is aimed at assessing the acute effect of several combinations of lipids differing in their fatty acid composition on glucagon-like-peptide (GLP)-2 and GLP-1 secretion in healthy subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Boosting the Secretion of GLP-2 and GLP-1 Intestinal Hormones by Nutrients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, the investigators aim to investigate the effect of various lipid types on GLP-2 and GLP-1 secretion. This will allow to determine the importance of lipids in nutritional solutions. Moreover, this will allow us to assess whether existing clinical formulas can be improved in order to stimulate GLP-2 and accelerate intestinal recovery.</detailed_description>
