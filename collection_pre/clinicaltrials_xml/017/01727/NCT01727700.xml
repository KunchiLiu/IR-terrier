	<brief_title>Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Fixed-dose Once-daily Oral Aripiprazole in Children and Adolescents With Tourette's Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tourette's Disorder is a neuropsychiatric condition that is characterized by the appearance of tics that can be simple or complex in nature. A tic is a sudden, rapid, recurrent, non-rhythmic, stereotyped motor movement or vocalization. There are a very limited number of medications approved for the treatment of Tourette's Disorder. The goal of the current trial is to obtain efficacy, safety, and tolerability data in a controlled condition of a Once-daily aripiprazole formulation in children and adolescents with Tourette's Disorder. The trial has an 8-week long double-blind treatment period after a pretreatment (screening/washout phase), and the subjects will be followed up for 1 month after the last treatment. The Once-daily tablet formulation that will be evaluated in this trial represents a daily dosage regimen that is intended to be administered to children and adolescents.</detailed_description>
