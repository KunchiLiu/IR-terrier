	<brief_summary>Current research on sperm morphology has been directed towards the dysmorphisms of the sperm head. A new technique based on the motile sperm organelle morphology examination (MSOME) allows the detection of sperm with large nuclear vacuoles (SLV). Large nuclear vacuoles are specific sperm alterations observed under high magnification, and their presence has been related to increased DNA fragmentation and denaturation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A new method for the detailed morphological evaluation of motile spermatozoa in real time, under high magnification, named "motile sperm organellar morphology examination" (MSOME) was developed. This magnification provides an accurate description of spermatozoa abnormalities, particularly the presence of head vacuoles, which is indicative of abnormal chromatin packaging in spermatozoa. However, the influence of sperm with large nuclear vacuoles (SLV) on ART outcomes is still a matter of debate. The goals for this study were to identify whether there is a connection between SLV under high magnification and ICSI outcomes.</detailed_description>
