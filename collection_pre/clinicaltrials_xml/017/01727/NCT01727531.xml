	<brief_summary>This research is being done to determine if a short course of Chloroquine (five weeks) before, during and after whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) will improve the overall survival of subjects being treated for brain metastases.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IDO2 Genetic Status Informs the Neoadjuvant Efficacy of Chloroquine (CQ) in Brain Metastasis Radiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis one: A short course of chloroquine one week prior and four weeks after initiation of WBRT is tolerable and significantly increases the median survival time of patients suffering from brain metastasis as assessed one, three, six, nine, twelve and 24 months post radiotherapy, when compared to historic controls. Hypothesis two: The presence of one or both single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)s in the gene coding for the immunoregulatory enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 2 (IDO2) improves the clinical outcomes of WBRT or the response to CQ co-treatment. 3.2. Specific Aims: The specific aims of this study are: 1. Determine patients physical profiles prior WBRT and at regular intervals afterwards up to 24 months after radiotherapy. 2. Record the status of patient metastases (i.e. number, location, size) 3. Determine patients' KPS values. 4. Record the incidence and causes of mortality of patients. 5. Determine the genotype of IDO2 for each patient. 6. Following data analysis, test the validity of the two hypotheses.</detailed_description>
