	<brief_summary>Based on the creation of a somato-autonomic reflex, the stimulation of sensory nerve terminals located in dermatome T6 may cause a reflex, whose efferent pathways end in vagal nerve branches stimulating the gastric wall, similarly to the gastric pacemaker. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of percutaneous electroneurostimulation (PENS) of T6 dermatome on appetite, weight loss and dietary compliance.</brief_summary>
