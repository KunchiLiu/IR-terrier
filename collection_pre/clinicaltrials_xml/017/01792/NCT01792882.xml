	<brief_summary>The study is intended to collect specimens to support the application of genome analysis technologies, including large-scale genome sequencing. This study will ultimately provide cancer researchers with specimens that they can use to develop comprehensive catalogs of genomic information on at least 50 types of human cancer. The study will create a resource available to the worldwide research community that could be used to identify and accelerate the development of new diagnostic and prognostic markers, new targets for pharmaceutical interventions, and new cancer prevention and treatment strategies. This study will be a competitive enrollment study conducted at multiple institutions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Collection of Surplus Surgical Tumor Tissues and Pre-surgical Blood Samples</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will enroll subjects diagnosed with various cancers and who are scheduled to undergo surgical treatment. Prior to scheduled surgery, subjects will be asked to donate a 10-20 ml blood sample. After surgery, surplus tissues (including tumor and adjacent normal tissues) not required for diagnosis will be collected. Subject clinical information will be collected, including basic demographic information, medical history, family history, current cancer history and treatment. After surgery, a final pathology report will be obtained for each subject's surgical specimen. In some instances and based on the cancer indications required, longitudinal data may also be collected at a frequency of every 6 months to once per year. Longitudinal data will include information on study subject survival and disease recurrence.</detailed_description>
