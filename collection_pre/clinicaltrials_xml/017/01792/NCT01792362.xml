	<brief_title>Evaluation of Anti-mullerian Hormone(AMH) Levels as a Predictive Factor of Response to Weight Loss Treatment in Obese Infertile Women With Poly Cystic Ovary(PCOS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study population comprised of all obese infertile PCOS patients aged 20-40 years which underwent 3 months weight loss diet in royan institute, Tehran Iran. The study is conducted over 12 wk energy restriction. All subjects have the same dietary protocol. At baseline, week 12 the levels of AMH,Follicular Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Lutienizing Hormone(LH),Prolactin (PRL), androgens, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), glucose, and insulin were measured and Free Androgen Index (FAI) and Insulin Resistance (IR) indices is calculated. The laboratory tests are determined by radioimmunoassay in the Laboratory of Endocrinology of Royan institute. AMH is measured in duplicate using an ultrasensitive ELISA kit (AMH-ELIZA Kit; Beckman Coulter, Marseilles, France) according to manufacturer instructions. All measurements are performed using a single kit and at the same time in the Laboratory of clinical Immunology of Royan institute. Data collection will be performed by using questionnaire to be filled as per the available records and laboratory results.
