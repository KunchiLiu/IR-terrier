The investigators wanted to confirm the known risk factors such as age, gender, smoking history and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and evaluate the impact on survival of etiology, number of different bacteriological species in retrospective and prospective sputa, azithromycin use and presence/development of pulmonary hypertension.</brief_summary>
