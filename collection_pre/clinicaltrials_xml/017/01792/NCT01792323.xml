	<brief_summary>To cover meal-related insulin requirements, insulin pumps allow insulin to be delivered at high rates over a short period of time (bolus delivery). The length of this period (bolus duration) usually depends on the chosen bolus size and on the used insulin pump model. This study will evaluate the impact of different bolus durations (i.e., durations commonly employed in commercially available insulin pumps: 2 and 40 seconds for delivering 1 Unit of insulin) on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of an rapid-acting insulin analogue. Objective: To evaluate in type 1 diabetic patients the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of rapid-acting insulin (insulin lispro) administered as subcutaneous boluses with different bolus durations. Study design: Single-center, randomized, controlled, two-arm cross-over intervention study Population: Twenty type 1 diabetic subjects Intervention: The investigational treatment is the subcutaneous administration of insulin lispro either as one bolus of 15 IU over a period of 30s or as one bolus of 15 IU over a period of 10 min. Plasma samples to assess pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties will be taken during an 8-hour clamp experiment. Patients will undergo both investigational treatments in a randomized order; between the two clamp visits there will be a wash-out period of 5-21 days. Main study endpoint: Time to maximum glucose infusion rate</brief_summary>
