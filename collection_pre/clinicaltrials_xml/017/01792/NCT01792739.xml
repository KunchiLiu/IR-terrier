	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to clarify the impact of lactobacillus preparation on the incidence of diarrhea in ICU-admitted patients. Almost all patients in ICU are treated with antibiotics for the effective control of various infections. However, antibiotics-associated diarrhea is another matter of concern. Many previous studies were proved that the use of probiotic lactobacillus preparation can reduce antibiotics-associated diarrhea in ward-admitted patients. In this study, we are planning to perform a similar study in severely ill patients in ICU.</brief_summary>
