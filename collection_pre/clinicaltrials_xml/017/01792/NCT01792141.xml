	<brief_title>Use of Diagnostic Dye to Identify Areas of Leakeage,in the Retina, Prior to Receiving Focal Laser Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study showed that early treatment of Clinically Significant Macular Edema (CSME) with focal and grid laser preserved vision in diabetic patients. Indocyanine Green angiography, which was not available at the time of the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS), is now standard-of-care for diagnostic evaluation of the choroidal circulation and is routinely done in combination with Fluorescein angiography for a more complete visualization of retinal pathology. Simultaneous examination of both retinal and choroidal circulation allows for identification of microaneurysms that are hyperfluorescent both on Fluorescein angiography and Indocyanine green angiography. Such microaneurysms are sites of increased vascular leakage and represent a means for providing more effective laser treatment by targeting these areas directly with focal laser.</detailed_description>
