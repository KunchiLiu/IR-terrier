	<detailed_description>Patients with active Wet AMD often receive intraocular Anti-VEGF injections such as Macugen, Lucentis and Avastin on a monthly basis for an extended period of time. While these medications are very effective at controlling the Choroidal Neovascularization associated with this disease, the impact of monthly intravigtreal Anti-VEGF injections on the viability of corneal endothelial cells has yet to be fully characterized. The availability of CESM as a diagnostic test that can be performed quickly and painlessly in the clinic offers a method of tracking corneal endothelial cell count in this patient population.</detailed_description>
