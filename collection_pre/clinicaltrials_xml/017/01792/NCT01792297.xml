	<brief_summary>Bovine colostrum is the initial milk secreted by cows during the first day after calving. Colostrum is high in protein and contains a number of substances that have potential to be beneficial for the immune system. Preliminary studies about effects of colostrum supplementation show its potential for increasing human exercise performance; however, more evidence across the lifespan is required to confirm effects and to understand mechanisms of action. The objectives are to determine the effect of 8 weeks of bovine colostrum supplementation, compared to whey protein supplementation on the following dependent variables in men and women 50 years and older while participating in a resistance-training program: - muscle mass - strength - blood levels of growth factors and markers of inflammation - urine levels of muscle and bone catabolic markers - tests of cognitive ability It is hypothesized that bovine colostrum supplementation will result in greater increases in muscle mass, strength, blood IGF-1 levels (an anabolic hormone), and cognitive ability, and greater reductions in inflammation, and markers of muscle and bone catabolism, compared to placebo.</brief_summary>
