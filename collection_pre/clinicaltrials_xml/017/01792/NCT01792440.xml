	<brief_summary>Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis patients (and controls) were recruited for the study. The investigators' aim was to study the relevance of clinical parameters in terms of underlying disease severity, proteolysis and inflammation in a diverse non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Sputum Colour Chart as a Predictor of Lung Inflammation and Proteolysis in Non-cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients from the non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB) outpatient clinic were recruited in our study from September 2009 till July 2010. Control healthy subjects were recruited among peers of the patient or hospital staff during the same period. For the NCFB patients, underlying etiologies of NCFB and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) colonization status were analyzed and each patient was evaluated by means of spirometry (FVC and FEV1), Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) and Sputum Colour Chart (SCC). SCC assessment was both done by letting the patient predict his sputum purulence prior to sputum induction and by SCC scoring after sputum harvest by the physician.</detailed_description>
