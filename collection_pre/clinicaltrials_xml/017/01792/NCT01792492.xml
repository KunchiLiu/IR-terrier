	<brief_title>The Role of an Optical Probe in Thyroid Cancer Diagnosis: Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The optical real-time readings will be compared to the histological analysis from the same area. Subjects undergoing thyroid surgery for thyroid disease including thyroid nodules, thyroid cancer and thyroid goiter with nodules will be eligible to participate. After the removal of the thyroid gland, optical readings will be taken from the ex vivo thyroid gland and these same areas will then be analyzed in the usual standard fashion. The reading will then be correlated with the histological results. In addition, if lymph nodes are removed as part of the surgery they will also be tested prior to histological standard processing. All specimens and data will be de-identified.</detailed_description>
