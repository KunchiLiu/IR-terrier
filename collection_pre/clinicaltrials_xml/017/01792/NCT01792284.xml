	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of participation in this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of different dosing schedules of LY2605541 and how different dosing schedules of LY2605541 affect Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Participants will be treated for up to 36 weeks with LY2605541 (one 12-week Lead-in period and two 12-week Randomization periods) and 42 weeks total study enrollment (10 day screening period and 4 week Follow-up period).</brief_summary>
