	<brief_summary>Although surgical techniques such as limberg flap. modified limberg flap and karydakis are currently most popular treatment methods for pilonidal disease, crystallized phenol application is also successfully used for pilonidal sinus treatment by different centers. We believe crystallized phenol application could become a good alternative to popular surgical interventions using transposition flaps.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Crystallized Phenol Versus Transposition Flaps for Treatment of Pilonidal Disease: A Prospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pilonidal sinus disease (PSD) is usually located at sacrococcygeal region of the body and mostly effect young males causing loss of labor and school time. Its incidence is reported 26 per 100000 in a Norwegian study. Although there are many treatment modalities either surgical or conservative, ideal treatment is still a matter of debate. Surgical techniques such as limberg flap, modified limberg flap and karydakis are most popular treatment methods for pilonidal disease crystallized phenol application is also successfully used for pilonidal sinus treatment by different centers. We would like to compare flap techniques and crystallized phenol application for complications, recurrence, patient comfort, duration of recovery and return to work. We believe crystallized phenol application could become a good alternative to popular surgical interventions using transposition flaps.</detailed_description>
