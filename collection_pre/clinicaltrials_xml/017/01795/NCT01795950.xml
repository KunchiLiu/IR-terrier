	<brief_summary>The purpose of this clinical study is to assess the safety of PLX-PAD to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). PLX-PAD is a cell-based product made of allogeneic Mesenchymal-like Adherent Stromal Cells (ASCs), derived from human full-term placentas following an elective caesarean section. This year-long study will evaluate the safety of three different dose levels of PLX-PAD, each given as a single intravenous infusion. This study will also evaluate effects that PLX-PAD may have on PAH, such as changes in the ability to exercise and on other tests used to measure the disease severity.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Summary of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eligible subjects: Are between 18 and 75 years of age Have a minimum weight of 45 kg Have a diagnosis of idiopathic or heritable PAH, PAH associated with connective tissue disease (CTD), PAH associated with repaired congenital systemictopulmonary cardiac shunt (at least one year since repair), or PAH associated with appetite suppressant/drug or toxin use confirmed by RHC Have a current WHO functional class II or III designation Have been stabilized, without dose changes for at least 30 days prior to the Screening visit on at least two approved PAH medications (e.g., PDE5 inhibitor, ERA, prostanoid [as inhalation or infusion]); or IV prostanoid monotherapy. Subjects on an IV prostanoid must have been receiving therapy for at least three months prior to the Screening visit. Have a 6MWD equal to or greater than 200 meters (m) at the Screening and Baseline Visits. Subjects must not: Have any evidence of pulmonary thrombus, significant coronary artery disease (CAD), left ventricular dysfunction, or a restrictive or congestive cardiomyopathy Have a history of malignancies within the past 5 years,with the exception of individuals with localized, nonmetastatic basal cell carcinoma of the skin, in situ carcinoma of the cervix, or prostate cancer who are not currently or expected to undergo radiation therapy, chemotherapy and/or surgical intervention, or to initiate hormonal treatment during the study Be listed for transplantation Be pregnant or nursing</criteria>
