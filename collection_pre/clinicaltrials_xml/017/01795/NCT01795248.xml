	<brief_summary>It is well-known that women with previous gestational diabetes mellitus are in risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life; approximately half of the women develop overt type 2 diabetes within the first 10 years after pregnancy. Knowing this, we want to examine the effect of the type 2 diabetes medicine, liraglutide (Victoza), in women with previous gestational diabetes with the aim of reducing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.</brief_summary>
