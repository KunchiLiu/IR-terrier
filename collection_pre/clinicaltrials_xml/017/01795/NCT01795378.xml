	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of Donor Natural Killer Cells Given After Haploidentical Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Those patients with acute leukemia, which is not responding to coventional chemotherapy, will be treated. The clinical effects will be evaulated in terms of safety (side effects) and anti-leukemia effect.</detailed_description>
