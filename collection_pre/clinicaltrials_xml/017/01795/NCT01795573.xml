	<criteria>Signed informed consent Diagnoses: a. Hematologic malignancies Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), nonHodgkin lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), multiple myeloma (MM) in complete remission (CR). Complete remission is defined per morphologic, cytogenetic, FISH, molecular, and radiographic imaging studies appropriate for each condition listed. AML, ALL: Normal values for absolute neutrophil count (&gt;1000/microL) and platelet count (&gt;100,000/microL); Absence of extramedullary leukemia; Less than 5 percent blast cells present in the bone marrow MDS: Bone marrow with ≤5 percent myeloblasts with normal maturation of all cell lines; Peripheral blood demonstrates hemoglobin ≥11 g/dL, platelets ≥100 x 10^9/L, neutrophils ≥1 x 10^9/L, and no circulating blasts CLL: Absence of constitutional symptoms attributable to CLL; No lymph nodes &gt;1.5 cm in diameter on computed tomography; No hepatomegaly or splenomegaly by computed tomography; Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1500/microL; Platelet count &gt;100,000/microL; No clonal lymphocytes in the peripheral blood by immunophenotyping; Bone marrow with no evidence of clonal CLL (by flow cytometry and/or immunohistochemistry NHL: No clinical evidence of disease or diseaserelated symptoms; Typically FDGavid lymphomas: a posttreatment residual mass of any size is permitted as long as it is PET negative; Variably FDGavid lymphoma/FDG avidity unknown: all lymph nodes normal size by CT; Spleen and liver nonpalpable and without nodules; If pretreatment bone marrow biopsy was positive, repeat bone marrow biopsy must be negative; if morphologically indeterminate, immunohistochemistry should be negative If pretreatment bone marrow biopsy was positive, repeat bone marrow biopsy must be negative; if morphologically indeterminate, immunohistochemistry should be negative HL: No clinical evidence of disease or diseaserelated symptoms; A posttreatment residual mass of any size is permitted as long as it is PET negative; Spleen and liver must be nonpalpable and without nodules; If a pretreatment bone marrow biopsy was positive, an adequate bone marrow biopsy from the same site must be cleared of infiltrate; if this is indeterminate by morphology, immunohistochemistry should be negative MM: Absence of monoclonal protein in serum and urine by immunofixation with no current evidence of soft tissue plasmacytoma; Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy must demonstrate less than 5 percent clonal plasma cells; In patients who lack measurable M proteins in the serum and urine being monitored using the FLC levels, the definition of CR requires a normalization of the free light chain (FLC) ratio in addition to the above criteria MDS: May have achieved CR through either hypomethylating agent therapy, induction chemotherapy, or other therapy MDS: Low/intermediate1 IPSS risk category patients are eligible only if they have failed prior therapy or are transfusiondependent Peripheral blood white blood count (WBC) greater than 2,000 per microliter (required for collection of dendritic cell precursors) Adequate vital organ function: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 45% by multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram; Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and diffusing lung capacity oxygenation (DLCO) ≥ 50% of predicted values on pulmonary function tests; Transaminases (AST, ALT) &lt; 3 times upper limit of normal values; Creatinine clearance ≥ 50cc/min Infectious disease criteria: No active infection; infection controlled with antimicrobial therapy is not excluded HIV negative by ELISA or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) [if ELISA is positive and RTPCR is negative, the ELISA is considered false positive] Hepatitis B and C negative by serology or RTPCR Must complete full screening panel: HIV 1, 2 serology and RTPCR; human T cell lymphotropic virus types 1/2 (HTLV1/2) serology; rapid plasma reagin (RPR) serology; EpsteinBarr virus (EBV) serology; Cytomegalovirus (CMV) serology; herpes simplex virus (HSV) serology; Varicella. Zoster Virus (VZV) serology Performance status: Karnofsky Performance Status Score ≥ 60%. Agreement to utilize effective contraceptive methods during the study (for one year) Eligible donors will include siblings age ≥ 18 matched with the recipient at HLAA, B, C, and DRB1 Those with any Sorror's comorbidity factors with score &gt; 3 2 or more Sorror's factors with composite score of ≥ 3 Important modification to comorbidity index calculation. DLCO will not be included in assessment of pulmonary risk, excepting those with DLCO &lt; 50%, who will merit a score of 3 and thereby be excluded from the trial.
