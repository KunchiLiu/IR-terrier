	<brief_title>An Efficacy and Safety Study of Fentanyl Transdermal Patch in Filipino Participants With Osteoarthritis and Chronic Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (a medical research study in which participants and researchers are told which treatments the participants are receiving, "unblinded") single-arm and prospective study (study following participants forward in time) of fentanyl in participants with osteoarthritis and Chronic low back pain with moderate (medium level of seriousness) and severe (very serious, life threatening) pain levels. Participants will be treated with fentanyl transdermal patch (patch containing a drug that is put on the skin so the drug will enter the body through the skin) starting with 12.5 microgram (mcg) dose of fentanyl. The dose will be increased on Day 3, if needed, by 12.5 mcg. Dose adjustments will be done every 3 days. Maximum of 50 mcg dose of fentanyl will be allowed. Participants will be evaluated for pain levels and quality of life using Brief pain inventory (BPI) score and Clinical global impression-severity (CGI-S) score. Tramadol 50 milligram tablet at a maximum of 6 tablets per day will be used as supplemental doses of analgesic (drug used to control pain). Participants' safety will be monitored through out the study.</detailed_description>
