	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to compare the lumbar proprioception of patients with chronic back pain to that of healthy volunteers during low- and high-frequency muscle vibration. The order of measures (low frequency of vibration, high frequency vibration and no vibration) is randomized in a cross-over design. Patients and volunteers are matched by age and body mass index.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lumbar Proprioception in Lower Back Pain Patients Versus Healthy Subjects : a Comparative Study on the Effects of Low- and High-frequency Muscle Vibrations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives of this study are: A-Measure the effect of low- and high-frequency vibrations on lumbar repositioning in patients with chronic lower back pain. B-Measure the effect of low- and high-frequency vibrations on lumbar repositioning in healthy volunteers. Our working hypothesis is that low frequency vibrations induce an illusion of shortening, and high frequency vibrations induce an illusion of elongation. The variability of the error should not increase.</detailed_description>
