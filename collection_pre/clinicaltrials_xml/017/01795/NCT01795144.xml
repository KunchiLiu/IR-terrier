	<brief_title>Incretin Regulation of Insulin Secretion in Monogenic Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Monogenic diabetes patients and healthy matched controls will be admitted to the University of Chicago Clinical Resource Center for a total of 4 nights. The following will take place on separate days: 1. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT): consume sugary drink and blood samples will be collected at multiple time points 2. Isoglycemic glucose infusion (IGI) test: glucose will be infused via a vein in the arm and and blood samples will be collected at multiple time points 3. OGTT during GLP-1 infusion 4. IGI during Exendin-9 infusion</detailed_description>
