	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to compare optimal medical therapy alone versus percutaneous coronary intervention on top of medical therapy in the setting of heart transplant recipient coronary artery disease in a randomized trial.The primary endpoint assessed at 1 year is the composite of death, myocardial infarction, need for transitory or permanent ventricular assist device implantation, myocardial revascularization, occurrence or worsening of heart failure, any graft dysfunction and/or a decrease of left ventricular ejection fraction of at least 25% compared to baseline. The hypothesis of the study is the superiority of the interventional management over medical therapy alone in preventing the occurrence of the primary endpoint of the study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The hypothesis of the study is the superiority of the interventional management over medical therapy alone in preventing the occurrence of the primary endpoint of the study assessed 1 year after randomization. Objectives: To demonstrate the superiority of the interventional management on top of optimal medical therapy over optimal medical therapy alone in preventing the occurrence of the primary endpoint of the study assessed 1 year after randomization Design : Multicenter, prospective randomized 1 :1, open-label blinded endpoint study Target population : Heart transplant recipients, aged ≥18 years, without coronary artery disease-related symptoms, with angiographically significant coronary artery stenoses (≥50% anatomically adequate for a revascularization by coronary angioplasty with stent implantation, with no contraindication to dual antiplatelet therapy associating aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitorfor a duration of 12 monthsand with ni grade IA ACC/AHA indication for revascularization Inclusion period: 12 months (may be extended based on the inclusion rythme) Maximum duration of participation for patients : 13 months Total duration of the study : 37 months Primary endpoint : The composit of death, myocardial infarction, retransplantation, implantation of transitory or definitve ventricular assist devices, new or worsening heart failure, graft failure and/or a decrease of left ventricular ejection fraction of at least 25% compared to baseline.The occurrence of any event qualifying for the primary endpoint will be assessed by a Cox survival analysis stratified on center.The primary endpoint will be assessed 12 months after randomization. Secondary endpoints : Any of the individual events defining the primary outcome at 1 year Number of patients to be included and power calculation : 80 patients per group. A 1 year primary endpoint rate of 30% in the active and 50% in with an inclusion period of 24 months and alpha=5% warants a 90% power using a cox model.</detailed_description>
