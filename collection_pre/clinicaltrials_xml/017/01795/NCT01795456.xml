	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of contrast enhanced carotid ultrasound to serve as an indicator of disease activity in patients with Takayasu's arteritis or Giant Cell arteritis and to determine if patients with active arteritis have a thickening of their blood vessel walls compared to healthy people of the same age and gender.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carotid Artery Neovascularization in Takayasu's and Giant Cell Arteritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Takayasu's arteritis and Giant Cell arteritis are chronic, relapsing diseases of the large arteries which can lead to significant narrowing of the arteries through episodes of inflammation within the artery walls. The changes in the vessel walls will be determined by an ultrasound test looking at and measuring: carotid vessel wall changes called carotid Intimal-Media Thickness (cIMT) and the presence of new blood vessels (neovascularization) using a contrast agent. Ultrasound findings will be correlated with markers of inflammation in the blood, findings from other radiology studies (such as MRI) already ordered as part of routine clinical care, and physical exam findings and symptoms of consistent with disease activity. 15 arteritis patients and 5 healthy controls will be recruited.</detailed_description>
