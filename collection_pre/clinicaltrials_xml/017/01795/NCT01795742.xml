	<brief_summary>This is an equivalence study comparing an electric nebulizer with a human-powered nebulizer--one that does not need electricity--in the treatment of mild to moderate asthma exacerbations in a regional clinic in San Salvador, El Salvador.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Equivalence of a Human-Powered Nebulizer to an Electric Nebulizer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design is to treat individuals suffering from mild to moderate exacerbations of asthma with nebulized salbutamol (2.5mg). Subjects will receive nebulization using either an electric nebulizer compressor or a human-powered nebulizer compressor. Improvement in peak expiratory flow will be the primary endpoint. Blood oxygenation levels as measured by pulse oximetry will be a secondary endpoint of the trial.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Suffering from Mild or Moderate Asthma symptoms Increased respiratory rate, but not over 30 breaths per minute Reduced peak expiratory flow rate, but not less than 60% of normal Oxygen saturation levels reduced but greater than 90% Any other respiratory condition that would interfere with nebulizer treatment If any other medication is being taken at the time Pregnant women or women who may think they might be pregnant Never taken salbutamol before</criteria>
