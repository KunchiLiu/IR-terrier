	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of three Bayer Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems (BGMS) with neonatal blood. Blood samples used in this study were 'left-over samples'. The blood samples were from heel sticks of neonates, collected (into a tube) and sent to the laboratory. All meter Blood Glucose (BG) results were compared with capillary plasma results obtained with a reference laboratory glucose method (CobasÂ® 6000 instrument).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Routine blood samples (heelstick) collected from neonates (less than 30 days of age). A portion of the samples (approximately 10%) will be from subjects &lt;24 hours old. A portion of the samples (at least 10%) will be from subjects in the NICU. Sample blood volume must be sufficient to complete investigational testing in addition to prescribed testing.
