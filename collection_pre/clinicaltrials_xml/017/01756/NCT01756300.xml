	<detailed_description>The RENABLATE feasibility study CS156 (EC12-02) is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized feasibility study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of renal artery sympathetic denervation using the investigational Celsius® ThermoCool® Renal Denervation (RD) Multi-electrode Ablation Catheter and integrated ablation system to treat resistant hypertension.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subject is &gt; 18 and &lt; 85 years old. 2. Individual has a systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mmHg (≥ 150 mmHg for type 2 diabetics) based on an average of 3 office blood pressure readings. 3. Individual is adhering to a stable drug regimen of at least 3 different classes of antihypertensive medications, including a diuretic (with no changes for a minimum of 2 weeks prior to enrollment) at optimal dose and is expected to be maintained for at least 6 months. 4. Individual agrees to have all study procedures performed, and is competent and willing to provide written, informed consent to participate in this study. 1. Subjects with known/diagnosed secondary hypertension. 2. Subject has 'White Coat' hypertension defined as 24 hour daytime systolic blood pressure &lt;135 mm Hg as evaluated at Baseline visit. 3. Subject has aortoiliofemoral artery anatomy not suitable for treatment with the investigational Celsius® ThermoCool® RD Multielectrode Ablation Catheter. 4. Subject has main renal arteries that are &lt; 20 mm in length or &lt; 4 mm in diameter. 5. Subject has multiple main renal arteries in either kidney. 6. Subject has a history of prior renal artery intervention including balloon angioplasty, stenting or surgery. 7. Subject had a previous kidney transplant or is a planned recipient of a transplant kidney or is on dialysis. 8. Subject has a past history of unilateral kidney removal or has a solitary functional kidney for any other reason. 9. Subject has an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of &lt; 45mL/min/1.73m2, using the MDRD formula. 10. Subject has type 1 diabetes mellitus. 11. Subject has history of Myocardial Infarction, unstable angina pectoris, or a cerebrovascular accident in the 6 months period prior to enrolment, or documented widespread atherosclerosis, intravascular thrombosis or unstable plaques. 12. Subject had a significant surgery or cardiovascular intervention in the 6 months period preceding enrollment or is planned to have such a surgery or cardiac intervention in the 6 months period post enrollment. 13. Subject has hemodynamically significant valvular heart disease for which reduction of blood pressure would be considered hazardous. 14. Subject is taking systemic steroids or chronic daily NSAIDs. 15. Subject has a known allergy to Aspirin and/or other procedural drugs or contrast agents which in the investigator's opinion excludes him/her from the study. 16. Subject has a serious medical condition, which in the opinion of the investigator, may adversely affect the safety and/or effectiveness of the participant or the study (e.g., subjects with active systemic infection, subjects with clinically significant peripheral vascular disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, bleeding disorders such as thrombocytopenia, hemophilia, or significant anemia). 17. Women of childbearing potential with a positive pregnancy test during screening OR women who do not agree to remain on birth control until followup at 6 months OR lactating women. 18. Subject has a known, unresolved history of drug use or alcohol dependency, lacks the ability to comprehend or follow instructions, or would be unlikely or unable to comply with study followup requirements. 19. Subject is currently enrolled in another investigational drug or device trial.</criteria>
