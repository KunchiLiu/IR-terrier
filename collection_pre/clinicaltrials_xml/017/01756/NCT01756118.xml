	<brief_summary>Primary objectives: - To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BEZ235 when administered twice daily (BID) as a single agent in patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia - To determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) Secondary objectives: - Assess the safety and tolerability of daily oral administration of BEZ235 with a BID schedule - To describe preliminary anti-leukemic activity of BEZ235 in patients with acute leukemia - To correlate changes in pharmacodynamic biomarkers with basic pharmacokinetic data Exploratory objectives: - To assess pre-treatment phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway-related genes in blast cells and all other malignant cells derived from blood or bone marrow. - To assess the pharmacodynamic changes in components of the PI3K-protein kinase B (AKT)-mTOR pathway in bone marrow following treatment as potential predictive biomarkers of pharmacodynamic (PD) activity of BEZ235 in association with clinical responses. - To identify potential resistance mechanisms and biomarkers that may correlate with efficacy and response from blood and bone marrow samples pre-and post-treatment in case of resistance</brief_summary>

	<criteria>A) Target population for the dose escalation phase: 1. Patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) / breakpoint cluster region abelson tyrosine protein kinase 1(bcrabl) negative B or Tprecursor ALL relapsed after at least induction and consolidation chemotherapy or having refractory disease and for whom no standard treatment is available or considered feasible. or: 2. Patients with Philadelphia chromosome and/or bcrabl positive Bprecursor ALL or CMLBP who have relapsed after or are refractory to first and secondline therapy that included at least two abelson tyrosine protein kinase 1 (ABL kinase) inhibitors. If a point mutation threonine 315 to isoleucine (T315I) bcrabl mutation has been identified, prior treatment with a second TKI is not required. or: 3. Patients with Philadelphia chromosome and/or bcrabl positive Bprecursor ALL or prior CMLBP with presence of minimal residual disease (MRD) and the presence of T315I mutation or a highresistance mutation shown to be unresponsive to approved thyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). or: 4. Patients with a cytopathologically confirmed diagnosis of AML, who are either relapsed after or refractory to standard therapy, and are considered inappropriate candidates for conventional salvage therapy. or: 5. Patients with a cytopathologically confirmed diagnosis of AML who are previously untreated but due to age, poor prognosis, or concurrent medical conditions are considered inappropriate candidates for standard induction therapy, or those who refuse standard induction therapy B) Target population: expansion cohort The target population for the dose expansion includes all categories of AML, ALL and CMLBP patients as for the dose escalation phase. Inclusion criteria 1. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2 2. Male or female patients, age ≥ 18 years 3. Life expectancy of ≥ 6 weeks 4. Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent 5. Normal serum levels &gt; lower limit of normal (LLN) of potassium and magnesium, or corrected to within normal limits with supplements, prior to the first dose of study medication 6. Adequate hepatic function 7. International Normalized Ratio (INR) ≤ 1,5 8. Adequate renal function 9. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≤ 160mg/dL 10. HbA1c ≤ 8 % 11. White blood cell count (WBC) ≤ 30 x 109/L. Prior cytoreductive therapy with hydroxyurea, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, or corticosteroids is permitted. For patients with CMLBP or Ph+ ALL a prior therapy with TKIs is also permitted. Intrathecal therapy consisting of depocyte or triple therapy with methotrexate (up to 15 mg), Ara C (up to 40 mg) and corticosteroids (up to 4 mg dexamethasone) may be administered up to 2 weeks and 1 weeks prior to first dose of BEZ235, respectively. 1. Patient has received previous treatment with PI3K and/or mTOR inhibitors 2. Eligibility for allogeneic (hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) at the time of enrollment (as defined by disease status, performance status and availability of donor) 3. Patients with Ph+ ALL eligible for treatment with dasatinib or imatinib or with CMLBP eligible for treatment with imatinib, nilotinib or dasatinib 4. Patient has active uncontrolled or symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) leukemia Note: A patient with controlled and asymptomatic CNS leukemia may participate in this trial. As such, the patient must have completed any prior treatment for CNS (including radiotherapy and/or surgery) leukemia more than 28 days prior to start of treatment in this study and should not be receiving chronic corticosteroid therapy for CNS leukemia. 5. Patient has received wide field radiotherapy (including therapeutic radioisotopes such as strontium 89) ≤ 28 days or limited field radiation for palliation ≤ 14 days prior to starting study drug or has not recovered from side effects of such therapy. 6.
