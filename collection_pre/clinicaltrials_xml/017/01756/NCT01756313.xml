	<brief_summary>The objectives of this study is to investigate if pre-treating the skin with an ablative fractional laser that creates small micropores in the skin: 1. Increases the uptake of Methylaminolevulinat (MAL) in the skin. 2. Decreases the required incubation time of MAL when performing photo dynamic therapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>12 healthy male individuals were included. On the back, 25 areas measuring 2.8x2.8 cm were marked, plus one control area. We tested 2 variables. 1) Density of laser channels. 2) Methylaminolevulinat (MAL) concentration 1. Laser - Each area was randomized to receiving: - no treatment - 1% laser channel density - 2% laser channel density - 5% laser channel density - 10% laser channel density - 15% laser channel density 2. MAL - Each density was assigned to 4 areas. Within each density category, the four areas were randomized to receive: - vehicle - 4% MAL - 8%MAL - 16%MAL The uptake of MAL was evaluated by fluorescence intensity measured with a florescence camera at t= - 0min - 30min - 1h - 1.5h 2h 2.5h 3h</detailed_description>
