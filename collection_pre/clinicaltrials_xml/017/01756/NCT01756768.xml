	<brief_summary>This will be an open-label, single-center study to evaluate the mass-balance and pharmacokinetics of PD-0332991 in approximately 6 healthy male subjects receiving a single oral 125 mg dose of PD-0332991 containing approximately 100 microcuries of [14C]-PD-0332991. Subjects will be checked in to the research unit from approximately 12 hours prior to dosing and remain in house until greater than 90% of the administered radioactivity is collected from bodily excreta or until less than 1% of the administered radioactivity is recovered from excreta on consecutive days. This study will investigate the extent of involvement of the renal and hepatic systems in the elimination of PD-0332991 and will seek to identify the compound's major metabolites.</brief_summary>
