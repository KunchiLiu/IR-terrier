	<brief_summary>When there is a bone defect, bone transport is used to bridge the defect. Frequently, the bone in the docking site (where the transported bone comes together) doesn't heal. The objective is to study the effectivity of rhBmp-2 (inductos) to stimulate bone healing, in order to find new techniques to treat non-union of long bones. The method of the study is a randomized controlled trial, to compare rhBMP-2 and autologous bone grafting in stimulating bone healing in the docking site.</brief_summary>
