	<brief_summary>Upwards of 33-50% of cancer patients who smoked prior to diagnosis continue to smoke following diagnosis and treatment. With medical advances in cancer care yielding a growing constituency of cancer survivors, addressing nicotine dependence in this population is a priority. While PHS guidelines recommend acute treatment durations with approved medications for tobacco use, extending the duration of treatment beyond the standard treatment duration significantly increases quit rates, reduces the risk for a relapse, and promotes recovery to abstinence following a lapse. Varenicline may be particularly effective for cancer patients given the drug's beneficial effects on affect and cognition. In this trial, 374 cancer patients will be randomized to standard varenicline treatment (12 weeks active + 12 weeks placebo) or extended varenicline treatment (24 weeks active). The investigators hypothesize that 1) Extended varenicline therapy will increase 24- and 52-week biochemically-confirmed abstinence versus standard varenicline treatment, 2) Quality of life will be rated higher in the extended therapy group versus the standard therapy group, and there will be no significant differences between groups in terms of severe side effects, and 3) Improved affect and reduced cognitive impairment will mediate the effect of extended therapy on quit rates.</brief_summary>

Residing in the geographic area for at least 12 months. 6. Women of childbearing potential (based on medical history and physical exam) must consent to use a medically accepted method of birth control (e.g., condoms and spermicide, oral contraceptive, DepoProvera injection, contraceptive patch, tubal ligation) or abstain from sexual intercourse during the time they are taking study medication and for at least one month after the medication period ends. 7.

Note: Once participants are found eligible for the study, they are told they should refrain from using any nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for the duration of the study. If a subject reports an isolated (nondaily) instance of NRT use during the study, they may be permitted to continue. Alcohol/Drug Exclusion Criteria 1. Diagnosis of substance abuse or dependence that has been unstable in the past year. 2. Positive urine drug screen (for cocaine, opioids, or methamphetamines) at the Intake Session (unless taking opiate for pain management). 3.

Medication Exclusion Criteria Current use or recent discontinuation (within last 14 days) of the following medications: 1. Other smoking cessation medications (e.g. Zyban, Wellbutrin, Wellbutrin SR, Chantix) a. Note: Once participants are found eligible for the study, they are instructed to only use the smoking cessation medication provided to them by the study staff. If a subject reports an isolated (nondaily) instance of using a nonstudy smoking cessation medication, the study physician and PI will evaluate the situation and determine if it is safe for the subject to continue participation. 2. Antipsychotic medications. 3. Bipolar Disorder medications. Medical Exclusion Criteria 1. Women who are pregnant, planning a pregnancy within the next 12 months, or lactating. 2. History of epilepsy or seizure disorder (history of seizure requires Study Physician approval). 3. History of kidney disease, including transplant. 4. Uncontrolled hypertension (SBP &gt;160 or DBP &gt;100). a. Note: If a participant presents with blood pressure greater than 160/100 at sessions occurring on Week 0 (PreQuit) or at any other point during the treatment period, they will not be provided with/able to continue on medication unless the study physician grants approval. 5. History of heart disease, stroke or MI, unstable angina, abnormal heart rhythms, or tachycardia (if stable, requires Study Physician approval). 6. Abnormal ECG (unless approved by Study Physician). 7. Any suicide risk score on MINI, current suicidal ideation on Columbia scale, or selfreported suicide attempt. 8.

Current diagnosis of unstable and untreated major depression, as determined by selfreport &amp; MINI (eligible if stable for &gt;30 days). 10. Previous allergic reaction to varenicline. General Exclusion Criteria 1. Any medical condition or concomitant medication that could compromise subject safety or treatment, as determined by the Principal Investigator and/or Study Physician. 2. Inability to provide informed consent or complete any of the study tasks as determined by the Principal Investigator and/or Study Physician.</criteria>
