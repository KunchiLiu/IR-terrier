	<brief_title>Impact on Management of the HEART Risk Score in Chest Pain Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During 14 months, patients presenting with chest pain to the Emergency Department (ED) of participating hospitals will be included in the study. First, all hospitals will apply 'usual care' to all patients, i.e. risk assessment and subsequent management without application of the HEART score. Then, during a 14 month period, each 1,5 month 1 randomly allocated hospital will sequentially start to apply the HEART score in all chest pain patients (intervention period); during this intervention period patients with a HEART score 0-3 will not be admitted to the hospital (in accordance with the results of our validation studies), and patients with a HEART score above 3 will be treated according to current guidelines.</detailed_description>

Legal incapacity of every patient will be assessed by the attending doctor, according to the guidelines of legal incapacity. In case of doubt, consultation of the cardiologist (primary local investigator) will be possible.</criteria>
