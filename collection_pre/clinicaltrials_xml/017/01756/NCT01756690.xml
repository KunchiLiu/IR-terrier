	<brief_summary>A certain molecule floating in the blood may represent a risk of lung injury after a transfusion. We are determining whether detection of this molecule on a simple blood clotting test will predict the development of lung injury due to transfusion in bleeding patients with chronic liver disease.</brief_summary>
