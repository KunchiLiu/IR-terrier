	<brief_title>Eculizumab for Prevention and Treatment of Kidney Graft Reperfusion Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based on experimental data and supportive observations in humans associating complement gene upregulation with ischemic reperfusion injury, it is hypothesized that C5 cleavage is a key step in the pathogenesis of ischemic reperfusion injury following transplantation. It was further hypothesized that eculizumab, antibody that blocks C5 cleavage in humans will be an effective prophylactic agent to prevent ischemic reperfusion injury in high risk recipients. For testing this hypothesis, this study is a pilot prospective study to test the efficacy of eculizumab in preventing the development of reperfusion injury and contribute graft survival.</detailed_description>
