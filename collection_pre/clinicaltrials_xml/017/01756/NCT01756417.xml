	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether there is a drug-drug interaction between multiple doses of canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) and a single dose of metformin. The safety and tolerability of canagliflozin will also be assessed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Investigate Whether Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Interactions Exist Between Metformin and Canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is an open-label (all volunteers and study staff know the identity of the assigned treatment), fixed sequence (all volunteers receive the same medication on the same days), single and multiple-dose study to determine how metformin (a blood glucose-lowering agent used to treat patients with diabetes) affects the pharmacokinetics (ie, how the body affects the drug) and the pharmacodynamics (ie, how the drug affects the body) of canagliflozin (a drug currently being investigated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus). The effect of canagliflozin on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of metformin will also be evaluated. The study will consist of 3 phases: a screening phase, an open-label treatment phase, and an end-of-study (or follow-up) phase. Each volunteer will participate in the study for approximately 39 days.</detailed_description>
