	<brief_summary>This phase III study is designed to examine if low-risk (lymph node negative), stage I a2-II b cervical cancer patients treated by paclitaxel/cisplatin chemoradiation have greater toxicities but similar survival rate as those treated by radiotherapy alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Postoperative Chemoradiation v.s Radiotherapy for Lymph Node Negative Cervical Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cervical carcinoma is one of the most common gynecologic cancers worldwide. Concurrent radiotherapy with cisplatin-based chemotherapy has become the standard treatment for patients with high risk factors cervical cancer. However, the treatment modality in patients with low-risk (lymph node negative) is still disputable. It is not yet known whether cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy are more effective than radiotherapy alone in treating these patients. Therefore, the investigators are going to perform the efficacy and safety study of postoperative concurrent paclitaxel/cisplatin chemoradiotherapy vs. radiotherapy alone in lymph node negative patients with early-stage cervical cancer following radical hysterectomy.</detailed_description>
