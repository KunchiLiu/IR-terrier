	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation of the OrthoPAT Advance System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The OrthoPAT Advance system is being developed by Haemonetics to change the user interface, especially for adding calculations for Estimating Blood Loss- (EBL). The OrthoPATÂ® serves as the predicate device. The following items will be changed in the OrthoPAT Advance system compared to OrthoPAT: - Software &amp; User Interface - ability to enter irrigant and anti-coagulant volumes and allow Estimated Blood Loss (EBL) calculation to be made by OrthoPAT Advance. - Hardware - - Redesign of reservoir and filter to process blood earlier by reducing hold-up volume and improve fluid visualization in reservoir. - Extended battery life. It is not intended to validate the major changes in the OrthoPAT Advance device (reservoir / filter and EBL), which will be conducted as lab based tests. The correct functioning of the reservoir / filter and EBL changes will be confirmed in the clinical setting in this study. However the most rigorous challenge to the filter will be by presenting the worst case media and this can only be controlled in the laboratory.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Male or female over the age of 18 years Subject is scheduled for a total knee/hip replacement/ revision or a hysterectomy. Subjects determined eligible per site standard of care for use of intra and postoperative use of cell salvage device For subjects where product is transfused Subject is undergoing a trauma procedure where there is a possibility of contamination from an open wound. Patient is diagnosed with sepsis. Patient is diagnosed with sicklecell anemia. Malignant cells may be mixed with blood salvaged from the surgical field. Prostatic or amniotic fluid is mixed with blood salvaged from the surgical field. Blood salvaged from the surgical field may be contaminated from an active infection at wound/drain site. Blood salvaged from the surgical field contains topical hemostatic agents, antibacterial agents, or wound irrigants not intended for parenteral use. For all subjects: Subject is undergoing a procedure which involves high, rapid blood loss such as liver transplants, certain cardiovascular procedures, and trauma procedures where blood loss is high (per Investigators judgment). Any procedure terminated prior to completion by subject request, operator decision or error, or device error. Any subject with which at least 200mL of filtered blood or 1 full disc is not available for processing and data collection within the study.</criteria>
