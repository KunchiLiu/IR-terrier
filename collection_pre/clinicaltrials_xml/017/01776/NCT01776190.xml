	<brief_summary>The investigators are conducting an open-label clinical trial determining the effects of UVA1 phototherapy on cutaneous lupus (CLE) patients. Past research on systemic lupus (SLE) subjects indicates that this treatment is likely to be effective in treating cutaneous lupus with few side effects. The fact that most CLE patients are seen at dermatology clinics also increases the usefulness of this study because there is a large probability that phototherapy treatment will be accessible for many of the patients that stand to benefit from it.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low-dose UVA1 Radiation in Cutaneous Lupus Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study subjects will receive low dose (20 J/cm2) UVA1 phototherapy treatment three times per week for 10 weeks. Each treatment will take less than 30 minutes. This period will be followed by an eight-week observation phase to assess longer term effects of the treatment. Patients will be assessed for disease activity, and blood studies and photos will be completed prior to, during, and after phototherapy treatment. Optional skin biopsies of affected and unaffected skin will be performed at the beginning and end of the active treatment phase.</detailed_description>
