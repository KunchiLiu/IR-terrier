	<brief_summary>The purpose of this studying is to develop and characterize neuropsychological testing software for evaluating the prefrontal and temporal function of patients. As no software has been used for this purpose, this study will gather pilot data on the baseline performance of patients in a hospital setting that lack any neurological impairment. After creating this baseline, later experiments can be proposed to compare the performance in normal subjects with those who have neurologic injury or disease.</brief_summary>
