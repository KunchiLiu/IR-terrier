	<brief_summary>The low prevalence of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) among adult Latinas likely contributes to the high rates of cancer and other chronic diseases in this population. The goals of the current study, based largely upon the core principles of the Social Ecological Model, are to design, implement, and evaluate an innovative multi-level intervention promoting physical activity among churchgoing Latinas. The evidenced-based intervention targets three "tiers" of environmental influences (i.e., church, immediate neighborhood surrounding the church, and community) on activity, as well as MVPA-related personal factors (i.e.., intra/interpersonal, cultural, and perceived environmental variables). The physical activity intervention will be compared with an attention-control condition providing health education on cancer prevention and control via screening. Sixteen churches will be randomly assigned to either the physical activity intervention or the attention-control condition. The primary aim of the study is to determine whether a multi-level intervention will increase MVPA among Latina churchgoers in the intervention condition relative to the attention-control condition.</brief_summary>
