	<brief_summary>The purpose of the trial is to directly compare the Cobalt Chromium platform everolimus-eluting stent, Xience Prime™, with the Platinum Chromium platform everolimus-eluting stent, Promus Element™, in relation to stent scaffolding shape, position with the heart blood vessel and extent of tissue coverage (at 6 months) using optical coherence tomography. Hypotheses: 1. The alloy composition and strut design of a drug-eluting stent has a direct bearing on stent apposition measured using OCT. 2. Stent design and alloy composition have a direct influence on radial support and scaffold shrinkage.</brief_summary>
