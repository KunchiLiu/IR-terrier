	<brief_summary>The overall objective of BOLD is to establish a large, community-based registry (at least 5000 subjects) of patients aged 65 years and older presenting with new episodes of healthcare visits for back pain. BOLD's primary aim is to create an infrastructure that allows for the conduct of prospective, controlled studies comparing the effectiveness of diagnostic and treatment strategies for back pain in older adults.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The BOLD registry identifies subjects at the time of a new episode of back pain and captures data in a longitudinal fashion for up to 12 months. The registry captures self-report outcomes data as well as comprehensive utilization data including pharmacy and imaging data through the electronic medical record system. We are applying for additional funding to continue follow-up for up to 4 years from baseline.</detailed_description>
