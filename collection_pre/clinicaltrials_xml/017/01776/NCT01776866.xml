	<brief_title>Image Content Analysis of Dural-axis Rotational Versus Standard Coronary Angiography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prior studies have demonstrated that dual-axis rotational coronary angiography (DARCA) is associated with lower contrast usage and radiation exposure compared with standard coronary angiography (SA). Single-axis rotational coronary angiography (RA) has been proved by previous studies without any reduction in diagnostic accuracy compared to SA. However, the rotational protocol is obvious different between DARCA and single-axis RA. A recent study has assessed the diagnostic accuracy of DARCA, but this study was not designed for image content analysis and the number of patients included did not provide sufficient statistical power to allow a valid comparison of DARCA with SA. The diagnostic accuracy of DARCA aroused our attention.</detailed_description>
