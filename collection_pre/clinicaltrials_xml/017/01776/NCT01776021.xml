	<brief_title>Effects of a Cranberry Beverage on Women With Recent History of Urinary Tract Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Urinary tract infections (UTI) are the second most common infection of any organ system and the most common urological disease in the United States, with a total annual cost of more than $3.5 billion. Although UTIs can occur in both men and women, they are about 50 times more common in adult women than adult men. It is estimated that 25% of women diagnosed with a primary UTI will suffer a recurrence within two to three months. While no universal definition has been accepted, recurrent UTI is usually defined as three episodes in the last 12 months or two episodes in the last six months following initial infection. In an estimated 75 to 95% of cases of uncomplicated UTI, Escherichia coli (E. coli) is the underlying cause. Cranberries have historically been associated with urinary tract health, but only recently has the biologic plausibility of cranberry use in the prevention of UTI been addressed. Current research suggests that A-type proanthocyanidins, a specific class of polyphenolic compounds found uniquely abundant in cranberries, inhibit adhesion of bacteria (including multidrug resistant E.coli) to cultured epithelial cells of the urinary tract. This study will compare the effects of a cranberry juice beverage vs placebo on rates of UTI recurrence in women with a history of UTI.</detailed_description>
