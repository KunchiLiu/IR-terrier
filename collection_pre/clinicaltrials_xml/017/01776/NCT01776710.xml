	<brief_summary>A primary therapeutic goal for patients with intermittent claudication (IC) is to regain lost physical function through exercise rehabilitation. Supervised exercise programmes can markedly improve walking capacity, but these are resource intensive, National Health Service provision is limited, and patients cite accessing services as a barrier to participation. Increasing walking activity via a structured education programme might be a pragmatic solution for improving walking capacity, health and wellbeing in patients with IC; however, further research is needed to substantiate this. Hence, the aim of this project is to develop a pragmatic education programme to increase walking in these patients and to collect data on its feasibility to inform the development of a definitive trial investigating clinical and cost effectiveness. Focus groups will be conducted to inform the development of the education programme. Programme components will be theoretically-underpinned and evidence-based. The development of the programme will be an iterative process involving pilot work, feedback, evaluation, and revision. The programme will then be assessed in a randomised controlled pilot study with 6-week follow-up (n=30). We will assess the feasibility of the intervention and obtain preliminary data of its impact on important outcomes (daily steps/physical activity, walking capacity, quality of life, illness perceptions).</brief_summary>
