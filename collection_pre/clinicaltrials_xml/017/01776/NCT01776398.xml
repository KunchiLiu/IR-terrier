	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to obtain biologic materials from the blood, airways and/or urine of normal individuals and individuals with lung disease. The normal are used to establish a set of normal ranges for various parameters. These provide control information when compared to individuals with various pulmonary diseases, and will help in understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of various lung diseases. The underlying hypothesis is that the pathologic morphological changes in the airway epithelium must be preceded by changes in the gene expression pattern of the airway epithelium and potentially in macrophages.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collection of Airway, Blood and/or Urine Specimens From Subjects for Research Studies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a protocol to obtain blood, urine and/or airway specimens from normal individuals and individuals with lung disorders in order to carry out laboratory studies looking at genetic expression, gene transfer, infection, proteins, human genes, and to store specimens for future genetic studies. Specimens collected may include blood, urine and airway samples (nasal, airway brushing, biopsy and/or washings) from consenting subjects. Subjects will include both individuals diagnosed with lung disease and healthy control subjects. The purpose of this study is to obtain biologic materials from the blood, airways and/or urine of normal individuals and individuals with lung disease. The normal are used to establish a set of normal ranges for various parameters. These provide control information when compared to individuals with various pulmonary diseases, and will help in understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of various lung diseases. The investigators will use bronchoscopy (inserting a scope into the lungs) to obtain airway cells by brushing, biopsy and/or washings in individuals with lung disease and in healthy controls. By studying those cells, the investigators hope to learn more about the specific causes of lung disease, how lung disease manifests and progresses, and how lung disease can be treated.</detailed_description>
