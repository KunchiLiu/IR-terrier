	<brief_summary>High prevalence of obesity in children has increased associated complications such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension and fatty liver disease. Dietitians develop a meal plan that restricts caloric intake by estimating the resting and total daily energy expenditures.Estimation of energy needs is most commonly done using predictive equations. Reliable and valid energy requirements can be obtained using a traditional metabolic system, however this is an expensive option. Handheld indirect calorimeters may be a good alternative to measure energy needs. Several studies have been conducted to determine the validity and accuracy of handheld calorimeters in adults and health children, however, to the best of our knowledge, there are no such studies in the overweight and obese pediatric population. The purpose of this study is to validate a handheld indirect calorimeter against a traditional metabolic system in overweight and obese children. If handheld calorimeters can accurately measure resting energy expenditure in overweight and obese adolescents, dietitians will have an opportunity to tailor pediatric weight management interventions based on parameters that are unique to each individual.</brief_summary>
