	<detailed_description>Phantom limb pain (PLP) is a common disorder reported by the patients who undergo amputation from peripheral vascular disease, peripheral neuropathic disease, neoplasm or traumatic events. Even though the cause of PLP remains unclear and the large number of treatments has been suggested, there is no single treatment regimen proving long lasting pain relief for PLP. However Gabapentin is widely used and have been well suggested recently for the treatment of neuropathic pain. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy and efficacy achieved in using of extended release Gabapentin to offer effective pain relief, improvement of sleep function, and decrease problematic side effects related to the peaks and valleys of the drug's short cycle in patients with PLP. Gabapentin has been clearly demonstrated to be effective in neuropathic pain and epilepsy, but as a treatment option for post amputation pain, it has not been tested. Approximately, 20 patients will be enrolled in the study, after a titration of two weeks a changing in pain intensity and quality of life will be obtained at subsequent visits. We are expected that the accuracy will be of benefit in reducing the incidence of chronic post-amputation pain and improving clinical outcomes postoperatively.</detailed_description>
