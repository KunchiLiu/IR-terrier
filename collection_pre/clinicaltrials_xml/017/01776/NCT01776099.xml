	<brief_summary>In animal models and retrospective studies, certain food components such as sugars and fiber have been detected as potential agents to influence development and progress of type 2 diabetes. The DiNA study prospectively investigates, if non-soluble non-fermentable fibers (vs. soluble ones) and galactose (vs. palatinose) are capable to improvement metabolic parameters in patients with long-term type 2 diabetes and intensive insulin treatment.</brief_summary>
