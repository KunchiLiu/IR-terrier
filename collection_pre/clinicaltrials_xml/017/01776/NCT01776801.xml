	<brief_title>Assessment of Autonomic Neuronal Changes During Moderate Rise of Intracranial Pressure in Human</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>From preliminary data, we know that changes in ICP influences both systemic and cerebral haemodynamics, introducing the concept of intracranial baroreflex We have to i) confirm the presence of this intracranial baroreflex, ii) analyze the changes in autonomic function during moderate rise in intracranial pressure (ICP) in human, and iii) correlate the changes in cerebral and systemic haemodynamics with autonomic function.</detailed_description>
