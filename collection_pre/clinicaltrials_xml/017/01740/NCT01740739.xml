	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to explore the relationship between the ClearView scan results and a variety of cardiovascular risk indicators such as the Coronary Calcium Score, Framingham Risk Factors, Reynolds Risk Score, and biomarkers of inflammation. The ClearView device is a bio-electrographic tool that may assist medical professionals in rapid assessment of the systemic origin of the patient's presenting symptom(s). The ClearView is a potentially valuable resource that may benefit a physician's office by offering expedited differentiation capabilities. The subsequent results have the potential to include more data that would allow rapid patient diagnosis, triage, and treatment; optimized precious resource expenditure (nursing, physician, etc.); lower costs to facility, patient and insurance company; and decreased office wait time.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Sex: Male or Female Age range: 18 to 85 Patients who are recommended for and who have had a cardiac CT study that produces a Coronary Calcium Score within 30 days prior to the ClearView Scan or plan to have the CT within 14 days after the ClearView Scan. Patients who have had a blood test resulting in hsCRP, fasting lipid panel and MPO results within 6 months prior to the ClearView Scan or plan to have the tests done within 14 days after the ClearView Scan. The patient or legal representative is able to understand and provide signed consent for the procedure. Patients with pacemakers or another implanted electrical device, such as an automatic internal cardiac defibrillator. Patients connected to an electrical device that cannot be removed or temporarily powered off (i.e. monitor) during subject testing with the ClearView Device Vulnerable populations Patients actively being treated for cancer or with a previous diagnosis of cancer that required chemotherapy, radiation therapy or hormonal therapy. Patients missing all or any part of a fingertip (excluding fingernail). Patients with involuntary hand tremors /shaking of the hands that may prevent clear imaging.</criteria>
