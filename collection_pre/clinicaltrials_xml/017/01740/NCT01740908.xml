	<brief_summary>This is an observational research study whose purposes are to see the effects of repeated hyperbaric oxygen therapy treatments on the levels of stem/progenitor cells in peripheral circulating blood following five days of treatment, 90 minutes per day at 2.0 atmospheres absolute in 100% USP Grade Oxygen. Hyperbaric oxygen has a greater oxygen concentration than air at sea level. In this research, the concentration of oxygen will be twice the level of oxygen at sea level.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Patients recruited will be healthy volunteers with no current, ongoing infection or chronic disease. We will exclude or delay the treatment if our patients have an active lung infection, develops cancer, if the patient cannot undergo pressurization/ depressurization because of eustachiantube dysfunction and confinement anxiety. Any patient that cannot breathe without a respirator will be excluded.</criteria>
