	<brief_summary>Rationale: The treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation is often inadequate due to poor guideline adherence. An integrated chronic care program (ICCP) at a specialized AF-clinic was found to be superior to usual care provided by a cardiologist in terms of cardiovascular hospitalizations and cardiovascular mortality. Hypothesis: treatment at a specialized AF clinic is superior to usual care in terms of cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations, cost-effectiveness, quality of life and guideline adherence. Objectives: primary objective is to show that an ICCP reduces cardiovascular hospitalizations and mortality. The secondary objectives include cost-effectiveness, guideline adherence, quality of life, patient knowledge and patient compliance in medication. Study design: randomized controlled trial with two study arms: usual care provided by cardiologists (control) versus ICCP at a specialized AF-clinic (intervention) in 9 hospitals in the Netherlands. In total 1716 patients with newly diagnosed AF will be included. Total duration of the study is 4,5 years and total mean follow-up will be 2,4 years. Data collected at inclusion, after 3, 6, 12 months and every year thereafter. Study population: Patients older than 18 year with newly diagnosed AF. Intervention: treatment through an ICCP at specialized AF clinics, consisting of a nurse specialist, cardiologist-supervisor and a guidelines-based information-communication technology (ICT) decision support program and a web-based patient centered medication management tool and tailored telemonitoring.</brief_summary>
