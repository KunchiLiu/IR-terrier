	<brief_summary>The operational and favored standard therapy for the treatment of osteoarthritis in the distal interphalangeal joint is the arthrodesis, in which a titanium screw is used. Arthrodesis shows in the most cases the complete reduction of osteoarthritis pain and low loss of function. But restrictions are reported in fine motor skills. The operation with silicone arthroplasty is similar. As an implant, a silicone joint is used, which has been sufficiently tested at the metacarpophalangeal joint and interphalangeal joint. The advantage of arthroplasty is the function obtained in the distal interphalangeal joint and the resulting improved fine motor skills.</brief_summary>
