	<brief_title>Autologous Bone Marrow Stem Cells for Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is accumulating evidence that shows that the administration of hematopoietic cells into the brain in the patients with spectrum autism could help in the physiopathology of the illness. It has been found that after introducing hematopoietic cells in the subarachnoid space of the spinal cord, these cells may be transported through the cerebrospinal fluid and can be delivered more efficiently to the injured area, when compared to the intravenous route. Patients will be stimulated for 3 consecutive days with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and then their bone marrow will be harvested according to their weight. Bone marrow will be processed in order to obtain CD34+ cells and minimize the amount of red blood cells. An inoculum of 5 to 10mL of stem cells will be infused intrathecally. Patients will be evaluated with two scales "CARS" and the "IDEA" also we will check the clinical history. On days 0, 30 and 180.</detailed_description>
