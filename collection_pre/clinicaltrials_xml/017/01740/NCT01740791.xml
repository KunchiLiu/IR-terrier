	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, antiviral activity and pharmacokinetics of GS-5816 in HCV treatment naïve subjects with genotypes 1-6.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Antiviral Activity of GS-5816 in Subjects With Chronic HCV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Administration of GS-5816 will be limited to 3 consecutive days to minimize the potential development of resistance. All subjects will be monitored for up to 48 weeks post-dose to determine the persistence of viral mutations. Twelve cohorts are planned for the examination; within each cohort subjects will receive QD doses of GS-5816 with safety, antiviral activity and pharmacokinetic assessments evaluated at specified time-points during the study</detailed_description>
