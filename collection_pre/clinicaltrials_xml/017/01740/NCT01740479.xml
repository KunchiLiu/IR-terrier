	<brief_summary>To determine whether, on a background of optimal medical therapy, including ticagrelor, opening of all suitable narrowings or blockages found at the time of primary PCI for an acute heart attack is better than treating only the culprit lesion in patients with multi-vessel disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Complete vs Culprit-only Revascularization to Treat Multi-vessel Disease After Primary PCI for STEMI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine whether, on a background of optimal medical therapy with low-dose ASA and ticagrelor, a strategy of complete revascularization involving staged PCI using drug eluting stents of all suitable non-infarct related artery lesions is superior to a strategy of culprit lesion-only revascularization in reducing the composite outcome of CV death or MI in patients with multi-vessel disease who have undergone successful culprit lesion primary PCI for STEMI.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Men and women within 72 hours after successful PCI (preferably using a drug eluting stent) to the culprit lesion for STEMI. PCI for STEMI can be either primary PCI or rescue PCI for failed fibrinolysis or a combination strategy where PCI is performed routinely 312 hours after fibrinolysis AND 2. Multivessel disease defined as at least 1 additional noninfarct related coronary artery lesion that is at least 2.5 mm in diameter that has not been stented as part of the primary PCI and that is amenable to successful treatment with PCI and has: At least 70% diameter stenosis (visual estimation) or At least 50% diameter stenosis (visual estimation) with fractional flow reserve (FFR) â‰¤ 0.80 1. Planned revascularization of nonculprit lesion 2. Planned surgical revascularization 3. Noncardiovascular comorbidity reducing life expectancy to &lt; 5 years 4. Any factor precluding 5 year followup 5. Prior Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery</criteria>
