	<brief_summary>The preferred method for early detection of prostate cancer (PCa) in older men with family history is the Prostate Specific Antigen test (PSA test), although the method is imprecise. It produces a high number of false-positive results and increases the risk of over-diagnosis and over-treatment. Yet, an increasing number of men get the PSA test as part of unsystematic screening. Genetic risk assessment may be a better way to identify men with low risk of PCa. The main study hypothesis is that genetic information about low risk of PCa can reduce the number of patients who get a PSA test as part of unsystematic screening.</brief_summary>
