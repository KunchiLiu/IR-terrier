	<criteria>Patient will be dependent upon parenteral nutrition (PN) Patient will have short gut syndrome (loss of &gt;50% of small bowel) Patient's guardian/caregiver provides informed consent for patient to receive therapy Pediatric patient â‰¤ 1 year of age Expected PN duration is greater than 30 days Direct bilirubin &gt;2.0 mg/dL measured on two occasions no more than one week apart Liver dysfunction secondary to cause other than PN verified by standard of care diagnostic procedures and lab work to rule out alternative causes of neonatal cholestasis. Any patient in whom Omegaven therapy would be contraindicated, such as an allergy to any seafood product, egg protein, and/or previously established allergy to Omegaven impaired lipid metabolism severe hemorrhagic disorder unstable diabetes mellitus collapse and shock, stroke/embolism, recent cardiac infarction, or undefined coma status</criteria>
