	<brief_summary>This will be an open-label, non-randomized, multi-center, patient sponsored study of Adipose-Derived Stromal Vascular Fraction (AD-SVF) implantation performed intra-articularly to affected joints. The intent of this clinical study is to answer the questions: 1) Is the proposed treatment safe and 2) Is treatment effective in improving the disease pathology of patients with diagnosed Osteoarthritis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Adipose-Derived Stromal Cells Delivered Intra-articularly in Patients With Osteoarthritis.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AD-SVF will be collected from the patient's adipose-derived tissue (body fat). Using local anesthesia, Liposuction will be performed to collect the adipose tissue specimen. The adipose tissue is then transferred to the laboratory for separation of AD-SVF. In addition, patient's peripheral blood will be collected for isolation of platelet rich plasma (PRP), which are then combined with the AD-SVF for intra-articular administration of affected joint.</detailed_description>
