	<brief_title>Dexamethasone Added to Levobupivacaine Improves Postoperative Analgesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Operations of upper extremities are often performed in regional anesthesia blocks. Single-injection blocks are effective, but time limited. Adding 4mg of dexamethasone to 0.5% levobupivacaine will significantly prolong duration of brachial plexus anesthesia and analgesia for fracture operations of upper extremity. This effect will result in less opioid use postoperatively.</detailed_description>
