	<brief_summary>The Boston Scientific Helical Stent is a unique stent designed to improve flexibility and comfort. It is designed to conform more to the shape of the ureter (hollow tube connecting the kidney and the bladder) to ultimately improve patient comfort and decrease the need for painkillers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluating the Helical Ureteral Stent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ureteral stents have been used for many years for a variety of clinical indications. Many surgeons routinely use ureteral stents after the endourologic removal of stones to facilitate in urine passage and facilitate excretion of any left over stones. There is a multitude of literature that reveals that most patients find ureteral stents to be uncomfortable. This discomfort often causes pain severe enough that patients anxiously anticipate stent removal, and often request early stent removal, and/or require use of pain medications that have many side effects and cause further discomfort to these patients.</detailed_description>
