	<brief_title>Urinary Biomarkers For Objective Measurement Of InterStim® Response In Over Active Bladder (OAB) Patients.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will look for changes in protein markers that might reflect bladder symptoms before and after InterStim® implant.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>OAB subjects (n=10 Phase I and n=10 Phase II) Female Age 1875 years Clinical symptoms of OAB (urgency and frequency with or without urge incontinence) for at least 3 or the 6 months immediately before the first visit. At least 8 voids/day and an average of 1 nocturnal void over 3 consecutive days on baseline bladder diary. InterStim® treatment naïve or being revised with a new lead Pelvic mass, pelvic prolapse, urinary retention, and pelvic malignancies as revealed by physical examination/medical record review Implanted Programmable Generator (IPG) is not implanted/connected to the tined lead (failed Stage I) Revision of only the IPG (without replacement of the tined lead) More than one InterStim® device being placed (undergoing bilateral stimulation) Controls (n=10) Inclusion: Female Age 1875 years Deny history of OAB diagnosis or symptoms (urgency and frequency with or without urge incontinence) American Urological Association (AUA) symptom score of ≤4 Exclusion: History of pelvic mass, prolapse, urinary retention, or pelvic malignancy within the last year</criteria>
