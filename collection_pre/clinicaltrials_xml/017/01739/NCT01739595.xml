	<brief_summary>The purpose of ZA-302 is to determine the effects of Androxal on morning testosterone and reproductive status in younger overweight men with acquired hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (confirmed morning T&lt;300 ng/dL) and normal sperm concentration, compared to changes with placebo. Subjects must not have previously been treated with testosterone products within the last 6 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase III Study to Evaluate Morning Testosterone Normalization in Overweight Men With Secondary Hypogonadism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Protocol ZA-302 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-center Phase 3 study to evaluate normalization of morning testosterone levels in overweight men with acquired hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and normal baseline sperm concentrations. The study requires 10 to 12 clinic visits (2 for eye exams), and is approximately 4 to 5½ months in duration. Subjects will be treated for 12-18 weeks. At Visit 3 (Week 6) subjects who do not achieve morning T values ≥300 ng/dL will be up-titrated to 25 mg. Placebo subjects may be sham titrated. Up-titrated subjects will receive an additional 6 weeks of treatment (18 weeks total). A schedule of procedures and assessments is displayed in Section 4. The study will enroll up to 152 male subjects, up to 114 randomized to treatment with Androxal and up to 38 randomized to placebo, in a 3:1 ratio. Subjects must not have used any prior testosterone treatments within the last 6 months. Eligible subjects must have 2 consecutive assessments of morning T below 300 ng/dL and LH below 9.4 mIU/mL. They will provide 2 sperm samples at baseline, at least 2 days apart, another 2 after 12 weeks of treatment, and up-titrated subjects will provide an additional 2 samples at the end of treatment. After 12 weeks of treatment (V5) all subjects will undergo serial T assessment for determination of the Cavg. Safety assessments will include collection of adverse events, eye examinations, physical examinations and clinical laboratory assessments.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Overweight (BMI 25 to 42 kg/m2 inclusive) males age 18 to 60 inclusive 2. All clinical laboratory tests within normal ranges (any clinically significant deviation of laboratory results will require approval of sponsor) 3. Previously or concurrently diagnosed as having secondary hypogonadism characterized as having 2 consecutive morning testosterone assessments &lt; 300ng/dL, one of which must be confirmed at Baseline. 4. LH &lt; 9.4 mIU/mL (at Visit 1 only) 5. Sperm count ≥ 15 million per milliliter (assessed twice at least 48 hours apart) 6. Ability to complete the study in compliance with the protocol 7. Ability to understand and provide written informed consent 8. Agreement to provide a total of up to 6 semen sample in a sponsorapproved clinic on up to 6 separate occasions. 1. Any prior use of testosterone treatments within the last 6 months 2. Use of spironolactone, cimetidine, Clomid, 5αreductase inhibitors, hCG, androgen, estrogen, anabolic steroid, DHEA, or herbal hormone products during the study 3. Use of Clomid in the past year 4. Uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes mellitus based on the Investigator's assessment at baseline. Subjects treated for Type II diabetes will be allowed into the study.

Abnormal fundoscopy exam such as central retinal vein occlusion 11. Any condition which in the opinion of the investigator would interfere with the participant's ability to provide informed consent, comply with study instructions, possibly confound interpretation of study results, or endanger the participant if he took part in the study 12. Irreversibly infertile or compromised fertility (cryptorchism, Kallman Syndrome, primary hypogonadism, vasectomy, or tumors of the pituitary) 13. Current or history of breast cancer 14.
