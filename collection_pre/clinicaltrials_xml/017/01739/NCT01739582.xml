	<brief_title>An Extension Study of Enclomiphene Citrate in the Treatment of Men With Secondary Hypogonadism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is an open-label, multi-center Phase 3 extension study to evaluate the safety on continued treatment with Androxal in subjects who completed either ZA-301 or ZA-302. The study requires 6 study visits (1 for an eye exam) and is approximately 7 months in duration. Subjects will be treated for 26 weeks, starting at a daily dose of 12.5 mg. At Visit 2 (Week 6) subjects who do not achieve morning T values ≥450 ng/dL will be up-titrated to 25 mg. Safety will be assessed by physical and visual acuity exams, slit lamp and fundoscopy, refraction eye exams, clinical laboratory tests and adverse event reporting.</detailed_description>
