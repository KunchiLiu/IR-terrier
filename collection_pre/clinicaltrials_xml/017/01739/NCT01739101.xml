	<brief_summary>Many women and men are at risk for sexual transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancies and have unrealistic family planning intentions and insufficient knowledge of health promoting lifestyle prior to conception. Without sufficient support from the health care system this can lead to negative consequences. The aim of our study was to investigate if the usage of the Reproductive Life Plan in midwifery counselling increases women's knowledge of reproduction and particularly knowledge of folic acid intake prior to pregnancy. Secondary aims were to evaluate the influence on women's family planning and to further explore how women experienced the Reproductive Life Plan-based counselling.</brief_summary>
