	<criteria>Subjects must provide signed informed consent prior to participation in any studyrelated procedures. Male and female subjects in good or fair general health as assessed by the investigator. ≥18 years of age. Previous history or newly diagnosed elevated IOP (≥21 mmHg) with or without openangle glaucoma in both eyes. Normal result, or result typical for openangle glaucoma of the following assessments in both eyes or available results in writing within the last 3 months prior to baseline period i.e. up to 4 months before Day 1, on condition that no new ocular signs or symptoms (e.g. marked deterioration of vision, eye pain) has occurred since then which would justify a repeat examination: Visual field 242 or equivalent Optical coherence tomography (OCT) Best corrected visual acuity ≥0.5 (20/40) on the Snellen chart, or ≤ 0.3 logMAR Schirmer test (lacrimation) Funduscopy Pregnant or breastfeeding females or those with a positive pregnancy test. Females of childbearing potential who will not use a medically acceptable contraceptive method from selection and during the hole study. Females of childbearing potential not willing to use a medically acceptable contraceptive method from enrolment until after the followup visit. Any current disease or condition that might compromise the respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrine, neurological, haematological, renal, or gastrointestinal function. Previous chronic processes or with rebound characteristics that could interfere with the study according to the investigator's judgment. Body temperature. Intolerability of any components of SYL040012 or placebo. Unable to comply with the clinical trial requirements as judged by the investigator. Beta blockers or corticosteroids use (other than cutaneous or intraarticular) for the treatment of concurrent diseases, even if sporadically, or any ocular or nasal vasoconstrictor treatment in the last 15 days prior to the first investigational product administration Previous refractive surgery; cataract extraction in the last 6 months Previous surgery for glaucoma. Participation in a clinical trial within 2 months before the enrolment visit Use of any other investigational product within 60 days before the enrolment visit. Other drugs for the treatment of concurrent diseases are allowed. However, their dosages should be kept constant throughout the study. Use of contact lenses in the last 7 days prior to the first investigational product administration and wearing contact lenses throughout the trial History of ocular infection or inflammation within the last 3 months before the enrolment visit Angleclosure or pigmentary glaucoma. Chronic or current acute eye diseases such as scleritis, uveitis, blepharitis, conjunctivitis, or ocular Herpes simplex virus infection</criteria>
