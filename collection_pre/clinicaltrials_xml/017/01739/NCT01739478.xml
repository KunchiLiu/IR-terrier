	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to compare the effect of packing and non-packing on the healing rate of perianal abscess cavities. Secondary objectives are to assess quality of life, cost effectiveness and rate of abscess recurrence and fistula-in-ano formation. If there is no difference in time to healing and non-packing is shown to be safe, acceptable to the patient and cost effective, this approach may become more widely accepted.</brief_summary>
