	<brief_summary>Cell-free hemoglobin can be measured in the plasma of patients with sickle cell anemia, hemodialysis, after red blood cell transfusion, and in patients with sepsis. Cell-free hemoglobin in these patient population has been associated with poor outcomes, including an association with an increased risk of death. Acetaminophen may have a protective effect in these patient populations by inhibiting hemoprotein-mediated lipid peroxidation. The purpose of the present trial is to study the effect of acetaminophen on lipid peroxidation in adults with severe sepsis and detectable cell-free hemoglobin. The primary hypothesis is that systemic markers of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, as measured by F2-isoprostanes, will be significantly lower in patients with severe sepsis and detectable cell-free hemoglobin who receive acetaminophen compared to placebo. The secondary hypothesis is that patients with severe sepsis and detectable cell-free hemoglobin treated with acetaminophen will have better clinical outcomes, including decreased incidence of acute kidney injury and lower rates of hospital mortality, compared to those who receive placebo.</brief_summary>
