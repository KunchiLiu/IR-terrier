	<criteria>Have a diagnosis of relapsed or refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification that has relapsed after, or been refractory to, available standard treatments. However, participants who are intolerant of, or unable to receive a standard treatment are not required to have MCL that has relapsed after, or been refractory to, that specific standard treatment. Pathology must be reviewed and confirmed at the investigational site where participant is entered prior to enrollment Have disease that is assessable according to the Response Criteria for Non Hodgkin's Lymphomas Have given written informed consent prior to any studyspecific procedures Have adequate organ function including: Hematologic: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5 x 10^9/Liter (L), platelets ≥75 x 10^9/L, and hemoglobin ≥8 grams per deciliter (g/dL) Hepatic: Bilirubin ≤1.5 times upper limits of normal (ULN) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤3.0 times ULN Renal: Estimated creatinine clearance ≥50 milliliter per minute (ml/min) Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0, 1, or 2 Have discontinued all previous therapies for cancer (including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and investigational therapy) for at least 21 days for myelosuppressive agents or 14 days for nonmyelosuppressive agents prior to receiving study drug, and recovered from the acute effects of therapy (treatmentrelated toxicity resolved to baseline) except for residual alopecia Are willing to make themselves available for the duration of the study and to follow study procedures Are amenable to compliance with protocol schedules and testing Males and females with reproductive potential must agree to use medically approved contraceptive precautions during the trial and for 3 months following the last dose of study drug Females with childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days of the first dose of study drug Have a life expectancy of ≥12 weeks Are able to swallow capsules Are currently enrolled in, or discontinued within 14 or 21 days of the initial dose of study drug for a nonmyelosuppressive or myelosuppressive agent, respectively, a clinical trial involving an investigational product or nonapproved use of a drug or device other than the study drug used in this study, or concurrently enrolled in any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible with this study Have serious preexisting medical conditions that, in the judgment of the investigator, would preclude participation in this study (for example, pneumonia, inflammatory bowel disease, history of major surgical resection involving the stomach or small bowel) Have symptomatic metastasis to the central nervous system (CNS). Participants may have CNS metastasis that is radiographically or clinically stable for at least 14 days prior to receiving study drug, regardless of whether they are receiving corticosteroids Have received an autologous or allogeneic stemcell transplant within 75 days of the initial dose of study drug. In addition, recipients of an allogenic stemcell transplant must have discontinued immunosuppressive therapy at least 14 days before study drug administration with no more than Grade 1 acute graft versushost disease on Day 1 of Cycle 1 Females who are pregnant or lactating Have active bacterial, fungal, and/or known viral infection (for example, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen [HBSAg], or hepatitis C antibodies). Screening is not required for enrollment Have a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) with any of the following findings: ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, abnormal QTcB (defined as ≥450 milliseconds for males and ≥470 milliseconds for females), or evidence of acute myocardial ischemia</criteria>
