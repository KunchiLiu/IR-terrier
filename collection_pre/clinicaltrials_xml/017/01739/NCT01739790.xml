	<brief_summary>N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is described as having mucolytic and antioxidant properties. It is widely prescribed for patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), particularly for those who have accompanying symptoms of chronic cough and sputum production. Compared to placebo, high-dose NAC will improve Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire scores in patients with COPD and chronic bronchitis.</brief_summary>
