	<brief_title>Randomized Clinical Trial of Intravenous Infusion Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells on Cardiopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I-II Clinical Trial - Safety and efficacy of umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells (ucMSC) in patients with heart failure Randomized, double blind, controlled prospective study in patients with compensated heart failure in dilated phase. Thirty patients will be selected, who will undergo a strict 3-month followup of ventricular function before being sequentially randomized into two groups: the first group of 15 patients will receive a sole injection of ucMSC and the remaining 15 patients will comprise the control group. Every patient will maintain their standard treatment of heart failure, with maximum tolerated dosage without side effects. The day of infusion will be considered day zero. From that moment, followup will be divided into 0-3, 3-6, and 6-12 months. Clinical results will be analyzed after completion of 12 months of followup.</detailed_description>
