	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1 single dose study conducted to evaluate the PK and PD of pegloticase administered to hemodialysis patients. A single dose of pegloticase will be administered intravenously to male or female hemodialysis patients (N = 12) starting 3 hour prior to dialysis. The study consists of a Screening Period, a Treatment Period, and Follow up Period.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Assess Pegloticase (KRYSTEXXA®) in Patients on Hemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>End stage renal disease (ESRD) patients that require hemodialysis typically undergo hemodialysis treatment 3 times per week. As such, medications can be dialyzed off, reducing their clinical effectiveness; this study is being conducted to understand how dialysis affects the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of pegloticase.</detailed_description>
