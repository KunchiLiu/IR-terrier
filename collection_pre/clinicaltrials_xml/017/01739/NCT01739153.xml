	<brief_summary>The main objective of the current study is to examine whether a high intake of regular-fat cheeses (Danbo and Cheddar) affect blood lipids differently than an isocaloric intake of either other fatty animal food products or of starchy carbohydrates. Furthermore, effects on fat digestibility, blood pressure, anthropometry, bile acid metabolism and insulin sensitivity is investigated. To do this, a randomized crossover intervention study with 3x14 days full diet periods (cheese diet, meat diet or carb diet)will be conducted in 16 postmenopausal women. Between the diet periods there will be at least 14 days of wash-out where the subjects eat their habitual diets. Fasting blood samples will be drawn before and after the diet periods, and also a non-fasting blood sample will be drawn after the diet periods. Furthermore, total feces is collected the last 5 days of each diet period.</brief_summary>
