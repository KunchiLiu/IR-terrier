	<brief_summary>This randomized, open-label study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant Avastin (bevacizumab) in participants with initially unresectable, FIGO stage IIIC/IV ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer. Participants will be randomized to receive 8 cycles of carboplatin plus paclitaxel with or without Avastin 15 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) intravenously every 3 weeks in Cycles 1 to 3 before surgery. All participants will receive Avastin 15 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for Cycles 6 to 26. Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs, for up to a maximum of 26 cycles.</brief_summary>
