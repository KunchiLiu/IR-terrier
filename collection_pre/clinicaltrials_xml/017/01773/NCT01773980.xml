	<brief_summary>The goal of this project is to develop and pilot test an innovative approach for overcoming barriers to cancer screening among women with physical disabilities (WWD) in rural Oregon. Many studies have shown that people with disabilities receive fewer indicated cancer screening services and are more likely to have poor cancer-related outcomes, such as late stage at diagnosis, compared to those without disabilities.</brief_summary>
