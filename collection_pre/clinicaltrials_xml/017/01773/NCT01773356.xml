	<brief_title>Effect of Dihydrocapsiate on Energy Expenditure in Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Capsaicin, a substance found in chili pepper, is known to stimulate thermogenesis. Dihydrocapsiate, a capsinoid, found in the non-pungent CH-19 sweet pepper has similar thermogenic effects without the gastrointestinal side effects. The objective of this project is to test the effect of 12 weeks of daily consumption of 9 mg dihydrocapsiate on resting energy expenditure relative to baseline when compared to a control group consuming products without DCT.</detailed_description>
