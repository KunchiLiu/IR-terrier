Methods: In this double-blind, placebo controlled study, 300 adults patients ASA I or II, scheduled to undergo elective surgery, were randomly assigned into three groups of 100 each. Group L, recevied 0.05 mL/kg lidocaine (% 2 lidocaine 5 mL + 5 mL SF), Group A, 0.05 mL/kg lidocaine with bicarbonate ( % 2 lidocaine 5 mL + 1 mL %8,4 NaHCO3+ 4 mL SF) and control group received isotonic saline pretreatment in the dorsum of the hand, followed by propofol 30 sec later. A blinded researcher assessed the patient's pain level via a four-point scale.</brief_summary>
