	<brief_summary>This study is using a new technology known as high resolution manometry which is used to evaluate patients that have trouble swallowing or have chest pain that is not related to the heart. The investigator wants to learn how the different positions of the body, in a lying position, semi-recumbent, sitting position or standing up, and the amount of liquid affects the outcome of the test. This will help the investigator to determine a standardized protocol for patients with trouble swallowing.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The esophageal manometry will be performed in the motility lab at the Shands Endoscopy Center by passing a small tube into the patients nose, down the food pipe and into the stomach. The participants will be instructed to swallow a determined volume of Gatorade,depending on the protocol being followed. All participants will be starting in the supine position followed by semi-recumbent,sitting, then standing up. When the esophageal manometry is finished, the tube is removed and participation in this study is complete.</detailed_description>
