	<brief_summary>The goal of the study is to compare the radiologist confidence level in evaluating patients with known breast lesions using a carbon nanotube x-ray based stationary breast tomosynthesis imaging device. The comparison will be made against conventional mammography acquired as a part of a standard clinical workup. One hundred patients who are to have a clinical surgical breast biopsy will be recruited for the study. A reader study will be performed to evaluate the ROC characteristics of the system.</brief_summary>
