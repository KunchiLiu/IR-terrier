	<brief_summary>This study will test the hypothesis that adding pegylated IFN (IFN)a-2b to denileukin diftitox improves the potential of denileukin diftitox alone to deplete regulatory T cells (Tregs) and will thereby boost tumor immunity in patients with advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancers, enhancing treatment efficacy.</brief_summary>
