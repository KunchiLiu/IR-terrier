	<brief_summary>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder afflicting the elderly. Currently, some biochemical tests performed on Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) samples have demonstrated to discriminate to some extend between AD and non-AD individuals based on the levels of tau, phospho-tau or AÎ²42. We aim to investigate newly identified proteins whose levels increase during the Braak Stages of AD that are accessible in other body fluids such as blood, urine or saliva. The detection of these proteins would allow performing simple tests in case its levels were confirmed to be associated with the AD pathology.</brief_summary>
