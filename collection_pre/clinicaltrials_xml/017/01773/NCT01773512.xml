	<brief_title>The Prediction of Extent and Risk Profile of Coronary Atherosclerosis and Their Changes During Lipid-lowering Therapy Based on Non-invasive Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The fundamental aim of this project is development of reliable algorithm for detection of extent and risk profile of coronary atherosclerosis based on non-invasive examinations (carotid ultrasound, examination of retinal vessel, diagnosis of endothelial dysfunction, pro-inflammatory markers including new markers of atherosclerosis and gene polymorphisms) with maximal effort on diagnosis of vulnerable plaques. The second part of the study is prediction of coronary atherosclerosis changes during high-dose lipid-lowering therapy (rosuvastatin 40 mg daily). Coronary artery impairment will be examined by up-to date technology using the fusion of angiography, intravascular ultrasound and virtual histology for 3D coronary artery reconstruction together with information about mechanical properties of arteries like a vessel shear stress. This algorithm for non-invasive assessment of coronary impairment and its changes during will be used for detection of high risk patients (in terms of acute coronary syndrome development) and of patients with low response to statin therapy. Further target is detailed assessment of atherosclerosis development and its changes during lipid-lowering therapy.</detailed_description>
