	<brief_title>Caldolor Versus Caldolor Plus OFIRMEV in Total Knee or Hip Arthroplasty Surgeries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergoing total knee or hip arthroplasty procedures at University Pain Institute at Hahnemann will be included in this study. Following Institutional Review Board's approval, eligible patients will be selected from the Pre Admission Testing for total knee or hip arthroplasty surgeries planned at Hahnemann University Hospital. The cases will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into either Group 1 or Group 2. Group 1 will receive 800 mg Caldolor at the induction of anesthesia, followed by 800 mg Caldolor every 6 hours until discharge or for a total up to 120 hours (5 days) Group 2 will receive 800 mg Caldolor at the induction of anesthesia and 1000 mg Ofirmev at the time of surgical wound closure, followed by 800 mg Caldolor plus 1000 mg Ofirmev every 6 hours until discharge or for a total up to 120 hours (5 days) After the surgery, at the request of the patient they could receive morphine administered by patient-controlled analgesia pump, or by hospital staff. The analgesics and procedures involved in this study are all standard of care drugs prescribed and administered by the attending anesthesiologist for control of total knee or hip arthroplasty surgery related pain. Data collected for every patient will exist in the patient's medical chart as part of their standard medical care. No additional patient procedures or activities are mandated by this study. The data collection and analysis will be completed in duration of 1 year</detailed_description>
