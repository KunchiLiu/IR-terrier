	<brief_summary>The aim of our study was to evaluate the reliability of uncalibrated cardiac index monitoring based on arterial waveform analysis in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reliability of Cardiac Output Monitoring Based on Uncalibrated Pulse Contour Analysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using contemporary statistical method the cardiac index values obtained via uncalibrated pulse contour analysis with Pro AQT system will be compared with traditional transpulmonary thermodilution technique (Pulsion, Germany).</detailed_description>
	<criteria>elective offpump coronary artery bypass grafting age &lt; 18 and &gt; 80 years, preoperative ejection fraction &lt; 0.35, severe cardiac valve dysfunction or peripheral vascular disease, constant atrial fibrillation, simultaneous interventions (carotid endarterectomy, aneurysm repair, etc.), transfer to cardiopulmonary bypass.</criteria>
