	<brief_title>The Effects of Weight Reduction in IgA Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective randomized study in adult IgA nephropathy. The investigators enrolled 30 patients who have proteinuria exceeds 1 g per day with biopsy proven IgA nephropathy. The experimental arm recieves the non-pharmacological treatment, weight reduction protocol. All patients in this arm must be reduce their body weight in 3-5 % from baseline as protocol. Another arm is control group which recieves standard treatment of IgA nephropathy including ACEIs/ARBs for blood pressure control (target &lt; 130/80 mmHg). The primary outcome is proteinuria level. The secondary outcome is cytokines and inflammatory markers level including interleukin-6, resistin, adiponectin, leptin and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1.</detailed_description>
