	<brief_summary>Although expressed breast milk is considered the optimal nutritional source for preterm infants, the macronutrient content is insufficient to enable optimal growth during neonatal intensive care. Optimal dose and optimal mode of administration (standardized or individualized) of enteral protein supplementation to very preterm infants have not been established. This study aims to compare the effects on weight gain of different modes of enteral protein supplementation.</brief_summary>
