	<brief_title>Frequency of Residual Neuromuscular Blockade in the Pediatric Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study will be the first to investigate the incidence of residual postoperative neuromuscular blockade in the pediatric patient following the intraoperative use of NMBA's. If there is significant residual blockade present, it may be that these effects will lead to postoperative respiratory complications including hypoxemia, atelectasis, and prolonged oxygen requirement resulting in a prolonged stay in the post-anesthesia care unit.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Delayed Emergence from Anesthesia</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. Age less than 18 years. 2. Surgery requiring the administration of neuromuscular blocking, agents with planned extubation in the postoperative care unit (PACU). 1. Neuromuscular diseases which may prolong the duration of NMBA's or exaggerate the effects of residual blockade. 2. The need for postoperative mechanical ventilation. 3. Direct admission to the Pediatric ICU, NICU or CTICU.</criteria>
