	<detailed_description>This study looks to investigate whether patients with schizophrenia for 2 years or less may benefit from omega-3 supplements. The main hypothesis to be tested in this study is that white matter integrity assessed with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and erythrocyte membrane omega-3 concentration may provide the means for identifying patients most likely to derive clinical benefit from omega-3 supplementation. To test this hypothesis the investigators will enroll 58 patients with recent-onset schizophrenia into a 16-week long randomized double blind placebo-controlled study of risperidone versus risperidone plus omega-3 supplementation. Study assessments after consent will include a baseline MRI and an MRI at the final visit, blood-work, clinical interviews to assess symptoms, and medical assessments for side effects. DTI exams and peripheral omega-3 concentration will be obtained prior to the initiation of treatment and the primary outcome measure will be the total Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale Score. Specific aims are: - To examine the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids as an adjuvant agent in the treatment of patients with recent-onset schizophrenia. The investigators hypothesize that patients treated with omega-3 fatty acids will demonstrate greater Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) reductions compared to the placebo group. - To identify whether pre-treatment fractional anisotropy (FA) assessed by DTI predicts which patients will derive clinical benefit from omega-3 fatty acids. The investigators hypothesize that patients with lower fractional anisotropy will derive greater clinical benefit from omega-3 fatty acid supplementation. - To identify whether pre-treatment peripheral omega-3 fatty acid concentrations predict which patients will derive clinical benefit from omega-3 fatty acids. The investigators hypothesize that patients with lower peripheral omega-3 fatty acid concentrations will derive greater clinical benefit from omega-3 fatty acid supplementation.</detailed_description>
