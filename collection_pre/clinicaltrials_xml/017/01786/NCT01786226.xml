	<brief_summary>Objectives: to evaluate the efficacy, safety and quality of life by using 2.5 and mifepristone 5 mg daily doses to treat uterine fibroids over 3 months with a 9 months follow-up period. The hypothesis of the study is that the 2.5 mg dosage resulted in a lesser reduction in fibroid size but a similar improvement in quality of life when compared to the 5 mg dose.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mifepristone to Treat Uterine Fibroids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women, in fertile age or in premenopausal status, presenting symptomatic uterine fibroids were randomly assigned to receive 5 mg or 10 of mifepristone. The diminishing of prevalence of symptoms attributable to uterine fibroids is the most important goal to achieve under both treatments. The possible side effects of mifepristone are slight and women's adherence to treatment is remarkable. Also the reduction of the volumes of the uterus and fibroids contribute to enhance the wellbeing of subjects.</detailed_description>
