	<detailed_description>Measurment of anorectal function is traditionnaly made using manometric device composed of perfused or ballon catheters. This allows the recording of anorectal pressure on 2-3 sites. Recently, high resolution manometryu devices using &gt; 36 pressure channels have been developped. The investigators therefore aim to evaluate the usefullness of the high resolution manometry in patient with fecal incontinence in terms of feasability and diagnosis accuracy</detailed_description>
