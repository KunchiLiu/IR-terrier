	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if treatment with hormone therapy in combination with abiraterone acetate and prednisone for 8 months controls the disease better than treatment with standard hormone therapy alone. Abiraterone acetate is designed to decrease the production of testosterone (male sex hormones), which plays a role in causing prostate cancer to grow. Prednisone is commonly used to treat prostate cancer and is given along with abiraterone acetate treatment to help lower or prevent some side effects.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Groups and Study Drug Administration: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (like the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. You will have an equal chance of being assigned to each group. If you are in Group 1, you will receive standard of care hormonal therapy. The study doctor will decide what hormone therapy you will receive and will explain when and how you should take the hormone therapy and any risks. If you are in Group 2, you will also receive standard of care hormone therapy. In addition, you will take 4 abiraterone acetate tablets by mouth each day at least 2 hours before a meal and 1 hour after a meal. You will also take prednisone every day. About every 28-days is considered a "cycle." You should return all unused study drug and/or empty pill bottles at the end of each cycle. Study Visits for Group 1: On Day 1 of Cycles 1, 5, 9 and every odd cycle after that: - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs. - You will be asked about any side effects you may have had and any drugs or treatments you may be receiving. - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your liver function and your PSA and testosterone levels. Before the Cycle 5 blood draw only, you must fast overnight and in the morning for at least 8 hours before your visit. On Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your liver function and your PSA levels. On Cycles 3 and 7, this blood will also be used to check your testosterone levels. These tests may be done at a local facility and results faxed to MD Anderson. Study Visits for Group 2: Every 2 weeks (for the first 12 weeks), blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn to test your liver function. This may be done at a local facility and results faxed to MD Anderson. On Day 1 of Odd Cycles (1, 3, 5, and so on): - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs. - Your performance status will be recorded. - You will be asked about any side effects you may have had and any drugs or treatments you may be receiving. - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your liver function and your PSA and testosterone levels. Before the Cycle 5 blood draw only, you must fast overnight and in the morning for at least 8 hours before your visit. On Day 1 of Even Cycles (2, 4, 6, and so on): - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs. - Your performance status will be recorded. - You will be asked about any side effects you may have had and any drugs or treatments you may be receiving. - Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your liver function and your PSA levels. These study visits may be done at a local physician's office and results faxed to MD Anderson. Length of Study: You may receive the study drugs for up to 8 cycles. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits. End of Treatment Visit: When you are no longer taking the study drugs: - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs. - Your performance status will be recorded. - You will be asked about any side effects you may have had and any drugs or treatments you may be receiving. - Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your liver function, and to check your PSA and your testosterone level. You must fast overnight and in the morning for at least 8 hours before your visit. - You will have a bone scan to check the status of the disease - You will have a CT scans to check the status of the disease. Follow-Up: Every 3 months, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to test your PSA and testosterone levels. This may be done at your local local facility and the results faxed to MD Anderson. Every 6 months: - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs. - Your performance status will be recorded. - Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your liver function, your PSA level and your testosterone level. The follow-up visits will continue as long as the disease is stable. Crossover Study Phase: If the disease gets worse while you are on study, you will be eligible for the extension phase. If you received hormone therapy alone, you will be treated with the combination of hormones and abiraterone acetate plus prednisone for 8 months. If you received the combination therapy, you will receive hormone therapy alone. If you crossover to the other treatment group on this study, the schedule for visits in the extension study will be identical to the schedule described above. This is an investigational study. Abiraterone acetate is FDA approved in combination with prednisone for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have received prior chemotherapy containing docetaxel. Prednisone is FDA approved and commercially available as a corticosteroid. The use of hormone therapy in combination with abiraterone and prednisone in patients with prostate cancer is investigational. Up to 310 patients will take part in this multicenter study. Up to 310 patients will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
