	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if specific brain injury biomarkers have utility as blood-based traumatic brain injury (TBI) diagnostic and monitoring tools. This will be accomplished by examining the relationships between potential serum-based TBI biomarkers and clinical measures of injury severity, occurrence of complications, and outcome, in subjects with mild or moderate TBI as well as in orthopedic control subjects.</brief_summary>
