	<brief_summary>The general objective of this open, pilot study is to characterize biological parameters related to acute kidney injury among patients undergoing a programmed coronarography with injection of contrast material. The study focuses on two main factors that may influence acute kidney injury: (1) sodium chloride hydration strategy versus sodium bicarbonate hydration strategy and (2) presence of oral L-carnitine treatment versus absence of oral L-carnitine treatment. We will also test for a potential interaction between these two factors.</brief_summary>
