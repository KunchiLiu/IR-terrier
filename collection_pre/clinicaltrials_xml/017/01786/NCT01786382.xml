Concurrent social conditions (e.g., drug or alcohol abuse, transportation difficulties) that would potentially interfere with the subject's study compliance 4. Clinically significant illness within 30 days preceding entry into the study 5. Participation in an investigational drug study within 30 days or 5 halflives, whichever is longer, before Screening 6. Use of prescription medications within 14 days before Day 1 and throughout the study.
