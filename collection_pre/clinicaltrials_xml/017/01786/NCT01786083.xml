	<brief_title>Caring for Family Caregivers:a Research-action Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: In Spain, home care for the chronically ill and their family caregivers should be a priority in health and social policies due to the aging of the population and the progressive increase in dependent individuals. In our case, 88% of healthcare within dependency care is provided by the family and only 12% by health professionals. The family requires comprehensive and multidisciplinary ongoing care, in which the primary healthcare nurse plays a leading role. One of the areas involved is home-based nursing and counselling for family caregivers, in order to improve the quality of the care provided and to prevent issues arising that may adversely affect the caregiver's life. Method: This is a research-action study with a mixed analysis methodology. Quantitative analysis was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the Problem Solving Technique in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression among family caregivers. The clinical trial involved a control and experimental group and pre-post intervention measurements, using the Goldberg scale of anxiety and depression. The sample consisted of 122 caregivers who presented one of these positive subscales. The technique's application process was evaluated for the qualitative analysis, with a content analysis of the records of 10 nurses performing the experimental intervention.</detailed_description>
