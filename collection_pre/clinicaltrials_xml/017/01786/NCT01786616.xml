	<brief_summary>Polymorphism at codon 16 of the beta2-adrenoceptor (beta2-AR) affects the responsiveness to salmeterol in asthmatics. Data concerning formoterol are more controversial in literature. The aim of this study was to verify whether homozygote for arginine-16 (ArgArg16) and homozygote for glycine-16 (GlyGly16) genotypes differently influence the long-term responsiveness to formoterol.</brief_summary>
