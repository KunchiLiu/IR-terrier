	<brief_summary>Recurrence and metastasis are the main factors affecting the prognosis of liver cancer after curative resection. Establishing an effective prognostic evaluation method is able to not only assess patients' prognosis but also guide the treatment. At the same time, it helps us to gain knowledge of the mechanism underlying recurrence and metastasis of liver cancer and to provide the basis for the search for new effective intervention method. In order to establish an effective prognostic evaluation method, we select liver cancer patients undergoing curative resection in our hospital. We plan to employ various technologies such as gene chip, methylation chip and flow cytometry to carry out comprehensive researches on liver cancer cell genetics, epigenetics, stem cells and tumor microenvironment changes. By analyzing clinical information including pathological features, patients' response to treatment, relapse, metastasis and survival, we aim to obtain the important factors affecting liver cancer prognosis, survival, recurrence and metastasis in order to be able to find and establish the effective prognostic evaluation method.</brief_summary>
