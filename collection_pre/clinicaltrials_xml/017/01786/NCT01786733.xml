	<brief_title>Behavioral Activation - From Inpatient to Outpatient Services</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Psychiatric inpatient care is reserved for individuals with the most acute mental health problems. The period after discharge is associated with increased risk for relapse, non-adherence and suicide. Delivering high quality psychosocial interventions during and after acute psychiatric inpatient care is known to be a difficult challenge. This study will investigate the effectiveness of adding either Behavioral Activation or Supportive Therapy to the standard acute psychiatric inpatient care. Subjects with different psychiatric diagnoses and elevated depressive symptoms are assessed and randomized after admission. Therapists from the nearest outpatient facility initiate 12 sessions of Behavioral Activation or Supportive Therapy as soon as possible. The 12 sessions are delivered twice weekly at the inpatient unit or at the outpatient facility, depending on whether the patient is admitted or discharged. Treatment as usual interventions(medications, nursing etc.) are not manipulated in the study. The main assessment points are pre-, post, 6 months follow-up and 12 months follow-up. The main outcome measure and some process measures are also administered at session 3, 6 and 9.</detailed_description>
