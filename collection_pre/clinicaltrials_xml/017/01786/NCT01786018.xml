	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate progression free survival, transplant-related morbidity (TRM) at day +100 and at +365, overall survival and incidence of acute and chronic GVHD in refractory/early relapsed aggressive B-cell non Hodgkin lymphomas patients treated with allogeneic Transplantation after a conditioning with Thiotepa, Busulfan and fludarabin.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In the present study, it is hypothesised that patients with aggressive B cell lymphomas refractory to or relapsed early (within 12 months) after the completion of standard first-line immunoProtocol TBF2012 Version 1, 20 Nov 2012 9 chemotherapy can benefit from de-bulking salvage therapy (i.e. R-DHAP + bortezomib) followed by an allograft to improve progression-free survival. Patient inclusion criteria - Patients with refractory/relapsed aggressive B-cell non Hodgkin lymphomas after frontline therapy. - Patients with stable disease or partial or complete remission (PET-negative) after salvage therapy - Patients younger than 65 years old - A fully HLA-identical sibling or matched unrelated donor is available. Patients with one antigen mismatched donors can be considered - Patient must be competent to give consent Patient exclusion criteria - Patients treated with an autologous transplant as salvage therapy - Patients with progressive lymphomas despite conventional therapies - Patients with progressive lymphomas despite conventional therapies - Uncontrolled CNS involvement with disease - Fertile men or women unwilling to use contraceptive techniques during and for 12 months following treatment - Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding - Organ dysfunction defined as follows: - Cardiac function: ejection fraction &lt;30% or uncontrolled cardiac failure - Pulmonary: DLCO &lt;40% predicted - Liver function abnormalities: elevation of bilirubin to &gt; 3 mg/dl and/or transaminases &gt;4 the upper limit of normal - Renal: creatinine clearance &lt;50 cc/min (24 hour urine Protocol TBF2012 Version 1, 20 Nov 2012 6 collection) - Karnofsky performance score &lt; 60% - Patients with poorly controlled hypertension despite multiple antihypertensives - Documented fungal disease that is progressive despite treatment - Viral infections: HIV positive patients. - Positive serology for Hepatitis B (HB) defined as a positive test for HBsAg. In addition, if negative for HBsAg but HBcAb positive (regardless of HBsAb status), a HBV DNA test will be performed and if positive the subject will be excluded. - Positive serology for hepatitis C (HC) defined as a positive test for HCAb, in which case reflexively perform a HC RIBA immunoblot assay on the same sample to confirm the result - Psychiatric disorders or psychosocial problems which in the opinion of the primary physician or Principal Investigator would place the patient at unacceptable risk from this regimen. - Patients with active non-hematologic malignancies (except nonmelanoma skin cancers). - Patients with a history of non-hematologic malignancies (except non-melanoma skin cancers) currently in a complete remission, who are less than 5 years from the time of complete remission, and have a &gt;20% risk of disease recurrence. Donor inclusion criteria: - Related or unrelated HLA identical donors who are in good health and have no contra-indication to donation. One antigen HLAmismatched (9/10 match) donors will also be considered. - No contra-indication for the donor to collection by apheresis of mononuclear cells mobilized by G-CSF at a dose of 10-12 μg/kg of body weight. - Donor must have adequate veins for leukapheresis or agree to placement of central venous catheter (femoral, subclavian). Donor exclusion criteria: - Age &lt; 18 years. - Identical twin. - Pregnancy. - Infection with HIV. - Inability to achieve adequate venous access. - Known allergy to filgrastin (G-CSF). - Current serious systemic illness.
