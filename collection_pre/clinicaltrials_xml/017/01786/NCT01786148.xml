	<brief_summary>The overall goal of this project is to use technology to improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART)and increase access to ART adherence care for those HIV+ persons living in rural areas. The LIVE Network audio music program mobile application (app) is innovative, practical, portable, and could be rapidly scaled up to address the adherence self-management needs of rural groups nationwide. If successful, the impact on HIV care will be immense and could transform the delivery of HIV self-management and adherence education by overcoming barriers of geographic isolation, transportation, stigma and confidentiality in this vulnerable group.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The project has two primary aims and one exploratory aim. 1.0 Revise and adapt the Live Network (LN) program and manual for rural persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and develop into a mobile application. 2.0 Conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of the program. When compared with an educational music control condition at 3, 6, and 9 months post-baseline, those randomized to the LN will have: H1: Significantly higher mean antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence rates (measured by pill counts, self report). H2: Significantly higher mean levels of ART drug levels in hair sample analyses. H3: Significantly better clinical indicators: higher mean CD4 lymphocyte counts and percents, a larger proportion achieving virologic suppression (proportion with HIV RNA PCR &lt;50 copies/ml), and smaller proportion with evidence of drug resistance, all as measured by medical record review. 3.0 Explore: a) the effects of LN on symptoms and symptom management; b) the roles of self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, and personal goal setting as mediators, and depression and health literacy as moderators of adherence.</detailed_description>
