	<brief_summary>The purpose of this project is to investigate the effect of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) blockade in healthy subjects on the systemic proinflammatory state after a meal high in fat and glucose. Subjects will include normal weight, healthy male subjects (BMI â‰¤ 25 kg/m2) between the age of 18-45, without hypertension and clinical evidence of metabolic, cardiovascular or any other kind of diseases. After a 12h fast, subjects will be assigned to a combination of oral fat loading test (OFLT) and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (day 1), followed by a two week treatment with 50 mg eplerenone. After two weeks, subjects will receive the second OFLT/OGTT treatment (day 15). Starting 5 days prior to the first intervention (day1), the participant's usual diet (ad lib) will be supplemented with 2 bullion broths each day. Standardization of sodium intake is necessary as variations in dietary sodium intake may affect outcome measures. We will evaluate the following parameters at day 1 and day 15 of the study. Prior to OFLT/OGTT, and 2h, 4h thereafter we measure a parameter of vascular and systemic inflammation: IL-6</brief_summary>
