	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study investigating the use of abdominal binders after cesarean sections. The researchers are testing whether elastic abdominal binders improve postoperative pain control and reduce postoperative blood loss. Blood loss and pain control are both concerns after giving birth. It is hoped that the use of an abdominal binder after giving birth will provide a non-pharmacologic way to to reduce blood loss and manage pain.</brief_summary>
