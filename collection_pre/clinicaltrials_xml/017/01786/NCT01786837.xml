	<brief_title>Functional Magnetic Stimulation Enhances Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients With Chronic Constipation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this pilot study is to evaluate the usefulness of FMS as a noninvasive method to stimulate the GI motility in individuals with non-neurological constipation by adopting a 5-week conditioning protocol performed in a hospital outpatient setting. FMS has demonstrated the ability to generate significant rectal pressure and enhance GI transit in normal and spinal cord injury subjects. With proper abdominal muscle conditioning, FMS may improve colonic motility partly due to improved abdominal muscle tone.</detailed_description>
