	<brief_summary>This study will involve an investigational device, the Seventh Sense Biosystems TAP20-C. The TAP20-C device collects small amounts of blood from the forearm which can then be used for blood testing. The study will also involve collecting blood by fingerstick which is a common way of collecting blood. The SAFE-T-FILL Capillary Blood Collection system and the Terumo Capiject 1.5 mm Blade Safety Lancet will be used for this. The study will compare the concentrations of glucose, hemoglobin, and HbA1C in blood samples collected with the two different blood collection methods. Additional information will be collected about how the TAP20-C device performs.</brief_summary>
