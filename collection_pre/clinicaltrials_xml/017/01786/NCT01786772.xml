	<detailed_description>Novel rehabilitation methods, that specifically target decreased muscle activation due to joint pathology prior to strength training, have elicited greater improvements in muscle function and self-reported disability compared to traditional therapies. Preliminary evidence suggests applying cryotherapy to a joint prior to exercise can increase quadriceps activation. It is unknown if applying cryotherapy and intermittent pneumatic compression can also increase quadriceps force output and voluntary activation. The purpose of this study is to determine changes in quadriceps force output and voluntary activation following the application of cryotherapy and compression. The investigators hypothesize there will be an increase in quadriceps force output and voluntary activation following the application of cryotherapy and compression.</detailed_description>
