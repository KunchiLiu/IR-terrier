	<brief_summary>Vancomycin is an essential antimicrobial which is frequently used in the ICU for suspected methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. Therefore, it is vital to optimize the dosing of vancomycin for this critically ill population. The most efficacious method of administering vancomycin is debated in the literature. Since vancomycin is associated with slow bactericidal activity, it is important to closely monitor serum concentrations so as to achieve early target serum concentration, particularly when treating aggressive S. aureus infections. One study has shown that vancomycin infused continuously may enable faster and more consistent achievement of a therapeutic serum concentration when compared to intermittent infusion. A faster achievement in the goal serum vancomycin concentration would be a protective factor for intensive care unit mortality in patients with MRSA infection. Currently in the surgical ICU (SICU) of our institute, vancomycin is administered based on a vancomycin dosing nomogram. Less than fifty percent of the ICU patients following this nomogram achieved target vancomycin concentration of 15 after 24 hours. To better achieve target vancomycin concentration in 24 hours, we developed a new vancomycin dosing nomogram with a continuous infusion. The aim is to determine which of the two dosing nomogram is more efficient and safer for SICU patients.</brief_summary>
