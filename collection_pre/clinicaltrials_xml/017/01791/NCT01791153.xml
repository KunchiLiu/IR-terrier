	<brief_summary>This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) in patients with giant cell arteritis. Patients will be randomized to receive either RoActemra/Actemra 162 mg subcutaneously weekly or every 2 weeks or placebo for 52 weeks, with tapering oral daily doses of prednisone. After Week 52, patients in remission will stop study treatment and enter long-term follow-up, whereas patients with disease activity or flares will receive open-label RoActemra/Actemra 162 mg subcutaneously weekly for a maximum period of 104 weeks at the discretion of the investigator. Anticipated time on study is 39 months.</brief_summary>
