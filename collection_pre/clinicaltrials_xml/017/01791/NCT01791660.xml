	<brief_summary>Protocol is intended for the clinical evaluation of fat reduction in male breasts (pseudogynecomastia) using the ZELTIQ Coolsculpting System. The ZELTIQ Coolsculpting system has received market clearance from the U.S.FDA for non-invasive fat layer reduction in the flanks, and is commercially available. Primary study endpoint is changes in the shape and reduction of the fat in the breast as established by photographic imaging and ultrasound imaging of the treated area. Secondary endpoints will provide supportive data to evaluate device performance (subject satisfaction &amp; fat reduction measured with ultrasound).</brief_summary>
