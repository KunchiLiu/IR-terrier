	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the absorption (the way the drug enters the body), metabolism (the way the drug is broken down in the body), and excretion (the way drug leaves the body) of canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) in healthy male volunteers after a single dose of radiolabeled 14C-canagliflozin (14C-JNJ-28431754). The safety and tolerability of canagliflozin will also be assessed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Investigate the Absorption, Metabolism, and Excretion of Canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) in Healthy Male Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be an open label (all volunteers and study staff know the identity of the assigned treatment), single dose, single center study to investigate the absorption, metabolism, and excretion of canagliflozin (a drug currently being investigated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus). The study will consist of 3 phases: a screening phase, an open-label treatment phase, and an end-of study (or follow-up) phase. On Day 1, all volunteers will receive a single oral dose of radiolabeled 14C-canagliflozin which contains 196 mg of canagliflozin and approximately 40 microcurie (1480kBq) of radioactivity. The International Commission on Radiological Protection considers this amount of radioactivity to be acceptable for this type of study. The radioactivity allows the amount of canagliflozin and its metabolites (break-down products) to be more precisely measured in blood, plasma, urine, and feces samples, which will be collected from each volunteer. The total duration of the study is approximately 5 weeks (including screening and follow-up); this time will be increased by 6 days in volunteers who have a slower rate of excretion of canagliflozin.</detailed_description>
