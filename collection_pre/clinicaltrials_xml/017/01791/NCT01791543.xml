	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of a new device called an Intramural Needle Ablation Catheter (INA catheter). The INA catheter is used for locating and ablating ventricular tachycardia that has failed standard radiofrequency ablation. This approach is desirable because some people have ventricular tachycardia that originates deep within the heart muscle where it is not abolished by ablation with standard catheters. The investigators seek to determine whether the INA catheter can potentially help people who have ventricular tachycardia that has failed standard radiofrequency ablation. The investigators also want to determine if it is likely to be safe, without excessive side effects.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia or incessant ventricular arrhythmia (including unifocal PVCs, couplets, Nonsustained VT) that is causing a decline in LV ejection fraction to less than 40% Arrhythmia meet the following criteria: 1. VT or ventricular arrhythmia is recurrent and symptomatic or causing a decrease in ventricular function 2. prior antiarrhythmic drug therapy has failed due to recurrent VT, toxicity, or intolerance Age 18 or older Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction &gt; 10% as estimated by echocardiography,contrast ventriculography or radionuclide imaging within the previous 90 days Failed prior VT ablation due to spontaneous recurrence of the arrhythmia. Able and willing to comply with all pre, post, and followup testing and requirements Signed Informed Consent Patients with idiopathic VT defined as VT that originates from a region without evidence of scar detected by MRI or voltage mapping in a patient without other evidence of heart disease that is not causing significant depression of ventricular function. Definite protruding left ventricular thrombus on preablation echocardiography when LV ablation is required. Thrombotic myocardial infarction within the preceding two (2) months. Other disease process that is likely to limit survival to less than 12 months. Class IV heart failure, unless heart failure is due to frequent or incessant VT. Contraindication to heparin. Allergy to radiographic contrast dye. Severe aortic stenosis Severe mitral regurgitation with a flail mitral valve leaflet. Significant congenital anomaly or medical problem that in the opinion of the principal investigator would preclude enrollment into the study. Enrolled in another investigational study evaluating a drug or device. Unstable angina that is not due to frequent or incessant VT. Women who are pregnant. Thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt; 50,000) or coagulopathy. Acute noncardiovascular illness or systemic infection. Cardiogenic shock unless it is due to incessant VT</criteria>
