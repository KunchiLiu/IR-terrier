	<brief_summary>Acute respiratory infection and acute diarrhea are among the most prevalent diseases of childhood increase the burden of morbidity and mortality in children under 5 years. Among the possible strategies for its prevention is important to count on good nutritional status for use in developing a good immune response to infections. Zinc deficiency has been shown to favor the development of infections and has been considered a real public health problem. Within the zinc compounds used are zinc amino acid chelate and zinc sulphate, the first that has shown evidence of being better absorbed and tolerated. We propose a study showing the effectiveness of zinc amino acid chelate and zinc sulphate in the prevention of acute diarrheal disease and acute respiratory infection.</brief_summary>
