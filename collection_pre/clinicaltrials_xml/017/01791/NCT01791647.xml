	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to compare the effects of six months treatment of two insulin-lowering therapies on the clinical and endocrine-metabolic parameters in obese women affected by polycystic ovary syndrome. The study group includes 40 patients, randomly allocated to subgroup A (metformin 1500 mg/day) and subgroup B (myo-inositol 1500 mg/day). The investigations include menstrual pattern and hirsutism score evaluation, hormonal assays, oral glucose tolerance test, euglycemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp and lipid profile at baseline and after six months of treatment.</brief_summary>
