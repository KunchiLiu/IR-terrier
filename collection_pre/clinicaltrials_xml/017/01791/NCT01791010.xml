	<brief_summary>Aging causes anatomical and physiological changes in the respiratory system and respiratory muscle strength with decline in its maximum function. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of inspiratory muscle training on respiratory muscle strength, thickness of the diaphragm and diaphragmatic mobility in older women. The investigators' hypothesis is that inspiratory muscle training improves respiratory muscle strength, the thickness of the diaphragm and diaphragmatic mobility in older women.</brief_summary>
