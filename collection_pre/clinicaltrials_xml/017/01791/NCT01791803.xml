	<brief_summary>Smoking-related cardiopulmonary diseases account for a large number of hospital admissions. We investigated the efficacy of hypnotherapy as an aid to a counseling-based smoking cessation program in improving quit rates of hospitalized smoking patients at 12 and 26 weeks after hospital discharge. We compared outcomes with hospitalized patients who received more conventional therapy, namely nicotine replacement therapy, or patients who decided to quit on their own. We also compared smoking cessation rates at 12 and 26 weeks after hospitalization among patients admitted with a cardiac or pulmonary diagnosis.</brief_summary>
