	<brief_summary>This pilot study will evaluate the effects of the anti-diabetic drug Bydureon (exenatide extended-release formulation) on blood sugar levels and serum markers of inflammation in a cohort of 12 HIV-infected adults on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) with untreated diabetes mellitus. Previous studies have shown that high levels of persistent systemic inflammation predict the development of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in HIV-infected persons on cART (a group at very high risk of atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction). Bydureon has demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory effects in prior studies of non-HIV infected persons, which suggests that this agent may represent a unique and preferred medication for the treatment of insulin resistance in HIV-infected adults. The Investigators hypothesize that short-term (16 weeks) therapy with Bydureon will improve glucose tolerance and significantly reduce circulating plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and highly-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), two biomarkers strongly implicated in the development of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in diabetic, HIV-infected, cART-treated adults.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>No further information. This was a single-arm trial to add an additional anti-diabetic medication to patients already known to be diabetic. The primary endpoint assessed whether the intervention reduced inflammation. There was no control arm.</detailed_description>
