	<brief_summary>The "d2 test of attention" has been used in studies regarding sleep deprivation due to night shifts in hospital staff, in order to determine whether sleep deprivation has an impact on performance. However, by repeating the test there appears to be a test-retest effect, as the participants improve when performing the test more than once. The aim of this study is to determine, whether the "d2 test of attention" has a test-retest effect.</brief_summary>
