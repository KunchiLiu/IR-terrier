	<brief_summary>Following the concept of "peak concentration hypothesis", which suggest the cutting peak of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators would result in restoring a situation of immunohomeostasis. The investigators conducted the prospective randomized controlled trial aimed to compare the clearance efficacy between on-line hemodiafiltration and high-flux hemodialysis in sepsis-related acute kidney injury patients. The lowering cytokines level during sepsis is postulated to improved outcomes in sepsis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1. Blood samples were taken from patients before and at the end of 4-hour in the first dialysis session. The percentage of reductions were calculated from the before and ending samples. The values of postfilter samples were corrected for changes in plasma volume, based on hemoglobin (Hb) of prefilter. 2. VEGF and other cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-α) were determined in the plasma separated from EDTA blood. After collection, plasma separation was achieved by centrifugation for 10 min at 1,500 g. Immediately after separation, the samples were stored at -70 ºC until further analysis. 3. All determinations were carried out in duplicate. The panels of cytokines (VEGF, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-α) were measured using the Luminex xMap-based multiplex technology. Assays were performed using the MILLIPLEX MAP (multi-analyte panels) 5-plex Cytokine Kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA) on the Luminex® instrument according to the manufacturer's procedure.</detailed_description>
