	<brief_title>Hospital Mortality in Patients Submitted to Pharmacoinvasive Strategy With Tenecteplase (TNK)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary percutaneous coronary intervention is the main therapy for patients with ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction. However, a significant portion of these patients won't receive optimal treatment due to the small number of tertiary centers with interventional laboratories available for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Specially in large urban centers and rural areas, where tertiary care hospitals are restricted to a specific region, alternative approaches must be developed. The pharmacoinvasive strategy has emerged as an alternative for patients admitted to primary care centers. It is based in up-front intravenous thrombolytic therapy and transfer to a tertiary center where early, systematic, coronary intervention will be performed between 3 to 24 hours after the administration of thrombolytic drugs, even in cases in which successful reperfusion was obtained.</detailed_description>
