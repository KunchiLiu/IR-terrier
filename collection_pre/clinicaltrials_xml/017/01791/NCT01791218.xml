	<brief_summary>A substantial proportion of patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting have a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation has adverse short-and long term postoperative effects. Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) seems to be effective treatment for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. PVI can be done concomitantly with coronary artery bypass grafting, aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis and combination of them. Procedure is well defined and safe. There is a lack of convincing evidence of the effect on postoperative atrial fibrillation burden, quality of life and symptoms especially in correlation with atrial fibrillation paroxysms.</brief_summary>
