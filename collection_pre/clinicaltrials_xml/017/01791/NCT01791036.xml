	<brief_summary>Adductor canal block will provide adequate analgesia to patients undergoing arthroscopic ACL reconstruction surgery, yet result in less motor blockade than a femoral block.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adductor Canal Block In Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to demonstrate that postoperative analgesia produced by the adductor canal block is not inferior to that produced by femoral nerve block in patients undergoing arthroscopic ACL reconstruction surgery. The study will also compare the degree of motor blockade of the adductor canal block to that of the femoral nerve block.</detailed_description>
