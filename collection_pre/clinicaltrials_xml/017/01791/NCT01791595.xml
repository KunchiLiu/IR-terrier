	<brief_summary>The main aims of this clinical study are to find out the maximum dose that can be given safely to patients, the potential side effects of the drug and how they can be managed and what happens to AZD3965 inside the body. AZD3965 is a type of drug called a monocarboxylate transporter 1 inhibitor which is being used to stop the growth of cancer cells and kill cancer cells by blocking the action of one of the proteins involved in moving chemical compounds in and out of the cells of the body. This will be the first time that this type of drug has been given to patients. The drug is a capsule and is taken daily. The study is in two parts. In Part 1, small groups of patients will be treated at increasing doses to find the highest safe dose and best dose to give to patients in Part 2 of the study. Approximately 18 patients with advanced solid tumours or lymphomas will be treated in this part. In Part 2, the dose found to be safe in Part 1 will be given to three groups of patients with either prostate cancer, gastric cancer or diffuse large B cell lymphoma. 15 patients will be treated in each group. Patients will need to visit the hospital weekly for two months and then every fortnight. Patients will have regular blood and urine tests, scans, heart traces and eye tests amongst other clinical tests. Research blood samples will also be taken to look at what happens to the drug inside the body. Treatment will continue until a patient's cancer starts growing but can continue for up to a maximum of 12 months if the cancer is responding to the drug. It is important to explain that this is the first study of this drug and patients will have advanced cancer so it is unlikely that patients will benefit directly from taking part but the study may help improve future treatment of cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Trial of AZD3965 in Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part 1 will follow a rolling six dose escalation schedule of AZD3965 until a tolerated dose at which MCT1 is inhibited (as measured by at least a four-fold change relative to baseline in peak lactate levels in PBMCs) and/or the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined. Approximately 36 patients with advanced solid tumours or lymphoma will be entered into Part 1. The final number will depend on the number of dose escalations required to reach MTD or the tolerated dose at which MCT1 is inhibited. A recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) will be proposed from the safety, pharmacokinetic, and proof of mechanism of lactate transport inhibition in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) results from Part 1. All patients in Part 2 will be treated at this RP2D to further explore the tolerability of this dose and schedule and to explore proof of principle of MCT1 inhibition in tumour types that were shown to express MCT1 (prostate) or in which AZD3965 showed some effect pre-clinically (gastric and diffuse large B cell lymphoma).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Part 1: Histologically or cytologically proven advanced solid tumour or lymphoma, refractory to conventional treatment or for which no conventional therapy exists. Available archived tumour samples. Part 2: Histologically proven castration resistant prostate cancer, diffuse large Bcell lymphoma or gastric cancer, which is refractory to conventional treatment or for which no conventional therapy exists or has been refused by the patient. Available archived tumour samples. Measurable disease according to RECIST criteria version 1.1 or documented rising prostatespecific antigen (PSA) for prostate cancer. 2. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks 3. World Health Organization (WHO) performance status of 0 or 1 (Appendix 1) 4. Haematological and biochemical indices within the ranges shown below. These measurements must be performed within one week (Day 14 to Day 7) before the patient receives their first dose of AZD3965. Laboratory Test Value required Haemoglobin (Hb) ≥ 9.0 g/dL or ≥10.0 g/dL if transfusion within last 4 weeks Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10^9/L Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase(AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≤ 2.5 x ULN or ≤ 5 x ULN in presence of liver metastases Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≤ 5.0 x ULN in presence of bone metastases Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) Either: Calculated creatinine clearance Or: Isotope clearance measurement (uncorrected) ≥ 50 mL/min Prothrombin time &lt;1.5 x ULN Glucose (fasting) &lt; 7.8 mmol/L 5. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)&gt;50% 6. 18 years or over 7. Written (signed and dated) informed consent and be capable of co operating with treatment and followup 1. Radiotherapy (except for palliative reasons), endocrine therapy, immunotherapy or chemotherapy during the previous four weeks (six weeks for nitrosoureas, MitomycinC and 4 weeks for investigational medicinal products) before treatment. Part 2 gastric patients only: received more than two lines of chemotherapy for advanced disease 2. Ongoing toxic manifestations of previous treatments. Exceptions to this are alopecia or certain Grade 1 toxicities, which in the opinion of the Investigator and the DDO should not exclude the patient. 3. Known brain or leptomeningeal metastases. 4. Patients with known retinal disease or macular degeneration affecting visual acuity as assessed by ophthalmologic tests. 5. Ability to become pregnant (or already pregnant or lactating). However, those female patients who have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test before enrollment and agree to use two highly effective forms of contraception (oral, injected or implanted hormonal contraception and condom, have a intrauterine device and condom, diaphragm with spermicidal gel and condom) during the trial and for six months afterwards are considered eligible. 6. Male patients with partners of childbearing potential (unless they agree to take measures not to father children by using one form of highly effective contraception [condom plus spermicide] during the trial and for six months afterwards). Men with pregnant or lactating partners should be advised to use barrier method contraception (for example, condom plus spermicidal gel) to prevent exposure to the foetus or neonate. 7. Any major surgery in the preceding eight weeks prior to the start of treatment or major thoracic or abdominal surgery from which the patient has not yet recovered. 8. Patients who are unable to swallow oral medication. 9. Alterations to corticosteroid dose within 2 weeks prior to first dose of AZD3965. 10. Gastrointestinal disorders likely to interfere with absorption of the study drug (e.g. partial bowel obstruction or malabsorption). 11. At high medical risk because of nonmalignant systemic disease including active uncontrolled infection. 12. Known to be serologically positive for hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). (N.B. Mandatory testing not required). 13. History of serious allergy or autoimmune disease. 14.

Acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction or unstable angina) 2. congestive heart failure requiring therapy; Severe valvular heart disease (as defined by British Society of Echocardiography) Presence of an atrial or ventricular arrhythmia, other than atrial fibrillation with well controlled ventricular rate, for which treatment is indicated (antiarrhythmic drugs or implantable cardioverter defibrillator) First, second or third degree heart block with or without symptoms unless functioning pacemaker QTc &gt; 450 msec in adult male and &gt; 460 msec in adult females (QTc to be verified manually) History of congenital long QT syndrome History of Torsade de Pointes (or any concurrent medication with a known risk of inducing Torsades de Pointes) See Appendix 5 Uncontrolled hypertension (BP ≥ 160/100mmHg despite medical therapy) 16. Prior allogeneic bone marrow transplant or have had extensive radiotherapy to greater than 25% of bone marrow within 8 weeks. Prior autologous bone transplant will not exclude a patient, 17. Is a participant, or plans to participate in another interventional clinical trial, whilst taking part in this Phase I study of AZD3965. Participation in an observational or interventional clinical trial that does not involve administration of an IMP would be acceptable. 18. Any other condition which in the Investigator's opinion would not make the patient a good candidate for the clinical trial. 19.
