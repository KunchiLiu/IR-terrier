	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to measure how much of the study drug (evacetrapib) gets into the blood stream and how long it takes the body to get rid of it when given with gemfibrozil. Each participant will receive gemfibrozil alone, evacetrapib alone, and both drugs in combination. There is no washout period between doses. The safety of both of the study drugs given together will be evaluated. Information about any side effects that may occur will also be collected. This study will last approximately 36 days.</brief_summary>
