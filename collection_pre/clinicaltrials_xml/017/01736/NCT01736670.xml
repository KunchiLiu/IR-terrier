	<brief_summary>Triamcinolone acetonide is a mid-potency, class 4/5 topical corticosteroid that is available in a spray formulation (Triamcinolone Acetonide Spray, T Spray). It is indicated for the relief of inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. Unlike more potent steroid products, T Spray has no time limitations on its use; therefore, it is commonly used to treat flares in psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, and contact dermatitis. In contrast to creams and ointments, T Spray can easily cover large and hard-to-reach areas of the body. Its optional nozzle directs application of the medication to precise areas without affecting nearby areas. Patients requiring a mid-potency corticosteroid for lesions on the scalp, back, intertriginous folds, large areas, or areas that require precise application would benefit from the T Spray formulation. In the time since the introduction of T Spray to dermatology, other topical corticosteroids have entered the market, but T Spray remains the only mid-potency corticosteroid available in a spray formulation. In a recently published open-label, non-comparator study involving 42 patients with chronic steroid-responsive dermatoses, T Spray was used up to four times a day for 28 days. Improvement of lesions after one week of treatment was experienced by 85% of patients, and 95% of subjects preferred the spray over creams and ointment. Most importantly, 56% of patients reported an anti-pruritic cooling effect which was experienced upon application.</brief_summary>
