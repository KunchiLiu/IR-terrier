	<brief_title>Clinical Trial of Rasagiline in Levodopa-Treated Parkinson's Disease Patients With Motor Fluctuations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Levodopa has been the mainstay therapy for PD for decades, and it is considered to be one of the most effective medications for relief of the symptoms of PD. However, within few months to few years the majority of levodopa-treated patients notice a decline in the duration of benefit of each dose and develop motor-complications. A major problem is the appearance of fluctuations in mobility, cycles of ON and OFF periods. The administration of rasagiline, a MAO-B inhibitor, can slow the elimination of the endogenous dopamine supplies or the dopamine produced from the exogenous levodopa therapy and may therefore improve ON-OFF fluctuations. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of rasagiline compared to placebo in PD patients with motor fluctuations on levodopa therapy.</detailed_description>
