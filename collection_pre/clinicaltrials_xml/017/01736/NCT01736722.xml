	<brief_summary>The Methodist Hospital Neurological Institute is conducting a clinical trial for patients suffering from Metastatic brain tumors. The objective for this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of a MRI-guided laser thermal therapy during a real-time MRI guidance for the treatment of brain metastasis. Patient will undergo laser therapy using the MRI scan to plan the treatment and ensure proper placement of the laser within the tumor. The tumor will then be heated by the laser and monitored by study physicians through the real-time MRI to see and control temperatures in the tissue. One in place, the thermal laser will then surgically remove the lesions. After the procedure, post treatment MR images will thenbe acquired for the determination of the effective treatment region.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI-Guided LITT for Treatment Metastatic Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a study for evaluating the feasibility and safety of MR-guided laser thermal ablation of treatment-resistant brain tumors using the Visualase® Thermal Therapy System (Manufactured by BioTex, Inc., Houston, TX). The Visualase system is FDA cleared for soft tissue ablation in a number of surgical specialties including Neurosurgery (see appendix for documentation). Patients with intracranial brain tumors measuring 3 cm or smaller in largest diameter that have failed any conventional therapy (surgery, stereotactic radiosurgery and/or whole brain radiotherapy) are eligible. The target tissue containing the tumor will undergo MRI-guided laser induced thermal therapy. MR imaging is used to define the treatment volume as well as plan and verify placement of the applicator. The extent of ablation is quantitatively monitored and displayed during delivery using real-time, MR temperature imaging. MR temperature imaging will also be used to monitor and control the temperature of adjacent tissues. Treatment will be automatically stopped if the MR temperature feedback system reports the temperature in the adjacent tissue has risen above a preset threshold. Treatment can be manually stopped by the neurosurgeon monitoring the treatment in real-time at any point during the procedure by simply turning off the power to the laser from the Visualase® system console. After laser delivery, MR images can be used to verify the extent of treatment and plan a therapy delivery if necessary.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Highgrade gliomas, metastatic brain tumors, and other brain tumors refractory to conventional medical therapy. 2. Patient or family able and willing to give informed consent. 3. Subjects with metastatic cancer to the brain who have failed at least one conventional therapy (surgery, stereotactic radio surgery, chemotherapy, and/or whole brain radiotherapy). 4. Four or fewer previously treated or untreated lesion(s) in the brain. 5. Tumor size ≤ 3.0 cm in largest diameter. 6. MR imaging is not contraindicated for the patient. 7. Lesion(s) are clearly defined on pretherapy contrast enhanced MRI scans as determined by the treating surgeon. 8. Able and willing to attend all study visits. 9. Karnofsky Performance Scale score &gt;50. 10. Patients age 19 and older. 1. Patients or family unwilling or unable to give written consent. 2. Patients who cannot physically fit in, or are too heavy for, the MRI scanner. 3. Patients with contraindications to MRI imaging, such as, but not limited to, some pacemakers or defibrillators, non compatible aneurysm clips, shrapnel, or other internal ferromagnetic objects. 4. Known sensitivity to gadoliniumDTPA, or glomerular filtration rate not compatible with receiving gadoliniumDTPA. 5. Based on Treatment Planning Imaging (MR and/or CT): Lesions localized in the brain stem. Lesions less than 5mm from primary branches of cerebral vessels, venous sinus, hypophysis or cranial nerves. Presence of more than 4 brain tumors at the time of enrollment. Medical issues which prohibit the patient from undergoing surgery (as determined by the treating surgeon, anesthesiologist, IMPAC clinic, referring physician). Positive pregnancy test for women of childbearing age.</criteria>
