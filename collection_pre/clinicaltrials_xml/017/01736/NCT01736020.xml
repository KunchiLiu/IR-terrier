	<brief_summary>This preclinical phase 1 development study in healthy volunteers seeks to identify if low doses of commonly used non-triggering anesthetic agents might have clinical utility for modulating emotional memory processing and to understand the nature of the brain mechanisms of drug action. Optimally, a drug, dose and brain mechanism of action will be identified that will form the foundation for future use in clinical studies of patients with PTSD.</brief_summary>
