	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to determine a safe, tolerable and effective dose of sotatercept that results in the greatest frequency of improvement of anemia in patients diagnosed with low- or intermediate-1 risk MDS or non-proliferative chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Sotatercept for the Treatment of Anemia in low-or Intermediate-1 Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) or Non-proliferative Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following enrollment of the initial 3 arms; additional cohorts of 20 patients for intermediate cohorts (not to exceed 2.0 mg/kg) may be added at the time of dose escalation up to 1.0 mg/kg and up to 2.0 mg/kg (eg, 0.75 mg/kg or 1.5 mg/kg respectively) based on assessment by the Steering Committee of available safety and efficacy data when at least six subjects have at least three cycles of treatment in the current dose level.</detailed_description>
