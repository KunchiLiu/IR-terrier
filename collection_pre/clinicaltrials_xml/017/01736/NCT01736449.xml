	<brief_summary>A pterygium is a fibrovascular growth originating from the conjunctiva that grows onto the surface of the cornea. Frequently, these pterygia will recur even after surgical resection. Bevacizumab is an inhibitor of angiogenesis, which is needed for recurrent growth. The use of bevacizumab is poorly understood in inhibiting pterygium growth. The objective of this study is to compare the effects of wound healing and recurrence rates in postoperative bevacizumab versus pterygium excision alone.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a prospective trial. Thirty-one patients with a primary pterygium of at least 2 mm in size and without any previous ocular surgery will be included. Outcome measures will include best corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, recurrence, and any sight threatening complications at two weeks, two months, and six months postoperatively.</detailed_description>
