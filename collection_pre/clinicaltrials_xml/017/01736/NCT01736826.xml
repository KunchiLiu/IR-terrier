	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that plasma concentrations of nucleosomes and free DNA differ between three groups: 1. pregnant patients with complications typical of placental insufficiency or venous thrombosis (group P), 2. healthy women (Group T1) and 3. healthy pregnant women (Group T2).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Free DNA and Nucleosome Concentrations in Pathological Pregnancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our secondary objectives include the following: 1. To describe, in 15 healthy, non-pregnant women changes in plasma concentrations of nucleosomes and free DNA over 3 months. 2. To describe, in 15 pregnant women (without complications), changes in plasma concentrations of nucleosomes and free DNA over the last 7 months of pregnancy 3. To show that plasma concentrations of nucleosomes and free DNA, in patients with complicated pregnancies differ according to the nature of the complication 4. To show that a relationship exists between the concentrations of nucleosomes, free DNA, and total granulocyte microparticles (and trophoblast particles for pregnant women) 5. To evaluate the relationship between nucleosome concentrations, free DNA concentrations and circulating leukocyte populations 6. To evaluate the relationship between nucleosome concentrations, free DNA concentrations and hemostasis markers 7. To describe changes in hemostasis markers throughout pregnancy 8. To evaluate the relationship between nucleosome concentrations, free DNA concentrations and the angiogenic marker CD146 9. To add to the Nîmes University Hospital biological collections.</detailed_description>
