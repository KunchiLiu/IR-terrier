	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect on corneal endothelial cell density (cells/mmÂ²) changes at 3 months when mapracorat ophthalmic suspension, 3% is administered QID (four times daily), for 14 days in healthy subjects with a normal ophthalmic history.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Must have a Pinhole visual acuity (VA) equal to or better than 20/40 in both eyes. Must be in good ocular health Subjects who have known hypersensitivity or contraindication to the study drug or its components. Subjects who currently require or are expected to require treatment with any medication listed as a disallowed medication per the Disallowed Therapy section of the protocol. Any topical ophthalmic medication, including tear substitutes that cannot be discontinued during the study. Subjects who are monocular (fellow eye is absent or fellow eye's Pinhole VA is worse than 20/200). Subjects with a history of ocular surgery, or who anticipate ocular surgery in either eye within the study period. Presence of significant ocular or systemic disease that the Investigator determines could interfere with the study.</criteria>
