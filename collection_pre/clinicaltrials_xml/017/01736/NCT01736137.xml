	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess functional capacity, quality of life and functioning of the autonomic nervous system in heart failure patients on beta-blocker treatment. The study hypothesis is that subjects who walk less distance, have lower quality of life and reduced heart rate variability during the six minute walk test.</brief_summary>
