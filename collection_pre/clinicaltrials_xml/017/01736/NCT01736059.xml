	<brief_summary>This pilot study is to determine whether it would be safe and feasible to inject CD34+ stem cells from bone marrow into the eye as treatment for patients who are irreversibly blind from various retinal conditions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial of Autologous Intravitreal Bone-marrow CD34+ Stem Cells for Retinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this pilot clinical trial, eyes with irreversible vision loss from retinal degenerative conditions (macular degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa) or retinal vascular disease (diabetic retinopathy or retinal vein occlusion) will be treated with intravitreal injection of autologous CD34+ stem cells isolated from bone marrow aspirate under Good Manufacturing Practice conditions. This study will determine whether there are any major safety and feasibility concerns using this therapy. Patients will be followed for 6 months after treatment by serial comprehensive eye examination supplemented with various retinal imaging and diagnostic tests.</detailed_description>
