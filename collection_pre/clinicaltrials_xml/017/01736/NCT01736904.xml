	<brief_title>wXELIRI Versus FOLFIRI Regimen in the Treatment of Advanced Colorectal Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The combination of irinotecan and fluorouracil drugs regimen is frequently used in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. According to the previous data, higher rate of diarrhea was observed in the combination of irinotecan and capecitabine (XELIRI) regimen, compared to the combination of irinotecan and 5-fluorouracil (FOLFIRI) regimen. However, the modified weekly XELIRI regimen, which was investigated in our previous single armed study, show tolerate toxicities compared with FOLFIRI, without compromising efficacy. It is supposed that wXELIRI regimen is no less less than FOLFIRI regimen in efficacy.</detailed_description>
