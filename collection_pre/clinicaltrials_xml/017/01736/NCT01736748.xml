	<brief_summary>The Dyn@mo lifestyle intervention (CHU Sainte-Justine, Quebec, Canada) targets children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years old with cardiometabolic risk factors, such as obesity, hypertension, disorders in glucose regulation or dyslipidemia. Its primary goal is to promote physical activity and reduce sedentary time to improve childrens' cardiometabolic profile. To do so, the intervention relies on gathering data on mobility and physical activity using wearable sensors. These data provide a detailed picture of real-life conditions and physical activity levels, improving the health care professional's ability to tailor counseling. The investigators are presently in the implementation phase of this intervention.</brief_summary>
