	<brief_summary>Increased glucose metabolism is characteristic for solid tumors. Thereby, glucose is important for the generation of ATP, supply of anabolic substrates and defense against reactive oxygen species in tumor cells. In preclinical models, restricting glucose availability using a ketogenic diet, calorie-restriction or transient fasting inhibits tumor growth. Therefore, the purpose of the study is to evaluate whether a calorie-restricted, ketogenic diet and transient fasting can enhance the efficacy of reirradiation in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.</brief_summary>
