	<detailed_description>This study is divided into three years. The aim of the first year is to analyze the types and percentage of chronic illness in middle- and old-aged population in communities and the impact on their physical and mental function. The Second year, we will use proper exercise prescriptions with exercise equipment available for chronic illness population and examine the improvement of their physical and mental functions after exercise intervention. The third year, we will adopt the concept of social marketing to promote knowledge about health-related fitness and exercise to communities and help to establish exercise center. To chronic illness people, the study seeks to delay the progression of disease and disability by encouraging them to participate in prescribed exercises. To relatively healthy people, exercise can achieve the purposes of healthy aging, decreased chronic illness, and improved ADLs function and life quality.</detailed_description>
