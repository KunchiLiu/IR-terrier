	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to assess whether pinitol improves hidrocarbonated metabolism parameters, and evaluate its effect on oxidative stress and endothelial function in diabetic, impaired and normal fasting glucose subjects. This was a 3-month randomised, controlled-placebo, parallel trial with a three-arm design. Patients were divided into three groups: diabetic (n=40), impaired fasting glucose (n=40) or normal fasting glucose subjects (n=40), receiving 4 g/day of pinitol/placebo.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Age range of 1870 years. Normal fasting glucose subjects were diagnosed as fasting glucose &lt;100 mg/dl and HbA1c &lt;5.7%. Impaired fasting glucose subjects were diagnosed as fasting glucose between 100 and 125 mg/dl and/or HbA1c between 5.7 and 6.4%. Type 2 Diabetes subjects were diagnosed as basal plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl, at least twice, or glucose levels 2 hours after 75 g oral glucose overload ≥ 200 mg/dl (American Diabetes Association) Exclusion criteria: Morbid obesity Type 1 diabetes Heart, liver, thyroid or kidney untreated disease Neoplasic disease Hypertriglyceridemia (Triglycerides &gt;400 mg/dl), Use of drugs that can influence the inflammatory state or insulin sensitivity (NSAIDs, corticosteroids, antiTNFα) and Uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (HbA1c ≥ 8%) or with insulin or intestinal disaccharidase inhibitors (acarbose, miglyol,...) treatment.</criteria>
