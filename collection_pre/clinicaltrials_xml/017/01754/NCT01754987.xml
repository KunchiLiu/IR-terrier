	<brief_summary>This protocol is a phase I/II, study of ascorbic acid (AA) infusions combined with treatment with sorafenib versus treatment with sorafenib alone in subjects with metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma. The phase I aspect will assess the safety and efficacy of the concurrent treatments and the phase II aspect will utilize CT (computer-tomography) scans to assess overall tumor response rate and evaluate disease progression</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Vitamin C in the Treatment of Liver Cancer to Determine if it is Safe and Effective</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intravenous Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) is a widely used alternative cancer treatment. This trial will study an intravenous Vitamin C treatment for persons with liver cancer that has spread, who are also receiving Sorafenib (a standard cancer drug), to see whether the combination of Vitamin C and Sorafenib is safe and well tolerated. Phase I will involve 6 persons who will receive the Vitamin C for 8 weeks to more specifically assess the safety of getting Vitamin C in combination with Sorafenib. Phase II will be randomized to receive either Vitamin C plus Sorafenib or Sorafenib alone for 16 weeks. If Vitamin C has a beneficial effect on tumour cells, patients may experience a regression of tumor or tumor markers. Additional benefits include scans at no charge to the patient.</detailed_description>

Willing and able to provide informed consent and participate in the study procedures. Patients with evidence of a significant current psychiatric disorder that would prevent completion of the study as determined by the PI will not be allowed to participate. Comorbid medical condition that would affect survival or tolerance as determined by the PI. This includes patients who have not fully recovered from toxicities associated with prior therapy. It also includes subjects who, as determined by the PI, are at risk of experiencing fluid overload (i.e., congestive heart failure). Patients who currently abuse alcohol or drugs. Patients with known glomerular filtration rate of &lt;60ml/min or with nephrotic range proteinuria.
