	<brief_summary>This is a First in Human study to assess the safety and tolerability of AZD7624, following inhaled administration of single ascending doses in healthy male volunteers and female volunteers of non-child bearing potential. Pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the drug) and pharmacodynamic (what the drug does to the body) parameters will be also assessed as secondary objectives.</brief_summary>
