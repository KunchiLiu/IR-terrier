	<brief_summary>The cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines chemotherapy remains a major problem, despite clinical and echocardiographic monitoring. In the case of treatment for breast cancer, surgery requiring general anesthesia may follow chemotherapy. Although a possible interaction between general anesthetics and anthracyclines on systolic function is only rarely mentioned, some cases of heart failure and / or conduction disturbances peranesthésique were observed in patients treated or previously treated with anthracyclines. The determination of concentration of BNP is a diagnostic tool used in the detection of heart failure and acute coronary syndromes. The question of a possible synergism between cardiotoxic anthracyclines and anesthetic agents arises. Given its minimally invasive nature and its diagnostic value, the BNP assay might thus allow to highlight a possible subclinical deficiency. To our knowledge, there is very little data regarding a possible synergism between cardiotoxic anthracyclines and anesthetic agents.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines chemotherapy remains a major problem, despite clinical and echocardiographic monitoring. In the case of treatment for breast cancer, surgery requiring general anesthesia may follow chemotherapy. Although a possible interaction between general anesthetics and anthracyclines on systolic function is only rarely mentioned, some cases of heart failure and / or conduction disturbances peranesthésique were observed in patients treated or previously treated with anthracyclines. The determination of concentration of BNP is a diagnostic tool used in the detection of heart failure and acute coronary syndromes. In fact, it is one of the most sensitive markers of impaired myocardial function, and an increase in interest rates may precede any other biological changes. In a patient who received anthracycline, although it remains asymptomatic elevation of NT-proBNP concentration may persist for some months after exposure, and that, whatever the doses received. The question of a possible synergism between cardiotoxic anthracyclines and anesthetic agents arises. Given its minimally invasive nature and its diagnostic value, the BNP assay might thus allow to highlight a possible subclinical deficiency. To our knowledge, there is very little data regarding a possible synergism between cardiotoxic anthracyclines and anesthetic agents.</detailed_description>
