	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well radiation therapy works in treating post-menopausal women with early stage breast cancer undergoing surgery. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. This may be an effective treatment for breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy in Treating Post-Menopausal Women With Early Stage Breast Cancer Undergoing Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: I. For select patients with early stage breast cancer undergoing wide local excision followed by single fraction radiation therapy (SFRT), we will evaluate rates of observer-rated toxicity, cosmetic outcomes and patient satisfaction, objective measures of toxicity and quality of life as well as delivery of intended dose. SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: I. Locoregional control reported at five years. OUTLINE: Patients undergo wide local excision breast surgery and SFRT over 60-100 minutes once negative margins are obtained. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and then every 6 months for 2 years.</detailed_description>
