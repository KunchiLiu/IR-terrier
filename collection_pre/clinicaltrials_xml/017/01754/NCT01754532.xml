	<brief_summary>The importance of stress as a possible deteriorating factor for schizophrenic patients is well documented. However, this notion is based on subjective experience and retrospective psychological analysis. A novel method of measuring cortisol using hair has a proven correlation to subjective stress in non-clinical as well as psychiatric clinical populations. This pilot study will attempt to assess the use of cortisol hair level, as a marker of stress, to predict clinical deterioration in schizophrenic patients.</brief_summary>
