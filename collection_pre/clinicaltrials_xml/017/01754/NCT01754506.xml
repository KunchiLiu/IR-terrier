	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of an oral, nutrient intervention containing the bioactive components of fish oil to promote healing of chronic venous leg ulcers (CVLU). If this systemic, nutrient intervention is found to alter the microenvironment of CVLU, the science of wound healing and care of patients with CVLU will be vastly improved.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Testing Fish Oil Derivatives In Healing Of Chronic Venous Leg Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pathogenesis of CVLU involves high numbers of activated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) that are associated with persistent inflammation in the wound bed 5-9. We propose to test the efficacy of an oral, nutrient intervention containing the bioactive components of fish oil to assuage PMN activity and promote healing of CVLU. If this systemic, nutrient intervention is found to alter the microenvironment of CVLU, the science of wound healing and care of patients with CVLU will be vastly improved. The purpose of this study is to test three fundamental corollaries of our organizing hypothesis in a 2-group, double-blind, randomized, experimental design on CVLU patients. The findings from the proposed experiments will increase our understanding of lipid mediators that influence wound healing and PMN function, and may lead to an innovative approach to reduce the physical and emotional burdens of nonhealing or recurrent CVLU.</detailed_description>
