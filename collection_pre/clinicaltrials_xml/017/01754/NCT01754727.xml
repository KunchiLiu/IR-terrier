	<detailed_description>This post-marketing observational study (PMOS) was performed in a multi-country, multi-center, single-arm format. Data were collected prospectively and retrospectively. Adult patients with diagnosis of AS who were assigned for treatment with adalimumab (Humira®) were eligible for participation. Each patient included in this study was to be observed during his/her adalimumab treatment for a maximum of 12 month period. During this period four follow-up visits were planned for observation of the patient and documentation of data. Ideally, these visits should have been performed approximately 3 (V1), 6 (V2), 9 (V3) and 12 (V4) months after the baseline visit (V0).</detailed_description>
