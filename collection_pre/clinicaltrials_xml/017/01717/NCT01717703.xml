	<brief_summary>The purpose of this experiment was to describe the effect of consuming 350 ml of 1% chocolate milk 60 minutes before a pizza meal on subjective appetite and short-term food intake when compared to cola, a fruit drink and a water control in normal weight and overweight/obese 9-14 year old boys and girls. It is hypothesized that 1% chocolate milk will increase meal time satiation to a greater extent than other sugars-sweetened commercially available beverages. Food intake will be measured 60 minutes after the consumption of 350 ml of water, fruit drink, cola or 1% chocolate milk.</brief_summary>
