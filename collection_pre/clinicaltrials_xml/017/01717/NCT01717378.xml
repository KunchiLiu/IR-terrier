	<brief_title>UCSF Research Participant Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The UCSF Research Participant Registry (http://registry.ucsf.edu) is a secure, standalone database that actively collects and stores data from willing volunteers who visit its website. The UCSF Registry is a cornerstone of the UCSF Recruitment Service (RS). Both the Registry and the RS are among several initiatives implemented by the UCSF Clinical &amp; Translational Science Institute. The chief purpose of the RS is to facilitate the enrollment of research participants into UCSF clinical studies. The primary function of the Registry is to expand the pool of potential clinical research volunteers. The Registry stores self-reported identifiable health information in a searchable database that is compliant with the privacy requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This information is then used by the RS for the future identification and recruitment of potentially eligible participants for specific UCSF studies. Registry participants whose data matches the major eligibility criteria for a specific study will be sent recruitment materials about the study. Contact information for the investigator or RS staff will also be included in the e-mailing. Participants are then free to choose whether to respond or ignore the study recruitment information.</detailed_description>
