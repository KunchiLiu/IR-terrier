	<detailed_description>Since October of 2001, approximately over 2 million troops have been deployed in the Global War on Terror. Many service members are returning with both physical injuries and mental health conditions. High rates of both post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and/or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and associated symptoms have been noted. It has been estimated that approximately 18-20% of returning service members meet criteria for PTSD and that 11-23% of veterans have a history of mTBI. It has been well established in the research literature that these two conditions frequently co-occur. While there is a dearth of evidence-based treatment for co-occurring PTSD and mTBI, it has been suggested that best practices entail treating presenting symptoms (hyperarousal, hypo-arousal, emotional reactivity, irritability, depression, anxiety, concentration problems) regardless of etiology. Yoga may be particularly well-suited to treating returning servicemen as data suggests that core symptoms that develop with a history of trauma exposure (e.g: hyperarousal; hypoarousal; emotional reactivity; anxiety, irritability), are physiologically based, somatically experienced and often not amenable to change through talking alone. In addition, yoga may assist with dysregulation often associated with mental health and physical conditions, and facilitate the development of mindfulness skills. Research suggests that that moment-to-moment awareness of present experience may decrease emotional reactivity and anxiety, and increase the capacity for self-regulation. Mindfulness skills have also been associated with: building resilience in the midst of stress; allowing one to better cope with physical discomfort; decreasing anxiety and depression; decreasing reactivity. All of these areas are relevant to improving the health and well-being of Veterans.</detailed_description>
