Active MS with history of at least one flare within the past 12 months or two flares in the past 24 months prior to screening. An Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of 6.0 or less at the screening visit. White blood cell count ≥ to 3.5x109. Subject agrees to use barrier contraceptive methods (i.e. diaphragm, cervical cap, contraceptive sponge or condom) with spermicidal foam/gel/cream/suppository, or IUD from study enrolment through 6 weeks after last dose of study medication, unless subject is postmenopausal or otherwise incapable of becoming pregnant by reason of surgery or tubal ligation, or has had a vasectomy. Subject agrees to appropriate contraception method though completion of study. Treatment with any other biological therapies including but not limited to Interferon beta1b, natalizumab, antiTNF biologic agents, or other agents intended to reduce TNF ≤ 8 weeks prior to screening or within 5 halflives of agent prior to screening, whichever is longer. Previous treatment with rifabutin and/or clofazimine. Previous treatment with amiodarone. Oral or parenteral antibiotics in the 4 weeks prior to screening. (Topical antibiotics are permitted.)

Relapse within the 30 days prior to screening, or between screening and baseline. Initiation or dose modification of 4aminopyridine within 60 days of screening. Use of azathioprine, 6mercaptopurine (6MP), methotrexate, cyclosporine or mycophenolate (CellCept) within 8 weeks prior to screening. Use of glatiramer acetate, cyclophosphamide, or plasma exchange within 12 weeks prior to screening. Use of mitoxantrone within one year prior to screening. Any previous treatment with cladribine, T cell vaccine, or altered peptide ligand. Previous total body irradiation or total lymphoid irradiation. Treatment with any medication that causes QT prolongation or Torsades de Pointes within 7 days prior to initiation of study drug, including but not limited to: Cisapride, pimozide, astemizole, terfenadine, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, sotalol, ibutilde, dofetilide, dronedarone, ondansetron or other 5HT3 receptor agonists, citalopram dose greater than 20 mg/day, tolteridine and quinine.

Adverse reaction or hypersensitivity to the study drug or any medications related to the study drug. Clinically significant abnormalities of hematology or chemistry at screening as confirmed by repeat testing based on investigator's discretion, including but not limited to, elevations greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal of Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), or creatinine clearance less than 60 ml/min at screening. Serum potassium, magnesium or calcium outside the normal reference range considered clinically significant by the investigator. Positive stool results for C. difficile. A positive serology for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C or HIV at screening except for the following: If positive history of previously treated Hepatitis C, but HCV PCR is undetectable off medications for at least 6 months prior to screening, and treating hepatologist or infectious disease specialist believes the subject is cured subject may be enrolled One of the following: History of atypical mycobacterial infections (other than MAP). History of active tuberculosis (TB) requiring treatment in the past 3 years. Tuberculosis infection as determined by a positive diagnostic TB test result (defined as a positive or indeterminate (after two independent tests) quantiFERON TB Test Gold test). Currently diagnosed or history of uveitis confirmed by either an ophthalmologist or optometrist. Any evidence of any other significant hematological, hepatic, renal, cardiac, pulmonary, metabolic, thyroid, neurological or psychiatric disease that might interfere with the subject's ability to safely enter and or complete the study requirements. History of malignancy within the past five years except for basal cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix that has been treated with no evidence of recurrence. Males who do not use barrier contraceptive methods (i.e. condom) with spermicidal foam/gel/cream/suppository or have not had a vasectomy.
