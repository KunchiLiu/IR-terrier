	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that adjunctive pioglitazone is more effective than placebo for the relief of acute depressive symptoms resulting from bipolar disorder. The secondary objectives are to determine potential moderators and mediators of antidepressant efficacy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pioglitazone for the Treatment of Bipolar Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled 8-week trial of pioglitazone, either as monotherapy or adjunctive to a mood stabilizer, for the acute relief of bipolar depression. The enrollment goal is 80 subjects (40 patients each in the pioglitazone treatment group and the placebo treatment group). Screening Phase: Patients who have been prescribed a mood stabilizer for &gt; 4 weeks and are on a therapeutic dose will proceed directly to the Screening Visit. For situations in which the patient prefers to be taking a mood stabilizer or where the treating psychiatrist feels it is clinically necessary, a mood stabilizer (lithium, divalproex, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, aripiprazole, ziprasidone or lurasidone) will be initiated (see Mood Stabilizer Initiation section below). For this set of patients who do begin a mood stabilizer, the Screening Phase may last up to 8 weeks. Otherwise, subjects who do not come in on a mood stabilizer will proceed directly to screening. Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study Period (Week 1 to Week 8): Patients who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized to study treatment at the baseline/randomization visit within 30 days of the screening visit. The efficacy and safety assessments will be carried out at baseline/randomization and then weekly or every two weeks for a total of 8 weeks.</detailed_description>
