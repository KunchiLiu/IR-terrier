	<brief_title>Metformin as a Chemoprevention Agent in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants will need to be scheduled to undergo a surgical resection of their lung cancer at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. They will be asked to provide a blood sample prior to their surgery. Samples of tumor tissue and normal lung tissue will be taken from the samples removed during your lung surgery. The tissue will be used to evaluate DNA. A skin biopsy at the edge of the incision that has already been made will be done during your surgery. We will take the skin and grow skin fibroblasts. Then we will reprogram the skin fibroblasts into induced pluripotent cells. You will be "randomized" into one of the study groups to either take Metformin for 6 months with your standard of care follow up or to receive standard of care follow up.</detailed_description>
