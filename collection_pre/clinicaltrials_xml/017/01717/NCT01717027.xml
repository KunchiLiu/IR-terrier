	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics And Relative Bioavailability Study Of Oxycodone in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will estimate the pharmacokinetics and relative bioavailability of oxycodone following oral administration of single 40 mg doses of PF-00345439 Formulations J and K compared with the reference PF-00345439 Formulation A, all taken whole and under fed conditions in healthy volunteers. In addition, the study will estimate the pharmacokinetics and relative bioavailability of oxycodone followingoral administration of single 40 mg doses of PF-00345439 Formulation J or K (to beselected based on Periods 1-3) after chewing under fasted conditions compared to that taken whole in the fed state in healthy volunteers, and assess the single-dose safety and tolerability of oxycodone inPF-00345439 formulations in healthy volunteers when administered under a naltrexone block.</detailed_description>
