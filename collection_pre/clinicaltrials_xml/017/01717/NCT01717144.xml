	<brief_summary>Parkinson's disease (PD) has considerable impact on motor, psychological and social activities and significantly affects the quality of life of patients and their families. To improve the medical care of PD patients, the investigator have developed an educational program specific to PD. The principal aim of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic education Program, comparing the quality of life of PD patients with or without the educational program after six month and one year follow-up. The secondary aims are to evaluate the evolution of motor and psychological states in these 2 groups of patients and to compare the medical costs. This is a monocentric, comparative, prospective randomised study. The investigators will evaluate 120 PD patients, 60 patients benefiting of the educational program and 60 patients with a traditional medical care. Quality of life of PD patients is evaluated using a specific scale (PDQ39) and a generalist scale (SF36) at 6 and 12 months. Motor and psychological states were assessed with UPDRS and HAD Scales. The educational program consisted of both individual and collective educational consultations. The investigators supposed that the therapeutic education program will improve the quality of life of PD patients. The supposition that this improvement will correlate with the motor and psychological states.</brief_summary>
