	<brief_summary>The purpose is to determine the effect of sugars in solution on food intake and subjective appetite in 9- to 14-year-old normal weight boys. The investigators hypothesize that food intake after all sugars-containing solutions will be decreased in comparison to the control solution, with similar reductions in FI between high-fructose corn syrup -55 (HFCS-55) and sucrose. Food intake will be measured 60 minutes after consumption of 50g of HFCS-55, sucrose or glucose, or a control treatment. Subjective appetite will be measured at 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 minutes.</brief_summary>
