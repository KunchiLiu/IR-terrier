	<brief_summary>Low testosterone is a condition that occurs when the body is unable to produce sufficient quantities of testosterone. The medical name for low testosterone is hypogonadism. Hypogonadism can be caused by many factors. Symptoms include: decrease in libido, lack of energy and mood swings. The goal of testosterone replacement therapy is to return testosterone levels to the normal range and relieve symptoms. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of TSX-002, which is testosterone provided in easy to swallow capsules, to maintain serum (blood) testosterone levels within the normal range in hypogonadal men. This will be determined by blood sampling at specified times during the study. The study is also intended to evaluate the tolerability of TSX-002, which will be taken orally twice per day for 15 days. In addition, the study is intended to determine a dosing regimen(s) that achieves testosterone levels within the normal range. Related Outcome Measures will be reported for Parts 1, 2, and 4. A portion of the study (Part 3) to also assess the effect of a high-calorie, high-fat meal on the single dose pharmacokinetic exposure of TSX-002. Related outcome measures to be reported for Part 3.</brief_summary>
