	<brief_summary>Hookworms digest hemoglobin from erythrocytes for use as an energy source via a proteolytic cascade that begins with the aspartic protease, APR-1. Vaccination with recombinant APR-1 has protected animals from infection in challenge studies. This study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two formulations of Na-APR-1 (M74) in healthy adult volunteers when co-administered with different concentrations of the immunostimulant GLA-AF.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Immunogenicity of the Na-APR-1 Hookworm Vaccine in Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Open-label, dose-escalation phase 1 clinical trial in healthy, hookworm-naïve adults: - Study site: George Washington Medical Faculty Associates, Washington, DC - Number of participants: 40 in 2 cohorts of 20. In Cohort 1 five (5) volunteers will receive 30 µg Na-APR-1 (M74) /Alhydrogel®, five (5) will receive 30 µg Na-APR-1 (M74)/Alhydrogel® plus 2.5 µg GLA-AF, and ten (10) will receive 30 µg Na-APR-1 (M74) /Alhydrogel® plus 5 µg GLA-AF. In Cohort 2 five (5) volunteers will receive 100 µg Na-APR-1 (M74)/Alhydrogel®, five (5) will receive 100 µg Na-APR-1 (M74) /Alhydrogel® plus 2.5 µg GLA-AF, and ten (10) will receive 100 µg Na-APR-1 (M74)/Alhydrogel® plus 5 µg GLA-AF. The cohorts will be enrolled in a staggered fashion with safety data assessed prior to the Na-APR-1 dose escalation from 30 to 100 µg. In addition, within each cohort, vaccinations will be staggered such that formulations containing 0, 2.5, and 5 µg GLA-AF will be tested sequentially: for example, those receiving Na-APR-1 (M74)/Alhydrogel® in combination with 2.5 µg GLA-AF will be vaccinated no sooner than 3 days after the last volunteer is vaccinated with the formulation containing no GLA-AF, whereas those vaccinated with Na-APR-1 (M74)/Alhydrogel® plus 5 µg GLA-AF will be vaccinated no sooner than 7 days after the last one receives the 2.5 µg GLA-AF formulation. - Immunization schedule: Study days 0, 56 and 112. - Route: IM in the deltoid muscle. - Doses of Na-APR-1 (M74) to be tested: 30 and 100 µg. - Doses of Alhydrogel®: 240 and 800 µg for the 30 and 100 µg doses of Na-APR-1 (M74), respectively. - Doses of GLA-AF to be tested: 2.5 µg and 5 µg. - Study duration: 44 weeks (10 months) per study participant; total duration of the study estimated at approximately 13 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males or females between 18 and 50 years, inclusive. Good general health as determined by means of the screening procedure. Available for the duration of the trial (44 weeks). Willingness to participate in the study as evidenced by signing the informed consent document. Pregnancy as determined by a positive urine human choriogonadotropin (hCG) (if female). Participant unwilling to use reliable contraception methods up until one month following the third immunization (if female and not surgically sterile, abstinent or at least 2 years postmenopausal). Currently lactating and breastfeeding (if female). Evidence of clinically significant neurologic, cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, rheumatologic, autoimmune, diabetes, or renal disease by history, physical examination, and/or laboratory studies. Known or suspected immunodeficiency. Laboratory evidence of liver disease (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] greater than 1.25times the upper reference limit). Laboratory evidence of renal disease (serum creatinine greater than 1.25times the upper reference limit, or more than trace protein or blood on urine dipstick testing). Laboratory evidence of hematologic disease (hemoglobin &lt;11.5 g/dl [females] or &lt;12.5 g/dl [males]; absolute leukocyte count &lt;3600/mm3 or &gt;10.7 x 103/mm3; absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &lt;1700/ mm3; absolute lymphocyte count &lt;700/mm3; or platelet count &lt;140,000/mm3). Laboratory evidence of a coagulopathy (PTT or PT INR greater than 1.1times the upper reference limit). Serum glucose (random) greater than 1.2times the upper reference limit. Other condition that in the opinion of the investigator would jeopardize the safety or rights of a volunteer participating in the trial or would render the subject unable to comply with the protocol. Participation in another investigational vaccine or drug trial within 30 days of starting this study. Volunteer has had medical, occupational, or family problems as a result of alcohol or illicit drug use during the past 12 months. History of a severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis. Severe asthma as defined by the need for daily use of inhalers or emergency clinic visit or hospitalization within 6 months of the volunteer's expected first vaccination in the study. Positive ELISA for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Positive confirmatory test for HIV infection. Positive confirmatory test for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Use of corticosteroids (excluding topical or nasal) or immunosuppressive drugs within 30 days of the volunteer's expected first vaccination in this study. Receipt of a live vaccine within 4 weeks or a killed vaccine within 2 weeks prior to the volunteer's expected first vaccination in the study. History of a surgical splenectomy. Receipt of blood products within the past 6 months. History of previous infection with hookworm or residence for more than 6 months in a hookwormendemic area.</criteria>
