	<brief_summary>Researchers at the UW are doing this study to find out if a commonly used anesthetic affects patients Analgesia Nociception Index (level of pain relief) during abdominal hysterectomy under general anesthesia. The investigators will administer routine anesthesia care including Ketamine, a commonly used anesthetic, during the patients surgery. During the patients surgery, the investigators will monitor the patients level of pain relief using the PhysioDoloris monitor, which monitors the routinely used EKG monitor. Though not yet FDA approved, the PhysioDoloris is completely non-invasive and collects data from the EKG monitor.</brief_summary>
