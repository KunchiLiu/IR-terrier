	<brief_summary>We have found that a 6-month course of insulin therapy after a short-term intensive insulin therapy could shorten the period of hyperglycemia to preserve ß-cell function and further improve long-term glycemic control in recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes with severe hyperglycemia (&gt;300 mg/dl, with HBA1C level around 9-11%) in our previous study. We thus hypothesized that a 6-month course of basal insulin therapy could also help to preserve ß-cell function in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes with moderate hyperglycemia (200-300 mg/dl). This prospective study is outpatient-based to evaluate whether 6-month basal insulin therapy versus oral anti-diabetic treatment (Metformin and sitagliptin) soon after the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes with moderate hyperglycemia (200-300 mg/dl) is associated with better ß-cell function reservation. We skip a short-term intensive admission course of insulin therapy as our previous study in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes with severe hyperglycemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ß-Cell Function and Glycemic Control in Newly Diagnosed Type 2 Diabetic Patients With Moderate Hyperglycemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ß-Cell dysfunction and decreased insulin sensitivity are the main pathophysiological defects responsible for the development of hyperglycemia. There is a progressive deterioration in ß-cell function and mass in type 2 diabetics. Optimal metabolic control, especially early intensive glycemic control, plays a role in the prevention of progressive ß-cell dysfunction and possibly destruction of the ß-cells with worsening of diabetes. We have found that a 6-month course of insulin therapy after a short-term intensive insulin therapy could shorten the period of hyperglycemia to preserve ß-cell function and further improve long-term glycemic control in recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes with severe hyperglycemia (&gt;300 mg/dl, with HBA1C level around 9-11%) in our previous study. We thus hypothesized that a 6-month course of basal insulin therapy could also help to preserve ß-cell function in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes with moderate hyperglycemia (200-300 mg/dl). This prospective study is outpatient-based to evaluate whether 6-month basal insulin therapy versus oral anti-diabetic treatment (Metformin and sitagliptin) soon after the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes with moderate hyperglycemia (200-300 mg/dl) is associated with better ß-cell function reservation. We skip a short-term intensive admission course of insulin therapy as our previous study in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes with severe hyperglycemia. This study also can assess what readily available parameter would predict which patients will achieve long-term successful glycemic control after correction of glucose toxicity. Our results will provide evidence that a 6-month course of basal insulin therapy could shorten the exposure to moderate hyperglycemia and further improve beta-cell function to achieve long-term glycemic control.</detailed_description>
