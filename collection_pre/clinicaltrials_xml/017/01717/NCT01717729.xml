	<brief_summary>To prospectively evaluate whether use of combined radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and percutaneous iodine-125 (125I) seeds implantation results in better survival compared with use of RFA alone in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hepatocellular Carcinoma Treated With Iodine-125 Implantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study was local ethical committee approved; all patients gave written informed consent. A total of 136 patients were randomly assigned to undergo RFA-125I (n = 68; 42 men, 26 women; mean age, 50.7 years; age range, 29-73 years) or RFA alone (n = 68; 47 men, 21 women; mean age, 48.9 years; age range, 30-74 years). Patients with viable tumors at computed tomography (CT) 4 weeks after treatment received additional treatment. Rates of local tumor progression and overall survival were evaluated by using Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests, respectively. The relative prognostic significance of variables in predicting overall survival and the time to tumor recurrence or metastasis were assessed with multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression and logistic regression analyses, respectively.</detailed_description>
