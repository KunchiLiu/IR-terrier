	<brief_summary>This multicenter, open-label, noncomparative study evaluates two oral formulations of raltegravir (MK-0518, film-coated tablet and chewable tablet) in combination with other antiretroviral agents for safety, tolerability, and antiretroviral activity in treatment-naive or treatment-experienced Russian children and adolescents infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1). As raltegravir is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral therapies (ARTs) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in pediatric patients in the United States (US), this study is designed to gain local treatment experience on the use of raltegravir in the pediatric HIV-infected population in Russia.</brief_summary>
