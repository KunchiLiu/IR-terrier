	<brief_summary>The EGFR is one of the most frequently overexpressed proteins in various cancers including lung cancer, and is related to tumor progression and resistance to most treatments. New treatment strategies targeting EGFR have been developed: "although much work remains to be done, erlotinib has already established itself as part of the therapeutic armamentarium against cancer"(A review of erlotinib and its clinical use. Tang PA, Tsao MS, Moore MJ. Expert Opin Pharmacotherapy. 2006 Feb;7(2):177-93.) Noninvasive PET/CT imaging of EGFR expression activity and mutation status in NSCLC could aid in the selection of patients for individualized therapy with EGFR kinase inhibitors. Whole-body noninvasive PET/CT imaging could estimate treatment-responsive vs. -resistant tumor burden before the initiation of therapy with EGFR inhibitors. The purposes of the study are: 1. To adjust an optimal treatment for patients with tumors that have high expression of EGFR by identification of this type of cancer using C11-Erlotinib PET/CT during pretreatment work-up; as well as to follow up after treatment response. 2. To recognize patients with advanced pancreatic cancer responding to treatment with erlotinib and to distinguish them from non-responders.</brief_summary>
