	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice for patients with symptomatic gall stones. For pain relief following laparoscopic cholecystectomy both intraperitoneal and intravenous administration of lignocaine has been used. But it is not clear from the existing literature which form of administration is more effective for pain relief. Hence this study has been undertaken with the following hypothesis : Intravenous lignocaine is superior to intraperitoneal lignocaine for postoperative pain relief and minimizing the stress response in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice for patients with symptomatic gall stones. For pain relief following laparoscopic cholecystectomy both intraperitoneal and intravenous administration of lignocaine has been used. But it is not clear from the existing literature which form of administration is more effective for pain relief. Hence this study has been undertaken with the following hypothesis : Intravenous lignocaine is superior to intraperitoneal lignocaine for postoperative pain relief and minimizing the stress response in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In this study the effect of intraperitoneal and intravenous lignocaine will be assessed based on the postoperative pain scores, total analgesic requirement, stress response in the form of total leukocyte count, c-reactive protein levels,return of bowel activity.</detailed_description>
