	<brief_summary>It is a Phase 3 extension of study V72P12E1 (NCT00944034). The main aim of the second extension study is to explore the bactericidal antibody persistence in 4-year-old children after a fourth dose boost of rMenB+OMV NZ or after a two-dose catch-up schedule of rMenB+OMV NZ administered to toddlers as part of their respective vaccination courses in study V72P12E1. In addition, this study will characterize the antibody response to a fifth dose boost in all children who received a three-dose primary series of rMenB+OMV NZ at 2, 3, 4 months of age (in parent study V72P12, NCT00721396), and only in a subset of children who received a three-dose primary series of rMenB+OMV NZ at 2, 4, 6 months of age (in parent study V72P12). Antibody response will also be characterized to a third dose boost of rMenB+OMV NZ administered at approximately 4 years of age in all children who received a two catch-up doses of rMenB+OMV NZ as toddlers in study V72P12E1. Finally, the safety and immunogenicity of two catch-up doses of rMenB+OMV NZ administered 2 months apart to healthy naïve children at 4 years of age will be assessed.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>A. Inclusion Criteria for naïve subjects, newly enrolled (B48_50): 1. 4 years old (48 to 60 months) healthy male and female subjects will be recruited from the same sites as in study V72P12E1. The age window is defined as the first day the subject turns 4 years old up to the day before the subject turns 5 years old. 2. For whom parent/legal guardian(s) has given written informed consent after the nature of the study has been explained. 3. For whom parent/legal guardian(s) confirmed availability for the visit(s) scheduled in the study. 4. In good health as determined by medical history, physical examination, clinical judgment of the investigator. B. Inclusion Criteria for followon participants (Groups B+R246 12_48, B+R246 18_48, B+R246 24_48, B246 12_48, B246 18_48, B246 24_48, B+R234 12_48, B+R234 18_48, B+R234 24_48, B12 14_48, B18 20_48, B24 26_48): Inclusion criteria are the same as for Group B48_50, with the addition that they are subjects who completed the vaccination course of V72P12E1 study. A. Exclusion Criteria for naïve subjects, newly enrolled (Group 7): 1. Subjects whose parents/legal guardians are unwilling or unable to give written informed consent to participate in the study. 2. History of any meningococcal B vaccine administration. 3. Previous ascertained or suspected disease caused by N. meningitidis. 4. Household contact with and/or intimate exposure to an individual with laboratory confirmed N. meningitidis. 5. History of allergic reaction to any vaccine component. 6. Significant chronic infection. 7. Any serious chronic or progressive disease according to the judgment of the investigator (e.g., neoplasm, diabetes mellitus Type I, cardiac disease, hepatic disease, progressive neurological disease or seizure, either associated with fever or as part of an underlying neurological disorder or syndrome, autoimmune disease, HIV infection or AIDS, or blood dyscrasias or diathesis, signs of cardiac or renal failure or severe malnutrition). 8. Known or suspected impairment/alteration of the immune system resulting from (for example) receipt of chronic immunosuppressive therapy or immunostimulants. 9. Participation in another clinical trial within 90 days prior to enrolment or planned for during study. 10. Family members and household members of research staff. 11. Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives. B. Exclusion Criteria for followon participants ((Groups B+R246 12_48, B+R246 18_48, B+R246 24_48, B246 12_48, B246 18_48, B246 24_48, B+R234 12_48, B+R234 18_48, B+R234 24_48, B12 14_48, B18 20_48, B24 26_48): Exclusion criteria are the same as for Group B48_50, with the exception of criterion 2 and excluding participation in V72P12E1 for criterion 9.</criteria>
