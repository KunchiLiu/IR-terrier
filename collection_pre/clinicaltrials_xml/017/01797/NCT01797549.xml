	<brief_summary>The goal of this project is to develop a test to assess frontal lobe function using a rapid, inexpensive, objective, and standardized method, without the need for expertise in cognitive test administration. Such methods would be particularly helpful in traumatic brain injury (TBI), where objective measures are needed, and would greatly expand the capacity to make such assessments in clinical practice and research.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Able to read, write, speak and understand English history of having sustained a TBI prior to enrollment. Evidence will be any one of the following 3 criteria: 1. GCS 3 12 2. Posttraumatic amnesia &gt; 24 hours 3. TBIrelated abnormality on neuroimaging (either CT or MRI). (Some missing information about the initial injury (i.e. documentation of initial GCS) is not necessarily exclusionary if the bulk of the available history is indicative that the patient suffered a TBI and meets the inclusion criteria) Multiple sclerosis, pre or coexisting Stroke (other than stroke at the time of TBI) Preexisting developmental disorder Preexisting epilepsy Preexisting major depressive disorder Preexisting schizophrenia</criteria>
