	<brief_title>Mediterranean Diet and Endothelial Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Abdominal obesity is well known to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), since it is commonly associated with hypertension, dyslipidemia, impaired fasting glucose, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, systemic inflammation and endothelium dysfunction. Abnormal endothelial function, expressed as lower vasodilatation through flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD) of brachial artery in response to an increase in blood flow, is considered an index of subclinical atherosclerosis, and an early hallmark of cardiovascular disease, with a strong prognostic value for future cardiovascular events. Changes in diet, level of physical activity and behavior are well known key elements influence endothelial function. Recent studies seem to show that Mediterranean diet has beneficial role on cardiovascular risk. It could protect against the development of coronary heart disease also through a possible effect on body weight and obesity. At the best of our knowledge, the effect of Mediterranean diet on endothelial function in obese subjects has not been definitely established. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of Mediterranean diet on anthropometric parameters (body weight, BMI and waist circumference), lipid profile [total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)], triglycerides (TG), fasting glucose and endothelium function, evaluated by FMD, in a group of obese and overweight subjects. In particular, subjects were invited to follow a standard Mediterranean diet for a short (3 months) or a longer (18 months) period. The specific role of some components of Mediterranean diet (olive oil or non fried fish or nuts) was also investigated.</detailed_description>
