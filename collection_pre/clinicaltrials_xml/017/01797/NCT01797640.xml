	<brief_summary>Currently, the treatment of choice for tibial fracture is intramedullary nailing. This procedure has been shown to have low rates of infection, high rates of bone healing, and a faster return to weight bearing and activity in comparison to conservative treatment. In concurrent fractures of the posterior or medial malleolus and the tibia, it is now common to identify, reduce, and fix the malleolar fracture prior to intramedullary nailing of the tibia. In this retrospective study, our aim is to establish that reducing malleolar fractures prior to tibial nailing is a safe treatment in which the reduction of the malleolus is maintained intraoperatively, postoperatively, and remains reduced until the fracture has healed.</brief_summary>
