	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether 24 week treatment with the Daclatasvir (DCV) in combination with Pegylated-interferon alfa 2a (pegIFNα-2a) and Ribavirin (RBV) is safe and demonstrates rate of Sustained Virologic Response at follow up week 24 (SVR24) (defined as undetectable HCV RNA at post-treatment Week 24) that are non-inferior to 48 weeks of the dual combination therapy of pegIFNα-2a/RBV in a majority of study subjects</brief_summary>
