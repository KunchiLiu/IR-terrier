	<brief_summary>Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is widely used in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), however, some patients fail to respond to PPI therapy. Recent reporters suggest that depressive disorders, anxiety, sleep dysfunction were related with the symptomatic responses to a PPI treatments. Nevertheless, the predictive factors of response to PPI treatment still remain controversial. Therefore, the aims of this study were to investigate the efficacy of PPI therapy, and to evaluate the predictors of the PPI response in patients with symptomatic GERD by using the questionnaire which consisted of GERD symptoms, GERD impact scale (GIS), Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), Hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), and WHO quality of life scale abbreviated version (WHOQOL-BREF).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Adult Subjects (From 16 to 85 years old) The participants with GERD symptoms were treated a PPI therapy. The participants completed a questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of demographic data, GERD symptoms, GERD impact scale (GIS), Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), Hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), and WHO quality of life scale abbreviated version (WHOQOLBREF). Patients with a history of gastrointestinal surgery, Barrett's esophagus, esophageal motility disorder, peptic ulcer or gastroduodenal cancer and systemic disease requiring chronic medication (except for hypertension and diabetes mellitus) were excluded. Patients who took the PPI therapy less than 4 weeks were excluded.</criteria>
