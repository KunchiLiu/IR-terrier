	<brief_summary>This is a three-period, three sequence, reference replicated, cross-over study to determine the bioequivalence of two amlodipine and losartan FDC tablet formulations FDC5/50 and FDC5/100 (GSK2944406; 5 mg amlodipine and 50 mg and 100 mg losartan) to reference amlodipine and losartan tablets co-administered in two groups enrolling 102 healthy adult male and female subjects under fasting conditions. A description of each treatment is provided below: A (Reference) = 1 x 5 mg amlodipine tablet and 1 x 50 mg losartan tablet. B (FDC5/50) = 1 x 5 mg amlodipine and 50 mg losartan tablet C (Reference) = 1 x 5 mg amlodipine tablet and 1 x 100 mg losartan tablet D (FDC5/100) = 1 x 5 mg amlodipine and100 mg losartan tablet The treatments will be administered in accordance with the randomisation schedule as. Group 1: A → A → B or A → B → A or B → A → A Group 2: C → C → D or C → D → C or D → C → C All subjects will attend a screening visit within 28 days of their first dosing period (Day 1). The baseline assessments will be conducted the day before the first dosing. In each treatment period, subjects will be admitted to the clinic in the evening before Day 1. All subjects will receive a single oral dose of amlodipine and losartan in the morning on Day 1. All the subjects will remain in the clinical unit until completion of all assessments at 24 hours post-dose on Day 2 including collection of the 24 hour post-dose PK sample. Subjects will return to the clinic for pharmacokinetic samples at 36, 48, 72 and 96 hours post-dose. The three treatment periods will be separated by a washout period of 10-17 days. Upon completion of the last dosing period, or early withdrawal, subjects will return to the clinical unit within 14-21 days for a follow up visit.</brief_summary>

The subject has a positive: drug/alcohol screen, Hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus(HIV) screen Subject with systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg or diastolic less than 60 mm Hg irrespective of associated symptoms at the time of admission If there is a drop in 20 mmHg of systolic pressure (and a 10 mmHg drop in diastolic) and a 20 beats per minute increase in heart rate between supine measurement and after two minutes standing at the time of admission. Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones). A positive prestudy drug/alcohol at the time of admission. Abuse of alcohol Participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current study: 30 days, 5 halflives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer) Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day. Unable to refrain from the use of prescription or nonprescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation. Donation of more than 500 milliliter (mL) blood within a 56 day period. Pregnant or lactating females. Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol. Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated. History of sensitivity to heparin or heparininduced thrombocytopenia.
