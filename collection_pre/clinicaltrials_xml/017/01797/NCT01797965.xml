	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of long-term treatment with BIIB019 (Daclizumab High Yield Process; DAC HYP) monotherapy in participants with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) who completed Study 205MS301 (NCT01064401), Study 205MS203 (NCT01051349) or Study 205MS302 (NCT01462318). Secondary objectives of this study in this study population are as follows: To describe MS-related outcomes, including MS relapse, disability progression, MS lesion formation, and participant-reported impact of MS, following long-term treatment with DAC HYP To assess the long-term immunogenicity of DAC HYP administered by prefilled syringe (PFS) To assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of switching to DAC HYP in participants previously on long-term treatment with interferon Î²-1a (Avonex) in Study 205MS301(NCT01064401).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-Term Extension Study in Participants With Multiple Sclerosis Who Have Completed Study 205MS301 (NCT01064401) to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of BIIB019</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Enrollment will include up to 1600 Participants, this includes approximately 1200 Participants who completed Study 205MS301 (NCT01064401). Additionally, approximately 400 Participants from the other BIIB019 extension studies 205MS203 (NCT01051349) and 205MS302 (NCT01462318) will be eligible to enter Study 205MS303 at Week 144 of Study 205MS303 [Study 205MS301 (NCT01064401), study 205MS203 (NCT01051349) and study 205MS302 (NCT01462318) have been referred to as parent studies in the protocol]. All Participants will receive the same dose of DAC HYP as received in the parent studies; i.e., 150 mg by an SC injection every 4 weeks. The duration of DAC HYP treatment is up to approximately 5 years, or until availability of commercial product (whichever is sooner).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key Must be a subject currently participating in Study 205MS301 (NCT01064401), or subject currently participating in Study 205MS203 (NCT01051349) or Study 205MS302 (NCT01462318) who has completed End of Study Visit (Week 96 or later). Women of childbearing potential must practice effective contraception during the study and be willing and able to continue contraception for 4 months after their last dose of study treatment. Key Any subject who permanently discontinued study treatment in Study 205MS301 (NCT01064401), Study 205MS203 (NCT01051349) or Study 205MS302 (NCT01462318) prior to the end of the study treatment period, or had an Early Termination visit in Study 205MS301, Study 205MS203 (NCT01051349) or Study 205MS302 (NCT01462318). Any significant change in the subject's medical history that would preclude administration of BIIB019, including laboratory tests or a current clinically significant condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would have excluded the subject's participation in Study 205MS301 (NCT01064401), Study 205MS203 (NCT01051349) or Study 205MS302 (NCT01462318). The Investigator must re review the subject's medical fitness for participation and consider any factors that would preclude treatment in this Study 205MS303. NOTE: Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
