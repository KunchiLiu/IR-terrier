	<brief_summary>Boys with constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP) should be offered evidence-based effective and safe treatment option. This study compares the effects of low-dose testosterone and aromatase inhibitor letrozole on pubertal progression. The hypothesis is that, in boys CDGP showing earliest signs of puberty, peroral letrozole (2.5 mg/d for 6 mo) induces faster biochemical and clinical progression of puberty as compared to low-dose intramuscular testosterone Rx (~1mg/kg/mo for 6 mo). In addition, 10 or more boys who select watchful waiting instead of medication will provide background data on the natural progression of CDGP, and their data will not be used in primary statistical comparisons.</brief_summary>
