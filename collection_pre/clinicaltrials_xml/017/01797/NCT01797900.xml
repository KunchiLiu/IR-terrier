	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) combined inductive and concurrent chemotherapy with more intensive regimen (cisplatin and paclitaxel) is feasible and effective than current standard treatment for high-risk locally advanced NPC patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role of Induction Chemotherapy for High-risk Locally Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma in the Era of IMRT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Meta-analysis showed chemotherapy when combined with conventional radiotherapy in locally advanced naso-pharyngeal carcinoma can improve 5-year overall survival with 6%, and beyond all concurrent chemotherapy with cisplatin benefits most. However, from Lin's (Lin JC, 2004) study, locally advanced NPC with high risk factors can not benefit from conventional concurrent chemoradiation. Failure pattern analysis revealed that local and distant failure accounted for 50% respectively. Large-scale data has demonstrated that with IMRT, local control can achieve 90%. Previous studies showed inductive chemotherapy can decrease distant metastasis. We need more effective and stronger chemotherapy, and we still need to testify concurrent chemotherapy combined with inductive chemotherapy. A prospective trial would thus provide valuable information to help physicians and patients more precisely identify the feasibility and effectiveness of inductive + concurrent chemotherapy combined with IMRT for high-risk locally advanced NPC.</detailed_description>
