	<brief_summary>We will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial to compare two antibiotic pre-authorization strategies (Fellow-based vs. Pharmacist-based). We believe that amount and duration of antibiotic consumption would be lower in the pharmacist group while the clinical outcome would be equivalent between two groups.</brief_summary>
