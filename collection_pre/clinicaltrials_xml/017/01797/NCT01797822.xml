	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether, in people with dry eye syndrome, over the counter artificial tears and the prescription eye drop, dexamethasone, change or effect the eyes response to a low humidity environment. It is known that irritation from dry eye can be improved by over the counter artificial tears because they wet and lubricate the eyes. The prescription eye drop, dexamethasone, can also improve eye irritation by decreasing the inflammation that develops in dry eye. Thus, the investigators hypothesize that the use of these conventional dry eye treatments will improve the eyes' response to a low humidity environment.</brief_summary>
