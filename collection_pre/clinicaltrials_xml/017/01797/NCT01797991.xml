	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, randomized, unicentric, two-arm, parallel, controlled, and double blind pilot study. The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility of a trial designed to compare the quality of life of patients taking dexamethasone in two different ways to prevent hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel. Dexamethasone given intravenously (IV) 30 minutes before paclitaxel could improve quality of life, could adequately prevent hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel and could reduce adverse effects compared to dexamethasone given orally 12 hours and 6 hours before paclitaxel.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Two Regimens of Dexamethasone in the Prevention of Hypersensitivity Reactions to Paclitaxel, a Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective: To assess the feasibility of a randomized, parallel, two-arm, controlled and double blind trial designed to compare the quality of life of patients taking dexamethasone 20 mg IV 30 minutes before paclitaxel with those taking a standard dose of dexamethasone, 20 mg orally 12 hours and 6 hours before paclitaxel, in patients taking paclitaxel every two to three weeks for a minimum of two cycles in order to estimate a sample size. Secondary objectives: Between the two study groups, to compare: - Quality of life during the first two cycles of chemotherapy; - Efficacy of dexamethasone in preventing acute hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel in the first two cycles of chemotherapy; - Adverse effects associated with dexamethasone on a daily basis during the first seven days of the first two cycles of chemotherapy. Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two study groups.</detailed_description>
