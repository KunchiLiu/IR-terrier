	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that Restylane速 could serve as a repair matrix which also maintains IL triamcinolone acetonide concentrations at higher levels for a longer period of time in the skin, giving a more sustained local anti-inflammatory effect and thus, arresting the AA process and promoting hair regrowth. Furthermore, the combination of Restylane速 with IL triamcinolone acetonide injections may prevent a common side effect, atrophy. With the prevention of scalp atrophy and the preservation of higher concentrations of triamcinolone acetonide for longer periods of time, patients may see a better clinical response for a longer period of time. Quality of life may improve as the number of clinic visits decreases as would the number of IL corticosteroid injections.</brief_summary>
