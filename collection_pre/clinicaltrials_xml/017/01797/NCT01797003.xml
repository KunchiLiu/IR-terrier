	<brief_summary>Prospective randomized study. Compare two techniques for high tibial osteotomy (HTO) for treatment of medial knee osteoarthritis. Opening wedge osteotomy using Puddu plate vs Closing wedge osteotomy using cramp fixation. We will compare functional results and patient satisfaction with repetitive evaluations from preoperatively to 2 years postoperatively.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Time-dependent Functional Results Following HTO. Closing Wedge vs Opening Wedge Technique.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Determination of the time course of patient-relevant functional outcome and the time course of Range of Motion (ROM) following HTO. Comparison of the Opening wedge and Closing wedge methods. Time-dependent improvement in functional outcome following High tibial Osteotomy. Medial opening wedge vs Lateral closing wedge. A two-year prospective randomized study involving 70 patients. In a prospective randomized study, we plan to include 70 patients aged 30-60 years operated with valgus high tibial osteotomy. 2 groups: 35 opening wedge, and 35 closing wedge osteotomies. Data are collected by independent investigators (physiotherapists) preoperatively and at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperatively. Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and ROM are determined at all follow-ups.</detailed_description>
