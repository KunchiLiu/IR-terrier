	<brief_summary>The investigators aim to evaluate the safety of delivering a one-time single fraction of Lattice Extreme Ablative Dose (LEAD) radiotherapy followed one day later by standard-dose, conventionally fractionated concurrent chemotherapy and radiation delivered over 6 weeks in patients with bulky stage III non-small cell lung cancer in the setting of a single-arm phase I clinical trial. The investigators hypothesize that the addition of a one-time single fraction of LEAD radiation is safe and feasible, and will not result in additional toxicity above that expected with standard-dose concurrent chemotherapy and radiation alone.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must have histologically or cytologically documented stage III nonsmall cell lung cancer including squamous cell, adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma and poorly differentiated nonsmall cell lung cancer. Patients must have a minimum of 4 cm of measureable disease in any one continuous dimension as seen on diagnostic CT scan. Pulmonary function tests with FEV1 &gt;= 1.45 liters/second. Patients must be 21 years of age or older. There is no maximum age restriction. Patients must have a Zubrod performance status of 0 or 1. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below: leukocyte &gt; 3,000/:I absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/:1 platelets &gt;100,000/:1 bilirubin within normal institutional limits AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal. Patients must have weight loss ≤ 10% over the past three months. Women of childbearing potential and men will be asked to use adequate contraception. Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Patients may not have had prior thoracic radiation at any time, or prior chemotherapy for the study cancer at any time. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents for the study cancer. Patients may not have evidence of brain metastases on baseline CT scan or MRI. Patients may not have measurable gross disease in the thorax &lt;4 cm in any one continuous dimension. Patients may not have a cytologically positive pleural effusion. Patients may not have a prior invasive malignancy (unless diseasefree for at least 3 years). Patients may not have had surgical resection of the present cancer. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding will be excluded. Patients must not have any comorbidity with life expectancy ≤ 6 months, or any uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Patients must not have severe lung disease defined by a history of severe COPD requiring 3 or more hospitalizations over the past year, or history of interstitial pneumonitis. Patients must not have any concurrent active malignancy. Patients must not have evidence of metastatic disease.</criteria>
