	<brief_summary>A potential application for unstructured monoacylglycerol (MAG) containing long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA)can be to provide essential fatty acids to humans who chronically consume lipases inhibitor such as Orlistat® for weigh lowering reasons. Indeed, it is predictable that chronic consumption of Orlistat® led to a depletion of essential fatty acids with time, therefore unstructured MAG containing LC-PUFA can be an option as a source of LC-PUFA for patients under Orlistat® treatment and hypothetically for subjects with other type of maldigestion/malabsorption. Potential applications of such concept are therefore related to disease conditions comprising low lipid digestion due to lipase activity insufficiency. In the present study, in order to see the response information for eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) delivery, EPA will be provided either as a mixture of free monoacylglycerols or as triacylglycerol (TAG). The erythrocyte and plasma fatty acid composition from subjects under Orlistat® consumption will be analyzed.</brief_summary>
