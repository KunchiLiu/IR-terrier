	<criteria>Key Ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form, which must be obtained prior to initiation of study procedures Plasma HIV1 RNA levels ≥ 1,000 copies/mL at screening No prior use of any approved or investigational antiretroviral drug for any length of time, except the use for preexposure prophylaxis (PREP), or postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) up to 6 months prior to screening Screening genotype report must show sensitivity to elvitegravir, emtricitabine, tenofovir DF Normal electrocardiogram (ECG) Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 50 mL/min according to the CockcroftGault formula for creatinine clearance Hepatic transaminases (AST and ALT) ≤ 5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL, or normal direct bilirubin Adequate hematologic function Serum amylase ≤ 5 × ULN Males and females of childbearing potential must agree to utilize highly effective contraception methods or be nonheterosexually active or practice sexual abstinence from screening throughout the duration of study treatment and for 30 days following the last dose of study drug Females who utilize hormonal contraceptive as one of their birth control methods must have used the same method for at least three months prior to study dosing Females who have stopped menstruating for ≥ 12 months but do not have documentation of ovarian hormonal failure must have a serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level at screening within the postmenopausal range based on the Central Laboratory reference range Age ≥ 18 years Key A new AIDSdefining condition diagnosed within the 30 days prior to screening Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive Hepatitis C antibody positive Individuals experiencing decompensated cirrhosis Females who are breastfeeding Positive serum pregnancy test Have an implanted defibrillator or pacemaker Current alcohol or substance use judged by the Investigator to potentially interfere with study compliance History of malignancy within the past 5 years or ongoing malignancy other than cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma, basal cell carcinoma, or resected, noninvasive cutaneous squamous carcinoma Active, serious infections (other than HIV1 infection) requiring parenteral antibiotic or antifungal therapy within 30 days prior to baseline Any other clinical condition or prior therapy that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would make the individual unsuitable for the study or unable to comply with dosing requirements Participation in any other clinical trial (including observational trials) without prior approval Receiving ongoing therapy with drugs not to be used with elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, tenofovir DF, and TAF or participants with any known allergies to the excipients of E/C/F/TDF or E/C/F/TAF Note: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
