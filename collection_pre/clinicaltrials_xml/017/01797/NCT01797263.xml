	<brief_summary>The Pain Outcomes comparing Yoga versus Structured Exercise (POYSE) Trial is a 2-arm parallel group, randomized clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of a yoga-based intervention (YOGA) with that of a structured exercise program (SEP) for subjects with fibromyalgia. The study aims are: 1) to compare the interventions' (YOGA vs. SEP) effects on overall fibromyalgia severity at 1 month (early response), 3 months (immediate post-intervention) and at 6 and 9 months (sustained effects); 2) to compare the interventions effects on specific fibromyalgia symptoms (pain, sleep, and fatigue), functional impairment, and related outcomes (quality of life, psychological symptoms); and 3) to compare the cost-effectiveness of the interventions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pain Outcomes Comparing Yoga Versus Structured Exercise (POYSE) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study sample will include 306 Veterans with fibromyalgia. Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment arms. The YOGA arm will involve a standardized 12-week, yoga-based intervention. The yoga intervention will consist of three treatment components: 1) in-person group yoga taught by a certified yoga therapist; 2) a relaxation audio recording for home-use; and 3) a DVD recording to reinforce concepts taught during in-person yoga sessions. Patients randomized to the structured exercise program (SEP) arm will participate in a 12-week exercise program delivered in a group/class format and supervised by a fitness instructor. In addition, SEP patients will receive a DVD (for home use) describing the benefits of aerobic exercise for fibromyalgia, a one-on-one consultation session with the fitness instructor, an individualized exercise prescription, and supervised exercise sessions for 12 weeks.</detailed_description>
