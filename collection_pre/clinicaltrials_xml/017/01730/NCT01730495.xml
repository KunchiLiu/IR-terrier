	<brief_summary>The hypothesis is that a subset of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome/ myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME), including also patients with no clinical response after B-cell depletion therapy using the anti-CD20 antibody Rituximab, may benefit from tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibition using Etanercept as weekly subcutaneous injections.</brief_summary>
