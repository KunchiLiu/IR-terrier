	<brief_summary>Both taping and balance exercises have effects on dynamic balance, so this study compared ankle taping and balance exercise on postural stability indices in healthy women. we hypothesized that both balance exercise and taping would increase stability indices but the effects of balance exercise was more greater than taping.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Ankle Taping and Balance Exercises on Postural Stability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ability to control the body in the space is a complex interaction between musculoskeletal and neural systems. This set is called postural control system. Postural control involves the control of body position in space for the dual purposes of postural stability and postural orientation. Balance process is divided into four-stage by Sullivan and Markos: mobility, stability, controlled mobility, and skill. Several types of exercise have been proposed to improve proprioception. Bout and Gahery stated that balance exercises improve neuromuscular relations and reduces the proprioception errors. They believe that those who have more proprioception difficulty may benefit more from exercise therapy.Taping is another technique to enhance proprioception. Improvement in proprioception leads to better function and reduction of disability. Kinesiotaping is being used to prevent injuries and to help curing the injury. It can also improve efficiency in sport, improve lymph and venous circulation, decrease edema, stimulate the mechanoreceptors and increase awareness of subject about the ankle position, reduces the pain and improves muscle performance</detailed_description>
