	<brief_title>Online Emotional Regulation Group Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will examine the feasibility of online delivery of emotional regulation training to individuals with Traumatic Brain Injury who also have emotional dysregulation. 80 subjects with significant emotional dysregulation will be enrolled and will receive 24 60-minute emotional regulation sessions twice a week for 12 weeks, delivered online via a group meeting software. Study participation will last 28 weeks: 4 weeks of baseline, 12 weeks of treatment (24 sessions) and 12 weeks of follow-up. Assessments will be conducted at each of four timepoints: T1 (baseline), T2 (pre-treatment assessment), T3 (end-of-treatment assessment) and T4 (follow-up assessment). In addition, a subset of the measures will be administered bi-weekly for the duration of the study. Assessments will consist of a variety of measures designed to measure executive functioning, problem solving skills, and quality of life. All assessments will be completed online, using a web-based data collection. Attendance and treatment compliance will be tracked, and outcomes will be monitored using online data collection methods. Treatment satisfaction and participant subjective experience (including technical difficulties that make access to web-delivered treatment impossible) will also be assessed.</detailed_description>
