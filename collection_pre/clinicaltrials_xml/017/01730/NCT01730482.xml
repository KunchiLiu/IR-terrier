	<brief_summary>This study is designed to describe the metabolism of AT1001 (migalastat HCl) and the contribution of metabolism and urinary excretion to its overall elimination as part of the continuing assessment of the safety and effectiveness of the drug. This is a Phase 1, single-site, open-label, single dose study of the absorption, metabolism and excretion of radiolabeled AT1001 in healthy male subjects between 30 and 55 years of age, inclusive. Six subjects will be dosed, with the goal of having at least 4 subjects complete the study through follow-up. All subjects will be screened within 28 days before admission to the Clinical Unit. Subjects will be confined to the clinical unit for 10 days after dosing and will return to the clinic for a follow-up visit 28 days after dosing. Each subject will receive a single oral dose of AT1001 as an aqueous solution containing 150 mg [14C] AT1001 (1 Î¼Ci). Blood, duodenal bile, expired air, urine, and feces samples will be collected at specified time points after dosing throughout the period of confinement at the study site. Safety will be assessed throughout the study by monitoring clinical laboratory tests, ECGs, physical examinations, vital signs, and adverse events. The total duration of the study for each subject is approximately 8 weeks.</brief_summary>

Presence or history of severe adverse reaction to any drug; history of hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to AT1001 or related iminosugars Receipt of any investigational agent or participation in any other interventional clinical trial within the past 30 days Participation in any clinical study involving administration of [14C] labeled compound(s) within the last 12 months. A subject's previous effective dose will be reviewed by the medical investigator to ensure there is no risk of contamination/carryover into the current study At Day 1, a drug toxicology screen positive for any illicit substances, or alcohol Anticipated need for alcohol, tobacco, or any drug during the period of confinement in the clinical unit</criteria>
