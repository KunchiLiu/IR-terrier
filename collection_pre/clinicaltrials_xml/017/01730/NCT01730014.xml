	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of this trial is to investigate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (the exposure of the trial drug in the body) and pharmacodynamics (the effect of the investigated drug on the body) of subcutaneous NNC0148-0000-0287 (insulin 287) in healthy subjects and in subjects with type 1 diabetes</brief_summary>
