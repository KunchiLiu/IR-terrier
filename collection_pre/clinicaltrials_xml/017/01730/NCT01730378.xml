	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the immunogenicity and the safety of PrepandrixTM in Korean subjects. A second group of subjects will receive FluarixTM vaccine as control.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunogenicity and Safety of PrepandrixTM in Korean Subjects Aged 18 to 60 Years Old</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Initially, 124 subjects were planned to be enrolled according to a 1:1 randomisation ratio. However, by mistake, the randomisation application was set up consistent with the vaccine supply ratio (2:1) rather than the treatment group randomization ratio (1:1). Subsequently, the protocol was amended to adjust the sample size and randomisation ratio for the study. The study will enrol 126 subjects randomised 2:1. 84 subjects will receive Prepandrix™ and 42 subjects will receive Fluarix™.</detailed_description>

An acute evolving neurological disorder or history of GuillanBarré syndrome. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose. Any administration of longacting immunemodifying drugs within three months before study start, or a planned administration during the study period. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period.

Administration of any vaccines within 30 days before vaccination, or planned administration during the study start.
