	<brief_summary>The most widely used approach for the invasive treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is catheter ablation, by which radiofrequency energy is used to heat the tip of an ablation catheter to deliver targeted burns on the inner surface of the heart. The aim of this approach is to cause electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the information which can be derived from the latest catheter technologies - on the degree of contact force between the catheter and the heart - affects the time to perform the procedure, or the outcomes as a result of it. Patients undergoing pulmonary vein isolation will be randomised to having their procedure performed with the contact force information available to the operator, or not available. The time taken to achieve pulmonary vein isolation is the primary end-point of the study.</brief_summary>
