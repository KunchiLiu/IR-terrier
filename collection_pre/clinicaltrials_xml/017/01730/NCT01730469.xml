	<brief_summary>This study will assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) study of a single dose of 150 mg AT1001 (migalastat HCl, GR181413A) administered orally to healthy subjects with normal renal function and to subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Pharmacokinetics of AT1001 (Migalastat HCl) in Healthy Subjects and Subjects With Impaired Renal Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be an open-label, non-randomized, multiple-center, sequential group, safety, tolerability, and PK study of a single dose of AT1001 (migalastat HCl, GR181413A) administered orally as a 150 mg dose in fasted healthy control male and female subjects with normal renal function compared to mild, moderate, and severe renally-impaired subjects (classified by level of creatinine clearance [CLcr] as determined by the Cockcroft-Gault formula). Screening will occur from Day -28 to Day -2. Subjects will check-in to the clinic on Day -1 and receive a single oral dose of 150 mg AT1001 on Day 1. Subjects will be discharged from the clinic on Day 2 (if stable as determined by the Investigator) and return for daily visits on Day 3 through Day 6 for a safety assessment and PK sampling. Subjects will undergo a follow-up visit on Day 7 (+1) and an end of study visit on Day 10 (+1).</detailed_description>
