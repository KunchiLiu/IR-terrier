	<criteria>1. Patients with LDLC greater than or equal to 70 mg/dL at the screening visit and who are not adequately controlled with a stable daily dose of rosuvastatin, with or without other LMT. OR 2. Patients with screening LDLC greater than or equal to 100 mg/dL who are not adequately controlled with a stable daily dose of rosuvastatin before the screening visit, with or without other LMT. 1. LDLC less than 70 mg/dL at the screening visit in patients with history of documented cardiovascular disease (CVD) 2. LDLC less than 100 mg/dL at the screening visit in patients without history of documented coronary heart disease (CHD) or nonCHD CVD, but with other risk factors 3. Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) (clinically or previous genotyping) 4. Recent (within 3 months prior to the screening visit) myocardial infarction (MI), unstable angina leading to hospitalization, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary bypass graft surgery (CABG), uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, stroke, transient ischemic attack, carotid revascularization, endovascular procedure or surgical intervention for peripheral vascular disease 5. Newly diagnosed (within 3 months prior to randomization visit) or poorly controlled diabetes 6. Presence of any clinically significant uncontrolled endocrine disease known to influence serum lipids or lipoproteins (The inclusion/ exclusion criteria provided above is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in this clinical trial).</criteria>
