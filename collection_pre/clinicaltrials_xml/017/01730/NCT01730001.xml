	<brief_summary>This study looks at advanced airway management in critically ill or injured patients treated by physician manned emergency medical services, comparing early (on-scene) intubation to late (emergency department) intubation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Versus Late Intubation Trial in Physician Manned Emergency Medical Services</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ELITE trial is a prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare competent EARLY-intubation to LATE-intubation in patients with on-scene Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) &lt; 9 and short ambulance transport times (&lt; 20 min) to hospital. The study aims to establish if advanced airway management with endotracheal intubation (ETI) in the field by specially trained Emergency Medical Services (EMS) physicians - compared to endotracheal intubation (ETI) performed by physicians in the emergency department in the same group - improves outcome in terms of 30-day mortality, degree of disability at discharge, complications and length of hospital stay, and neurologic outcome at 6 months.</detailed_description>
