	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial studies sorafenib tosylate and stereotactic body radiation therapy to see how well they work compared to sorafenib tosylate alone in treating patients with liver cancer. Sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be able to send the radiation dose directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving sorafenib tosylate together with stereotactic body radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib Tosylate With or Without Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) improves overall survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with sorafenib (sorafenib tosylate). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the difference in time to progression (TTP) and progression-free survival (PFS) in HCC patients treated with sorafenib compared to SBRT followed by sorafenib. II. To measure differences in toxicity in HCC patients treated with sorafenib versus SBRT followed by sorafenib. III. To measure vascular thrombosis response post sorafenib versus SBRT followed by sorafenib. IV. To measure differences in health related quality of life (QOL) and quality-adjusted survival in HCC patients treated with sorafenib compared to SBRT followed by sorafenib. V. Collection of biospecimens for future correlative studies to investigate differences in potential biomarkers in patients treated with sorafenib versus SBRT followed by sorafenib. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM 1: Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 5 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM 2: Patients undergo SBRT every 24-72 hours for a total of 5 fractions over 5 to 15 days. Within 1-5 days post-SBRT, patients receive sorafenib tosylate PO BID on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 5 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed weekly during SBRT, monthly during sorafenib tosylate and on the following schedule as a whole from study entry: every 3 months for 3 years, then every 6 months for 2 years and then annually.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have a diagnosis of HCC by at least one criterion listed below within 360 days prior to study entry: Pathologically (histologically or cytologically) proven diagnosis of HCC,(biopsies are recommended, and are to be submitted for research evaluation if patients consent) At least one solid liver lesion or vascular tumor thrombosis (involving portal vein, inferior vena cava [IVC] and/or hepatic vein) &gt; 1 cm with arterial enhancement and delayed washout on multiphasic computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the setting of cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B or C without cirrhosis. For patients whose CURRENT disease is vascular only: enhancing vascular thrombosis (involving portal vein, IVC and/or hepatic vein) demonstrating early arterial enhancement and delayed washout on multiphasic CT or MRI in a patient with known HCC (diagnosed previously &lt;720 days) using the above criteria. Measureable hepatic disease and/or presence of vascular tumor thrombosis (involving portal vein, IVC and/or hepatic vein) which may not be measureable as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) on liver CT or MRI, within 28 days of registration Appropriate for protocol entry based upon the following minimum diagnostic workup: History/physical examination including examination for encephalopathy, ascites, weight, height, and blood pressure within 14 days prior to study entry Assessment by radiation oncologist and medical oncologist or hepatologist who specializes in treatment of HCC within 28 days prior to study entry Prerandomization Scan (REQUIRED for All Patients): CT scan chest/abdomen/pelvis with multiphasic liver CT scan or multiphasic liver MR scan within 28 days prior to study entry.
