	<brief_title>Interscalene and Combined Supra Scapular and Axillary Nerve Blocks in Rotator Cuff Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients having elective arthroscopic rotator cuff repair will be randomized to one of the two groups. Group 1: This group will receive Interscalene block (ultrasound guided and nerve stimulator aided) followed by a general anesthesia. Group 2: This group will receive Suprascapular and Axillary nerve block (ultrasound guided and nerve stimulator aided) followed by a general anesthesia. Performance time, quality and efficacy as well as any side-effects of the blocks will be evaluated in terms of pain scores in recovery room, after 4- 6 hours and the next morning, opioid usage and patient satisfaction. Primary hypothesis: • Combined Suprascapular and axillary nerve blocks provide similar postoperative analgesia as compared to interscalene block for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Secondary hypothesis • Interscalene block is associated with more side effects and complications as compared to suprascapular nerve block and axillary nerve block.</detailed_description>
