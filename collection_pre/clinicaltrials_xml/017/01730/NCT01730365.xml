	<brief_summary>Investigation of application possibilities of optical spectroscopy within the field of oncology. Optical spectroscopy enables the possibility to specifically differentiate between different (human) tissues. The hypothesis is that incorporation of this technique into existing medical devices (e.g. biopsy needle) would enlarge the accuracy and reliability of these devices. The purpose is to improve and speed up the diagnostics and therapy of the malignancies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optical Detection of Malignancy During Percutaneous Interventions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective: In this observational study the investigators aim to evaluate whether optical spectroscopy can correctly diagnose malignant tissue in the existing clinical workflow of percutaneous interventions in lung, liver, and breast. Secondary Objective: During the measurement procedure, possible improvements of the measurement hardware will be recorded. Analysis of this documentation will provide information for possible alterations of hardware design for improved clinical applicability in the future. Special attention will be paid to observe how the procedure fits in the standard workflow of the radiologist.</detailed_description>
