	<criteria>1. Diagnosis of MS a. Relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) not responding to at least a year of attempted therapy with one or more of the approved therapies (betainterferon, glatiramer acetate, natalizumab, mitoxantrone, fingolimod) as evidenced by one or more of the following: i. ≥1 clinically documented relapse in past 12 months ii. ≥2 clinically documented relapses in last 24 months iii. ≥1 GEL at MRI performed within the last 12 months b. Secondary progressive MS (SPMS) not responding to at least a year of attempted therapy with one or more of the approved therapies (betainterferon, glatiramer acetate, natalizumab, mitoxantrone, fingolimod) as evidenced by both: i. an increase of ≥1 EDSS point (if at randomization EDSS ≤ 5.0) or 0.5 EDSS point (if at randomization EDSS ≥ 5.5) in the last 12 months ii. ≥1 clinically documented relapse or ≥ 1 GEL at MRI within the last twelve months. c. Primary progressive MS (PPMS) patients with all the following features: i. an increase of ≥1 EDSS point (if at randomization EDSS ≤ 5.0) or 0.5 EDSS point (if at randomization EDSS ≥5.5), in the last twelve months ii. ≥ 1 GEL at MRI performed within the last 12 months iii. positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (oligoclonal banding) 2.
