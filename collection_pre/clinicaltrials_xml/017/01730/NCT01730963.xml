	<brief_title>Multi-Reader Multi-Case Study to Identify Uterine Contractions Recorded From Laboring and Nonlaboring Patients by Practicing Clinicians</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The SureCALL® Labor Monitor® (SureCALL®) is a transabdominal electromyography monitor intended to measure uterine activity. It is intended for use on pregnant women, with singleton pregnancies, using surface electrodes on the maternal abdomen. The device is intended for use by healthcare professionals in a clinical setting. This multi-reader multi-case study was designed to evaluate the performance of SureCALL® to the predicate Tocodynamometer device (TOCO). This study involved 25 women at a Gestational Age of 36 weeks or less and 5 women at a Gestation Age of greater than 36 and not in labor at five clinical sites. Each study subject was instrumented with two technologies for measuring uterine activity: 1. Standard tocodynamometer attached to the maternal abdomen, 2. SureCALL® with a set of abdominal surface electrodes for uterine electromyography attached to the maternal abdomen An assessment was obtained and quantified from masked, qualified clinical obstetrician readers for the evaluation of the equivalence of both labor monitor devices by identifying in isolation the individual uterine contraction signals and the peak of each contraction signal as recorded by each labor monitor device.</detailed_description>
