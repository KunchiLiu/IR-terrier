	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to optimize pretargeting parameters using pharmacokinetic and imaging data for immuno-PET using anti-CEA x anti-HSG TF2 BsMAb and 150 MBq of 68Ga-IMP-288 peptide in MTC patients with abnormal Ct serum level after initial complete surgery and at least one abnormal lesion</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ImmunoTEP for Patients With Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Variation of TF2 molar dose, IMP-288 molar dose and pretargeting interval will be performed in 4 to 5 cohorts of 3 patients, receiving 30 to 120 nmol of TF2 and 1.5 to 6 nmol of peptides 1 to 3 days apart. Blood samples will be obtained after TF2 and 68Ga-IMP-288 injections. A last cohort (cohorte number 5 or 6) with optimal conditions will be proposed. Whole-body PET images will be recorded 60 and 120 minutes after 68Ga-IMP-288 injection to assess semi-quantitatively tumor targeting and tumor/background ratio. Moreover, the targeting sensitivity of the TF2-pretargeted 68Ga-IMP-288 will be compared to standard methods of tumor. some patient will have a second immuno-TEP for their follow up in the first examen was the most sensible.</detailed_description>

Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception take continuously for 3 months. KPS ≥ 70 or ECOG 01 and life expectancy of at least 6 months Absence of serious illness or comorbidity assessed risk Creatinine ≤ 2.5 normal Absence of cancer treatment within 6 weeks prior to the immunoPET No history of cancer within 5 years, except skin cancer other than melanoma or carcinoma in situ of the cervix Lack of antiantibodies in patients who have previously received antibodies and hypersensitivity to antibody or protein Informed consent signed Social Insurance Pregnancy or breastfeeding Serious illness or comorbidity assessed risk History of cancer within 5 years, except skin cancer other than melanoma or carcinoma in situ of the cervix Presence of antiantibodies in patients who have previously received antibodies Known hypersensitivity to antibody or protein Need to establish a cancer treatment within 3 months of immunoPET (before stock evaluation 3 months) Inability intellectual sign consent Patient protected by law</criteria>
