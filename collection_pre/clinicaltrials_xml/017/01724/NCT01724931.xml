	<brief_title>Aminopterin Dose Finding Treatment for Methotrexate-Naïve Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose ranging study that will evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic properties (the absorption, distribution and excretion) of aminopterin following oral administration by subjects with active rheumatoid arthritis (≥ 6 tender and ≥ 6 swollen joints) who have not been treated with methotrexate (MTX). Subjects are randomized to one of three treatments: placebo, 1 mg of LD-aminopterin, or 3 mg of LD-aminopterin in a 1:1:1 ratio. The study hypothesis is that the 3 mg LD-aminopterin per week is effective at treating rheumatoid arthritis compared to placebo.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. &gt; 18 years of age. 2. A diagnosis of RA established by the ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria applied to patients who: 1) have &gt;1 joint with definite clinical synovitis (swelling); 2) with the synovitis not better explained by another disease. Add scores of categories AD; a score &gt;6/10 is required for study entry. A. Joint involvement: 1 large joint=0; 210 large joints=1; 13 small joints (with or without involvement of large joints=2; 410 small joints (with or without involvement of large joints)=3; &gt;10 joints (at least 1 small joint)=5. B. Serology (at least 1 test result is needed for classification): Negative RF and negative ACPA=0; Lowpositive RF or lowpositive ACPA=2; Highpositive RF or highpositive ACPA=3. C. Acutephase reactants (at least 1 test result is needed for classification): Normal CRP and normal ESR=0; Abnormal CRP or abnormal ESR=1. D. Duration of symptoms: less than 6 weeks=0; 6 weeks or greater=1. 3. Class I, II or III functional according to the ACR 1992 revised criteria for the classification of global functional status in RA. 4. RA is active, defined as ≥ 6 swollen joints and ≥ 6 tender joints. 5. Ability to understand and sign written informed consent. 6. For sexually active men and for women of childbearing potential, an adequate form of contraception. 7. For premenopausal women, a negative pregnancy test, obtained within 1 week prior to first study drug dose. 8. Negative serology for hepatitis B and hepatitis C. 9. The following screening laboratory blood tests must have the following values, or not clinically significant as determined by the PI and Medical Monitor: WBC WNL; absolute neutrophil count &gt; lower limit of normal; platelet count WNL; hemoglobin &gt;10.0 g/dL; AST WNL. 10. Adequate renal function: GFR estimated by CockcroftGault formula &gt;60 ml/min 1. Known history of hepatitis, HIV infection, interstitial lung disease. 2. Alcohol consumption on a regular basis and unwilling, or unable, to discontinue this consumption during the study period. 3. Prior methotrexate or aminopterin therapy. 4. Prior biologic drug therapy (e.g., etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab). 5. Within 2 weeks prior to Study Day 0, or on Study Day 0, or at any time during the study, use of any of the following medications that may result in drug/drug interactions with AMT: trimethoprim with or without sulfamethoxazole; sulfonamides; sulfonylureas; pyrimethamine; triamethamine; dipyridamole; colchicine; probenecid; aminoglycosides; theophylline; phenytoin; and folinic acid (i.e., leucovorin). 6. At Study Day 0 use of DMARDs and biologics (except antimalarials) including oral or injectable gold, azathioprine, penicillamine, sulfasalazine or cyclosporine. Subjects previously treated with any of these medications are eligible provided a 28 day washout is completed prior to Study Day 0. Antimalarial can be continued at the same dose if they have been administered at the same dose for 8 weeks before Study Day 0, and they will be administered at the same dose throughout the study. NSAIDs or corticosteroid (≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent/day) may be continued at the same dose if they have been used at a stable dose for two weeks prior to Study Day 0, and will be continued at the same doses throughout the study. 7. Use of corticosteroids in excess of 10 mg prednisone or equivalent/day. 8. Known concurrent malignancy except basal or squamous cell skin carcinoma, or cervical carcinoma in situ. 9. Concurrent participation in another clinical trial involving experimental treatment within 30 days of Study Day 0. 10. Current and uncontrolled infection, cardiovascular, renal, pulmonary, hepatic or GI conditions that will interfere with the conduct of the trial or pose a morbid risk. 11. Investigator's opinion that a concurrent disease or condition impairs the subject's ability to complete the trial: includes psychological, familial, sociological, geographical or medical conditions.</criteria>
