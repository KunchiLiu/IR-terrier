	<brief_summary>Chronic ulcers is a common clinical problem. Diabetes or peripheral vascular occlusion is major reason leading to chronic wound healing. The investigators's previous animal experiments have confirmed that OLED can promote burn wound healing and fibroblast proliferation in normal Wistar rat. In order to find the time point and dosage of the effective light therapy. The investigators further use cultured human fibroblasts in vitro to study light therapy to promote fibroblast proliferation mechanisms. Expect clinical application of light therapy in the future is more accurate and effective.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>To Study the Effect of Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLED) on Cultured Fibroblast</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic ulcers is a common clinical problem. Diabetes or peripheral vascular occlusion is major reason leading to chronic wound healing. Therapeutic methods to promote wound healing are hyperbaric oxygen therapy, vacuum assisted therapy and photostimulation. Although there are many treatments but no one has been widely accepted. The clinical effects of uncertainty, high cost and inconvenience of use is the main reason. Each year amputation of the population due to chronic ulcers has not decreased. In order to break the current medical difficulties, We refer to the new light therapy technology. Look forward to shorten the healing time and reduce medicine costs. The investigators's previous animal experiments have confirmed that OLED can promote burn wound healing and fibroblast proliferation in normal Wistar rat. In order to find the time point and dosage of the effective light therapy. The investigators further use cultured human fibroblasts in vitro to study light therapy to promote fibroblast proliferation mechanisms. Expect clinical application of light therapy in the future is more accurate and effective irradiative time points and dosage.</detailed_description>
