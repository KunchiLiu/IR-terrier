	<brief_summary>This multi-center, open-label, randomized study will evaluate the participant preference with subcutaneous versus intravenous administration of MabThera/Rituxan (rituximab) in participants with CD20+ diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or CD20+ follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In Arm A, participants will receive MabThera/Rituxan 375 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and MabThera/Rituxan 1400 mg subcutaneously (SC) on Day 1 of Cycles 2-4, followed by MabThera/Rituxan IV in Cycles 5-8. Participants in Arm B will receive MabThera/Rituxan IV in Cycles 1-4 and SC in Cycles 5-8. All participants will receive 6-8 cycles of standard chemotherapy (according to local country practice) with 8 cycles of MabThera/Rituxan. Anticipated time on study treatment is up to 24 weeks.</brief_summary>
