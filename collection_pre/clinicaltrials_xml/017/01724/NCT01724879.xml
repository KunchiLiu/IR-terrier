	<brief_summary>The current standard treatment approach for young patients with Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (Ph+ALL) is the combination of a chemotherapy protocol employing four to five cytotoxic agents typically used for ALL together with imatinib. It is recommended to propose allogeneic Standard Induction and Consolidation Therapy (SCT) to all eligible patients with a suitable donor and to continue imatinib with or without additional therapy in patients not undergoing SCT. This protocol is a study for newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients aged 18 to 55 years. The objective of this strategy is to improve the overall results in the treatment of adult ALL with the addition of specific molecules to the common chemotherapeutic schedule.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Frontline Dasatinib Plus Chemotherapy in Philadelphia Chromosome Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (PH+ALL)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the present study, the potent ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Dasatinib will be added to standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy for the Philadelphia positive chromosome sub-group of ALL patients aged 18 to 55 years. The Study hypothesis is, that Dasatinib in combination with standard chemotherapy according to GMALL protocol 07/2003 is feasible and induces cytologic and molecular remission rates comparable to chemotherapy in combination with imatinib without increased treatment-related mortality.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Confirmed new diagnosis of Philadelphia chromosome or BCRABL positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia Male or female patients aged 1855 years Not previously treated except for prephase (corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, single dose VCR will be permitted) therapy during establishment of the diagnosis Signed written inform consent, willingness and ability to comply with all study procedures Molecular detection of BCRABL transcripts Willingness of women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and male subjects whose sexual partners are WOCBP, to use an effective form of contraception (pearl index &lt; 1%), such as complete sexual abstinence, combined oral contraceptive, hormone IUCD, vaginal hormone ring, transdermal contraceptive patch, contraceptive implant or depot contraceptive injection in combination with a second method of contraception like a condom or a cervical cap / diaphragm with spermicide or surgical sterilisation (vasectomy) in male patients or male partners during the study and at least 6 months thereafter. WOCBP are defined as sexually mature women who have not undergone a hysterectomy or surgical sterilization or who have not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., who has had menses any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months).
