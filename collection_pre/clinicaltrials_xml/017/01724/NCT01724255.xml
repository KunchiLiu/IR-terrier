	<brief_summary>The medical literature does not provide sufficient information or recommendation regarding the optimal time to remove the staples and the bandage after a cesarean section. The goal of this study is to compare 5 groups of patients: 1. staple removal on POD 4 and dressing removal on Post Operative Day (POD)1 2. staple removal on POD 4 and dressing removal on Post Operative Day (POD)4 3. staple removal on POD 7 and dressing removal on Post Operative Day (POD)1 4. staple removal on POD 7 and dressing removal on Post Operative Day (POD)7 5. staple removal on POD 4 and dressing removal on Post Operative Day (POD)7 Since there is no definite protocol for staple and dressing removal, we will adapt the above protocol each for a 3-4 month period of time. Patients will be contacted to either return for a follow up visit or to answer a telephone survey.</brief_summary>
