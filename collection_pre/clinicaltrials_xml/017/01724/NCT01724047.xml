	<brief_summary>The primary goal of this study is to identify efficacious and cost effective intervention strategies that can improve academic and psychological outcomes for children with ASD, and can be feasibly be implemented at fidelity by school personnel in under served elementary schools. Two simultaneous interventions will occur. In intervention 1, students with ASD in inclusion classrooms will be randomized to the Playground Intervention or a waitlist control group. In the Playground Intervention, UCLA/ROC/UPENN staff will work with school personals (teachers, paraprofessionals) to increase peer engagement on the yard. In intervention 2, students in special day classes will be randomized to the 'Schedule Tools Activities Transitions' Intervention (STAT) or wait-list control. In the STAT Intervention, UCLA/ROC/UPENN staff will work with teachers to implement behavioral strategies in the classrooms. In both interventions, the conditions are: 1) Immediate treatment, where the training will begin immediately after baseline measures are completed. 2) Wait-list treatment, where the training will begin the follow school year.</brief_summary>
