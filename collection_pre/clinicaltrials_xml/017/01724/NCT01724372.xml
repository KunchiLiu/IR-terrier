	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, controlled pilot study comparing the antidepressant fluoxetine with the second generation antipsychotic aripiprazole in approximately 10 subjects aged 12-25 at risk for developing psychosis. Our primary hypotheses are that compared to aripiprazole, fluoxetine will be better tolerated and will lead to greater improvement in symptoms at the end of 6 months of treatment.</brief_summary>
