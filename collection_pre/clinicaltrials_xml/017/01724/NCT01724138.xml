	<criteria>Pediatric patients aged from 2 to less than 6 years old. Patients with transfusion dependent βthalassemia major. Serum ferritin values ≥ 1000 ng/ml at screening. Written informed consent must be obtained from the patient's legal guardian in accordance with local law and regulation prior to any screening procedures. Nontransfusiondependent thalassemia. Systemic diseases which would prevent study treatment (e.g. uncontrolled hypertension, cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, metabolic, etc.) Serum creatinine &gt; age adjusted ULN. Significant proteinuria as indicated by a urinary protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≥ 0.5mg/mg in a nonfirst void urine sample at screening. If UPCR is found to be ≥ 0.5 mg/mg the test can be repeated after 1 month. ALT/AST &gt; 2.5xULN and total bilirubin &gt; 1×ULN. Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 56% by echocardiography. Patient has a known history of HIV seropositivity or history of active/treated hepatitis B or C (a test for screening is not required). A history of clinically relevant ocular and/or auditory toxicity related to iron chelation therapy Any surgical or medical conditions which will significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of the drug(e.g. ulcerative disease, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, malabsorption syndrome, obstruction, or stomach and/or small bowel resection). Other conditions which investigator deems potential harm to patients if participate the study.</criteria>
