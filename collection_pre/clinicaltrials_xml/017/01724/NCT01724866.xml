	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of test doses of HM10460A on the duration of severe neutropenia (DSN) during Cycle 1 in patients with breast cancer who are candidates for adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study of HM10460A or Pegfilgrastim Use for the Management of Neutropenia in Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open label, multicenter, dose ranging study, sequentially enrolled by study dose, with a non-inferiority design to compare the effectiveness of HM10460A relative to a fixed dose of pegfilgrastim as a concurrent active control to each dose of HM10460A in patients with breast cancer. The study will include 4 arms: 3 dose levels of HM10460A versus pegfilgrastim. The start of study treatment is defined as the initiation of HM10460A or pegfilgrastim. The duration of treatment consists of a maximum of 4 cycles, which begin on Day 1 with chemotherapy administration and continue through Day 21. The planned number of patients is a total of 144 based on 36 enrolled into each of 4 treatment arms. The target population are patients with breast cancer who are candidates for neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with TC chemotherapy. All patients who receive at least 1 dose of either HM10460A or pegfilgrastim will be followed for safety through 20 (± 2) days after their last dose of study treatment or until all treatment-related AEs have resolved or returned to baseline/Grade 1, whichever is longer, or until it is determined that the outcome will not change with further follow-up.</detailed_description>
