	<brief_summary>[F-18]T807 is being developed as a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical for PET imaging of the human brain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 0, Open Label, Multi-center Exploratory and Safety Study of [F-18]T807</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Siemens Molecular Imaging (SMI) is seeking to determine if [F-18]T807 might be useful as a non-invasive assessment tool in the clinical evaluation of subjects with conditions associated with tau protein aggregates, such as Alzheimer's disease. The information collected under this exploratory study will not be used for diagnostic purposes, assessments of the participant's response to therapy or for clinical management of the participants. However, this exploratory study will provide baseline information on the safety, biodistribution, and dosimetry of [F-18]T807. These data will aid in the design of future studies of [F-18]T807 in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Overall, this study will provide initial data that inform the development of [F-18]T807 as the first PET imaging agent for human tau protein related pathology.</detailed_description>
