	<brief_summary>Dental fluorosis is a clinical manifestation of chronic exposure to high intakes of fluoride during the tooth development. The present study is planned to evaluate the efficacy of Resin Infiltration technique in improving the esthetics of non-pitted fluorosis stains on permanent anterior teeth. Resin infiltration is a novel method that has shown its efficacy in improving the esthetics of White spot lesions (WSLs) per say and post orthodontics WSLs in different both in-situ and in-vivo studies. The Resin Infiltration technique is also known to stop the progression of caries in non cavitated lesions in both, smooth surface and interproximal lesions. Therefore, the following trial will be conducted to assess the esthetic improvement of fluorosed permanent anterior teeth after resin infiltration and compare it with standard bleaching procedure and a combination of bleaching and Resin infiltration therapy in children with damaged teeth by fluorosis.</brief_summary>
