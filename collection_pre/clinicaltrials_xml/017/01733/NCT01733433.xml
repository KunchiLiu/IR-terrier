	<brief_summary>The main goal of this study is to evaluate the effect of taping on postural control during dynamic exercises. 30 subjects with Chronic ankle instability (CAI) will be included in the study. Several questionnaires regarding anthropometric data, medical history, activity level and functional status will be filled in by the participants. Postural control will be measured using a force plate and an optoelectronic system to capture lower limb kinematics. Subjects will be asked to perform a forward hop, sideward hop and a vertical drop, and they have to maintain their balance for 10 seconds after landing. 5 good trials of each movement will be captured. Subjects with CAI will perform these exercises with and without tape. Hypothesis is that subjects with CAI that tape will enhance postural control.</brief_summary>
