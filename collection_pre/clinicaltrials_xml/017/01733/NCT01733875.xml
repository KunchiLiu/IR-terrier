	<brief_title>2-part Study to Assess Safety, Pharmacokinetics &amp; Pharmacodynamics of CC-220 &amp; Effect of Food on CC-220 in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 2-part study to be conducted at a single study center. Part 1 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending-dose study. During the course of Part 1, each subject will participate in a screening phase, a baseline phase, a treatment phase and a follow-up visit. There will be a total of 7 cohorts, each of which consists of a different dose level, with 8 subjects per cohort. In each cohort, 6 subjects will receive a dose of CC-220 and 2 subjects will receive placebo depending on the randomization schedule. A single dose will be administered to each subject. This study design allows safety and tolerability data to be gathered in a stepwise fashion. Administration of study drug at the next higher dose level will not begin until the safety and tolerability of the preceding dose have been evaluated and deemed acceptable by the investigator and sponsor's medical monitor. Part 2 is an open-label, randomized, 2-period, 2-way crossover study. During the course of Part 2, each subject will participate in a screening phase, a baseline phase in each study period, a treatment phase in each study period and a follow-up visit. A total of 10 subjects will receive a single dose of 1 mg CC-220 in each of 2 study periods, once without food and once with food, depending on the treatment sequence to which they are randomized. The CC-220 dose in each study period will be separated by a washout of 11 to 14 days.</detailed_description>

History of any clinically significant and relevant neurological, gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, psychological, pulmonary, metabolic, endocrine, hematological, allergic disease, drug allergies, or other major disorders. 2. Any condition which places the subject at unacceptable risk if he or she were to participate in the study, or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study. 3. Used any prescribed systemic or topical medication (including but not limited to analgesics, anesthetics, etc) within 30 days of the first dose administration, unless sponsor agreement is obtained. 4. Used any nonprescribed systemic or topical medication (including vitamin/mineral supplements, and herbal medicines) within 14 days of the first dose administration, unless sponsor agreement is obtained. 5. Used cytochrome P450, subfamily 3A inducers and inhibitors (including St. John's Wort) within 30 days of the first dose administration. 6.

Appendectomy and cholecystectomy are acceptable. 7. Donated blood or plasma within 8 weeks before the first dose administration to a blood bank or blood donation center. 8. History of drug abuse (as defined by the current version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) within 2 years before dosing, or positive drug screening test reflecting consumption of illicit drugs. 9. History of alcohol abuse (as defined by the current version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) within 2 years before dosing, or positive alcohol screen. 10. Known to have serum hepatitis or known to be a carrier of hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C antibodies, or have a positive result to the test for human immunodeficiency virus antibodies at screening. 11. Exposed to an investigational drug (new chemical entity) within 30 days preceding the first dose administration, or 5 halflives of that investigational drug, if known (whichever is longer). 12. Smoke more than 10 cigarettes per day, or the equivalent in other tobacco products (self reported). 13. Vaccination within 30 days of dosing or plans to receive vaccination within 30 days after dosing. Systemic infection within 30 days of dosing.</criteria>
