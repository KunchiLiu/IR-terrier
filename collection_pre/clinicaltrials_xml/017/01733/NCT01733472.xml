General anaesthesia compared to intrathecal anaesthesia will give shorter length of hospital stay (LOS) for patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA). Primary endpoint: LOS. Secondary endpoints: Postoperative pain? Postoperative orthostatic function (dizziness) Time until the patient meets the discharge criteria from PACU How many patients will need at least one urinary bladder catheterisation</detailed_description>
