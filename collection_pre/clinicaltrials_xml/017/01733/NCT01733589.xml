	<brief_summary>Resistance of hypoxic tumor cells to radiation is a significant reason of failure in the local control of tumors, especially the squamous cell carcinomas. Preclinical models have shown that Endostar may transiently "normalize" the tumor vasculature to make it more efficient for oxygen delivery, thereby providing a window of opportunity for enhanced sensitivity to radiation treatment. This study is to evaluate the safety, toxicity, and efficacy of the addition of Endostar Continued Pumping into Vein to the standard CCRT regimen in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC.</brief_summary>
