	<detailed_description>Road traffic injuries are the 4th leading cause of death among individuals in the economically productive age group (age 15 to 59) in low and middle income countries. The Africa region currently has some of the world's highest traffic injury rates, with vulnerable road users, including motorcycle riders, bearing a disproportionate share of the injury burden. Motorcycles are a rapidly growing form of transport in Africa, both for personal and commercial transportation. Conspicuity measures—factors that increase a motorcycle rider's visibility—for the prevention of motorcycle crash have been previously studied and found to be associated with a decreased risk of crash. Motorcycle taxi drivers are a particularly high risk population for motorcycle crash as they operate a motorcycle for several hours a day. Reflective, fluorescent safety vests are a common article worn by motorcycle drivers in some locations; however, penetration of such clothing in Moshi is currently low. This study aims to increase use of reflective vests among commercial motorcycle drivers. We will test whether provision of a free reflective, fluorescent vest increases use of reflective, fluorescent clothing compared to education about wearing reflective, fluorescent clothing alone.</detailed_description>
