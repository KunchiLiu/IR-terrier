	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine how multiple doses of canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) affect the pharmacokinetics (ie, how the body affects the drug) and pharmacodynamics (ie, how the drug affects the body) of a single dose of glyburide.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Effects of Canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) on the Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Safety of Glyburide in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be an open-label (all volunteers and study staff know the identity of the assigned treatment), single-center, fixed-sequence study (all volunteers receive the same medication on the same days) to determine how canagliflozin (a drug currently being investigated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus) affects the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of glyburide (a blood glucose-lowering agent used to treat patients with diabetes). The study will consist of 3 phases; a screening phase, an open-label treatment phase, and an end-of-study (or follow-up) phase. During the open-label treatment phase, each volunteer will receive a single 1.25 mg dose of glyburide on Day 1, followed by 200 mg canagliflozin once daily on Days 4 through 8. On Day 9 volunteers will receive both glyburide 1.25 mg and canagliflozin 200 mg. Each volunteer will participate in the study for approximately 40 days.</detailed_description>
