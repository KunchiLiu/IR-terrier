	<brief_summary>The investigators data reveal an important new observation regarding the recovery of breathing during emergence from general anesthesia: respiration resumes as a prolonged abdominal expiration event. The present study aims to further clarify the physiology of recovery of breathing with the addition of a cutaneous monitor for arterial carbon dioxide measurement and a comparison of two different recovery paradigms.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of the Effect of Arterial Carbon Dioxide Tension on the Recovery of Spontaneous Respiration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study will use non-invasive respiratory inductance plethysmography(RIP) and transcutaneous carbon dioxide measurement to compare recovery of respiration under constant Transcutaneous carbon dioxide measurement( ptcCO2) with continuous high frequency jet ventilation HFJV (study method) with recovery of respiration during rising and apnea (current standard). The investigators hypothesize that the prolonged abdominal expiration that we observed during recovery of breathing in prior studies will be unaffected by arterial carbon dioxide (CO2) levels.</detailed_description>
