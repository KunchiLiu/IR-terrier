	<brief_summary>This project will use a new form of non-invasive brain stimulation called high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) to facilitate verbal learning. This form of stimulation is similar to transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) but allows for more spatially focused stimulation. We hypothesise that HD-tDCS when applied to regions of the brain important for learning and memory will improve verbal learning and memory compared to sham HD-tDCS.</brief_summary>
