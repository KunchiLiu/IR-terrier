	<brief_summary>In the acute phase of stroke, dysphagia (difficulty/inability to swallow) is a common problem that can have serious consequences such as aspiration pneumonia, increased lenght of hospitalisation, and death. It would be interesting to enhance the therapeutic effect of swallowing retraining by means on non-invasive brain stimulation such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Hypothesis: during the acute phase of stroke, applying tDCS over the brain during the revalidation and/or supervised feeding improves dysphagia significantly when compared to sham tDCS.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>tDCS will be used in a double-blind, randomized control trial in acute stroke patients suffering from dysphagia. After informed consent and recruitment, patients will be randomly (computer method) allocated to real or sham tDCS, that will be applied during swallowing exercices/therapy or supervised feeding. Baseline and follow-up outcomes about dysphagia will be collected.</detailed_description>
