	<brief_title>Transplantation of Autologous Cardiac Stem Cells in Ischemic Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure is a common, costly, disabling, and potentially deadly condition. Heart transplantation is the ultimate approach to treating heart failure, but this is costly and excludes patients who are poor candidates for transplantation given their co morbidities, or for whom a donor organ is unavailable. Currently, there is no effective intervention to regenerate dead heart muscle after a heart attack. Our hypothesis is that CSCs regenerates myocardium. In this study all eligible patients are randomly allocated into two study groups by a permuted block randomization method: group A (case group) received 5-10 millions autologous cardiac stem cells, group B (control group) just received placebo. They follow up for 18 months.</detailed_description>
