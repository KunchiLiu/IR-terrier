	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety of specialized white cells from the donor at different doses. They are called WT1 sensitized T cells. They have been grown in the lab and are immunized against a protein. The protein is called the Wilms' tumor protein, or WT1. The multiple myeloma cells make and express this protein". The investigators want to learn whether the WT1 sensitized T cells will attach to the protein and kill the myeloma cells. The investigators want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, it has on the patient and multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis: Patient must have multiple myeloma that has either relapsed or remains refractory following autologous stem cell transplantation and patients who have plasma cell leukemia at diagnosis. Patients with relapsed multiple myeloma following autologous stem cell transplantation who achieved &lt; partial response following additional chemotherapy or who achieved &lt; PR at 3 months following autologous stem cell transplantation and patients with plasma cell leukemia at diagnosis. DONOR: Patients must have a healthy HLA matched or mismatched related or unrelated donor who is willing to receive GCSF injections and undergo apheresis for PBSC collection, or undergo a marrow harvesting procedure. HLAmatched related and unrelated donors Patients who have an HLAmatched related or unrelated donor are eligible for entry on this protocol. This will include a healthy donor who is genotypically matched at all A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 loci, as tested by DNA analysis. HLA mismatched related and unrelated donors Patients who do not have an HLAmatched donor but have a related or unrelated donor who have one antigen or one allele mismatch at the HLA A, B, C, DRB1 or DQB1 loci or who have two mismatches, at HLADQB1 and at one other locus, will be eligible for entry on this protocol. The following inclusion criteria are also required: Patients should be â‰¥ 21, &lt; 73 years old. Patients may be of either gender or any ethnic background. Patients must have a Karnofsky (adult) or Performance Status &gt; 70% Patients must have adequate organ function measured by: 1. Cardiac: asymptomatic or if symptomatic then LVEF at rest must be &gt; 50% and must improve with exercise. 2. Hepatic: &lt; 3x ULN ALT and &lt; 1.5 total serum bilirubin, unless there is congenital benign hyperbilirubinemia. 3. Renal: serum creatinine &lt;1.2 mg/dl or if serum creatinine is outside the normal range, then CrCl &gt; 40 ml/min (measured or calculated/estimated) with dose adjustment of Fludarabine for &lt;70ml/min. 4. Pulmonary: asymptomatic or if symptomatic, DLCO &gt; 50% of predicted (corrected for hemoglobin) Each patient must be willing to participate as a research subject and must sign an informed consent form. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding Active viral, bacterial or fungal infection Patient seropositive for HIVI/II; HTLV I/II Patients who have had a previous malignancy that is not in remission. Patients with known hypersensitivity to mouse proteins (murine antibodies in ISOLEX) if receiving SBAE bone marrow, or chicken egg products.</criteria>
