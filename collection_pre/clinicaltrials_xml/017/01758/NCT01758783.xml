	<brief_summary>Objective: To evaluate the effects of perioperative glutamine supplemented total parenteral nutrition support on nutritional status, immunologic function and intestinal permeability of patients with chronic radiation intestinal injury. Methods: The 40 patients with CRII were randomized into two groups, the standard TPN group and glutamine-enriched TPN group. The patients were administered total parenteral nutrition for at least four weeks (two weeks pre-operation and two weeks post-operation). The nutritional status, immunologic function, plasma concentration of glutamine and intestinal permeability were measured at 1 day, 1 week and 2 weeks pre-operation, 3 day, 1 week and 2 weeks post-operation. Nutrition status was determined the plasma concentrations of hemoglobin, albumin, prealbumin, transferrin and triglyceride. Immunologic function were measured by the percentages of CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells, the ratio of CD4 +T cells to CD8+T cells ( CD4 +/CD8 +) was calculated， and serum IgA, IgM and IgG．The intestinal permeability was detected by the urinal ratio of lactulose and mannitol.</brief_summary>
