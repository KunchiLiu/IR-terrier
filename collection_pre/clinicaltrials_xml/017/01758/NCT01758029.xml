	<detailed_description>the study protocol will follow hypogonadal patients, who initiate treatment with testosterone undecanoate, given in accordance with the standard protocol. Hypogonadal men eligible for treatment with testosterone undecanoate, who have not been treated with testosterone undecanoate within the last 6 months prior to enrollment, can be enrolled in the study. Patients who were treated with another testosterone formulation (eg. testosterone gel, testosterone enanthate injections) will require a 4 week wash-out period. Patients must be enrolled after the decision for treatment with testosterone undecanoate has been made. Patients will be followed for an observation period of 28 weeks. Observations will be recorded at 3 consecutive visits, and will assess patient and spouse satisfaction and quality of life with validated questionnaires. The study design is an intra-individual comparison. Each patient/spouse serves as his own control. a laboratory test for total testosterone level will be required in the last visit. the need for concomitant phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors use will also be recorded and analyzed.</detailed_description>
