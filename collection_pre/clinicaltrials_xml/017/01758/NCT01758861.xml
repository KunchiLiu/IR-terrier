	<brief_summary>Acute kidney injury (AKI) frequently occurs after cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) is known to provide organ protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury through its anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of a single preoperative bolus of EPO on the incidence of AKI following complex valvular heart surgery in a randomized, controlled and double-blind trial.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>preoperative risk factors for AKI and scheduled for complex valvular heart operations Enrolled criteria for high risk of AKI were patients with more than 2 of bellows: female, serum creatinine &gt;1.2 mg/dl, preoperative Afib, GFR &lt; 60 ml/min, NYHA class IV, HTN, DM, age &gt; 65 years, peripheral vascular disease. Complex valvular heart operations were defined as doublevalve surgery, combined valve and coronary artery bypass grafting procedures, Bentall operation, combined mitral valve surgery and tricuspid annuloplasty or reoperation. Patients with preexisting uncontrolled hypertension (diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mmHg), immunosuppression, history of thromboembolism, malignant disease, seizure, liver dysfunction, renal impairment (serum creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dL), and drug or alcohol abuse were excluded.</criteria>
