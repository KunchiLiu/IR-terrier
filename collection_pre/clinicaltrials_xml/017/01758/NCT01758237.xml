	<brief_summary>To establish the correlation of the location of the Nd:YAG laser peripheral iridotomy to the post operative visual symptoms experienced by some patients. The investigators hypothesize that fully uncovered laser peripheral iridotomy will produce less significant dysphotopsia, due to avoidance of the prismatic effect produced by the tear film than those covered.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Nd:YAG LPI is a frequently performed procedure for patients who have narrow angles at risk of acute angle closure glaucoma, pupillary-block conditions, chronic angle closure, and pigment dispersion syndrome. Most complications associated with the procedure are benign and include intraocular pressure (IOP) spike, transient uveitis, hyphema, corneal or lens damage and closure of the iridotomy. Visual disturbances have been also reported but only a few papers address this specific issue. The rate of these symptoms vary between 2.7% and 4%. It is believed that these symptoms are associated with the fact that light enters through the LPI and thus creating abnormal visual symptoms. Hence it has been suggested to carefully place the LPI so that the eyelid fully covers the LPI, therefore preventing light getting through. However, reports of patients with fully covered LPIs and visual disturbances have led to hypothesize the theory that even when fully covered by the eyelid, light can access through the LPI by a base-up prism created by the tear meniscus at the lid margin. Therefore, placement of the LPI, fully covered, partially covered or totally uncovered can potentially lead to equally significant symptoms. This study will attempt to address the issue of placement of the LPI in relationship with visual symptoms.</detailed_description>
