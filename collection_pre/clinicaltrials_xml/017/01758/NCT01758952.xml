	<brief_summary>Stroke is an important cause of perioperative morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients &gt; 60 years. In cardiac, neurological and carotid surgery the incidence is known to be high (2.2-5.2%). However, little is known regarding perioperative stroke following other types of surgery including general, urological, orthopedic, thoracic and gynecological procedures. We therefore propose to undertake a multicenter, observational cohort study, to determine the current incidence of, the risk factors for, and outcome associated with perioperative stroke in patients undergoing non-cardiac and non-neurological surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Incidence and Risk Factors of Peri-operative Stroke in Non-cardiac,Non-neurosurgical Surgeries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient population: Prospective cohort study of 10,000 adults undergoing non-cardiac, non-neurological surgery. Screening and enrollment: Consecutive patients undergoing (elective or emergency) non-cardiac, non-neurosurgical surgeries will be recruited. Monitoring, follow-up, and data collection: Usual treatment will be provided. Demographic details will be recorded. Patients will be visited regularly in hospital. Patient will be reviewed for neurologic deficit using the mNIHSS. Brain imaging will be performed to confirm stroke event. Follow-up at 30 days after discharge will be done to ascertain if there is any adverse outcome.</detailed_description>
