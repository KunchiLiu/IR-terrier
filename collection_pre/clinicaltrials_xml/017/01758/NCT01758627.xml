	<brief_summary>In patients with advanced heart failure (HF), systemic congestion is the main indication for hospitalization. Recent evidence has highlighted the role of fluid retention in the pathogenesis of renal dysfunction and subsequent diuretic resistance. Previous kidney disease, diuretic resistance, and progression of renal dysfunction often coexist in patients with HF and persistent volume overload. This clinical presentation represents the most extreme feature of the cardio-renal syndrome. However, available therapeutic options for this ominous condition are scarce and limited. Indeed, there are no data from randomized control trials using pharmacological interventions that support the beneficial effect on survival. Interestingly, intermittent ultrafiltration has recently emerged as an alternative therapeutic option for reducing volume overload in patients with refractory HF. Current literature suggests that it has potential advantages over standard medical treatment particularly in acute stages of HF. Among ultrafiltration methods, peritoneal dialysis (PD) has been preferred as an additional resource for the treatment of advanced congestive heart failure (CHF) compared with hemodialysis because it can provide a more physiological and continuous ultrafiltration. In fact, several studies showed that use of PD improved clinical functional class and hemodynamic parameters and reduced hospitalization rates in patients with CHF. Nevertheless, most studies were limited by retrospective analyses of small sample size, prospective observational design with no control group, or inclusion of patients with end-stage renal failure. Therefore, well-designed prospective randomized controlled studies are mandatory to confirm the effects of PD in these patients.</brief_summary>
