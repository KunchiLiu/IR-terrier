	<brief_summary>The skin of newborn infants is immature and ineffective as a barrier. Preterm skin exhibits even more vulnerability to the environment due to poor self regulatory heat mechanisms, paucity of fatty tissue and its thinness. Most preterm babies lose up to 13% of their weight as water loss from their skin during the first week of life. Many strategies have been utilized by neonatologists to decrease this water loss. Edible coconut oil application on the skin acts as a non permeable barrier and can help in achieving this. Hence the investigators decided to undertake this study to objectively assess the reduction in water loss from skin after oil application.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>All preterm babies born at the study center with birth weight &lt; 1500g were eligible for inclusion in the study. 1. Babies with birth weight less than 750 gms at birth 2. Babies with major congenital malformations. 3. Babies with severe asphyxia, hydrops and shock. 4. Babies with congenital diseases of skin associated with skin breach or denudation of skin precluding oil application 5. Babies with preexisting skin infection such as multiple furuncles (2 or more skin areas each limb, head, chest, abdomen and back are the individual areas that will be taken as one area)</criteria>
