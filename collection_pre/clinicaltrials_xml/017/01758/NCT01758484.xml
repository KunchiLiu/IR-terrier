	<brief_title>Supportive Care for Patients With Hematological Malignancies Undergoing Hematopoietic Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Pilot a supportive care intervention that begins prior to transplantation and continues through the acute peritransplant period. II. Determine the proportion of patients who enroll and the level of comfort / distress of hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) patients who meet with the supportive care team. III.
