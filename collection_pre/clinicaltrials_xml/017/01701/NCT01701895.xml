	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to evaluate how easy it is for female HIV- positive subjects taking Complera to comply with the dietary requirement using a food diary in the short term (4 weeks) and long term (24 weeks and 48 weeks) and to determine association between calorie intake and virologic suppression. A secondary goal of the study is to evaluate subjects' attitudes towards contraception.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing Short and Long Term Compliance With Caloric Intake in HIV Positive Women Taking Complera</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1. HIV1 infection documented by HIV serology or detectable viral load at any point prior to study entry or other documentation confirming HIV infection. If no documentation is available to confirm HIV infection, a rapid test may be performed to document HIV infection. 2. HIV+ female â‰¥18 years old and obtaining care at UNC Health Care Infectious Diseases Clinic, Wake County Human Services Clinic, or Durham County Early Intervention Clinic. Patients receiving care at other clinics may be entered with approval of the study team. 3. HIV viral load (VL) &lt; 50 copies/ml as measured by any FDAapproved test for quantifying HIV1 RNA during the six months prior to study entry (PSE). The timing of the viral load may be longer than 6 months depending on the schedule of the last clinic visit attended by the subject. The intent of the protocol was to assess viral load status at the previous clinic visit which may occur at an interval longer than six months due to the scheduling constraints of the UNC Infectious Diseases clinic. Viral loads drawn &gt; than 6 months (but not &gt; 8 months) prior to the study entry visit are acceptable. A single "blip" of &gt; 50 and &lt; 200 copies/ml is permissible provided the most recent VL is &lt;50 copies/ml. 4. No documented resistance to FTC, TDF or rilpivirine. Note: genotyping will not be performed on study. Subjects with no historical genotype will be considered to have no documented resistance. 5. Able and willing to provide informed consent. 6. In the opinion of the investigator, able to comply with study medication and procedures, including ability to complete food diary. 7. Willing to receive monthly phone calls. 8. Agreement between ID clinic provider and study team that clinical monitoring and care of patient will reside with the ID clinic provider. The study responsibility is limited to providing 48 weeks of Complera. 1. Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would be likely to interfere with ability to take the study medications appropriately and comply with the study protocol. 2. Current active illness requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization until the individual completes therapy or, in the opinion of the investigator, is clinically stable on therapy for at least 7 days prior to study entry. 3. Acute viral hepatitis. 4. Known allergy/hypersensitivity to components of the study drugs or their formulations. 5. Current or expected use of medication on the prohibited medication list.</criteria>
