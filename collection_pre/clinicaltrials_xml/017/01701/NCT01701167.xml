	<brief_title>Verification of the Quantitative Accuracy of the PET/CT System Imaging Chain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Scope: To evaluate the new technologies that have been included in the PCA-9000A PET/CT System, the study has the following 3 goals. - Define and confirm all supported clinical protocols from Low-Dose CT, to PET acquisition and presentation. - Verification of the quantitative accuracy of the imaging chain. - Evaluate the performance and stability of the new system and its related quality control and calibration procedures. Result (Expected): The study is an essential step in assessing the quality of the hardware and software defining the new PCA-9000A PET/CT System. Several essential parameters for the acquisition, reconstruction, correction, filtering, and presentation will be estimated or adjusted during this period. The evaluation will confirm PCA-9000A PET/CT System is effective for its intended use.</detailed_description>
