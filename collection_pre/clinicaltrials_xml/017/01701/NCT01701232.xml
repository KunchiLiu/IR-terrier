	<brief_summary>This international multi-center, randomized, controlled, open-label study will investigate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy and safety of BCD-020 (NN: rituximab, CJSC Biocad) versus MabThera (INN: rituximab, F. Hoffmann La Roche, Ltd.) both administered as a monotherapy of patients with indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Patients will be randomized to receive 375 mg/m² BCD-020 as intravenous infusion once a week for 4 weeks or MabThera at the same regimen.</brief_summary>
