	<brief_summary>Randomized trial to determine if the volume of fluid administration in pediatric patients with DKA impacts the rate of normalization of serum bicarbonate, pH as well as the length of treatment</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fluid Resuscitation for Pediatric Diabetic Ketoacidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized trial of two initial volumes of IVF and subsequent administration rates. Group I received 10 mL/kg of NS intravenous bolus over the first hour followed by ¾ NS with potassium replacement at 1.25 times maintenance and Group II received 20 mL/kg of NS intravenous bolus over the first hour followed by ¾ NS with potassium replacement at 1.5 times maintenance. The specific variables measured included demographics (age, gender, and race/ethnicity) and routine laboratory values (pH, pCO2, plasma glucose, electrolytes, bicarbonate, sodium, chloride, BUN. Length of treatment was defined as a time of the hospital stay after the start of IVF infusion.</detailed_description>
