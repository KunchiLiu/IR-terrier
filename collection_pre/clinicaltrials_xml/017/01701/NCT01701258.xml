	<brief_summary>Severe childhood adversity, including childhood sexual abuse (CSA), explains 32-44% of psychiatric disorders and is associated with substantially increased risks for depression and substance abuse later in life. However, 20-40% of adults with a history of CSA report little to no consequences. The neurobiological underpinnings associated with adaptive (resilience) and maladaptive consequences of CSA remain largely unknown. The goal of this study is to investigate brain pathways within adult females (with a history of CSA that occurred between the ages of 5-9) with and without a current diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD). We hypothesize that the CSA/MDD participants will be characterized by (1) reduced reward responsiveness and prefrontal cortex activity, but increased cortisol levels, (2) reduced dopamine activity, and (3) reduced dopamine transporter binding. The over-arching purpose of the study is to (1) identify individuals at risk for psychopathology and maladaptive behavior, (2) prevent re-victimization, and (3) develop more targeted therapeutic interventions. This study involves 4 sessions, described below. Session 1 (SCID Session) The first session takes place at the Center for Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Research (CDASR) or Neuroimaging Center (both at McLean Hospital) and involves consenting, a clinical evaluation, a series of questionnaires, and a medical assessment. Session 2 or 3 (fMRI Session) The third session takes place at the Neuroimaging Center. Using a double-blind design, participants will be administered either amisulpride (50 mg) or placebo. Participants will complete the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and the Probabilistic Stimulus Selection Task (PSST) afterwards. Session 2 or 3 (PET Session) This session takes place at Massachusetts General Hospital. 9 mCi of [11C] altropane will be injected by a trained nuclear medicine technician and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning will begin. Prior to the PET scan, a blood serum pregnancy test will be administered for females. Session 4 (ERP Session) The fourth session takes place at the CDASR and involves an electroencephalography (EEG) recording, the Probabilistic Reward Task (PRT), and collecting saliva samples to assess cortisol levels.</brief_summary>

Failure to meet MRI or PET safety requirements. Serious or unstable medical illness, including cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, respiratory, endocrine (hypothyroidism), neurologic or hematologic disease; Past/current DSM diagnosis of: OCD, ADHD, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, bipolar disorder, mood congruent/incongruent psychotic features, substance dependence, substance abuse within the last 12 months (with the exception of cocaine or stimulant abuse, which will lead to automatic exclusion); Simple phobia, social anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorders will be allowed only if secondary to MDD and only in the CSA/MDD and MDD groups (which will be matched for comorbidities); History of seizure disorder; renal insufficiency; history of adverse reactions to amisulpride; History of cocaine, stimulant, and other DA drug use [e.g., (meth)amphetamine), methylphenidate].</criteria>
