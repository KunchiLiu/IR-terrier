	<brief_summary>1. Objective To test the safety of 6 month-duration of DAPT compared to conventional 12-month-or-longer duration after second-generation DES implantation in patients with acute coronary syndrome. 2. Hypothesis A 6-month duration of DAPT is non-inferior to a conventional 12-month-or-longer duration of DAPT at preventing the occurrence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) at 18-month after second-generation DES implantation in patients with ACS</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1. Primary endpoint MACCE, defined as a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events at 18 months after the index procedure. 2. Secondary endpoint Individual component of primary endpoint at 18-month after index procedure Death, or myocardial infarction (MI) at 18-month after index procedure Cardiac death at 18-month after index procedure Target vessel failure (TVF) : cardiac death, MI in the target vessel territory, target vessel revascularization (TVR) at 18-month after index procedure Major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (all death, MI, cerebrovascular event, revascularization [MACCE]) at 18-month after index procedure Death, MI, cerebrovascular events, stent thrombosis or BARC Type 2, 3, 4, and 5 at 18-month after index procedure Death, MI, cerebrovascular events, stent thrombosis or BARC Type 2, 3, 4, and 5 at 18-month after index procedure</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Subject must be ≥ 20 years. 2. Subject is able to verbally confirm understandings of risks, benefits and treatment alternatives of receiving percutaneous coronary intervention and he/she or his/her legally authorized representative provides written informed consent prior to any study related procedure. 3. Subject must have a culprit lesion in a native coronary artery with significant stenosis (&gt;50% by visual estimate) eligible for stent implantation. 4. Subject must have clinical diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome that includes unstable angina and myocardial infarction. The specific definitions of acute coronary syndrome, as follows; 1) STsegment elevation MI (STEMI) elevation of STsegment more than 0.1 mV in 2 or more contiguous ECG leads or new left bundlebranch block with elevated biomarkers of myocardial necrosis 2) NonSTsegment elevation MI (NSTEMI) Elevated biomarkers of myocardial necrosis (troponin or CKMB &gt; upper reference limit) with one of the following 1. Transient STsegment elevation or depression, or Twave changes consistent with myocardial ischemia 2. Identification of a culprit lesion at coronary angiography 3) Unstable angina An accelerating pattern or recurrent episodes of chest pain at rest or with minimal effort and new STsegment depression of at least 0.05 mV, or T wave inversion of at least 0.3 mV in at least 2 leads. The ECG criteria for unstable angina were based on the TACTICSTIMI 18 trial.28 5. Target lesion(s) must be located in a native coronary artery with visually estimated diameter of ≥ 2.25 mm and ≤ 4.25 mm. 6. Target lesion(s) must be amenable for percutaneous coronary intervention 1. The patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to any of the following medications: Heparin, Aspirin, Clopidogrel, Biolimus, Everolimus, Zotarolimus, and Contrast media (Patients with documented sensitivity to contrast media which can be effectively premedicated with steroids and diphenhydramine [e.g. rash] may be enrolled. Those with true anaphylaxis to prior contrast media, however, should not be enrolled.) 2. Patients with active pathologic bleeding 3. Gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding within the prior 3 months, or major surgery within 2 months. 4. Systemic (intravenous) Biolimus, everolimus, zotarolimus use within 12 months. 5. Female of childbearing potential, unless a recent pregnancy test is negative, who possibly plan to become pregnant any time after enrollment into this study. 6. History of bleeding diathesis, known coagulopathy (including heparininduced thrombocytopenia), or will refuse blood transfusions 7. Noncardiac comorbid conditions are present with life expectancy &lt;1 year or that may result in protocol noncompliance (per site investigator's medical judgment). 8. An elective surgical procedure is planned that would necessitate interruption of clopidogrel during the first 12 months post enrollment. 9. Patients who are actively participating in another drug or device investigational study, which have not completed the primary endpoint followup period.</criteria>
