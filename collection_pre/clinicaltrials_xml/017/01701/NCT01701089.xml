	<brief_summary>This open-label, multiple dose, parallel group study will assess the monoamine oxidase in the brain by in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) and safety of RO4602522 in patients with Alzheimer disease and in healthy volunteers. Patients and volunteers will receive multiple doses of RO4602522 and up to three injections of C11-L-deprenyl-D2 used in the PET.</brief_summary>
