	<brief_summary>Sensory disturbances in persistent postherniotomy pain, include hyperalgesia from deeper structures as well as the skin. Whether this is one combined pain syndrome, where for instance deep pain leads to cutaneous hyperalgesia, or two isolated synchronous pain conditions, is unknown. By Giving pain free subjects an intense non-harmful electrical stimulation in deeper tissues in the groin and recording the skin sensory function, this hypothesis will be tested</brief_summary>
