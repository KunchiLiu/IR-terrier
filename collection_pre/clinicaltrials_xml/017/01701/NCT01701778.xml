	<brief_title>Caudal Versus Intravenous Dexmedetomidine for Supplementation of Caudal Analgesia in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single shot caudal epidural block is one of the most widespread technique for pediatric pain management after infraumbilical surgical procedures.However, in a significant proportion of patients, despite good initial analgesia from a caudal block with local anesthetic, pain develops after the block resolves. Dexmedetomidine is used increasingly in pediatric anesthesia practice to prolong the duration of action of caudal block with a local anesthetic agent.But which route of administration of clonidine is the most beneficial remains unknown. The investigators performed prospective randomized double-blind study to compare the effects of caudal dexmedetomidine with intravenous dexmedetomidine on postoperative analgesia after caudal levobupivacaine for inguinal herniorrhaphy or orchidopexy surgery. 90 children (ASAⅠorⅡ,aged 2-5 yr) undergoing unilateral orchiopexy or inguinal herniorrhaphy were included in this study. Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane via a facemask, followed by placement of a laryngeal mask airway. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane 2-3% in oxygen-air.Then,caudal block was applied. Patients were randomly assigned in three groups. Group Cau-DEX (n = 30): Caudal Levobupivacaine 0.25% 1ml/kg plus dexmedetomidine 1µg/kg and 10 ml normal saline i.v.;Group IV-DEX(n = 30): Levobupivacaine 0.25% 1ml/kg and dexmedetomidine 1µg/kg(10 ml)i.v.;Group Placebo(n = 30): Levobupivacaine 0.25% and 10 ml normal saline intravenous.</detailed_description>
