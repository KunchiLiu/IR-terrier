	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies infusion of laboratory-grown donor cord blood cells following combination chemotherapy in treating younger patients with acute myeloid leukemia that has returned or that does not respond to treatment. Chemotherapy drugs work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Chemotherapy also kills healthy infection-fighting cells, increasing the risk of infection. The infusion of laboratory-grown cord blood cells may be able to replace blood-forming cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy. This may decrease the risk of infection following chemotherapy, and allow for more chemotherapy to be given so that more cancer cells are killed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laboratory-Treated Donor Cord Blood Cell Infusion Following Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Younger Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the safety of infusing "off-the-shelf" non-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched expanded cord blood cells as supportive care following administration of FLAG (fludarabine phosphate, cytarabine, and filgrastim) consolidation or reinduction chemotherapy in pediatric and young adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the kinetics of autologous recovery when compared to historical cohorts. II. Assess the ability of the product to provide transient myeloid engraftment/recovery. III. Examine the in vivo persistence of the ex vivo expanded cord blood cells by determining the kinetics and durability of potential engraftment. IV. Develop understanding of the underlying immune interaction between the patient (host) and the infused expanded cord blood cells (donor) by performing in vitro analyses to assess host-mediated rejection of the non HLA-matched expanded cells. V. Estimate the incidence of clinically significant infections (e.g. bacterial, viral, or fungal) observed in patients treated with FLAG consolidation or reinduction chemotherapy followed by "off-the-shelf" non-HLA matched expanded cord blood cells. VI. Assess the percentage of patients that achieve complete remission (CR)/complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi)/complete remission with partial recovery of platelet count (CRp) with this therapy approach. VII. Assess long term efficacy (overall survival [OS]/disease free survival [DFS]) of FLAG consolidation or reinduction chemotherapy followed by "off-the-shelf" non HLA matched expanded cord blood cells in pediatric AML or acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage patients during long term follow up. OUTLINE: Patients receive filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) on days 1-7, fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days 2-6, cytarabine IV over 4 hours on days 2-6, and ex vivo-expanded cord blood progenitor cells IV over 30 minutes on day 8. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years.</detailed_description>
