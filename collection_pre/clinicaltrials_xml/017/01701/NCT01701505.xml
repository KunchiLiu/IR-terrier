	<brief_title>Dose-Ranging Study of Intranasal Kovacaine Mist in Pediatric Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-center, open-label, randomized, parallel-groups, dose-ranging study to assess the efficacy and safety of intranasally administered Kovacaine Mist for anesthetizing maxillary teeth in pediatric subjects. The study will employ an open-label design to determine the lowest effective doses (LEDs), and assess the safety and efficacy of Kovacaine Mist administered intranasally for inducing pulpal anesthesia of maxillary primary teeth numbers A to J and maxillary permanent teeth numbers 4 to 13 (maxillary right second premolar to maxillary left second premolar) sufficient to allow completion of the Study Dental Procedure, and will be carried out in healthy children of either sex between the ages of 3 and 17 years, inclusive.</detailed_description>

Patency of the naris ipsilateral to the tooth undergoing the Study Dental Procedure. Minimum weight: Subjects in Cohorts A and B (age 6 and above) must weigh at least 20kg (44 lb.). Subjects in Cohort C (age 3 and above) must weigh at least 10kg (22 lb.). Dental care requiring a local anesthetic within the 24 hours prior to anticipated study participation. History of allergy to or intolerance of tetracaine, benzyl alcohol, other ester local anesthetics, or paraaminobenzoic acid (as found in PABAcontaining sunscreen). History of allergy or hypersensitivity to lidocaine, oxymetazoline, epinephrine, or sulfite preservatives. Use of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor within the 3 weeks preceding study entry. Nursing, pregnant, suspected of being pregnant, or trying to become pregnant. (Females of childbearing potential will be required to take a urine pregnancy test on the day of, but prior to, study drug administration to rule out pregnancy.) Inadequately controlled thyroid disease of any type. Use of any investigational drug (including Kovacaine Mist) and/or participation in any clinical trial within 30 days of study participation. Frequent nose bleeds (≥ 5 per month). Anticipated need for use of oxymetazoline or phenylephrine nasal spray, nasal irrigation, or other nasal or oral decongestant on the day of the study procedure. History of congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia. Clinically relevant history of sinus/nasal surgery, recent epistaxis, nasal congestion or sinus infections, or use of a "sinus medication" within the 48 hours prior to anticipated study participation. History of alcoholism and/or drug abuse. Pulpal pathology in the index tooth. Anticipated need for use of nitrous oxide before or during the Study Dental Procedure. Any chronic or currently uncontrolled psychogenic, neurological, endocrine, pulmonary, cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal or hepatic disease or condition with manifestations that might confound interpretation of study results or make receipt of study medication a source of risk for adverse outcome. Fever defined as body temperature ≥100° (37°C) on the day of and prior to study drug administration.</criteria>
