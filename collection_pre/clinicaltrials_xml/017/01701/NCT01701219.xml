	<criteria>1. Presence of bacteremia due solely to: S. aureus on at least 1 blood culture within 72 hours of beginning study drug (Cohort A) OR MRSA on a baseline blood culture and on at least 1 additional blood culture after at least 72 hours of vancomycin and/or daptomycin treatment (Cohort B). 2. Male or female ≥ 18 years of age. 3. If female of childbearing potential must be willing to practice sexual abstinence or dual methods of contraception during treatment and for at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug. 4. Expectation of survival for at least 2 months. 1. For subjects in Cohort A: previous therapy for more than 48 hours with any parenteral antibiotic with activity against S. aureus within 72 hours of positive blood culture results. 2. For subjects in Cohort B: previous therapy for more than 48 hours with any parenteral antibiotic with activity against MRSA, except vancomycin and/or daptomycin, within 72 hours of positive blood culture results confirming persistence. 3. Previous episode of S. aureus bacteremia within 3 months. 4. Known leftsided endocarditis or prosthetic heart valve. 5. Osteomyelitis or prosthetic joint infection except new onset nonhardwareassociated vertebral osteomyelitis. 6. History of any hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to any βlactam antibacterial agent. 7. Evidence of significant hepatic, hematologic, or immunologic impairment. 8. Pregnant or nursing females.</criteria>
