	<brief_title>Activity and Safety Study of BKM120 in Monotherapy in Patient With Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer Recurrent or Progressive</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BKM120 is a PI3K inhibitor. The PI3K/Protein kinase B (AKT) signalling pathway deregulation is frequently observed in Head and neck cancer. In addition to its role in tumor genesis, the PI3K/AKT pathway seems to be involved in resistance to cetuximab. In this context, the study proposal is to evaluate the clinical interest of a monotherapy with a PI3K inhibitor (BKM120, Novartis) in patients with metastatic head and neck cancers refractory or relapsing under platin and cetuximab based- chemotherapy. Since resistance to cetuximab can result from phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) mutation, PIK3CA amplification or mutation upstream in the PI3K pathway, BKM120 activity will be evaluated in two parallel independent cohorts of patients: patients presenting a PI3KCA mutation and patients without a PI3KCA mutation.</detailed_description>
