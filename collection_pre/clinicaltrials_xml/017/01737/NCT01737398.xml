	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of IONIS-TTR Rx in Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy (FAP) is a rare, hereditary disease caused by mutations in the transthyretin (TTR) protein. TTR is made by the liver and secreted into the blood. TTR mutations cause it to misfold and deposit in multiple organs causing FAP. IONIS-TTR Rx is an antisense drug that is designed to decrease the amount of mutant and normal TTR made by the liver. It is predicted that decreasing the amount of TTR protein will result in a decrease in the formation of TTR deposits, and thus slow or stop disease progression. The purpose of this study is to determine if IONIS-TTR Rx can slow or stop the nerve damage caused by TTR deposits. This study will enroll late Stage 1 and early Stage 2 FAP patients. Patients will receive either IONIS-TTR Rx or placebo for 65 weeks.</detailed_description>
