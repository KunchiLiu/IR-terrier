	<brief_title>Improving Outcomes After PICU Admission: A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most children are now expected to make a complete medical recovery following admission to PICU. However, research suggests that some children will go on to develop psychological difficulties, such as problems with emotions, behaviour, and learning. In addition, parents themselves may suffer with emotional difficulties. Although the follow-up of survivors is recommended, there are currently no specific guidelines in place. Intervention in the early stages of recovery could help families pull through without long lasting after-effects.</detailed_description>
