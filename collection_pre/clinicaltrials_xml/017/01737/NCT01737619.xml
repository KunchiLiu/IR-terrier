	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to compare positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scans and sentinel lymph node mapping in finding lymph nodes that have endometrial cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Evaluation of Lymph Node Metastasis at the Time of Surgical Staging for High Risk Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If you are found eligible to take part in this study, you will have a PET/CT scan before your surgery and sentinel lymph node mapping procedure during the surgery. For the sentinel lymph node mapping procedure, a blue dye, a radioactive colloid, and/or an indocyanine green (IC-Green) dye will be injected into your cervix during your surgery. The study staff will then use a device that detects radioactivity and that looks for lymph nodes stained with the dye(s). When the study staff locates the sentinel lymph nodes, they will remove them. The sentinel lymph nodes will then be sent to a lab where a pathologist will check them to see if they contain cancer cells. Other lymph nodes may be removed as part of your standard of care surgery if your surgeon thinks it is in your best interest. Length of Study: Your participation in this study will be over after your surgery. This is an investigational study. The 2 procedures being compared in this study are standard of care. Up to 150 participants will be enrolled in this study. Up to 10 will be enrolled at the Harris Health System.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Histologically confirmed high grade endometrial cancer including grade 3 endometrioid, serous, clear cell, MMMT or any mixed tumor containing one of these cell types 2. Patients with a grade 1/2 tumors and evidence of deep myometrial invasion or cervical involvement on preoperative imaging or physical exam 3. Candidate for surgery. 4. No evidence of peritoneal disease on preoperative imaging 5. Negative pregnancy test if of childbearing age 6. No preoperative treatment for endometrial cancer including radiation or chemotherapy 7. Previous hormonal therapy is allowed 1. Medical comorbidities making surgery unsafe, as determined by the primary treating physician 2. Any contraindications to PET/CT or lymph node mapping (inability to control serum glucose to a value of &lt;/= 200 mg/dl for FDGPET/CT) 3. Does not meet histologic criteria 4. Evidence of peritoneal or distant metastasis on preoperative imaging 5. Baseline creatinine (necessary for imaging studies)</criteria>
