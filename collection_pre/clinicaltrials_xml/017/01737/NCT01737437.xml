	<brief_summary>A previous study demonstrated topical lidocaine spray on the larynx and the trachea is effective in reducing hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation. In clinical practice, blind oropharyngeal application of lidocaine without aiding direct laryngoscopy can not assured that sprayed lidocaine effectively reaches the larynx and trachea. Therefore, direct laryngoscopy should be necessary to reach topical lidocaine to correct sites. Unfortunately, direct laryngoscopy itself can affect hemodynamics during spraying lidocaine. In this study, we will investigate an effect of lidocaine sprayed on direct laryngoscopy and the tracheal mucosa on hemodynamic change throughout intubation.</brief_summary>
