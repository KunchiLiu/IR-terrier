	<brief_title>Renal Sympathetic Denervation in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease and Resistant Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic kidney disease(CKD) is a global and growing public health problem, and its frequency increases with age. The major complications of CKD involve losing renal function and cardiovascular disease, which result in significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. The main measures for treatment of CKD are optimizing drug therapy and renal replacement therapy. Optimizing drug therapy, including vascular angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, diuretic, beta adrenoceptor blocking agent, statins, platelet aggregation inhibitor, anticoagulants and so on. However, the situation for treatment of CKD is not satisfying. Sympathetic overactivity plays a key role in the development and progression of CKD. Sympathetic nerve activity was increased in patients with all stages of CKD, which was associated with cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. At the same time, hypertension and proteinuria become the most important risk factor for progression of CKD. Recently, many clinical researches have verified that Catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation can safely be used to substantially reduce muscle and whole-body sympathetic-nerve activity (MSNA) and whole-body norepinephrine spillover. Simultaneously, a marked reduction in blood pressure, sleep apnea severity and urine micro albumin level is apparent, with a improvement glucose tolerance. Sympathetic activation, high norepinephrine level, hypertension, glucose tolerance abnormity, proteinuria and obstructive sleep apnea are all recognized as independent risk factors for the development and progression of CKD. So, we design this randomized parallel control clinical study to demonstrate whether RSD can slow the progression of CKD and reduce the rate of all-cause mortality effectively and securely.</detailed_description>
