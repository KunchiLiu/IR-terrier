	<brief_summary>Collection of data from different sites regardless of whether they use standard or tailored protocols for the application of high concentration iodinated contrast agents to assess if the individually patient-adapted protocols result in a similar diagnostic image quality.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multidetector Computed Tomography (MDCT) Tailored Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To record technical information and compare image quality regarding routine MDCT procedures with contrast administration using a tailored contrast injection and radiation dose protocol. The hypotheses are that the tailored protocols lead to a lower applied mean radiation dose compared to the use of standard protocols and will provide a more standardized contrast dose per patient size without impairing diagnostic quality.</detailed_description>
