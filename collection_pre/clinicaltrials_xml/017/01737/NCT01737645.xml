	<brief_title>A Comparison of Intraocular Pressures (IOP) During Prolonged Trendelenburg Positioning in Morbidly Obese and Thin Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eye pressure will be measured at protocol specified intervals.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1. Subjects undergoing prolonged procedures (scheduled &gt;3hr) in steep Trendelenburg position (eg. robotic prostatectomy, hysterectomy, cystectomy) 2. Morbidly obese subjects: BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 3. Thin subjects: BMI ≤ 30 kg/m2 4. Age 1870 5. ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) physical status classification I, II, or III 1. Known history of glaucoma 2. Note:if initial IOP is noted to be &gt;21mmHg (millimeters of mercury), patient will be excluded from study and an ophthalmology consultation will be obtained.Surgery will not be postponed. 3. Recent use of IOP lowering topical ophthalmic agents 4. Allergy to latex or proparacaine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 5. Patients with active corneal epithelial defects or history of recurrent corneal erosion 6. Patients with underlying disorders that can directly increase intraocular pressure (thyroid eye disease, intra orbital tumors, orbital vascular malformation, SturgeWeber disease, carotid or dural cavernous arteriovenous malformation, cavernous sinus pathology) 7. History of corneal surgery, to include LASIK (laserassisted insitu keratomileusis) 8. Any eye surgery within prior 1 month 9. Known pregnancy 10. Cognitive impairment</criteria>
