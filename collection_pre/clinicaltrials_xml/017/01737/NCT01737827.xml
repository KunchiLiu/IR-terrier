	<brief_title>Study Efficacy and Safety of INC280 in Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed as a Phase II, single arm, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of INC280 as first-line treatment in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are not eligible for or had disease progression after surgical or locoregional therapies, with c- MET dysregulation. The study includes a Dose-Determining Part and a Dose Expansion Part. Pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of INC280 in the setting of liver dysfunction will be determined in the Dose-Determining Part. The Dose Expansion Part will start when the appropriate dose for patients with liver dysfunction is determined based on pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety data from the Dose-Determining Part and other INC280 ongoing clinical studies.</detailed_description>

Measurable disease as determined by RECIST version 1.1. Current cirrhotic status of ChildPugh class A with no encephalopathy. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &lt; or = 2. Other protocoldefined inclusion criteria may apply. Received any prior systemic chemotherapy or moleculartargeted therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma such as sorafenib. Previous treatment with cMET inhibitor or hepatocyte growth factor targeting therapy. Previous local therapy completed less than 4 weeks prior to dosing and, if present, any acute toxicity &gt; grade 1. Known active bleeding (e.g. bleeding from gastrointestinal ulcers or esophageal varices) within 2 months prior to screening or with history or evidence of inherited bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy. Clinically significant venous or arterial thrombotic disease within past 6 months. History of acute or chronic pancreatitis, surgery of pancreas or any risk factors that may increase risk of pancreatitis. Other protocoldefined exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
