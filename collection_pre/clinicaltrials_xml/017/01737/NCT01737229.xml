	<brief_title>Efficacy and the Safety Study of RD94 in Patients With Endodontic Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>METHODOLOGY: This multi-centre and open-label study comprises six groups corresponding to the six indications tested. No placebo or reference product is involved. No randomization is required as the indication will define the patient selection. The six indications studied are: - Direct pulp capping following carious pulp exposure - Direct pulp capping following dental trauma injury to healthy pulp (partial pulpotomy) - Repairing perforated root canals and/or the pulp chamber floor - Retrograde endodontic surgery - Pulpotomy in primary molars - Apexification Study start: October 2009 Inclusion period: 1/10/2009 to 30/06/2011 Study duration: 2 years OBJECTIVES: The trial objective is to illustrate the clinical efficacy and tolerance of RD94 in the indications described. Primary objective: The primary objective is to show that RD94 can be easily applied in the claimed indications and to evaluate its efficacy. This can be defined after a 6 month follow-up. Secondary objective: The secondary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of RD94 after a two year follow-up which is important for safety and the longevity of the product. TRIAL POPULATION AND NUMBER OF PATIENTS: 60 patients in three French study centers, 10 per indication studied. Depending on the indication, children (from 3 years onwards), and/or adults will be included. DURATION OF TREATMENT: The product is applied on D0 (Inclusion) of the study. The follow-up period includes 2 years with six visits: Visit1 - Week 1, Visit 2 - Month 1, Visit 3 - Month 3, Visit 4 - Month 6, Visit 5 - Year 1, Visit 6 - Year 2.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria provide signed, informed consent. be affiliated to social security. criteria for the corresponding indication: Direct pulp capping following carious pulp exposure children (6 to 18 years) + adults Symptomatic or asymptomatic mature or immature tooth that presented pulp exposure when scraping out carious lesions or performing cavity preparation. Direct pulp capping following dental trauma injury to healthy pulp, reformulated as a partial pulpotomy children (6 to 18 years) + adults Permanent mature or immature singleroot tooth having suffered traumatic injury &lt; 72 hours, with amelodentinal coronal fracture causing pulp exposure. Repairing perforated root canals and/or the pulp chamber floor adults Iatrogenic perforation of the pulpal floor, with or without LEO. Iatrogenic perforated root canals following post space preparation involving dentin matrix, with or without LEO. Iatrogenic perforated root canals with stripping not involving dentin matrix, with or without LEO. Retrograde endodontic surgery adults Failure of endodontic treatment or retreatment, evidenced by recent or persistent clinical or radiological signs of LEO and/or symptoms on a tooth in which the root canal filling looks to be of sufficiently good quality, provided that a working coronal restoration is in place. Failure of endodontic treatment evidenced by recent or persistent clinical or radiological signs of LEO and/or symptoms on a tooth in which the root canal filling is inadequate, when orthograde retreatment does not offer a more favorable riskbenefit ratio than the surgery option. Pulpotomy in primary molars children ( 3 to 12 years ) Molar presenting deep carious lesion without irreversible pulpal disease, as the molar has to stay on the dental arch for at least 3 years. Pulp exposure during excision of a carious lesion on a temporary molar that does not present irreversible pulp disease. The molar has to stay of the dental arch for at least 3 years. Apexification children (7 to 18 years) + adults Permanent immature singleroot tooth having suffered periodontal or dentoalveolar injury causing pulp necrosis with or without periapical disease (LEO) in children, teenagers or adult patients. Permanent immature singleroot tooth presenting pulp necrosis with or without periapical disease (LEO) in children. Apical Root Resorption Exclusion Criteria 1. History of malignancy in the last 5 years. 2. Systemic disease not stabilized within 1 month before the Inclusion Visit or judged by the investigator to be incompatible with the study or condition incompatible with the frequent assessments needed by the study. 3 Risk A cardiopathies 4. Known hypersensitivity to one of the components of the study or procedural medications. 5. Presence or history of severe systemic allergy. 6. Presence or history of drug addiction or alcohol abuse. 7. Patient who has participated in a clinical trial with a new active substance during the month before study entry. 8. Participation in another clinical study at the same time as the present study. 9. Known pregnancy or lactation at study entry. exclusion criteria for each indication : Direct pulp capping following carious pulp exposure Chronic irreversible pulpitis Pulp necrosis Anterior or salivacontaminated tooth pulp exposure Accidental exposure occurring during nonretentive prosthetic preparation Direct pulp capping following dental trauma injury to healthy pulp, reformulated as a partial pulpotomy Pulp exposure period &gt; 72 hours Crownroot fracture Pulpal necrosis with or without periapical disease(LEO) Repairing perforated root canals and/or the pulp chamber floor Supracrestal iatrogenic perforation Inadequate periodontal support Loss of tooth structure (Coronal decay and/or concomitant root decay) compromising the tooth's maintenance on the dental arch) Retrograde endodontic surgery Failure of endodontic treatment or retreatment, evidenced by recent or persistent clinical or radiological signs of LEO and/or symptoms on a tooth in which the root canal filling looks to be of sufficiently good quality, when a working coronal restoration is either missing or presents microleakage Failure of endodontic treatment evidenced by recent or persistent clinical or radiological signs of LEO and/or symptoms on a tooth in which the root canal filling is inadequate, when surgical treatment does not offer a more favorable riskbenefit ratio than the orthograde retreatment option Insufficient periodontal support, endoperiodontal lesion Coronal decay and/or concomitant root decay compromising the tooth's maintenance on the dental arch Maxillary intrabony lesion of suspected nonendodontic origin Pulpotomy: Temporary molar expected to begin exfoliation within 24 months.
