	<brief_summary>The new technical of ultrasonic exploration of this project purpose to validate the measurement of cerebral pulsatility by a new way called "Fast Cerebral Pulsatility Imaging" (FCPI).This will somehow determine the natural history of cerebral pulsatility during development adult to old age</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasonic Explorations of Cerebral Tissue Motions - Influence of Aging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Main objective Phase 1: -Study the in-vivo development of ultrasonic method in terms of quality of the acquisitions and intra-operator reproducibility. Study the ease of positioning in relation to MRI and fusion of MRI and FCPI data via the neuro-navigation system Phase 2: -Study the variability of cerebral pulsatility of measured by "Fast Cerebral Pulsatility Imaging" or FCPI with age. Secondary objectives - Compare the results of displacements cartography's and vascular cartography obtained by MRI (especially by Arteriel Spin Labelling = ASL) - Compare results of FCPI with results of cognitive tests of aging separating fluid functions (prefrontal) and functions called crystallized; and study the residual effect of age on cognitive tasks and speed of cognitive processing after taking into account the effect of the cerebral pulsatility - Compare results of FCPI with electrophysiological measures (PE EEG) describing the attentional control - Perform an exploratory analysis to highlight the propagating part of the brain displacement maps</detailed_description>
