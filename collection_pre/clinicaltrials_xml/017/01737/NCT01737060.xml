	<criteria>Patient admitted in hospital with a displaced three or four part proximal humerus fracture of OTA / AO group 11B2 or 11C2 (displaced fracture of extraarticular or articular, bifocal type). The subgroups .1, .2 and .3 will be included for both B2 and C2 groups, provided severe displacement: This is defined as a malposition of at least 45ยบ of angular deviation in valgus or 30ยบ in varus in true frontal projection, regardless of whether the fracture is impacted or not, or less than 50% contact between humeral head and the metaphyseal part of the shaft. The greater or lesser tubercle displaced at least 10 mm. Patient younger than 65 years or older than 85 years, previous history of injury or illness of the injured shoulder, injuries of other parts of the humerus or the contralateral upper extremity, alcohol or drug abuse, dementia, neurological diseases, or severe cardiovascular or lung diseases that would contraindicate surgery. Patients have to understand the Norwegian language and be compliant to rehabilitation and followups.</criteria>
