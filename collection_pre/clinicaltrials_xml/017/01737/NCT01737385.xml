	<brief_summary>This study examines the microcirculation of the caput humeri after proximal humeral fracturation using O2C light probes. During the operation the blood circulation is measured at four points (tuberculum majus, tuberculum minus, neck and head of the humerus) directly on the bone. The O2C light probes are a none-invasive technique of measuring blood flow, velocity and oxygen concentration. The data is analysed in respect to the fracture type according to the classification of Neer. Valuable additional information for the correct treatment and prognosis of humeral fractures is expected.</brief_summary>
