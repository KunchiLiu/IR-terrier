	<brief_title>Evaluation of the Conversion From Peginesatide to Epoetin Alfa in Patients Receiving Hemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase 4, multicenter, single-arm, open-label study designed to evaluate whether patients receiving hemodialysis and treated with peginesatide can be converted to epoetin alfa using a predefined conversion table while achieving stable hemoglobin. The study will be conducted in two phases. Hemodialysis patients treated with epoetin alfa 3 times a week (TIW) will first be converted to peginesatide administered every 4 weeks (Q4W). After 24 weeks, these participants will be converted back to epoetin alfa administered TIW for 32 weeks. The primary endpoint will be the mean hemoglobin during the last 8 weeks of the epoetin alfa period.</detailed_description>
