	<brief_summary>The goal of the project is to investigate the clinical efficacy of management of early caries lesions by resin infiltration, which may be imaged through a SFE laser optical device comparable to radiographic results.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective: The hypothesis to be tested is that Icon performs similarly to an established prevention strategy for early caries (Oral hygiene instruction and topical fluoridation) for caries arrest; and caries progression may be imaged through a SFE laser optical device. Materials and Methods: The investigators propose a pilot study of Icon vs. control including Oral Hygiene Instructions (OHI) and topical fluoridation for early caries arrest in primary molars. Lesion depth will be performed through standard-of care methods, i.e. radiographs and visual exams, plus a novel optical device based on scanning fiber endoscope (SFE) technology for laser light imaging for early caries detection in pediatric populations. The investigators will utilize SFE laser optical device prototypes developed by the University of Washington's Human Photonics Lab (HPL), a device already in human use for other applications, including imaging and cancer screening. Clinical Significance: This controlled trial will assess the positive effects of white spot infiltration by ICON and may open a new therapeutic strategy in paediatric dentistry. Additionally, this study would be one of the first in vivo dental applications of the SFE optical device, and would add a novel early caries visualization technique to the armamentarium for detecting caries progression.</detailed_description>
