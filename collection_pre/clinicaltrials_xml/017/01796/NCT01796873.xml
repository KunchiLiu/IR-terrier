	<brief_summary>Plavix (clopidogrel) is a drug that is approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) to reduce the risk of having another heart attack by preventing platelets (blood cells that are important in forming blood clots) from sticking together and forming another clot. Platelet activity can be measured by a machine called VerifyNow. The purpose of this study is to see whether Hispanic women and White non-Hispanic women have the same platelet response to a commonly used drug, Plavix (clopidogrel). Recent studies have shown that platelets may be more active in Hispanics, making it more difficult to prevent clots from forming, even when using Plavix. In addition, studies have shown that women may also have more active platelets than men. There have been no studies of Hispanic women and the effect of Plavix on platelet activity.</brief_summary>
