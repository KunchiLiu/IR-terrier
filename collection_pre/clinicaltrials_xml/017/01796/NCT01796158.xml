	<brief_title>Pilot Test of Computerized MET to Reduce Adolescent Alcohol Use</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this project is to conduct a pilot study evaluating feasibility, acceptability, and estimating the effect size of a new computerized Motivational Enhancement Therapy (cMET) intervention for alcohol-involved adolescent primary care patients. The investigators hypothesize that 1) cMET, when added to Computerized Alcohol Screening and Brief Intervention (cASBI), (cASBI+cMET) will be feasible and acceptable when used in primary care; and 2) 12- to 18-yr old patients receiving cASBI+cMET will have lower rates of any alcohol use, days of alcohol use, drinks per drinking day, and days of heavy episodic drinking, than cASBI alone.</detailed_description>
