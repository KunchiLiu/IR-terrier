	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics of entospletinib and idelalisib. Participants will be enrolled who have one of the following hematological tumor types: chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), follicular lymphoma (FL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), or non-FL indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas (iNHL; including lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma/Waldenström macroglobulinemia [LPL/WM], small lymphocytic lymphoma [SLL], or marginal zone lymphoma [MZL]).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Diagnosis of Bcell iNHL, DLBCL, MCL, or CLL as documented by medical records and with histology based on criteria established by the World Health Organization For institutions that have Phase 3 or Phase 4 protocols studying idelalisib (Zydelig®; GS1101); subjects with malignancies being studied in these protocols must have failed screening and be registered as a screen failure in the respective idelalisib protocol Prior treatment for lymphoid malignancy Presence of radiographically measurable lymphadenopathy or extranodal lymphoid malignancy Discontinuation of all therapy for the treatment of cancer ≥ 3 weeks before the start of study drug All acute toxic effects of any prior antitumor therapy resolved to Grade ≤ 1 before the start of study drug Karnofsky performance status of ≥ 60 Life expectancy of at least 3 months Key Known histological transformation from iNHL or CLL to an aggressive form of NHL (ie, Richter transformation) Known active central nervous system or leptomeningeal lymphoma Presence of known intermediate or highgrade myelodysplastic syndrome Current therapy with agents that reduce gastric acidity, including but not limited to antacids, H2 inhibitors, and proton pump inhibitors Evidence of ongoing systemic bacterial, fungal, or viral infection at the time of start of study drug Ongoing liver injury Ongoing or recent hepatic encephalopathy Ongoing druginduced pneumonitis Ongoing inflammatory bowel disease Ongoing alcohol or drug addiction Pregnancy or breastfeeding History of prior allogeneic bone marrow progenitor cell or solid organ transplantation Ongoing immunosuppressive therapy Concurrent participation in an investigational drug trial with therapeutic intent Note: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
