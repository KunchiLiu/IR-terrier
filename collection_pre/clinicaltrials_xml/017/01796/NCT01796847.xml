	<brief_summary>Glycemic variability in critically ill patients is a recognized negative prognostic factor. The molecular mechanisms determining inter-patients variability in glucose metabolism during stress are not fully understood. The Phosphatase and Tensin homolog (PTEN) is known to influence glucose homeostasis by interfering in intracellular insulin signaling. Aim of this study is to ascertain whether differential expression of PTEN in critically ill patients correlates with glycemic variability and clinical outcome.</brief_summary>
