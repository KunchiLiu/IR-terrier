	<brief_summary>This study is a phase I/II, open-label study in patients with relapsed positive non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The Phase I part of the study is a dose escalating study to define the maximum tolerable dose of 177Lu-DOTA-HH1 (Betalutin), assess safety and toxicity, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and efficacy. After completion of the phase I study, a dose will be selected for the phase II part of the study which is designed to investigate tumour response rate, progression free survival, confirmation of the selected dose as well as safety and toxicity.</brief_summary>
