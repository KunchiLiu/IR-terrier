	<brief_summary>Primary objective of the study is to compare the efficacy of romidepsin when administered with CHOP versus CHOP alone in subjects with previously untreated peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) assessed according to Response criteria for malignant lymphoma 1999 by RAC.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Males and females of 18 years of age to 80 years of age. 2. Understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent document prior to any study related assessments/procedures are conducted. 3. Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements. 4. Patients with histologically proven peripheral Tcell lymphoma (PTCL), not previously treated; the following subtypes as defined by the WHO classification (2008;2011) may be included, whatever the Ann Arbor stage (I IV): a. Nodal types: i. PTCL, not otherwise specified ii. Angioimmunoblastic Tcell lymphoma iii. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma, ALKnegative type b. Extranodal types: i. Enteropathyassociated Tcell lymphoma ii. Hepatosplenic Tcell lymphoma iii. Subcutaneous panniculitislike Tcell lymphoma iv. Primary cutaneous gammadelta Tcell lymphoma v. Primary cutaneous CD8+ aggressive epidermotropic lymphoma vi. Primary cutaneous CD4+ small/medium Tcell lymphoma c. Other non classifiable peripheral Tcell lymphoma 5. ECOG performance status 0, 1 or 2 6. Negative pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential (FCBP) 7. Female patients of child bearing potential must use an effective method of birth control (i.e. hormonal contraceptive, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide or abstinence) during treatment period and 1 month thereafter; Males must use an effective method of birth control during treatment period and 3 months thereafter. 8. Life expectancy of ≥ 90 days (3 months). 1. Any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would prevent the patient from participating in the study. 2. Any condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study. 3. Other types of lymphomas, e.g. Bcell lymphoma 4. The following types of T cell lymphomas: 1. Adult Tcell lymphoma/leukemia (HTLV1 related Tcell lymphoma) 2. Extranodal Tcell/NKcell lymphoma, nasal type 3. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma, ALKpositive type 4. Cutaneous T cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoid, Sézary syndrome) 5. Primary cutaneous CD30+ Tcell lymphoproliferative disorder 6. Primary cutaneous anaplastic Tcell lymphoma 5. Previous treatment for PTCL with immunotherapy or chemotherapy except for shortterm corticosteroids (duration of ≤ 8 days) before randomization 6. Previous radiotherapy for PTCL except if localized to one lymph node area 7. Patients planned for autologous or allogeneic transplant as consolidation in first line 8. Central nervous system meningeal involvement 9. Contraindication to any drug contained in the chemotherapy regimen, 10. Subjects with HIV positivity 11. Subjects with active hepatitis B or C. Chronic carriers of hepatitis B without HBV DNA positive blood are eligible. Subjects with nonactive hepatitis C (with normal transaminases) are eligible. 12. Any of the following laboratory abnormalities, except if secondary to the lymphoma: 1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1,500 cells/mm3 (1.5 x 109/L), 2. Platelet count &lt; 100,000/mm3 (100 x 109/L), or &lt; 75,000/mm3 if bone marrow is involved, 3. Serum SGOT/AST or SGPT/ALT ≥ 3.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN), 4. Serum total bilirubin &gt; 2 x ULN, except in case of hemolytic anemia, 5. K+ and Mg2+ levels &lt; LLN, except if corrected per protocol guidance before beginning the romidepsin infusion 13. Serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 x ULN 14. Prior history of malignancies other than lymphoma (except for basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast or untreated prostatic cancer without any plan for a treatment) unless the patient has been free of the disease for ≥ 3 years 15. Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would prevent the patient from signing the informed consent form 16. Any known cardiac abnormalities such as: 1. Patients with congenital long QT syndrome 2. Corrected QT interval &gt; 480 msec (using the Fridericia formula) 3. Myocardial infarction within 6 months of cycle 1 day 1 4. History of or concomitant significant cardiovascular disease 5. Ejection fraction &lt;45% by MUGA scan or by echocardiogram; 17. Concomitant use of drugs that may cause a significant prolongation of the QTc 18. Patients who have received more than 200 mg/m2 doxorubicin 19. Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 20. Concomitant use of therapeutic warfarin due to a potential drug interaction. Use of a low dose of warfarin or another anticoagulant to maintain patency of venous access port and cannulas is permitted. 21. Clinically significant active infection 22. Use of any standard or experimental anticancer drug therapy within 28 days of the initiation (Day 1) of study drug 23. Pregnant or lactating females or women of childbearing potential not willing to use an adequate method of birth control for the duration of the study.</criteria>
