	<brief_summary>The study is a multidisciplinary research project and has two main aims: 1. To determine the safety of a contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR) in women, with an emphasis on its effect on the vaginal microenvironment after different durations of use: the vaginal microbiome, biofilm formation on epithelial cells and rings, inflammation and immune activation in the vagina 2. To investigate the feasibility, acceptability and adherence to vaginal ring use in Rwandan women, including attitudes towards a future multi-purpose vaginal ring for prevention of both pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STI).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1. An integrated study design This clinical study combines a clinical safety evaluation of the contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR) with social science research on acceptability and adherence of ring use in Rwandan women. The clinical part of the study assesses the general safety of the contraceptive ring including the effect on the vaginal microbiome, genitourinary symptoms and signs and clinical adverse events. In addition the clinical part of the study aims to understand better the possible biofilm formation and to explore the impact of the ring on the microbiome and inflammation in the vagina. The social science component consists of a combination of a mixed-methods research including In-depth Interviews (IDIs), Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), questionnaires, and (if funding permits) audio computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI). 2. Clinical study design This is an open label single-centre cohort study with the NuvaRing速. A total of 120 Human Immunodeficiency Virus(HIV)-negative women will be randomized to an intermittent regimen or a continuous regimen of ring use and will be followed for maximum 14 weeks, to determine general safety of the ring in the African context, and to determine differences in the vaginal microbiome and vaginal inflammation before and after use of a contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR). Qualitative research for the social science component will be performed to address the acceptability and adherence of intermittent or continuous CVR use in more depth. Women will be randomized into two study groups: 60 intermittent users in group A and 60 continuous users in group B. Both groups will use the NuvaRing速. Women in group A (the intermittent users) will use each CVR for 3 weeks followed by one week of no ring use to allow menstruation. Women in group B (the continuous users) will use each ring for 3 weeks, with the next ring being inserted immediately after the previous one and no off period in between [4]. The total duration from enrolment to the last study visit is maximum 14 weeks. The screening process will be a maximum of 6 weeks. As noticed above, the study will include also a social sciences component, aimed at assessing the level of acceptability and reported adherence to intermittent and continuous Contraceptive Vaginal Rings (CVRs) use in women in Rwanda; at identifying and describe the context specific attitudes and beliefs regarding family, family planning, and gendered norms; at exploring the women's beliefs and expectations regarding future potential use of a multi-purpose ring (contraception and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) prevention); and at exploring how women and men in Rwanda perceive and experience risk related to unwanted pregnancy and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). This part of the study will result in qualitative outcomes.</detailed_description>
