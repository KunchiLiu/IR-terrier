	<brief_summary>Regular aspirin use has been associated with a reduction in the development of a number of different malignancies including lung cancer. The mechanism of aspirin's cancer prevention is not known. This study will evaluate whether once daily aspirin use can reduce the production of a protein named prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2), which is known to promote cancer. Specifically, this study will evaluate if aspirin can inhibit the production of PGE-2 by blocking an enzyme named cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2). To accomplish these goals, participants will take either aspirin 325 mg daily, celecoxib 200 mg twice daily, or the combination of both during various days of this 16-day study. Urine be collected to evaluate for PGE-2 production at 4 timepoints in this 16-day study.</brief_summary>
