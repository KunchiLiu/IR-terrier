	<brief_summary>To evaluate the feasibility of conducting a trial of a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program for patients with diabetes (DM) on measures of HbA1c, blood pressure, perceived stress, depression, patient self-efficacy and quality of life; and to estimate the effect of a MBSR program for patients with DM. It is expected that MBSR program participants will evidence a trend toward better clinical outcome measures of HbA1c, blood pressure, and standardized measures of diabetes self-management, perceived stress, depression, self-efficacy, and quality-of-life.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objective: Evaluate the feasibility of conducting a trial of a MBSR program for patients with diabetes on measures of HbA1c, blood pressure, perceived stress, depression, patient self-efficacy and quality of life. Feasibility will be assessed via: a) the interest of patients in taking part in an MBSR program; c) the effectiveness of strategies for recruiting patients with diabetes into the study; d) rates of participant compliance with the MBSR; and, e) patient compliance with the program evaluation plan. Estimate the effect of a MBSR program for patients with diabetes. It is expected that MBSR program participants will evidence a trend toward better clinical outcome measures of HbA1c, blood pressure, and standardized measures of diabetes self-management, perceived stress, depression, self-efficacy, and quality-of-life. Secondary Objective: To explore the experience of people with diabetes who participate in an MBSR course through the use of semi-structured interviews.</detailed_description>
