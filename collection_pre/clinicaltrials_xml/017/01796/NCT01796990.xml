	<brief_title>Developing a Physically More Active Lifestyle Based on One's Own Values - RCT Among Sedentary Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In more detailed the study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the acceptance- and commitment-based behavioural intervention concerning physical activity level and self-efficacy, as well as regarding planning and the acceptance of psychological and physical discomfort related to physical activity after 3 and 6 months compared to providing only individual written feedback on their physical activity. A further aim was to explore stability and maintenance of changes in physical activity at the 6 months follow-up. It was hypothesised that acceptance- and commitment-based behavioural intervention is more effective than feedback only in improving physical activity and related beliefs and cognitions.</detailed_description>
