	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Profiles of SR-T100 Gel on External Genital Warts/Condyloma Acuminate(EGWs)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A double-blind, randomized,vehicle-controlled, parallel-group, and dose-ranging study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SR-T100 gel in patients with EGW(s). The primary efficacy endpoint will be defined as the proportion of patients whose baseline EGW(s) on the treated area achieve total clearance. The efficacy of SR-T100 gel in prevention of new EGW(s) occurrence will be evaluated. Distinct to existing medications for EGWs, SR-T100 gel possesses characteristics of high safety and low LSR causality. SR-T100 gel will be administered on EGW lesion(s) for clearance and on the surrounding clinical normal skin for prevention of new EGW(s) occurrence.</detailed_description>
