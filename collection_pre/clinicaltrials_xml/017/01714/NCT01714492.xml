	<brief_summary>Utilize previously developed mathematical model to determine in vivo knee mechanics (kinematics, forces, stresses, areas and sound) for subjects having a Sigma Posterior Stabilizing (PS) mobile bearing (MB) total knee arthroplasty (TKA). There are several hypotheses for this study, although the most prominent is: Subjects having a Sigma RP PS TKA will experience polyethylene bearing rotation at 10 years post-operative, similar to their previous evaluations at six months, two years and five years.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Additional hypotheses: - Subjects having a Sigma RP PS TKA will experience full ideal femorotibial contact mechanics. - Subjects having a Sigma RP PS TKA will experience optimal cam/post mechanics. - Subjects having a Sigma RP PS TKA will experience continuous axial rotation in deep flexion. - Subjects having a Sigma RP PS TKA will experience optimal distribution of tibio-femoral and cam/post contact forces over a broad area on the post. - Subjects having a Sigma RP PS TKA will experience a smooth transition of the cam on the post, not an abrupt slide as seen with fixed bearing PS TKA. - The use of the sound sensors will detect cam/post contact mechanics under in vivo conditions.</detailed_description>
