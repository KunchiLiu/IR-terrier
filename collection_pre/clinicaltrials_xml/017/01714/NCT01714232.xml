	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of a Bayer Blood Glucose Monitoring System (BGMS) and four additional Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems (BGMS) from other manufacturers. All meter BG results were compared with plasma results obtained with a reference laboratory glucose method (YSI Glucose Analyzer). Performance of the five systems were evaluated across the glucose range of the BGMSs using capillary blood. All testing and lancing were performed by study staff and some samples were tested from subject fingertips. Additionally, some blood samples were glycolyzed to lower the glucose concentration levels and glucose solution was added to other samples to raise glucose concentration levels.</detailed_description>
