	<brief_summary>Erlotinib with concurrent radiotherapy has superior efficacy and comparable safety profile in unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with activating mutation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in exon 19 or 21 versus etoposide plus cis-platin with concurrent radiotherapy.</brief_summary>
