	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the local and systemic inflammatory response and haemostatic alterations in the lungs after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) instillation and to determine the feasibility of imaging techniques to quantify lung inflammation in an adapted human endotoxin instillation model. The investigators will also explore whether glucocorticoid treatment can blunt LPS effects.</brief_summary>
