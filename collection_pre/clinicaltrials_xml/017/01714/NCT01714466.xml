	<criteria>The subject's written informed consent must be obtained prior to inclusion. Subjects age 40 to 70 years. Part B only: Subjects willing to undergoing a screening colonoscopy, where the subject: 1. is between 40 and 70 years of age and has a known personal or familial risk of colon neoplasia,or 2. is aged 55 to 70. Part A: Subjects need to be without any history of clinically significant gastrointestinal symptoms by clinical judgement and without the presence of acute abdominal discomfort or symptoms.

Females using oral contraceptives must also use additional contraception. Hormonal and IUD methods of contraception must be established for a period of 3 months prior to dosing and cannot be changed or altered during the study. All females must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and checkin (unless postmenopausal). Willing, able and competent to complete the entire procedure and to comply with study instructions. Ferrous sulphate should be stopped at least one week prior to study medication. Part A only: Subjects undergoing screening colonoscopy. Presence of current clinically significant functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder (e.g. gastric emptying disorder, chronic constipation, irritable bowel syndrome [IBS]). Regular use of laxatives or colon motility altering drugs in the last month. Donation or loss of 500 mL or more of blood within 8 weeks prior to the first dose of investigational drug. Any history or current presence of ileus, gastrointestinal (GI) obstruction or perforation , GI tract cancer, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or colonic resection. Known glucose6phosphatase dehydrogenase deficiency. Known phenylketonuria. History or evidence of any clinical significant cardiovascular or neurological disease, cardiac, renal or hepatic insufficiency. Known hypersensitivity to polyethylene glycols and/or ascorbic acid. History or evidence of any clinically relevant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities and/or uncontrolled hypertension. Evidence of dehydration. Any evidence for clinically significant abnormal sodium or potassium levels or other clinically significant plasma electrolyte disturbances. Females who are not postmenopausal with a positive pregnancy test. Females not using reliable methods of birth control if not postmenopausal. Clinically relevant findings on physical examination based on the Investigator's judgement. Clinically relevant deviations of laboratory parameters from reference ranges at screening or checkin evaluation. Positive serology for chronic viral hepatitis or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at screening. History of drug or alcohol abuse within the 12 months prior to dosing or evidence of such abuse as indicated by the laboratory assays conducted during the screening or checkin evaluations. Subjects who are unwilling to comply with the provisions of the study protocol. Concurrent participation in an investigational drug study or participation within 3 months of study entry. Subject has a condition or is in a situation, which in the Investigator's opinion may put the subject at significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere significantly.
