	<brief_title>Nerve Transfer After Spinal Cord Injuries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current treatment strategies of acute cervical spinal cord injuries remain limited. Treatment options that provide meaningful improvements in patient quality of life and long-term functional independence will provide a significant public health impact. Specific Aim: Measure the efficacy of nerve transfer surgery in the treatment of patients with complete cervical spinal cord injuries with no hand function. Optimize the efficiency of nerve transfer surgery by evaluating patient outcomes in relation to patient selection and optimal timing the the surgery. Hypothesis: Peripheral nerve transfers in patients with spinal cord injuries will improve hand function and provide improvement in patient quality of life and functional independence.</detailed_description>
