	<brief_title>Exploring Massage Benefits for Arthritis of the Knee for VA Healthcare Users</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of this supplement is to enroll n=25 VA healthcare users with knee OA into the initial 8-week EMBARK massage program in order to collect preliminary data on the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of massage in this patient group, in preparation for a larger grant submission to evaluate the effectiveness of massage for knee OA in the VA healthcare system. All veterans enrolled under this supplement will complete the initial 8-week massage protocol, since this will allow us the maximum opportunity to assess the feasibility and gather preliminary efficacy data. Veterans with symptomatic knee OA will be recruited from the Durham VA Medical Center, and the remaining study activities will be completed at the Duke site of the EMBARK study.</detailed_description>
