	<brief_summary>The major aim of this research study is to investigate the relationship between genetic variation in DNA (inherited code material in the cells of the body) and factors affecting transplant outcomes, like the drugs people receive or the way their immune systems work, for example. To do this, investigators will collect blood samples from participants. Genetic material will be separated from each blood sample and analyzed, looking for genetic variation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In the past, the major problems in kidney transplantation were surgical complications, acute rejection, and infections. Right now, researchers are focusing on improving immune suppression therapy and achieving better long-term survival of kidney transplants. One of the ways to try to understand what causes loss of function after many years is to find out if there is a genetic factor involved. There are a number of differences in specific genes that have been identified and are thought to affect transplant outcomes. Studying these gene variations (differences between people or differences between populations) is important in determining whether these variations are related to transplant outcomes and how this information can help patients achieve better long-term transplant survival.</detailed_description>
