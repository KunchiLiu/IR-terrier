	<brief_title>Effects of Osteopathic Treatment on Pulmonary Function After Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is performed worldwide. Several studies have found that there is a decrease in pulmonary function, loss of thoracic mobility and a high prevalence of chronic poststernotomy pain (CPSP) after CABG. So far there is no effective treatment for these conditions. The OstinCare study aims to investigate whether osteopathic treatment has an added value in the treatment of these patients.</detailed_description>
