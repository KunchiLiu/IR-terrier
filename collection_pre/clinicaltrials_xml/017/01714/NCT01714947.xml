Medical conditions requiring daily, chronic, or regular use of proton pump inhibitors(PPIs) within 7 days preceding the first dose of alisertib, or H2receptor antagonists within 24 hours preceding the first dose of alisertib. Patient requiring systemic anticoagulation (excluding lowdose aspirin, or lowdose anticoagulation to maintain patency of venous access devices). Low molecular weight heparin, administered as preventive treatment, is allowed if the patient has tolerated treatment with a stable dose and schedule without bleeding complications for more than 1 month Major surgery within the 14 days preceding the first dose of alisertib Infection requiring systemic intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy within 14 days preceding the first dose of study drug, or other severe infection Lifethreatening or uncontrolled medical illness unrelated to cancer Ongoing nausea or vomiting that is Grade 2 or worse in intensity Diarrhea that is Grade 2 or worse in intensity or use of an antimotility agent to control diarrhea to an intensity of Grade 1 or lower level. Known GI disease or GI procedures that could interfere with the oral absorption, excretion, or tolerance of alisertib History of urinary and/or fecal incontinence History of uncontrolled sleep apnea syndrome and other conditions that could result in excessive daytime sleepiness such as severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Inability to swallow tablets, or inability or unwillingness to avoid taking anything by mouth except for water and prescribed medications for 2 hours before and 1 hour after the first dose of alisertib Inadequate bone marrow or other organ function as specified in study protocol Any cardiovascular condition specified in the study protocol Known or suspected human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive or hepatitis B surface antigenpositive status, or known or suspected active hepatitis C infection Inability to comply with study visits and procedures including required inpatient confinement (approximately 1117 days) Please note that there are additional exclusion criteria. The study center will determine if you meet all of the criteria.</criteria>
