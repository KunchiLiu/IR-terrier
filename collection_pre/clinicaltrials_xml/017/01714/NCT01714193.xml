	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether there is a drug-drug interaction between multiple doses of canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) and single doses of an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel. The safety and tolerability of canagliflozin will also be assessed in healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Effects of Canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) on the Pharmacokinetics and Safety of an Oral Contraceptive in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be an open-label (all volunteers and study staff know the identity of the assigned treatment), single-center, fixed-sequence study (all volunteers receive the same medication on the same days), to determine how canagliflozin (a drug currently being investigated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus) affects the pharmacokinetics (ie, how the body affects the drug) of an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel. The study will consist of 3 phases; a screening phase, an open-label treatment phase, and an end-of-study (or follow-up) phase. Each volunteer will participate in the study for approximately 33 days.</detailed_description>
