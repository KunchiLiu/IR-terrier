Adverse events from the previous study (EVP6124015 or EVP6124016) that have not resolved, are of moderate or greater severity and judged to be possibly related or related to study drug and are thought by the investigator to be contraindications to study participation. Any condition which would make the subject, in the opinion of the investigator, unsuitable for the study. Female subjects who are pregnant.
