	<brief_summary>Study subjects were screened and enrolled for the study. Subjects were housed in the clinical facility from not less than 12 hours pre-dose till at least 30 hours post-dose in each period. After maintaining at least 10 hours of overnight fast Test or Reference product was administered orally (as per the randomization schedule) to each subject with about 240 mL of water at ambient temperature in each period by trained study personnel after consuming the whole standardized high fat non-veg breakfast. The pre-dose (0.00 hours) blood sample was collected before dosing and post-dose samples were collected at 2.00, 3.00, 4.00, 5.00, 6.00, 7.00, 7.50, 8.00, 8.50, 9.00, 9.50, 10.00, 10.50, 11.00, 11.50, 12.00, 12.50, 13.00, 14.00, 16.00, 20.00, 24.00 and 30.00 hours in each study period with a washout period of 7 days between the dosing of two periods. Subjects were continuously monitored for well being i.e., blood pressure, radial pulse and oral temperature before check-in, prior to drug administration and at regular intervals post dose in each period. The concentration of Ropinirole in plasma samples obtained from study subjects was determined using validated LC-MS/MS method. Pharmacokinetic and statistical analyses were performed on obtained drug concentration data, using appropriate software.</brief_summary>

Subjects whose screening laboratory values are within normal limits or considered by the physician/Principal Investigator to be of no clinical significance. v. Light, non or exsmokers. Light smokers are defined as someone smoking 10 cigarettes or less per day, and exsmokers are defined as someone who completely stopped smoking for at least 3 months.

Participation in another clinical study not involving donation of blood, within the preceding 90 days of study start. Subjects who have: i. Systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm of Hg or more than 140 mm of Hg ii. Diastolic blood pressure less than 60 mm of Hg or more than 94 mm of Hg. Minor deviations (13 mm Hg) at checkin may be acceptable at the discretion of the physician /investigator. iii. Pulse rate below 50/min. or above 105/min. Any waiver of these inclusion and exclusion criteria must be approved and documented by the qualified investigator and the sponsor on a casebycase basis.</criteria>
