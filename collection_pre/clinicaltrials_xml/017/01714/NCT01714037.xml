	<brief_title>A Clinical Study on the Safety and Efficacy of Debio 0932 in Combination With Standard of Care in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer [NSCLC]</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part A of this study will determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose of Debio 0932 in combination with cisplatin/pemetrexed and cisplatin/gemcitabine in treatment-naïve patients with Stage IIIb or IV NSCLC, and with docetaxel in previously treated patients with Stage IIIb or IV NSCLC. Escalating doses of Debio 0932 will be given to subsequent patients in combination with standard doses of these 3 background chemotherapies.</detailed_description>
