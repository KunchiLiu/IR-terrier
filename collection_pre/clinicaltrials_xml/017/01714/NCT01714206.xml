	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine how multiple doses of canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) affect the pharmacokinetics (ie, how the body affects the drug) of multiple doses of digoxin. The safety and tolerability of canagliflozin will also be assessed in healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Effects of Canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) on the Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Digoxin in Healthy Volunteers.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be an open label (all volunteers and study staff know the identity of the assigned treatment), randomized (the treatment is assigned by chance), multiple dose, cross-over study (all volunteers will switch from one treatment to another) to determine how canagliflozin (a drug currently being investigated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus) affects the pharmacokinetics of digoxin (a drug used to treat various heart conditions). Volunteers will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment sequence groups: Group AB or Group BA. Volunteers assigned to Group AB will be given Treatment A: digoxin once a day for 7 days. Volunteers assigned to Group BA will be given Treatment B: digoxin and canagliflozin once a day for 7 days. A washout period (when no medication is given) of at least 14 days will follow the first 7-day treatment period. Following the washout period, volunteers will be assigned to the treatment that they did not receive during the first treatment period. This second treatment period will last for 7 days. Each volunteer will participate in the study for approximately 60 days.</detailed_description>
