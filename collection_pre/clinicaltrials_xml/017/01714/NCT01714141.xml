	<brief_summary>This pilot study's main goal is to develop and preliminarily test a technology-based intervention to improve asthma medication adherence in urban African American emerging adults (ages 18-29). It is hypothesized that youth randomized to MCTI for adherence will show improvements in motivation to adhere to asthma medications and self-reported adherence compared to the comparison condition at 1- and 3- month follow up.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi-Component Technology Intervention for Minority Emerging Adults With Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study collected pilot data with a sample of 48 African American emerging adults with asthma with suboptimal medication adherence. Half of the sample were randomized to receive a multi-component technology-based intervention (MCTI) targeting adherence to daily controller medication. The MCTI consisted of two components: 1) 2 sessions of computer-delivered motivational interviewing targeting medication adherence, and 2) individualized text messaging focused on medication adherence between the sessions. Text messages were individualized based on Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). The remaining half of participants completed a series of computer-delivered asthma education modules matched for length, location, and method of delivery of the intervention session. Control participants also received text messages between intervention sessions. Message content was the same for all control participants and contain general facts about asthma (not tailored).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>African American Live in the Detroit Area, approximately 30 miles from the Hutzel Building Ages 1829 Have moderate to severe persistent asthma. Persistent asthma is defined according to the 2007 NHLBI guidelines. The level of symptoms, as defined by any of the following in the last 4 weeks: Use of any asthma medication more than 2 times a week Daytime asthma symptoms such as wheezing, tightness of chest, problems coughing more than 2 times a week, or waking up at night because of asthma more than 2 times a month Participant is prescribed a daily asthma controller medication, even if they do not take it. Participant must report poor adherence to daily controller medications during eligibility screening (brief interview). Poor adherence is defined as not taking medications "as prescribed" less than 4 days per week in any of the 4 weeks prior to enrollment OR as a proxy of poor adherence as selfreport of &lt;80% medication adherence in the past 30 days, selfreport of emergency room visit/hospitalization for asthma in the past 6 months, or a poor score on the Asthma Control Test. Participant must be able to complete questionnaires in English Participant must own or have access to a cellular phone for the duration of the study No exclusions will be made due to comorbid mental health problems (i.e. ADHD, depression) except thought disorders (i.e. schizophrenia, autism), suicidality or mental retardation. Individuals with other chronic health conditions requiring ongoing medical intervention ( e.g., HIV, Type II Diabetes) will be excluded. These chronic diseases include: Glaucoma, bipolarism, segmented glomerular nephritis, cystic fibrosis, spondyloarthropathy, congenital heart disease, sickle cell No pregnant women will be included in this study.</criteria>
