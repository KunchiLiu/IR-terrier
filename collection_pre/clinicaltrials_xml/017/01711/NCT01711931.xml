	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of everolimus- and biolimus-bluting stents with everolimus-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold stents. The null hypothesis to be rejected is that there is no significant difference with regard to lumen late loss at 9 months and a clinical end point of death, myocardial infarction and TVR at 12 months between everolimus-eluting and biolimus-eluting stents and everolimus-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold stents.</brief_summary>
