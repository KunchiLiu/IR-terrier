Subjects in stable health as determined by the investigator's clinical examination and assessment of subject's medical history. Subjects are eligible regardless of history of administration of influenza vaccine in a previous season. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product other than the study vaccine within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Routine registered childhood vaccinations are permitted. Child in care.

Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment. Any significant disorder of coagulation or treatment with warfarin derivatives or heparin. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination. Any other condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, prevents the subject from participating in the study.</criteria>
