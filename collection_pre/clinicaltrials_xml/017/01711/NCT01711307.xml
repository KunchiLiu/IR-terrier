	<brief_summary>The proposed trial is a multi-centre prospective randomized controlled trial comparing outcomes of patients with acute Achilles tendon ruptures treated either non-operatively or with open operative tendon repair. All patients will undergo accelerated functional rehabilitation. The primary outcome measure is Achilles tendon re-rupture rate.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Equivalent clinical outcomes to surgical repair; reduced morbidity and disability to subjects through elimination of a surgical repair; reduction of cost to patients by eliminating need for surgery.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Complete midsubstance rupture of the Achilles tendon as diagnosed on clinical exam Present for initial assessment and treatment with application of a plantarflexed cast within 48 hours of their injury. Referred to one of the participating orthopaedics surgeons in a timely fashion so as to allow for further treatment (operative repair or initiation of the rehabilitation protocol) within 14 days of their injury. Open Achilles injury Achilles injury that is not a midsubstance tendon injury Any additional injury to the ipsilateral lower extremity Contraindication to surgery or anesthetic (Physical or mental) that may interfere with compliance with the rehabilitation protocol Any known factor for increased risk of Achilles tendon rupture (i.e. diabetes mellitus, immunosuppressive therapy including local or systemic steroids, and fluoroquinolone use).</criteria>
