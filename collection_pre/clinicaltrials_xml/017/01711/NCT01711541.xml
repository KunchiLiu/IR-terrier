	<brief_summary>This partially randomized phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of veliparib when given together with combination chemotherapy and to see how well they work in treating patients with stage IV head and neck cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy is more effective when given with or without veliparib in treating head and neck cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Veliparib in Treating Patients With Stage IV Head and Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended phase II dose, dose limiting toxicity (DLT), and safety of ABT-888 (veliparib) with carboplatin and paclitaxel induction chemotherapy in locoregionally advanced head and neck (LAHNC) patients. (Phase I) II. Compare magnitude of tumor shrinkage (response) following 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy with and without ABT-888 in LAHNC. (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Compare progression-free (PFS), disease-specific (DSS), and overall survival (OS) in subjects treated with or without ABT-888. (Phase II) OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of veliparib followed by a phase II study. PHASE I: Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7, paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15, and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then continue on to concomitant chemoradiotherapy. PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive veliparib, paclitaxel, and carboplatin as in Phase I. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 10 days from completion of course 2, patients begin concomitant chemoradiotherapy. ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO BID on days 1-7. Patients also receive paclitaxel and carboplatin as in Phase I. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 10 days from completion of course 2, patients begin concomitant chemoradiotherapy. CONCOMITANT CHEMORADIOTHERAPY: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 regimens of concomitant chemoradiotherapy based on the guidelines of the institution where they are being treated. OPTION I (CONCOMITANT CHEMORADIATION WITH CISPLATIN): Patients receive cisplatin IV on days 1 and 22 and undergo radiation therapy 5 days per week for 6 weeks. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 5 courses. OPTION II (CONCOMITANT CHEMORADIATION WITH TFHX): Patients receive hydroxyurea PO every 12 hours on days 1-5 for up to 11 doses, fluorouracil IV over 120 hours on days 1-5, paclitaxel IV on day 1, and undergo radiation therapy BID on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 5 courses. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48, and 60 months. Patients who progress will be followed up every 6 months through year 5.</detailed_description>
