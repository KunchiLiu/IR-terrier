	<brief_title>A Phase 1, Open-label, Multiple Dose Escalation Trial to Determine Safety and Tolerability of Once Daily OPB-111077 in Subjects With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The secondary objective of this study is to investigate the pharmacokinetic properties of OPB-111077; the pharmacodynamic effects of OPB-111077; the antitumor activity of OPB-111077 as assessed by RECIST or IMWG Uniform Response Criteria; and to explore whether PET responses correlate with other measures of clinical response.</detailed_description>
