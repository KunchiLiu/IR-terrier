Is an appropriate implant candidate for the SQS system 1. Has been or is currently being treated with spinal cord stimulation, subcutaneous nerve stimulation, peripheral nerve stimulation or an implantable intrathecal drug delivery system 2. Evidence of an active disruptive psychiatric disorder that is significant enough to impact the perception of pain, compliance to intervention and/or ability to evaluate treatment outcome, as determined by the investigator 3.
