	<brief_summary>Recent research in multiple sclerosis (MS) have suggested that altered coagulation and vascular inflammation may play a role in pathophysiology of MS. Sonoclot is viscoelastic method of analyzing clot formation. This instrument will be used to compare coagulation in individuals with MS to healthy controls. A 24-hour dietary recall and food frequency questionnaire will help determine whether coagulation is modified by fish consumption.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Coagulation in Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This case-control study will recruit individuals with a diagnosis of MS and healthy controls. Individuals will be asked to come to Bastyr Clinical Research Center for a single study visit, at which time dietary intake, current medications and supplements, other medical diagnoses, and coagulation will be evaluated.</detailed_description>
