The subject has a history of tuberculosis or exposure to anyone known or suspected to have tuberculosis or any illness that might confound the results of the study or pose additional risk in administering study drug to the subject. The subject has a positive result for hepatitis C antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen, or QuantiFERON®TB Gold test at Screening or is known to be positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The subject has a known or suspected allergy to any of the components of the trial products including mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or the azole class of compounds, or a history of multiple and/or severe allergies to drugs or foods, or a history of severe anaphylactic reactions. The subject is a smoker (any use of tobacco or nicotine containing products) within 6 months prior to Screening. The subject has had treatment with prescription drugs or complementary and alternative medicines within 14 days prior to Day 1, or overthecounter medications within 1 week prior to Day 1, with the exception of acetaminophen up to 2 g/day.
