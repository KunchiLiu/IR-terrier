The enrollment period will be fifteen months. The duration is over two years of observation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tdap Vaccine in Post-Partum Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single site, prospective study involving only one intervention, receipt of a single 0.5 mL intramuscular (IM) dose of Adacel (Tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular Pertussis) vaccine, among 55 healthy post partum women. The purpose of the study is to examine the immune responses and subsequent decline in serum and breast milk antibody titers over two years of observation. The clinical trial will involve women (aged 18 - 45 years) who have just delivered full-term infants (greater than or equal to 37 completed weeks of gestation) at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. One particular population at Vanderbilt to target will be the "centering prenatal care group" that has breastfeeding rates as high as 75 percent at hospital discharge and maintained at 20 percent at 6 months. The enrollment period will be fifteen months. The subjects, staff assessing subjects, and laboratory personnel will be aware of receipt of the vaccine. Since only a single vaccine product is being utilized, there is no blinding needed of the subjects or staff.</detailed_description>
