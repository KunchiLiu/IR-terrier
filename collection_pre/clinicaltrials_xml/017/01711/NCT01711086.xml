	<brief_summary>Double-blind study, randomized, controlled, and crossover. Study recruited 30 volunteers with stable asthma aged 8-18 years. Participants will perform lung function as part of the routine follow-up then will receive a Foradil 12mcg either with an Aerolizer (a standard dry powder inhaler) or with the Inspiromatic (an active, breath synchronized innovative inhaler). 3-60 days later participants will receive the same drug through the other inhaler. Pre and post treatment (15 min, 30 min, 60 min) Lung function results, drug levels in the blood, vital signs and side effects will be recorded.</brief_summary>
