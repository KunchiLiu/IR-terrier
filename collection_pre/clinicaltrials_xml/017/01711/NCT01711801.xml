	<brief_summary>This randomized, Investigator/Subject-blind, adaptive single-ascending-dose, placebo-controlled, parallel study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (including the effect of food), and pharmacodynamics of RO5545965 following oral administration in healthy male volunteers. In Part 1, subjects will be randomized in cohorts to receive single ascending doses of RO5545965 or placebo. In Part 2, subjects will receive 2 doses of RO5545965, in the fed or fasted state, in randomized sequence with a washout period of approximately 2 weeks between treatment periods.</brief_summary>
