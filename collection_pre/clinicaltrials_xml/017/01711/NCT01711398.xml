	<brief_summary>The experimental plan will consist in: The dose-finding Bayesian adaptive phase I portion of the study is designed to determine the optimal and recommended dose of IPP-204106N using a Bayesian "with memory" design with combined toxicity and pharmacokinetic endpoints to determine doses for successive cohorts of three patients. The Bayesian methodology allows updating information as the trial progresses and stopping the trial as soon as the information obtained is deemed to be sufficient. Preclinical toxicokinetic studies of N6L and IPP-204106N in dogs and the first phase I clinical trial with N6L will be used to inform the prior distribution in the present study. The decisional part, according to the results of the phase I portion of the study, will define the optimal dose recommended for the phase IIa portion of the study. The phase IIa portion of the study will confirm the optimal dose, and is designed to evaluate the safety and the preliminary efficacy of IPP-204106N in an expanded patient population treated at the recommended dose of IPP-204106N.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Signed informed consent obtained prior to initiation of any studyspecific procedures for study participation and signed informed consent for tumor biopsy. Informed consent for tumor biopsy is mandatory for patients included in the phase IIa part of the study. Man or woman at least 18 years of age. Histological or cytological confirmed advanced solid tumor, non eligible for curative local treatment or active palliation with systemic therapy. Patients with measurable or evaluable disease (by tumor measurements or by tumor biomarker) with a proof of disease progression. At least one measurable lesion is mandatory for the phase IIa portion of the study. Patients currently under treatment with N6L or patients who have taken part in the Phase I part of the study are eligible for the phase IIa part, according to the investigator's judgment, irrespective of their tumor status. Tumor biopsy available at study entry for patients included in the phase IIa part of the study and if possible for phase I patients. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2. Life expectancy more than 3 months according to the investigator's judgment. Recovery from any acute toxicity related to prior therapy. Toxicity should be ≤grade 1 according to NCICTCAE criteria or returned to baseline excluding alopecia. Adequate hematological counts: neutrophils &gt;=1.5 x 109/L, platelets &gt;=100 x 109/L, hemoglobin &gt;=9 g/dL. Adequate renal function: serum creatinine ≤1.5 × upper limit of normal range (ULN). Adequate hepatic function: Serum bilirubin ≤1.5 × ULN (except for isolated hyperbilirubinemia attributed to Gilbert's syndrome). Alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) ≤2.5 × ULN (or ≤5 × ULN in case of liver metastases). All women of childbearing potential must use adequate contraception throughout the duration of the study, or their partner must be surgically sterilized. The prestudy pregnancy test must be negative for women with reproductive potential. Women who have been surgically sterilized or are at least two years postmenopausal may be enrolled and do not need birth control. Hematological malignancy (including lymphomas). Any of the following within the 6 months prior to study drug administration: severe/unstable angina, myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft, symptomatic congestive heart failure, stroke, including transient ischemic attack, or pulmonary embolism. Ongoing cardiac arrhythmias of NCICTCAE grade ≥2. Active uncontrolled infections. Uncontrolled hypertension. Radiotherapy or chemotherapy within 4 weeks before study entry (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin). Pregnancy or breastfeeding. Participation to another therapeutic clinical trial within the last 4 weeks except studies including treatment with N6L. History of severe allergic reactions. Documented or suspected allergy to any nucleolin antagonist. Documented allergy to excipient (mannitol or chondroitin sulfate) product. Documented allergy to aspirin</criteria>
