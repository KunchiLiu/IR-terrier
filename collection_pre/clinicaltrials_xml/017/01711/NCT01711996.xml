	<brief_summary>Urinary Neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL) has been recently reported to be related with the degree of hydronephrosis in pediatric ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) patients. We are trying to analyze whether it is related with the grade of renal injury in UPJO patients.</brief_summary>
