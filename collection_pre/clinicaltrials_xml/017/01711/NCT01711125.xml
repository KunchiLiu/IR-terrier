	<brief_title>Baclofen in the Treatment of Alcoholic Liver Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled study investigating the efficacy of baclofen for the treatment of alcohol dependence in patients with alcoholic liver disease. Medications will be given for 12 weeks, with a further 6 months follow-up. Both male and female participants will be recruited to this study. Trial patients will be randomised to one of three treatment groups: (1) baclofen 30mg/day (10 mg t.i.d), (2) baclofen 75mg/day (25 mg t.i.d) or (3) Placebo (3 matched tabs/day). This study will also include a second, parallel group of patients with alcohol dependence (non alcoholic-liver disease patients) that will undergo the trial protocol as described above. These patients will be randomised according to a separate list into one of three treatment groups: (1) baclofen 30mg/day (10 mg t.i.d), (2) baclofen 75mg/day (25 mg t.i.d) or (3) Placebo (3 matched tabs/day).</detailed_description>
