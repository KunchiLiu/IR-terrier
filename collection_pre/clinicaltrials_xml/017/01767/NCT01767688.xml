	<brief_summary>This study will investigate and compare the pharmacokinetics of a single 25-mg dose of MK-3102 in participants with moderate hepatic impairment and matched healthy participants. The primary hypothesis is that in participants with moderately impaired hepatic function, the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC0-∞) is similar to that observed in healthy matched control participants following a single 25 mg oral dose of MK-3102. Specifically, the true ratio (moderately impaired hepatic function patients/healthy matched control subjects) of geometric means for AUC0-∞ is no greater than 2.</brief_summary>
