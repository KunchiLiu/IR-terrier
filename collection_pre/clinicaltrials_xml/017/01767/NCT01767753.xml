	<brief_summary>Selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) is an increasingly popular treatment modality in early-to-moderate glaucoma patients. SLT has been suggested to reduce IOP more consistently during the nocturnal period than during the diurnal period in a group of medically-treated patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). At present, there is scarce data on SLT effects on the 24-hour IOP pattern in patients with glaucoma and there is no data on the 24-hour effect of SLT in untreated glaucoma patients. The purpose of this study is to assess the changes of IOP over a 24-hour period in patients with glaucoma undergoing SLT.</brief_summary>
