	<brief_summary>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex and frequent disorder with a heterogeneous clinical presentation varying throughout life, from birth up to post-menopause. Although mostly known for its reproductive consequences, PCOS is associated with metabolic abnormalities related to insulin resistance and obesity. Children born from PCOS mothers are considered to be at risk for early insulin resistance, leading to development of PCOS and metabolic abnormalities in childhood and adolescence. Obesity and insulin resistance are considered as states of low- and pro-inflammation associated with endothelial dysfunction. In addition, it has been shown that endothelial dysfunction develops from the first decade of life in response to genetic and environmental risk factors. Therefore, offspring of women with PCOS may be at increased risk for vascular disease later in life. Moreover, some evidence suggests that early life respiratory disease also contributes to later life cardiovascular consequences. The number of studies on offspring of PCOS mothers is low and a systematic follow up of children born form PCOS mothers has not been performed yet. the investigators propose a systematic evaluation of cardiometabolic and pulmonary health characteristics of children (aged 2,5-8 years) born from mothers diagnosed with PCOS. A saliva sample will be performed to determine the biochemical androgenic status of the children. Mothers of these children have undergone standardized phenotyping prior to conception; the investigators will therefore be able to correlate the metabolic status of the mother around the time of conception and the cardiometabolic and pulmonary health of their offspring.</brief_summary>
