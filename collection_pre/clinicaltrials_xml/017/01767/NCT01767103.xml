	<brief_summary>Multi-center, non-randomized, open-label, single-dose, parallel group study to determine the effect of impaired hepatic function on the PK of deferiprone and its 3-O-glucuronide metabolite following a single oral dose of 33mg/kg Ferriprox®.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Post-marketing study to evaluate the effect of impaired hepatic function on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of deferiprone and its 3-O-glucuronide metabolite and on the safety of Ferriprox® in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment as compared to healthy volunteers.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Main All subjects: 1. Adult males or females, 18 75 years of age (inclusive); 2. Body weight ≥ 50 kg; 3. Body mass index (BMI) between 19 and 32 kg/mE2 (inclusive); 4. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of &gt;1.5x10E9/L ; Healthy volunteers: 1. Medically healthy with clinically insignificant screening results (e.g., laboratory profiles, medical history, vital signs, physical examination); 2. Matched to hepatically impaired subjects in the study by age (+/ 10 years), sex and weight (+/ 15% BMI). Hepatically impaired subjects: 1. Considered clinically stable in the opinion of the Investigator; 2. Subjects with different degrees of impaired hepatic function as assessed by a ChildPugh classification score: mild (Class A: 56 points) and moderate (Class B: 79 points) impaired hepatic function. Main 1. For subjects with hepatic impairment, fluctuating or rapidly deteriorating hepatic function as indicated by clinical and/or laboratory signs of hepatic impairment (e.g. advanced ascites, infection of ascites, fever, or active gastrointestinal bleeding). 2. Evidence of liver impairment in healthy volunteers: hepatitis B and C; or aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, clotting factors, serum protein that is considered clinically significant by the Investigator; 3. History or presence of significant clinically unstable respiratory, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic (except for subjects assigned to one of the hepatically impaired groups), renal, hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine (except for subjects with hepatic impairment with clinically stable and treated diabetes, hypertension and thyroid disorders), immunologic, dermatologic, neurologic, or psychiatric disease; 4. Disorders or surgery of the gastrointestinal tract which may interfere with drug absorption or may otherwise influence the PK of the investigational medicinal product (e.g. resections of the small or large intestine, febrile conditions, chronic diarrhea, chronic vomiting, clinically unstable endocrine disease, severe infections, acute inflammations, etc.); 5. Received a pharmacological agent in another clinical trial within 28 days prior to the first dose of the study;</criteria>
