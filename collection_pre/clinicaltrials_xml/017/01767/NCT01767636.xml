	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well pazopanib hydrochloride works in treating patients with kidney cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Pazopanib hydrochloride may also stop the growth of kidney cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pazopanib Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the efficacy of pazopanib (pazopanib hydrochloride) in non clear cell metastatic renal cell cancer patients as assessed by the overall survival rate at 12 months. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the rates of best tumor response at the end of the first two treatment cycles of pazopanib in non clear cell metastatic renal cell cancer patients. II. To determine the benefit of pazopanib in increasing progression free survival time. III. To describe toxicity profile of pazopanib in non clear cell metastatic renal cell cancer patients. OUTLINE: Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.</detailed_description>
