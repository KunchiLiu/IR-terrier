	<brief_summary>Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) persists despite decades of intervention efforts. Negative outcomes of inappropriate antibiotics include increased costs of care, adverse drug reactions, and rising prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. To address this public health problem, we apply the principles of commitment and consistency in an effort to influence clinician decision-making through the implementation of a low-cost behavioral "nudge" in the form of a simple public commitment device. Clinicians were asked to post in their exam room a signed letter indicating their commitments to reducing inappropriate antibiotic use for ARIs. Our hypothesis is that clinicians displaying the poster-sized commitment letters will decrease their inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for ARIs as compared to clinicians in the control condition (with no posted letter).</brief_summary>
