	<brief_summary>This study will assess the utilization patterns (adherence, source of the index antidiabetic agent (ADA) and treatment modification) of the marketed glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (exenatide and liraglutide), dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (sitagliptin, saxagliptin, and linagliptin) and other ADAs and the incidence rate of acute pancreatitis among the users of these GLP-1 receptor agonists and users of DPP-4 inhibitors, separately, in comparison to other ADAs. The proposed study will help in understanding the treatment utilization patterns and the incidence rate of acute pancreatitis among users of the marketed GLP-1 receptor agonists. This study differs from previous observational studies by including both exenatide and liraglutide and follow-up time is expected to be longer in the current study (2005 - 2011). This study will be a retrospective cohort study conducted in the Truven (Thomson Reuters) commercial health insurance database from 2005-2011.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects aged ≥ 18 and ≤ 64 years as of index date and those who have continuous enrolment for at least 12 months in Truven Subjects should have complete medical and pharmacy benefits and continuous enrolment in the health plan for at least 12 months before the index date (preindex period). Subjects should also have at least 1 claim of T2D diagnosis identified using ICD9 codes 250.x0 or 250.x2 (excluding 250.x1 and/or 250.x3 Type 1 diabetes and 648.0x gestational diabetes) For the objective of evaluating the association between GLP1 receptor agonists, DPP4 inhibitors and acute pancreatitis as compared to the association observed between this outcome and the use of other ADAs, subjects having evidence of pancreatic disease (ICD 9 code of 577.xx) in the preindex period (12 months before the index date) will be excluded.</criteria>
