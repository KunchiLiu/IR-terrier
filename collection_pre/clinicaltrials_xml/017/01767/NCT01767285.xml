	<brief_summary>The investigators are examining if there is a difference in continuation rates of the etonogestrel contraceptive implant between women who have the device placed immediately after delivery, before leaving the hospital, and women who have the device placed at the routine 6-week postpartum visit. There will be 60 subjects total, randomized in a 1:1 ratio, for 30 in each group. All participants will follow-up at the same postpartum clinic 6 weeks after delivery. They will then be contacted at 3, 6, and 12 months postpartum and asked to complete a brief survey. The investigators hypothesize that continuation rates of Implanon will be higher in the immediate postpartum placement arm than in the delayed placement arm.</brief_summary>
