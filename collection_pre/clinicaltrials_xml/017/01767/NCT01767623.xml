	<brief_summary>This open-label, Phase I study will evaluate the impact of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics and safety of vemurafenib in patients with BRAF V600 mutation positive cancer. Patients will receive vemurafenib 960 mg (normal hepatic function) or 720 mg (severe hepatic impairment) orally twice daily on Days 1 to 20 (morning dose) and from Day 27 onwards until disease progression or inacceptable toxicity occurs.</brief_summary>
