	<brief_summary>The objective of this study was to confirm if two formulations of cephalexin tablets are bioequivalent. Test product was Ceporex® (1 g Cephalexin; GlaxoSmithKline) and reference product Keflex® (1 g Cephalexin; Eli Lilly). The single dosage was one tablet. The study was prospective, open-label, randomized, crossover, single dose, with 02 treatments, 02 sequences and 02 periods, under fasting conditions. The population was composed of 26 healthy volunteers, both genders, adults between 18-40 years. The comparative bioavailability of the two formulations was evaluated based in statistical comparisons of relevant pharmacokinetic parameters, obtained from data of drug concentrations in blood.</brief_summary>
