	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics of PCI-32765 in Participants With Varying Degrees of Hepatic Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-dose, multi-center (study conducted at multiple sites), non-randomized study to access the pharmacokinetics of PCI-32765 in participants who either have mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment or qualify for the control group (normal liver function). The study mainly consists of 3 phases: screening phase (within 21 days prior to the first dose of study medication), treatment phase, and a follow up phase (10 to 12 days after the last dose of study medication). In the treatment phase, participants will receive single oral dose of PCI-32765 on Day 1. Liver impairment will be classified according to the Child-Pugh Classification of Severity of Liver Disease, as: normal, mild, moderate, and severe. Total 30 participants (24 with hepatic impairment [6 mild, 9 moderate and 9 severe] at baseline and 6 in the control group according to Child-Pugh criteria) will be enrolled. Participants in the control group will be enrolled after the participants with mild or moderate hepatic impairment have completed the study. Safety evaluations for adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examination will be monitored throughout the study. The total duration of study for each participant will be approximately for 29 to 33 days.</detailed_description>
