	<brief_summary>This is a multinational, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study using a Bayesian design with response adaptive randomization across placebo or 5 active arms of BAN2401 to determine clinical efficacy and to explore the dose response of BAN2401 using a composite clinical score (ADCOMS). BAN2401-G000-201 is an 18-month study in which 3 dose levels (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg) are given biweekly (once every 2 weeks) to separate groups of participants and 2 dose levels (5 and 10 mg/kg) are given monthly to separate groups of participants. Participants will be from 2 clinical subgroups: mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild Alzheimer's disease dementia. Frequent interim analyses will be conducted to continually update randomization allocation on the basis of the primary clinical endpoint.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Inclusion Criteria for Mild Cognitive Impairment due to Alzheimer's Disease Intermediate likelihood: 1. Subjects who meet the National Institute of Aging Alzheimer's Association (NIAAA) core clinical criteria for mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease intermediate likelihood 2. Subjects who have a CDR score of 0.5 and a Memory Box score of 0.5 or greater at Screening and Baseline 3. Subjects who report a history of subjective memory decline with gradual onset and slow progression over the last one year before Screening; MUST be corroborated by an informant Key Inclusion Criteria for Mild Alzheimer's Disease Dementia: 1. Subjects who meet the NIAAA core clinical criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease dementia 2. Subjects who have a CDR score of 0.51.0 and a Memory Box score of 0.5 or greater at Screening and Baseline Inclusion Criteria that must be met by all subjects: 1. Subjects with objective impairment in episodic memory as indicated by at least 1 standard deviation below ageadjusted mean in the Wechsler Memory Scale IV Logical Memory II (WMSIV LMII): 1. Less than or equal to 15 for age 50 to 64 years 2. Less than or equal to 12 for age 65 to 69 years 3. Less than or equal to 11 for age 70 to 74 years 4. Less than or equal to 9 for age 75 to 79 years 5. Less than or equal to 7 for age 80 to 90 years 2. Positive amyloid load as indicated by PET or CSF assessment 3. Age between 50 and 90 years, inclusive 4. Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score equal to or greater than 22, and equal to or less than 30, at Screening and Baseline 5. Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than 17 and less than 35 at Screening 6. Females must not be pregnant or lactating, and specified contraceptive precautions must be followed 7. Subjects on acetylcholinesterase inhibitor or memantine therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) must be on a stable dose for at least 12 weeks prior to baseline 8. Subjects must have identified caregivers/informants 9. Subjects must provide written informed consent Key 1. Any neurological condition that may be contributing to cognitive impairment above and beyond that caused by the subject's AD 2. History of transient ischemic attacks (TIA), stroke, or seizures within 12 months of Screening 3. Any psychiatric diagnosis or symptoms, (e.g., hallucinations, major depression, or delusions) that could interfere with study procedures in the subject 4. Contraindications to MRI scanning, including cardiac pacemaker/ defibrillator, ferromagnetic metal implants, e,g., in skull and cardiac devices other than those approved as safe for use in MR scanners 5. Evidence of other clinically significant lesions that could indicate a dementia diagnosis other than AD on brain MRI at Screening, or other significant pathological findings on brain MRI at Screening 6. A prolonged QT/QTc interval (QTc greater than 450 ms) as demonstrated by a repeated electrocardiogram (ECG) 7. Certain other specified medical conditions 8. Severe visual or hearing impairment that would prevent the subject from performing psychometric tests accurately</criteria>
