	<brief_title>Ranolazine Cardioprotection in PCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ranolazine has been demonstrated to decrease angina, ischemia on perfusion imaging, improve diastolic function, and cardiac metabolism. Furthermore it has been associated with reduced cardiac arrhythmias, including non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation. It has not been studied as an acute cardioprotective agent in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We hypothesize that upfront administration of Ranolazine could decrease the myocardial injury associated with PCI due to all the factors listed above (i.e. precondition the myocardium). We plan to screen all patients scheduled for an elective coronary angiogram. Those who meet criteria and consent will be randomized to either receive Ranolazine or placebo twice a day for 3 days leading up to the PCI.</detailed_description>
