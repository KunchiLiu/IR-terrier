	<brief_summary>This study was conducted to compare the rate and extent of absorption of valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide following oral administration as a fixed dose combination tablet and concomitant administration of the individual drugs under fasting conditions in healthy Egyptian subjects. The study was extended to investigate any potential reaction between VAL and HCT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Interactions of Valsartan and Hydrochlorothiazide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study comprised 2 separate parts, I and II; each was a single-dose, open-label, 4-crossover periods separated by a 2 weeks washout, and 4-Treatments. Part I consisted of Treatments A (VAL 160 mg alone), B (HCT 12.5 mg alone), C (VAL 160 mg + HCT 12.5 mg) and D (VAL / HCT 160 mg/12.5mg) and Part II consisted of Treatments E (VAL 320 mg alone), F (HCT 25 mg alone), G (VAL 320 mg + HCT 25 mg) and H (VAL / HCT 320 mg/25 mg). Blood samples were collected up to 48 hours postdose and plasma was analyzed for VAL and HCT concentrations using HPLC. The pharmacokinetic properties of each drug after co-administration of VAL and HCT were compared with those of each drug administered alone.</detailed_description>
