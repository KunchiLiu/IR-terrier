	<detailed_description>Impairment in cognitive functions is one of the main symptoms in schizophrenia and is currently one of the challenges in the treatment of the disease. In this study we compare effects of two computer-aided training programs. One focused on auditory perception and processing as a basic ability underlying higher order information processing. The other training focus on facial affect discrimination and working memory. Both trainings are computer-aided and time-intensive, including up to twenty sessions within four weeks.</detailed_description>
