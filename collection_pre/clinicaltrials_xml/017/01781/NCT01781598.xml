	<brief_title>Patient-specific Instruments as a Standard Procedure in Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Orthopaedic Clinic Gersthof is a teaching hospital, where the entire spectrum of joint replacements with emphasis on hips and knees is performed. Twenty surgeons perform TKAs at our institution, with approximately 400 TKAs implanted per year. The PSI system of Smith &amp;Nephew速 (Patient-Matched Cutting Blocks [PMCB]; the VISIONAIRE速 technology) is applied. The preoperative image modality is based on a long leg standing X-ray as well as an MRI of the knee. The Genesis II速 Endoprosthesis (Smith &amp; Nephew速) is used as the TKA implant. This study is a observational monocentric prospective study. Estimated enrollment: 70 Enrollment time: September 2011-October 2012 Primary outcome: Alignment The postoperative X-rays (AP, lateral view, and long leg standing), taken 7-to-10 days after surgery are evaluated in terms of component position and restoration of the mechanical alignment. X-rays are routinely monitor-guided but not calibrated at our institution. As a secondary outcome the learning curve is evaluated using the following parameters collected during surgery: the fit of the cutting blocks, changes of the implant size, bony recuts, soft tissue releases, and changes in inlay size. Gap balancing was subjectively judged by the operating surgeon. Operation time, number of blood transfusions, and early postoperative complications were recorded within the first 14 days after surgery.</detailed_description>
