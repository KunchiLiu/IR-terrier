	<brief_summary>Recent studies have shown an increased gastrointestinal reactivity and increased intestinal permeability in IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Probiotic supplementation is known to impact the gastrointestinal immune system possibly by improvement of both the immunologic and the non-immunologic intestinal barrier. Probiotic supplementation should thus theoretically have an effect on IgAN. In this study the investigators will study the efficacy and safety of Lactobacillus reuteri.</brief_summary>
