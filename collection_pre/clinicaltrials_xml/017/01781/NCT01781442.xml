	<detailed_description>The Philippine Food and Drug Administration requires that a post marketing surveillance study be conducted nationwide and enroll approximately 3,000 study patients. In cases where the 3,000 patients will not be met, the total sample size can be reduced to 10% of the volume of drug use during the first year of it being marketed. Final sample size will be determined after one year of marketing authorization. The decision to use Torisel must be a joint decision made by the subject and the investigator. The investigator must discuss product information with the subject as per usual practice.</detailed_description>
