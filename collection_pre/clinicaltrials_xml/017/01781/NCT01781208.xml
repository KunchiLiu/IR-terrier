	<brief_title>Ultrasound Based Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A new technique based on ultrasound, known as Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) imaging is performed using standard approved ultrasound machines and transducers. The sound waves or impulses are generated in a different pattern and offer information on the stiffness of the tissue.
