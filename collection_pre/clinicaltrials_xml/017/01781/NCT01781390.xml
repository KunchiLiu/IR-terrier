	<brief_summary>This is a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled study that will enroll 225 subjects with de novo anterior myocardial infarction due to a lesion of the left anterior descending coronary artery undergoing PCI. Eligible subjects will be enrolled and undergo revascularization of the culprit LAD followed by an intracoronary (IC) delivery of the assigned treatment, infused into the stented culprit artery. The study will determine the safety and feasibility of the IC infusion of investigational MPCs in this patient population.</brief_summary>
