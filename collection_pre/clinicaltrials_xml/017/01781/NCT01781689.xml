	<brief_summary>Stroke is the most common cause of motor function impairment. However, the functional impairment is not totally irreversible. Several mechanisms may involved in both the cortical and motor function recovery after onset of stroke, and most of them are related to changes of cortical perfusion and metabolism. Motor function recovery after stroke (especially middle cerebral artery territory lesion) frequently follow stereotypic pattern (brunnström stage). This study is designed to investigate the relationship between motor cortex oxygenation/metabolism and motor function recovery after stroke. To seek if there is similar stereotypic pattern of motor cortex oxygenation/metabolism change during the recover stage after stroke.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Relationship Between Motor Cortex Oxygenation and Motor Function Recovery in Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants receive evaluations (1/week for 3 months period) of - motor function (Include: MMSE, brunnström stage, Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Physical Performance, Box and Block Test of Manual Dexterity, Functional Independence Measure) - cortical perfusion detection during performing limb movements (using NIRS) Then use path analysis to investigate the relationship between motor cortex oxygenation/metabolism and motor function recovery after stroke.</detailed_description>
