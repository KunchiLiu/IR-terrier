	<brief_summary>Excision repair cross complementing 1 (ERCC1) ribonucleotide reductase M1 (RRM1) and thymidylate synthase(TS) are molecular determinants that predict sensitivity or resistance to platinum agents 、 gemcitabine and pemetrexed respectively. Tailored therapy using these molecular determinants suggested patient benefit in a previously reported phase 2 trial. Here, we designed a study for an individual patient analysis of prospectively accrued patients who were treated with the "personalized therapy" approach versus other standard approaches.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients who had nonsmall- cell lung cancer (NSCLC) performance status of 0/1 were accrued to 2 phase 2 clinical trials Trial A (carboplatin and chemotherapy individuation based on sensitivity marker ), Trial B (carboplatin non-individuation or chemotherapy non-individuation ). Patients who were treated on Trials B were analyzed as the "standard therapy" group. Patients accrued to Trial A were called the "personalized therapy" group. disease free survival (DFS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</detailed_description>
