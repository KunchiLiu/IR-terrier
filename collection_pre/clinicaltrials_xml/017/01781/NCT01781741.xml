	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies stereotactic body radiation therapy after surgery in treating patients with stage III-IV non-small cell lung cancer. Stereotactic radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Lymphadenectomy may remove tumor cells that have spread to nearby lymph nodes in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Giving stereotactic body radiation therapy after lymphadenectomy may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the feasibility/toxicity of combining transcervical extended mediastinal lymphadenectomy (TEMLA) with or without video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess time to initiation of chemotherapy following TEMLA with or without video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)and SBRT. II. To assess feasibility/toxicity of combining TEMLA with or without VATS and SBRT with various chemotherapy regimens (to be determined by medical oncologist based on patient and tumor characteristics). III. To estimate survival following TEMLA with or without VATS and SBRT. IV. To define any differences in quality of life/toxicity following TEMLA with or without VATS and SBRT based on tumor location (peripheral/central). V. To assess response for primary tumor control and overall survival in TEMLA only patients. VI. To assess progression free survival for TEMLA with or without (VATS) patients. OUTLINE: Patients undergo TEMLA to remove the mediastinal lymph nodes followed by a single fraction of SBRT to the primary tumor (unless VATS procedure done) and mediastinal lymph node beds (if positive on TEMLA), with or without VATS. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6,9, and 12 months, every 6 months for 2 years and annually for 2 years.</detailed_description>
