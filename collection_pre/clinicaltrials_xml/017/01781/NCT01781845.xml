	<brief_summary>Pediatric upper urinary tract dilatation (hydronephrosis) is relatively common and may be either obstructive or nonobstructive. While the upper urinary tract is commonly evaluated by ultrasound, this imaging technique often fails to distinguish obstructed from nonobstructed systems. ARFI SVI is a new ultrasound technology that can be used to determine stiffness by measuring a tissue's shear wave velocity, may show alterations in parenchymal shear wave velocity in kidneys that show obstruction on DRS (Diuretic renal scintigraphy)which serves as the reference standard.</brief_summary>
