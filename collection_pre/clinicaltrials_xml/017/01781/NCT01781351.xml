	<brief_summary>Untreated ankle sprains often remain symptomatic and may end in chronic instability. The aim of our study is to quantify the stabilizing effect of different devices. Through the combined use of the 3D motion analysis and the surface electromyography, the influence of the devices with respect to a mechanical effect and to an influence on the neuromuscular control are examined. The tests will simulate situations with a higher risk of injury. In the experimental set-up, an element of surprise will be integrated in order to analyze any muscular compensation mechanisms.</brief_summary>
