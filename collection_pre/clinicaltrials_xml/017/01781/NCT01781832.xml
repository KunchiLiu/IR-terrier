	<brief_summary>Urinary bladder fibrosis is relatively uncommon in children. Traditionally, the presence of urinary bladder fibrosis has been confirmed directly with bladder biopsy or using urodynamic testing. In this study we will use ARFI (acoustic radiation force impulse)-derived shear wave velocities to potentially identify any urinary bladder wall fibrosis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Urinary bladder fibrosis is relatively uncommon in children. Traditionally, the presence of urinary bladder fibrosis has been confirmed directly with bladder biopsy or using urodynamic testing. We will use ARFI (acoustic radiation force impulse)-derived shear wave velocities to potentially identify the presence of urinary bladder wall fibrosis. We hypothesize that shear wave velocities obtained within the bladder wall will increase with increasing evidence of fibrosis.</detailed_description>
