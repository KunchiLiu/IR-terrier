	<brief_summary>Urine reflux (urine backing up into the kidneys) is common in the pediatric population and may be complicated by renal abnormalities, such as infection and scarring. Currently, urine reflux is detected using either voiding cystourethrogram or other procedures. A new technique called ultrasound-based Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI), or shear wave velocity imaging SVI) is performed using standard approved ultrasound machines and transducers bu the sound waves/impulses are produced in a different pattern. We hope to evaluate the usefulness of ARFI in diagnosing possible kidney damage caused from urine reflux (urine backing up into the kidneys).</brief_summary>
