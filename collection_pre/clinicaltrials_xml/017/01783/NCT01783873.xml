	<brief_summary>Occupational asthma (OA) caused by high molecular weight (HMW) substances have been shown to induce predominantly an eosinophilic inflammation. In contrast, OA caused by low molecular weight (LMW) substances results in a neutrophilic inflammation. In addition, data regarding phenotype of lymphocytes in OA caused by HMW and LMW substances are scarce. The use of a new equipment will allow the realization of specific standardized bronchial challenges (BC) to occupational agents. Thus, we propose to study in more detail the cellular mechanisms involved during BC to HMW and LMW occupational agents in a double-blind placebo controlled study.</brief_summary>
