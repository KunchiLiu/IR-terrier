	<brief_summary>This is a phase 1b/2 study to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of the combination of lapatinib, everolimus and capecitabine for the treatment of participants with HER2+ breast cancer with metastases in the brain who have progressed on trastuzumab. The combination of 2 drugs able to reach the brain (lapatinib and everolimus) that target different parts of the HER2 signaling pathway plus chemotherapy (capecitabine) that has proven benefits in metastatic breast cancer may lead to improved clinical outcomes for participants with CNS metastasis. Participants will undergo brain MRIs and CT scans of the chest and abdomen to evaluate response to the treatment, regular laboratory tests and echocardiogram or Multi Gated Acquisition Scan (MUGA) to assess cardiac activity</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1b/2 Trial Using Lapatinib, Everolimus and Capecitabine for Treatment of HER-2 Positive Breast Cancer With CNS Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Central nervous system (CNS) objective response rate at 12 weeks: defined as either a complete response or partial response provided there is no progression of extra-CNS disease, increasing steroid requirements, or worsening of neurologic signs and symptoms (NSS)^34 Lesions will be measured using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Safety and tolerability. II. Median progression free survival. III. Median overall survival. IV. CNS objective response rate and clinical benefit rate (complete response, partial response and stable disease lasting at least 6 months). V. Extra-CNS objective response rate according to RECIST1.1. OUTLINE: Patients receive lapatinib ditosylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) and everolimus PO QD on days 1-21, and capecitabine PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 17 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment or treatment discontinuation, patients will complete 2 follow up visits within 7 days and at 30 days and then will be followed for survival every 3 months for up to 12 months.</detailed_description>
