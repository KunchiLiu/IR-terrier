	<brief_title>Study of Nivolumab Given Sequentially With Ipilimumab in Subjects With Advanced or Metastatic Melanoma (CheckMate 064)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order to evaluate the potential synergistic activity of nivolumab and ipilimumab and also because there may be differences in biology between tumors which are stable or responding to therapy and those that are clinically progressing, this study, CA209064, looked at two sequential combination regimens in which the second agent is administered immediately after a pre-specified duration of therapy with the first agent and not delayed until the time of progression after the first agent. This sequential study design looked at pharmacodynamic changes during treatment with one agent which may predict clinical activity to subsequent treatment with the alternate agent. This was done because it has not been scientifically proven whether or not the order in which nivolumab and ipilimumab are given is clinically important.</detailed_description>
