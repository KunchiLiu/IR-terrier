	<brief_title>11C Methionine PET for the Detection of Hyperfunctional Parathyroid Tissues</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary: To compare the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 11C-methionine (MET) PET/CT and 99mTc-MIBI SPECT-CT in the detection of pathologic parathyroid glands in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Secondary:To compare the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 11C-MET and 18F-FDG PET/CT scans in the detection of pathologic parathyroid glands in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. STUDY DESIGN A phase II diagnostic imaging, single-centre study to compare the accuracy of 11C-MET PET/CT with standard 99mTc-MIBI SPECT-CT and with 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. STUDY POPULATION Number of Subjects: 50 patients Number of groups: 1: 50 with primary hyperparathyroidism. Age/Gender: Age greater than or equal to 19 years / Male and Female Study specific requirements: Subjects with clinically suspected primary hyperparathyroidism who require 99mTc-MIBI SPECT-CT parathyroid imaging. INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT Product: 11C-Methionine Route of administration: Intravenous Dosage(s) and frequency: Radioactive dose of 11C-Methionine of 6 MBq per kilogram body weight per injection (maximum dose of 555 MBq); one injection per patient. COMPARATOR PRODUCTS Product: 99mTc-Methoxyisobutylisonitrite; 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Route of administration: Intravenous Dosage(s) and frequency: (1) Radioactive dose of 99mTc-Methoxyisobutylisonitrite of 555 - 740 MBq per injection; one injection per patient. (2) Radioactive dose of 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose of 296 - 521 MBq per injection; one injection per patient. EVALUATION CRITERIA Efficacy: The comparison of the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 11C-MET PET/CT with 99mTc-MIBI SPECT-CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT in the detection of pathologic parathyroid glands in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Safety: Vital signs before and following 11C-MET administration; adverse events collection.</detailed_description>
