	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to understand more about limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Therefore, the investigators would like to track the following information collected once a year from patients with GENETICALLY CONFIRMED LGMD: quality of life questionnaires, muscle strength, motor function, routine examination, assessment of patient (or parent) understanding of LGMD, and serum (blood) for growth factors, cytokines, and biomarkers (all parts of your blood). By tracking this information, we hope to be able to understand more about the diagnosis, progression and natural history of this disorder.</brief_summary>
