	<brief_title>A Phase II Study of Everolimus in Combination With Exemestane Versus Everolimus Alone Versus Capecitabine in Advance Breast Cancer.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a three-arm, randomized, open label, multi-center phase II study investigating the combination of everolimus (10mg daily) with exemestane (25mg daily) versus everolimus (10mg daily) versus capecitabine (1250mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days, 3-week cycle) in patients with estrogen-receptor positive, HER2 negative, advanced breast cancer after recurrence or progression on letrozole or anastrozole. The reference therapy (control arm) used in the course of this trial is the combination arm of everolimus plus exemestane. The investigational therapies in the context of this study are everolimus monotherapy and capecitabine monotherapy. All treatments will be taken orally until disease progression, intolerable toxicity or withdrawal of patient's informed consent. Patients will be randomly assigned with equal allocation to one of the treatment arms: 1. Exemestane (25mg daily) in combination with everolimus (10mg daily) 2. Everolimus (10mg daily) 3. Capecitabine (1250mg/m2 twice daily) orally for two weeks, followed by a one week rest period in 3-weeks cycles. Treatment assignment will be stratified by the presence of visceral disease (yes vs. no). Visceral refers to lung, liver, heart, ovary, spleen, kidney, adrenal gland, malignant pleural or pericardial effusion or malignant ascites.</detailed_description>
