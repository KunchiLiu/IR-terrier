	<brief_summary>The objective of this clinical evaluation is to evaluate the immediate and long-term (up to 12 months) outcome of NanoCrossTM balloon catheter (Covidien) in a prospective, non-randomised, controlled investigation for the treatment of patients with critical limb ischemia (Rutherford 4-5) due to the presence of lesions of minimally 10cm in length at the level of the below-the-knee arteries.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient presenting with rest pain or minor tissue loss (Rutherford class 4 or 5) Patient is willing to comply with specified followup evaluations at the specified times Patient is &gt;18 years old Patient understands the nature of the procedure and provides written informed consent, prior to enrolment in the study Patient has a projected lifeexpectancy of at least 12 months Patient is eligible for treatment with the NanoCrossTM .014 balloon catheter (Covidien) Male, infertile female, or female of child bearing potential practicing an acceptable method of birth control with a negative pregnancy test within 7 days prior to study procedure De novo lesion or restenotic lesion after PTA in the infrapopliteal arteries,suitable for endovascular therapy Total target lesion length minimally 100mm Target vessel diameter visually estimated to be &gt;1.5mm and &lt;4.0mm Guidewire and delivery system successfully traversed lesion At least one nonoccluded crural artery with angiographically documented run off to the foot. Patient refusing treatment The reference segment diameter is not suitable for the available balloon design Untreated flowlimiting inflow lesions Perioperative unsuccessful ipsilateral percutaneous vascular procedure to treat inflow disease just prior to enrollment Any previous surgery in the target vessel (including prior ipsilateral crural bypass) Aneurysm in the target vessel Target lesion has severe calcification as determined by physician's discretion Nonatherosclerotic disease resulting in occlusion (e.g. embolism, Buerger's disease, vasculitis) Severe medical comorbidities (untreated CAD/CHF, severe COPD, metastatic malignancy, dementia, etc) or other medical condition that would preclude compliance with the study protocol or 1year life expectancy Major distal amputation (above the transmetatarsal) in the study limb or non study limb Septicemia or bacteremia Any previously known coagulation disorder, including hypercoagulability Contraindication to anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy Known allergy to contrast media that cannot be adequately premedicated prior to the study procedure Patient with known hypersensitivity to heparin, including those patients who have had a previous incidence of heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT) type II Currently participating in another clinical research trial Angiographic evidence of intraarterial thrombus or atheroembolism from inflow treatment Target lesion access not performed by transfemoral approach.</criteria>
