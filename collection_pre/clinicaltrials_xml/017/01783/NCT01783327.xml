	<brief_title>Teens-Connect: Preventive Psycho-education for Transitioning Teens With Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aims are: 1. To evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of provider-prescribed Teens-Connect (TEENCOPE™+Managing Diabetes) in pediatric diabetes practice compared to prescription of Planet D™. The hypotheses to be studied are: 1. Youth who participate in Teens-Connect will have better metabolic control (A1c) and quality of life (QOL) than those who participate in Planet D. 2. These effects will be mediated by improvements in stress/coping, self-efficacy, diabetes problem-solving, and self-management. 3. Teens-Connect prescribed by providers in diabetes clinics will be a cost-effective approach to reduce A1c and improve quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for youth with T1D. 2. To compare the reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and maintenance (RE-AIM) of the two provider-prescribed psycho-educational internet programs.</detailed_description>
