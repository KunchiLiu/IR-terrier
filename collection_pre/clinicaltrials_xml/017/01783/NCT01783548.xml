History of a respiratory infection or disorder (including, but not limited to bronchitis, pneumonia, chronic sinusitis or influenza) within the 14 days preceding the Screening Visit (SV), or development of a respiratory infection during the RunIn Period. Active asthma requiring treatment with inhaled or systemic corticosteroids and/or routine use of betaagonists and any controller drug (e.g., theophylline, leukotriene antagonists). History of intermittent use (less than or equal to 3 uses per week) of inhaled short acting betaagonists prior to the Screening Visit (SV) is acceptable.
