	<brief_summary>We will study the efficacy of FDA approved intravenous (IV) acetaminophen ("Ofirmev", Â© 2011 Cadence Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) in reducing opioid consumption after minimally invasive thoracic surgery in a double blind randomized trial. This drug has been shown in Europe to reduce the need for patient controlled analgesia and the total dose of opioids, which have serious side effects in thoracic surgery patients. We will compare the use of IV patient-controlled morphine (PCA) in two groups of subjects in treating postoperative pain. One group of subjects will receive IV acetaminophen every six hours beginning within 30 minutes before surgical end time and continuing for 24 hours plus IV morphine PCA, and the other group will receive IV placebo every six hours plus IV morphine PCA, a standard treatment for postoperative pain. We will determine if IV acetaminophen reduces post-operative morphine requirements (primary end point). We will also assess subject pain scores and post-operative complications associated with pain management as secondary end points. Our hypothesis is that the study arm receiving intravenous acetaminophen will have lower total morphine consumptions compared to the placebo group.</brief_summary>
