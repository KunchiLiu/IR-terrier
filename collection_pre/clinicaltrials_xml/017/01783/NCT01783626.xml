	<brief_summary>Evodial +hemodialyzer consists of an evolution of the existing CE marked Evodial device, with respect to the hemodialyzer membrane removal characteristics. Different membrane prototypes configurations are proposed (3 versions in total), with the objective to modulate the hemodialyzer removal capacities (convective and adsorptive capacities). Materials(including heparin grafted specifications) as well as the sterilization process are identical to the Evodial hemodialyzer. Based on available preclinical data , a clinical study is requested to document in vivo the different prototypes removal capacities with respect to middle Molecular Weight (MW) reference toxins such as b2 Microglobulin and collect data with regards to protein loss.</brief_summary>
