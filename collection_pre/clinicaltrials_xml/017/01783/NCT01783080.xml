	<brief_title>Behavioral Activation (BA) for Medication-responsive Chronically Depressed Patients With Impaired Social Functioning</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Psychosocial functioning was assessed before and after BA treatment in medication responsive depressed individuals who continued to have impaired social functioning. The primary goal was to demonstrate feasibility of recruitment and retention, and obtain an open pilot sense as to whether there are benefits from this brief psychotherapy approach in this population. The investigators also planned to refine measures and estimate the effect size of any treatment response to estimate power and sample size with the goal of completing a future controlled study.</detailed_description>
