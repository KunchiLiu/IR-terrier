	<brief_summary>The BABY HUG Treatment Study was designed to see if treatment with the drug hydroxyurea (also called HU) in children with sickle cell disease could prevent organ damage, especially in the spleen and kidneys. There was also a chance that treatment could prevent painful crises, lung disease, stroke, and blood infection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pediatric Hydroxyurea Phase III Clinical Trial (BABY HUG) Follow-up Observational Study II Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current observational trial, Follow-Up Study II (designated FUS II) includes enhanced neuropsychological, brain, cardiac, and pulmonary evaluations for this very well characterized cohort of subjects. Measures of spleen and renal function and markers of DNA damage will continue to be collected. Assessment of other target organs in sickle cell disease including pulmonary and cardiac function will be performed in addition to evaluation of developmental aspects of SCD and potential HU toxicity.</detailed_description>
