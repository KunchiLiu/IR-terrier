	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to determine if papaya fruits are an exceptionally good food source for carotenoids in humans, particularly when compared more common carotenoid sources like carrots and tomatoes. This objective will be accomplished by quantitation of the immediate post-prandial plasma concentrations of parent carotenoids and vitamin A metabolites from subjects who consumed a meal containing fresh papaya, tomato, and carrot.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Carotenoid Bioavailability From Fresh Papaya, Tomato and Carrot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main purpose of this study is comparing bioavailability of papaya carotenoids versus carrot and tomato carotenoids. Previously, vitamin A deposition in rat livers was studied, showing that carotenoid bioavailability from papaya is higher than from spinach, parsley and carrots. Detailed knowledge about human carotenoid absorption and conversion from papaya fruit compared to other food sources is still lacking.</detailed_description>
