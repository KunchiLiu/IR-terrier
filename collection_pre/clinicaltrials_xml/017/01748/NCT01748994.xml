	<brief_summary>The body shape of obese women varies between having the majority of fat either above the waist ("apple" shape) or below the waist ("pear" shape). The study will investigate what restricts: apple"-shaped women from being "pear"-shaped at the cellular level. Since "pear" shaped women tend to have better health, this study will open the door to future research in regulating body shape and thus improving health.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cellular Dynamics of Subcutaneous Fat Distribution in Obese Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adipose tissue expandability and the distribution of stored fat in the body are stronger predictors of health risk. A better understanding of the factors that determine regional fat mass growth may lead to developing new strategies for prevention or treatment of metabolic complications of obesity. The objective of this proposal is to study the responsiveness of different fat depots to adipogenic stimulation in upper-body and lower-body obese women.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>You are a premenopausal woman between 1840 years of age Your Body Mass Index (BMI, weighttoheight2 ratio) is 27 38 kg/m2, inclusive The ratio of your waisttohip circumferences is either &gt;0.84 ("apple"type body shape) or &lt;0.77 ("pear"type body shape) You are willing to undergo a drug intervention for 16 weeks You are willing to drink heavy water [similar to the ordinary water that is highly enriched in the naturally occurring stable (nonradioactive) form of hydrogen, deuterium; also called deuteriumlabeled water] for 8 weeks before the beginning and during the second half of the drug intervention; you will need 24hours access to a refrigerator for storage of the water. You agree to use a double barrier method as a form of birth control to prevent pregnancy. Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) are not allowed in the study. Acceptable methods of birth control are condoms, spermicide, IUD (intrauterine device, must be hormone free see list in clinic), diaphragm and abstinence. An example of a double barrier method would be condoms plus spermicide, etc. You have gained or lost more than 4.5 lb (2 kg) in the last 3 months You have had significant changes in the diet or level of physical activity within the past month You have a blood sugar of greater than 100 or a diagnosis of diabetes. You have abnormal liver enzyme values from your blood work You have a history of heart, kidney, lung, liver, and thyroid disease You have an average blood pressure &gt;140/90 at your screening visit Have you had a positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B or hepatitis C? You require chronic use of medications including diuretics, steroids, thyroid hormones, and adrenergicstimulating agents (bronchodilators, nasal decongestants)</criteria>
