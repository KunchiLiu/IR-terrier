	<brief_title>Vitamin D Supplementation in Cutaneous Malignant Melanoma Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To assess whether vitamin D supplementation, in the follow up period after diagnosis and surgery of a first cutaneous malignant melanoma, has a protective effect on relapse of cutaneous malignant melanoma and whether this protective effect correlates with vitamin D levels in serum and vitamin D receptor (VDR) immunoreactivity in the primary tumor.</detailed_description>

Preexisting renal stone disease, chronic renal disease with glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or renal dialysis. 4. Liver failure or chronic liver disease with liver enzymes &gt; 2 fold upper limit of normal (ULN). 5. History of parathyroid disease or granulomatous disease (TBC and sarcoidosis) 6. History of malabsorption syndrome or any medical condition that might interfere with vitamin D absorption. 7. History of small intestine resection. 8. History of other malignancy within the last 5 years except for carcinoma in situ of the cervix or basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or in situ malignant melanoma. 9. Chronic alcohol abuse. 10. Medical or logistic problems likely to preclude completion of the study. 11. Taking medication that predisposes to hypercalcemia (digoxin, lithium, thiazide diuretics) or taking medication that would affect metabolism of vitamin D (anticonvulsants, corticosteroids, H2receptor antagonists) 12.
