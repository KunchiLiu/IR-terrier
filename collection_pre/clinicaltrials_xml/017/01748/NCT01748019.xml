	<brief_summary>ST1968 is a novel camptothecin derivative which interacts with topoisomerase I-DNA complex, inducing S-Phase specific cytotoxicity. It is endowed with a potent antitumor activity and an increased Therapeutic Index with respect to the clinically used analogues (i.e.irinotecan and topotecan) in some xenograft models (ovary, colon, head &amp; neck, cervix). Anti-tumor activity has been also noted in platinum resistant ovarian cell xenografts and in topoisomerase I mutant prostate cell lines. The acceptable toxicity profile in animals and the activity in camptothecin-resistant cell lines make ST1968 a good candidate for clinical trials.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ST1968 Intravenous (Weekly) in Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multicenter, open label, uncontrolled Phase I pharmacokinetic trial to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of ST1968 given intravenously (I.V.) once every week for 2 consecutive weeks every 3 weeks and the MTD of ST1968 given I.V. once every 3 weeks. A starting dose of 1.5mg/m2 given as a flat dose of 2.5mg is defined, given once on Day 1, Day 8 every 21 Days (D1, D8 Q21D schedule), over 2 h. Starting dose for the Day 1 every 21 Days (D1 Q21D schedule) has to be determined from the MTD of D1, D8 Q21D schedule. Plasma, urine pharmacokinetics in all patients (minimum of 3 pts for each cohort) during the first cycle of treatment and in at least 6 patients at the Recommended Dose (RD). During the study any hints of anti-tumor activity will also be evaluated by RECIST criteria.</detailed_description>

Life expectancy of at least 3 months Capacity of understanding the nature of the trial and giving written informed consent. Less than 4 weeks since last chemotherapy, radiotherapy or prior investigational therapy. Less than 2 weeks since last hormone or immunotherapy or signal transduction therapy. Active infection. Presence of cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis Presence of serious cardiac (congestive heart failure, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within one year prior to study entry, uncontrolled hypertension or arrhythmia), neurological or psychiatric disorder. Presence of uncontrolled intercurrent illness or any condition which in the judgement of the investigator would place the subject at undue risk or interfere with the results of the study.
