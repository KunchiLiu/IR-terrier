	<brief_summary>The purpose of this prospective registry is to collect real world, post-marketing data on the use of Stryker Target® 360,Target® 2D, and 2nd generation Target® Nano coils for the embolization of ruptured or unruptured intracranial saccular aneurysms. Up to 300 patients (150 in the TARGET 360°/Helical arm and 150 in the New NANO arm) presenting with intracranial aneurysms suitable for coil embolization will be enrolled at up to 20 sites. A post hoc analysis comparing Target® 360° and Target® 2D coil technical and clinical endpoints will be performed.</brief_summary>
