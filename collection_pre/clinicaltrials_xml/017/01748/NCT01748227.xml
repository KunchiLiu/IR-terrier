	<brief_summary>The overall purpose of this pilot study is to conduct a formative evaluation of (veteran)peer delivery of a chronic pain self-management program to veterans with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Our specific aims are as follows: Aim 1: Evaluate the feasibility of identifying, recruiting, training, and retaining veteran peers to implement a self-management program for chronic pain. Aim 2: Identify facilitators and barriers to peer-delivery of a chronic pain self-management program. Aim 3: Convene an expert panel to review the results of Aims 1 and 2, help to interpret the results, and plan next steps.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a one-arm pilot study with a pretest/posttest design. Thus, participants' (n=20) baseline scores were compared to their final outcome assessment scores (i.e., change scores.) There was no control group. This study is an intervention using peer coaches to deliver pain self-management instruction to patients. Peer coaches thus delivered the intervention and underwent a 3-hour training session prior to initiation of the study. Because peers served as intervention facilitators and not as recipients of the intervention, this study was not focused on peer outcomes. Patients (n=20) attended a 2-hour didactic session led by the study nurse. Then patients were assigned a peer (2 patients per peer). Patients met with their peers for 4 months to discuss pain self-management with the guidance of a study manual. Peers were asked to contact patients a minimum of bi-weekly via telephone or in-person. Peers reviewed each of the topic areas covered in the self-management manual. Peers reviewed a different topic each session, ask if the patient has questions, and discuss his or her personal experience with the topic being covered during that session. Modeling what the nurse care manager has done in prior studies, peers worked with patients to help them to set goals and to evaluate whether these goals are realistic. A new goal was set at each session, with the peer following up on the previous goals with the patient, whether they were accomplished, and if not, possible courses of action (e.g., modifying the goal or offering other advice to accomplish the goal). Throughout these sessions peers were encouraged to draw on their own experiences and how they personally overcame obstacles and handled setbacks and frustrations. Peers did not advise on or discuss medications or medical questions with patients. Participating patients (n=20) were given outcome assessments at baseline and at 4-month follow-up.</detailed_description>
