	<brief_summary>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an established risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, as shown by common manifestations of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and arterial calcifications in CKD patients. Fibroblast growth factor-23(FGF-23) is a recently identified phosphaturic hormone that has been reported to be associated with the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism, cardiovascular morbidity, mortality, CKD progression. While vitamin D is the mainstay therapy in CKD mineral bone disease (CKD-MBD), increased FGF-23 levels have been reported with vitamin D administration. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of calcium carbonate when used in conjunction with calcitriol on FGF-23.</brief_summary>
