	<brief_title>Phase 1 Study for Safety and Tolerability of EBI-005 Topically Administered to Eyes of Healthy Adult Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The planned dose levels are 5 mg/mL EBI-005 (Group 1) and 20 mg/mL EBI-005 (Group 2). A total of 8 subjects will be dosed in each group with subjects randomized in a ratio of 6:2, EBI-005:placebo. Treatment administration in Group 2 will proceed following a review of safety data from Group 1. In both groups, subjects randomized to active treatment will receive EBI-005 in the right eye and placebo in the left eye. Subjects randomized to placebo will receive placebo in each eye.</detailed_description>
