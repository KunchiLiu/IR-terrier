	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics (ie, how the body affects the drug) and pharmacodynamics (ie, how the drug affects the body) of 2 different doses of canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) in healthy Indian volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) in Healthy Indian Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be an open-label (all volunteers and study staff know the identity of the assigned treatment), randomized (the treatment is assigned by chance), single center, single dose, 2-way cross-over study (all volunteers switch from one treatment to another) to assess the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of canagliflozin (a drug currently being investigated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus) in healthy Indian volunteers. The study will consist of 3 phases: a single screening phase, a baseline phase of 2 days per period, and an open-label treatment phase that includes 2 treatment periods (Periods 1 and 2). During Period 1, volunteers will be randomly assigned to receive a single dose of either 200 mg (Treatment A) or 300 mg (Treatment B) of canagliflozin on Day 1. During Period 2, volunteers will receive the dose of canagliflozin (Treatment A or B) that they did not receive during Period 1. The duration of each treatment period will be 4 days and each treatment period will be separated by a 14 day washout period (when no medication is given). Each volunteer will participate in the study for approximately 45 days.</detailed_description>
