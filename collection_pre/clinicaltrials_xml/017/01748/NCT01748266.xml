	<brief_summary>Microcirculatory disturbances following cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) have been thought to be at the origin of organ dysfunction. Though, few studies correlated microvascular alterations with outcome. Investigators aimed at firstly describing microcirculation with near infra red spectroscopy (NIRS) and secondly correlating NIRS parameters with intensive care length of stay and organ dysfunction.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Microcirculation of the Thenar Eminence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>40 patients at high risk of post operative systemic inflammatory response syndrome after an elective cardiac surgery with CPB were included in this prospective observational study. Patients were studied during the first 48 postoperative hours. Microcirculation of the thenar eminence was analyzed by NIRS technology, through the StO2 and the resaturation slope after an ischemic challenge. Organ dysfunction was assessed with the SOFA score.</detailed_description>
