	<brief_summary>This single arm, open-label study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination oxaliplatin, capecitabine and Herceptin (trastuzumab) and chemoradiotherapy in the adjuvant setting in patients with curatively resected HER2-positive gastric or gastro-esophageal junction cancer. Patients will receive Herceptin 8 mg/kg intravenously (iv) on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and 6 mg/kg iv on Day 1 of every following 3-week cycle, with oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2 iv on Day 1 of Cycles 1-3 and capecitabine 850 mg/m2 orally twice daily on Days 1-14 of Cycles 1-3 and on 5 days per week during chemoradiotherapy. Radiotherapy will be given at a total dose of 45 Gy divided into 25 doses on 5 treatment days each week for 5 weeks starting Day 22 of Cycle 3. Anticipated time on study treatment is 1 year.</brief_summary>
