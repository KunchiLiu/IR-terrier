	<brief_title>The Effectiveness of Dexketoprofen on Shoulder Pain Using Different Physiotherapy Treatments</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It is a question of valuing the decrease of the pain (by means of the visual analogic scale pain score) and the increase of the functionality of the joint (by means of Dash and Constant scores) of three different treatments from physical therapy to establish the most effective protocol for the treatment of the subacromial syndrome. Determine the best physiotherapy treatment for subacromial syndrome with 20 sessions of different treatments. A group will receive the conventional treatment with ultrasounds without drugs, another group will receive dexketoprofen by phonophoresis and the third group will receive dexketoprofen by iontophoresis.</detailed_description>
