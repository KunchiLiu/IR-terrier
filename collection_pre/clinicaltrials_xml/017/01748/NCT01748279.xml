	<brief_summary>Rationale: Retrospective studies suggest that statins improve outcomes in COPD patients possibly as a result of an anti-inflammatory effect. Objectives: To determine whether statins have an anti-inflammatory effect on the lungs of patients with COPD. A controlled, parallel group study to compare the effects of Atorvastatin in comparison to placebo as an add-on treatment to Formoterol therapy in patients with mild to moderate COPD in group of 20 patients. All subjects will have spirometry, lung volumes, DLCO, SGRQ, 6MWD, serum lipids and hs-CRP measured before and after treatment. Bronchoscopy and transbronchial lung biopsy (TBB) will be carried out at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment, and TBB specimens will be processed for histology, immunohistochemistry and microarray analysis.</brief_summary>
