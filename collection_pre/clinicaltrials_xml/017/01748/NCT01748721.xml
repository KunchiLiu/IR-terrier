	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of MORAb-004 in treating young patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors or lymphoma. Monoclonal antibodies, such as MORAb-004, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MORAb-004 in Treating Young Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Solid Tumors or Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose of MORAb-004 (anti-endosialin/TEM1 monoclonal antibody MORAb-004) administered as an intravenous infusion every week to children with refractory solid tumors. II. To define and describe the toxicities of MORAb-004 administered on this schedule. III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of MORAb-004 in children with refractory cancer. IV. To monitor for the development of human anti-human antibody (HAHA) in children receiving MORAb-004. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of MORAb-004 within the confines of a phase 1 study. II. To examine tumor endothelial marker-1 (TEM-1) and PDGFRB levels in tissue and plasma samples as potential biomarkers of MORAb-004 activity. III. To correlate baseline expression of TEM-1 and PDGFRB (in issue and plasma)with clinical parameters including disease response in an exploratory manner. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive anti-endosialin/TEM1 monoclonal antibody MORAb-004 intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 13 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
