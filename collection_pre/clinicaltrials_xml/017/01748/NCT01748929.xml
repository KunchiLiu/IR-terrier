	<brief_summary>Women of reproductive age are considered a high-risk group for worm infections by the World Health Organization. Maternal infection and anemia contribute to infant malnutrition by affecting milk quality and quantity, and duration of exclusive breastfeeding. To date, no study has investigated the health benefits of postpartum deworming to infants or mothers. A randomized controlled trial will be conducted in Peru to investigate the effectiveness of integrating deworming into routine postpartum care. The primary measure of effect will be infant weight gain between birth and six months of age. Other infant and maternal health indicators will also be ascertained.</brief_summary>
