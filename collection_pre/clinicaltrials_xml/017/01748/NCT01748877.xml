	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether NXN-462, a selective nNOS inhibitor, is effective in reducing pain levels in patients with post-herpetic neuralgia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy, Tolerability, and Safety of NXN-462 in Patients With Post-Herpetic Neuralgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NXN-462 is designed to target the nitric oxide synthase system (NOS), specifically the neuronal NOS (nNOS) isoform. By design, NXN-462 is a potent inhibitor of nNOS with good affinity, and has little or no affinity for a range of G protein-coupled receptors, ion channels, and enzymes. NXN-462 is being developed as an oral therapy for the treatment of neuropathic pain syndromes, including PHN. This drug design strategy provides a new therapeutic paradigm for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain.</detailed_description>
