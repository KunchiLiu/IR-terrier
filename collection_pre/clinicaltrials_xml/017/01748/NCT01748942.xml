	<brief_title>Dexamethasone in Reducing Oral Pain and Dry Mouth After Surgery in Patients With Oropharyngeal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To prospectively determine if a longer 4-day course of dexamethasone (or equivalent) for the management of postoperative pain and dysphagia following transoral robotic surgery (TORS) is superior to the current standard of a single injection of dexamethasone 10 mg. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effect of postoperative corticosteroids on postoperative dysphagia following TORS. II. Determine the effect of postoperative corticosteroids on length of hospital stay following TORS. III. Determine the complications associated with postoperative corticosteroid use after TORS. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive dexamethasone intravenously (IV) at the time of surgery and orally (PO) every 8 hours for up to 4 days following surgery. ARM II: Patients receive dexamethasone IV at the time of surgery and placebo PO every 8 hours for up to 4 days following surgery. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 12 months.</detailed_description>
