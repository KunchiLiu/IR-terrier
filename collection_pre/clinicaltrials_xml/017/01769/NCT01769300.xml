	<brief_summary>The specific aim of this cluster-randomized (site) comparative effectiveness research study is to determine whether children who are (1) 5-12 years of age, (2) cared for in ePROS practices or clinics using an electronic health record (EHR), (3) have attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and (4) are to receive treatment with stimulant medication for the first time in these practices, have superior clinical outcomes if their clinicians have access to an EHR-guided clinical decision support system (intervention group) than if their clinicians have no such access (control group).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In this cluster (site)-randomized trial of clinical decision support for ADHD medication titration, clinicians caring for children with ADHD whose families are initiating stimulant medication at that practice will be followed. Two groups will be compared; an intervention group, which will receive the interventionâ€”the clinical decision support (CDS)--, and a control group, who will not receive CDS. Over a 6-month period, the CDS will support guideline-based medication titration to achieve optimal symptom control with minimal side effects. The study will track the care delivered to affected children by the practitioners and will assess the endpoints of symptom reduction and side effects. There will also be a sub-study within the larger study which will give the team a better understanding about the pros and cons of consenting parents over the phone.</detailed_description>
