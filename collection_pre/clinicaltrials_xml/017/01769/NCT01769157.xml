	<brief_summary>L-carnitine and thyroid hormone tended to antagonize reciprocally in human body. Urinary excretion of L-carnitine decreased in hypothyroid patients, and levothyroxine supplementation increased excretion of L-carnitine. The investigators hypothesized that supplying L-carnitine to hypothyroid patients with fatigue symptom could improve the quality of life, and fatigue score in them. Therefore, the investigators planned to compare the efficacy of L-carnitine and placebo in hypothyroid patients who had taken levothyroxine.</brief_summary>
