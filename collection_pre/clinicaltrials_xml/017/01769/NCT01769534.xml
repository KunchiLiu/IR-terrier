	<brief_title>Registry and Fluid Banking of Pancreatic Cystic Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patients will present to our endoscopy unit for EUS-FNA to work up pancreatic cystic lesion(s). At that time, we will recruit them to be in the patient registry and tissue repository. Their enrollment in the patient registry will allow us to contact them annually for survey purposes. Their enrollment in the tissue repository will allow us to store left-over pancreatic cyst fluid that was already aspirated for analysis (as part of the standard-of-care workup for pancreatic cysts).</detailed_description>
