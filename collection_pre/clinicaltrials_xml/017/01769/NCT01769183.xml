	<criteria>Age &gt;= 18 years Individuals &lt;18 years old are not being included because PDR is so rare in this age group that the diagnosis of PDR may be questionable. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2) Any one of the following will be considered to be sufficient evidence that diabetes is present: Current regular use of insulin for the treatment of diabetes Current regular use of oral antihyperglycemia agents for the treatment of diabetes Documented diabetes by ADA and/or WHO criteria (see Procedures Manual for definitions) At least one eye meets the study eye criteria Able and willing provide informed consent Significant renal disease, defined as a history of chronic renal failure requiring dialysis or kidney transplant. A condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in the study (e.g., unstable medical status including blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and glycemic control). Individuals in poor glycemic control who, within the last 4 months, initiated intensive insulin treatment (a pump or multiple daily injections) or plan to do so in the next 4 months should not be enrolled. Participation in an investigational trial within 30 days of randomization that involved treatment with any drug that has not received regulatory approval for the indication being studied. Note: study participants cannot receive another investigational drug while participating in the study. Known allergy to any component of the study drug. Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 (systolic above 180 or diastolic above 110). If blood pressure is brought below 180/110 by antihypertensive treatment, individual can become eligible. Myocardial infarction, other acute cardiac event requiring hospitalization, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or treatment for acute congestive heart failure within 4 months prior to randomization. Systemic antiVEGF or proVEGF treatment within 4 months prior to randomization. These drugs should not be used during the study. For women of childbearing potential: pregnant or lactating or intending to become pregnant within the next 3 years. Women who are potential study participants should be questioned about the potential for pregnancy. Investigator judgment is used to determine when a pregnancy test is needed. Individual is expecting to move out of the area of the clinical center during the study. History of allergy to Squalamine</criteria>
