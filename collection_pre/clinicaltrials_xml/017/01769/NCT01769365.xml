	<brief_summary>To simultaneously compare the efficacies of 7-day triple, 10-day sequential and 7-day quadruple therapies for H. pylori infection in Taiwan. Consecutive H. pylori-infected patients were randomly assigned to a 7-day standard triple therapy (pantoprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin for 7 days), a 10-day sequential therapy (pantoprazole and amoxicillin for 5 days, followed by pantoprazole, clarithromycin and metronidazole for a further 5 days) or a 7-day quadruple therapy (pantoprazole, clarithromycin, amoxicillin and metronidazole for 7 days). The end point is to evaluate the effectiveness of Helicobacter pylori eradication rates between three groups.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of three H. pylori eradication regimens: 7-day standard triple therapy (pantoprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin for 7 days), 10-day sequential therapy (pantoprazole and amoxicillin for 5 days, followed by pantoprazole, clarithromycin and metronidazole for a further 5 days) and 7-day quadruple therapy (pantoprazole, clarithromycin, amoxicillin and metronidazole for 7 days) in Taiwan. A total of 306 subjects are enrolled into this study. H. pylori-infected patients are randomized to a 7-day standard triple therapy, a 10-day sequential therapy, or a 7-day quadruple therapy. Eradication efficacy is assessed by a follow-up endoscopy with rapid urease test and histological examination eight weeks after the H. pylori therapy. The eradication rates of three groups will be compared.</detailed_description>
