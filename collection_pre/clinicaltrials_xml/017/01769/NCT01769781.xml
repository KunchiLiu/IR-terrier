	<brief_summary>The aromatase inhibitor (anastrazole) plus long acting GnRH agonist leuprolide acetate will be tested for the treatment of women with endometriosis recurrence compared with classical GnRH analog treatment. Pain symptom disappearance and disease free time during follow-up will be the outcomes for establishing which medical treatment is the best in endometriosis recurrence treatment.</brief_summary>
