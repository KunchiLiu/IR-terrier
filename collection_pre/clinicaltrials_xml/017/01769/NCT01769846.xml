	<brief_summary>Advances in intensive care and mechanical ventilation (MV) in the past two decades have increased critically ill patient survival. However, some patients require prolonged MV (PMV) and are deconditioned due to respiratory insufficiency caused by underlying disease, adverse effects of medications, and prolonged immobilization. Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) are often confined to their beds, which results in inactivity, immobility, and severe osteomyoarticular system dysfunction. Our hypothesis is that an early mobilization protocol improves peripheral muscle strength, perceived functional status, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay of the critically ill patient. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of implementation an early mobilization protocol in critically ill patients in the Intensive Care Unit of the University Hospital of Santa Maria.</brief_summary>
