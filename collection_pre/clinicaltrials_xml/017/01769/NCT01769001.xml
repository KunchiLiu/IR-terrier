	<brief_title>An Extension of a Phase 1/2, Open Label, Dose Ranging Study of PRX-102 in Adult Fabry Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be enrolled into one of three PRX-102 dosing groups (0.2 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, 2.0 mg/kg) to receive the same dose they had received in the Phase 1/2 study, PB-102-F01, and will continue to receive intravenous infusions of PRX-102 every 2 weeks for 38 weeks (9 months). All exploratory endpoints that were evaluated during the Phase 1/2 study PB-102-F01 will continue to be assessed in the extension protocol (study PB-102-F02). The additional exploratory efficacy parameters that were evaluated at baseline of the Phase 1/2 study PB-102-F01 as a reference point, before the initiation of treatment, will be evaluated after 3 months into the extension study (total treatment of 6 months). These parameters include Gb3 concentration in renal and skin tissues, LVM, MSSI and cardiac function tests (echocardiography and stress test). Cerebrovascular disease (clinical and MRI) will be evaluated at last infusion (total treatment of 12 months).</detailed_description>
