	<brief_summary>This is a biomarker study with the goal of measuring changes in proteins and gene methylation. This study is not intended for use in diagnosing, mitigating, treating, curing, or preventing disease. The purpose of this study is to determine if Vitamin D (cholecalciferol) alone and in combination with celecoxib (Celebrex, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID), act together to decrease breast cancer risk by their effect on certain biological indicators (biomarkers) of breast cancer risk (called PGE2, COX-2, and 15-PGDH) and cell changes in the breast.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a biomarker study with the goal of measuring changes in protein and rna expression. This study is not intended for use in diagnosing, mitigating, treating, curing, or preventing disease. 66 women at normal risk for developing breast cancer will be recruited and enrolled. 22 women will be randomized into each arm, with anticipation of 2 women in each group will not be evaluable, leaving 20 in each group for evaluation. A combination of vitamin D and celecoxib act synergistically to decrease breast cancer risk by decreasing cell proliferation in the mammary epithelium through their action on prostaglandin synthesis and metabolism. Specific Aims: -Evaluate vitamin D metabolism, through the measurement of CYP24 in the breast. 2-Evaluate breast specific levels of vitamin D and celecoxib, and assess if the levels of these compounds correlate with response to markers which influence prostaglandin synthesis and metabolism. Additionally, in women without active breast cancer , we will determine the effect of vitamin D, with or without celecoxib, on 1) PG synthesis and metabolism, through the measurement of PGE2, COX-2 and 15-PGDH in the breast, 2) proliferative activity in the breast,, and 3) circulating levels of vitamin D and celecoxib, to determine if levels of these compounds correlate with response to markers of PG production, metabolism, or cell proliferation.</detailed_description>
