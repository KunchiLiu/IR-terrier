	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to compare different methods for training hand movement at home after stroke. This study involves research because it will test two experimental devices, the MusicGlove and the Resonating Arm Exerciser (RAE), compared to conventional hand and arm exercises. The MusicGlove is a glove that measures finger movements and allows its user to play a musical computer game using those movements. The RAE is a lever that attaches to a manual wheelchair with elastic bands and can be pushed back and forth to exercise the arm.</brief_summary>
