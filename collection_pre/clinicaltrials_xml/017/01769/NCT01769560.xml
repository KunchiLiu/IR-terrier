	<brief_title>MeFirst: A Tailored Intervention to HPV Vaccine Decision Making</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MeFirst is the first web-based, online, educational tool designed to promote Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine awareness and understanding in an effort to improve HPV vaccine intent and uptake among female university students. HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection and causes genital warts and cancer. The HPV vaccine has been recommended for girls ages 11-26 since 2006, yet vaccination rates remain low. Tailored online interventions may be more effective tools to promote behavior change among college students than traditional static interventions. The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of the MeFirst tool vs. standard static educational material on increasing HPV vaccination intent and uptake among female university students aged 18-26.</detailed_description>
