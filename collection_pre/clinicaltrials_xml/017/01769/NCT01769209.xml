	<brief_summary>This phase II trial studies how well giving bortezomib together with combination chemotherapy works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib and Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate of bortezomib in combination with a chemotherapy backbone of doxorubicin (doxorubicin hydrochloride), vincristine (vincristine sulfate), PEG-asparaginase (pegaspargase), and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine progression free survival. II. Estimate the rate of complete response (CR) and CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) after this re-induction compared to a historical baseline. III. Estimate failure-free survival (FFS) and survival percent at 1 year compared to a historical baseline. IV. Assess safety and tolerability of the study drug. V. Determine whether bortezomib induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) in circulating acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) blast cells. OUTLINE: Patients receive bortezomib subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11; doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) on day 1; pegaspargase IV or intramuscularly (IM) on days 5 and 22; vincristine sulfate IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; dexamethasone orally (PO) daily on days 1-14; cytarabine intrathecally (IT) on day 1 and methotrexate intrathecally (IT) on day 15. Patients with central nervous system disease receive intrathecal treatment per investigator's discretion. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any studyrelated procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care Female subjects who: Are postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, OR Are surgically sterile, OR If they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice 2 effective methods of contraception, at the same time, from the time of signing the informed consent form through 30 days after the last dose of bortezomib, or agree to completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse Male subjects, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status post vasectomy) who: Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and through a minimum of 30 days after the last dose of study drug, OR Agree to completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse â€¢ The patient has relapsed or refractory B or T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia that has progressed following at least one prior therapy. Ph+ patients are eligible. Relapsed ALL is defined in patients as the reappearance of leukemia cells in the peripheral blood or bone marrow or appearance of extramedullary disease after a complete remission. Refractory ALL is defined in patients as failure to achieve a complete remission after induction therapy. Complete remission is defined by &lt;5% leukemia cells in the bone marrow with recovery of peripheral blood counts. Relapsed disease can be documented by bone marrow biopsy (&gt;5% cells in the bone marrow) or by flow cytometry in the peripheral blood or biopsy of extramedullary disease. Must have received at least one (1) line of prior systemic therapy that may NOT have included VELCADE (bortezomib); patients who have undergone autologous/allogeneic stem cell transplantation are eligible Transplant eligible patients are eligible Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 02 No poorly controlled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, poorly controlled diabetes, symptomatic congestive heart failure, or psychiatric illness that in the opinion of the investigator would limit compliance with study requirements Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) unless elevation is deemed due to leukemia infiltration. In these patients, dose modifications may be required based on standard guidelines. Patients must have adequate renal function defined as creatinine clearance of &gt;= 30 ml/minute (CockcroftGault) Patient has &gt; 1.5 x ULN total bilirubin Patient has &gt;= grade 2 peripheral neuropathy Patient had myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment or has New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities; prior to study entry, any electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality at screening must be documented by the investigator as not medically relevant Patient has hypersensitivity to bortezomib, boron, or mannitol Female subject is pregnant or lactating Serious medical or psychiatric illness likely to interfere with participation in this clinical study Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 2 years of enrollment, with the exception of complete resection of basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, an in situ malignancy, or lowrisk prostate cancer after curative therapy Participation in clinical trials with other investigational agents not included in this trial throughout the duration of this trial Radiation therapy within 3 weeks before randomization; enrollment of subjects who require concurrent radiotherapy (which must be localized in its field size) should be deferred until the radiotherapy is completed and 3 weeks have elapsed since the last date of therapy The patient has been exposed to &gt;= 350mg/m^2 of anthracycline (doxorubicin equivalent) The patient has a left ventricular ejection fraction of &lt; 40%</criteria>
