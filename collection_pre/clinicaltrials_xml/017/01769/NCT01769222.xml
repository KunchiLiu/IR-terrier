	<brief_summary>This pilot phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best of dose ipilimumab when given together with local radiation therapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with recurrent melanoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, colon, or rectal cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill cancer cells. Giving monoclonal antibody therapy together with radiation therapy may be an effective treatment for melanoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, colon, or rectal cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ipilimumab and Local Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Recurrent Melanoma, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Colon, or Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: 1. To assess the safety of combining intratumoral anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) immunotherapy with local radiation therapy in patients with melanoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and colorectal carcinoma with a monotherapy ipilimumab safety lead-in. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: 1. To assess the induction of an anti-tumor immune responses using laboratory correlative studies. 2. To determine tumor response rates and duration of response at unirradiated tumor sites in patients with advanced malignancies. 3. To identify putative immunologic biomarkers of tumor response. OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study of ipilimumab, followed by a phase 2 study. Only a few subjects participated in the phase 1 portion of this study. The phase 2 portion of this study was not conducted. Patients receive ipilimumab intratumorally on day 1 and undergo local radiation therapy within 48 hours for at least 3 fractions. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 and 8 weeks, and then every 24 weeks for 5 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Willing and able to give written informed consent Before any study procedures are performed, subjects (or their legally acceptable representatives) will have the details of the study described to them, and they will be given a written informed consent document to read; then, if subjects consent to participate in the study, they will indicate that consent by signing and dating the informed consent document in the presence of study personnel Histologically confirmed malignancy In Phase 1, histologically confirmed melanoma. In Phase 2, histologically confirmed melanoma, nonHodgkin lymphoma, or colorectal carcinoma Must have failed at least one systemic therapy or be intolerant to at least one prior systemic treatment Must have at least two lesions of evaluable size by modified World Health Organization (mWHO)/Cheson criteria; one of two lesions must be amenable to biopsy (core or fine needle aspirate) and intratumoral injection of up to 5ml (diameter &gt;= 10mm) Subjects with asymptomatic brain metastases are eligible; (systemic steroids should be avoided if possible, or the subject should be stable on the lowest clinically effective dose, as steroids as they may interfere with the activity of ipilimumab if administered at the time of the first ipilimumab dose) Must be at least 28 days since treatment with standard or investigational chemotherapy, biochemotherapy, surgery, radiation, cytokine therapy, or immunotherapy, and recovered from any clinically significant toxicity experienced during treatment Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2 Life expectancy of &gt;= 16 weeks Subjects must have baseline (screening/baseline) radiographic images, (e.g. brain, chest, abdomen, pelvis, and bone scans with specific imaging tests to be determined by the attending physician) within 6 weeks of initiation of ipilimumab White blood cell (WBC) &gt;= 2000/uL (~2 x 10^9/L) Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1000/uL (~0.5 x 10^9/L) Platelets &gt;= 75 x 10^3/uL (~75 x 10^9/L) Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/dL (may be transfused) Creatinine =&lt;
