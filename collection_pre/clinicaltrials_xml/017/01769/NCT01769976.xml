	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to examine whether periodic fasting improves markers of diabetes risk and cardiovascular health, and will compare this to the effects observed with daily dieting by energy restriction, and also with no change in energy intake. It is hypothesized that periodic fasting, with or without weight loss, will be as effective as daily energy restriction to improve markers of metabolic health and energy metabolism.</brief_summary>
