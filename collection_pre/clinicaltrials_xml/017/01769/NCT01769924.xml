	<brief_summary>Studies of patients with established kidney disease, even when this is mild, appear to show that they are at high risk of heart failure, stroke and sudden cardiac death. This may be because kidney disease causes stiffening of the arteries in the body which means that the heart and brain are damaged by high blood pressure. By studying patients before and after the removal of a kidney (uni-nephrectomy) for transplantation the investigators will find out for the first time in man the effect of an isolated reduction in kidney function on the structure and function of the cardiovascular system.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective UK Multicentre Study of Kidney Donors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>A donor group will be recruited from all patients undergoing donor nephrectomy. A contemporaneous control group will be recruited from clinics, advertisements within and outside the institutions and from any local volunteer databases. These will be the same for donors and controls. The current nationally set exclusion criteria for donors include age/glomerular filtration rate (GFR) cutoff, diabetes mellitus, any history of cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, evidence of hypertensive endorgan damage, known left ventricular dysfunction (including ejection fraction &lt; 40%) and atrial fibrillation.</criteria>
