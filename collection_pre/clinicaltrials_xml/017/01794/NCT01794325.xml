	<brief_summary>Transradial approach (TRA) reduces vascular complications and access related-bleeding compared to transfemoral approach (TFA). However, this technique has been related to higher radiation exposure during coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention. Previous studies have shown that TRA demands a long learning curve, and procedure success rate increases with operator's experience. Our hypothesis is that the higher radiation exposure during TRA is not a technique issue, but due to operator's expertise. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether experienced operators with either TRA or TFA can perform diagnostic coronary angiography with similar radiation exposure.</brief_summary>
