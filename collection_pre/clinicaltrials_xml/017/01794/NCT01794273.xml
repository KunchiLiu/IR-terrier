	<brief_summary>The effects on brain perfusion of the two currently vasopressors used to treat accidental hypotension occurring during carotid surgery (i.e. ephedrine and phenylephrine) is not known, but a disadvantage to use phenylephrine is suspected, due to its mechanism of action and according to published reports</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Compared Efficacy and Tolerance of Two Vasopressors Used to Treat Preoperative Hypotension During Carotid Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomised trial comparing ephedrine and phenylephrine as used for accidental hypotension occurring during carotid surgery, on cerebral perfusion, assessed by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).</detailed_description>
