	<brief_summary>When a patient receives a kidney transplant particularly if the kidney is from an older donor or one who has had the kidney removed after their heart has stopped, there is a risk that the newly transplanted kidney may not function immediately. If the delay in function means that dialysis is needed in the first 7 days after the transplantation then this is known as delayed graft function or dDGF. Also delayed graft function that does not require dialysis but is present because the serum creatinine does not fall sufficiently is known as functional delayed graft function or fDGF. This problem is often due to an excessive inflammatory reaction to not having had a blood supply between the time of donation and transplant. OPN-305 is a monoclonal antibody that blocks Toll-like Receptor 2 which is thought to be partly responsible for increasing the risk of this inflammation. It is hoped that the effects of the inflammation will be reduced and therefore prevent dDGF and fDGF from occurring. The purpose of the study is to explore how effective OPN-305 is in preventing dDGF and fDGF as well as improving other measures of kidney function and the overall safety of the antibody. In the first part of the study, each patient received an Infusion of one of three possible doses of OPN-305 or a placebo and in the second part the most suitable dose of OPN-305 and a placebo would be used. The purpose of this second part of the study is to find out if a dose of OPN-305 which has already been tested in an earlier part of this study can prevent kidney graft dysfunction. For the purposes of this study, kidney function will be assessed using the composite of delayed graft function (dDGF) because dialysis is necessary in the first 7 days and functional delayed graft function that does not require dialysis but is present because the serum creatinine, a key measure of renal function, does not fall sufficiently (fDGF) in the first 7 days post-transplant. Protocol OPN305-103 follows out to 12 months post-transplant the clinical status and graft function of patients who have completed the 6-month post-transplant period under Part A or Part B of OPN305-102.</brief_summary>
