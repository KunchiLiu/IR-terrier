	<brief_summary>Aim: To determine the effects of pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) in women with a single delivery route. Pregnancy and delivery route alter the pelvic floor muscle strength and are considered risk factors for urinary incontinence and genital dystopias. Methods: A Randomized controlled clinical trial with two hundred ninety-seven women aged 35 to 45 years old were selected for functional assessments of their pelvic floors by vaginal digital palpation and perineometry. One hundred sixty-five (69.7%) exhibited muscle strength deficits and were included in the clinical trial. The participants were distributed into two groups based on the delivery route (A, vaginal delivery and B, cesarean delivery) and were then randomly subdivided into Groups A1 (n = 44) and B1 (n = 42), who performed PFMT, and Groups A2 (n = 39) and B2 (n = 40), who did not undergo muscle training. The PFMT involved perineal contraction exercises in the dorsal decubitus, sitting, and standing positions and was applied twice per week for a total of 15 sessions. The functional assessment of pelvic floor by vaginal digital palpation and perineometry was performed after 15 sessions of pelvicÂ´s floor muscles training. The statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney and Z tests at a 5% level of significance.</brief_summary>
