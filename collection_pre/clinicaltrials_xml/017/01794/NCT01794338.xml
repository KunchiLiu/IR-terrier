	<brief_summary>This study evaluates the outcomes of patients who have been treated with Strattice or Gore Bio-A mesh for the repair of complicated abdominal wall hernias. The purpose of this study is to collect information and evaluate the outcome of your surgery. Synthetic (man made) mesh has been shown to provide durable long-term outcomes; however, this type of mesh should not be used in patients at risk of developing an infection. Therefore, to address the challenge of finding an artificial strengthening material to repair complicated hernias in patients that could potentially develop surgical infection, two types of non-permanent materials have been developed, including biologics and bioabsorbables. Biologic mesh is made of living tissue and bioabsorbable mesh is made of synthetic material that is gradually absorbed by the body over time. The purpose of this study is to allow surgeons to compare the postoperative course of patients associated with these two mesh types to decide which material will improve the outcomes of their patients with complicated abdominal wall defects. To date there is no evidence to suggest that either mesh type is superior or safer than the other.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use of Biologic Mesh vs Bioabsorbable Mesh During Ventral Hernia Repair in At-risk Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the outcomes of patients implanted with Strattice® (LifeCell Corporation, Branchburg, NJ, USA) and Gore® Bio-A® (W. L. Gore &amp; Associates, Inc., Newark, DE, USA) for the repair of abdominal wall defects in at-risk patients. Primary endpoints of the study will include hernia recurrence, duration of postoperative drains, the incidence of systemic and wound-related complications, the need for percutaneous intervention or reoperation and quality- of-life with 3 years of follow-up. The study will be prospective and randomized, and the evaluator and patient will be blinded as to the type of mesh implanted.</detailed_description>
