	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to verify if the periodic flush with normal saline 0.9% NaCl causes a longer or equal duration of patency of peripheral venous catheters, compared with heparin solution 50 U / ml flush, in children from 2 years to 14 years. Only 22 and 24 gauge catheters Will be included in the study.The study will assess in particular: - the difference of permanence in situ of the device - the difference in incidence of complications (in detail: obstruction, phlebitis, thrombocytopenia, systemic anticoagulation) - the difference in costs between use of saline normal saline 0.9% NaCl solution and heparinized 50 U / ml.</brief_summary>
