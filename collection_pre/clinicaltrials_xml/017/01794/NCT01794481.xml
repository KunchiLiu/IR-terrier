	<brief_title>Benefits of Exercise Training in Head and Neck Cancer Patients Undergoing Organ-Preserving Definitive Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer are treated with radiation therapy (with/without chemotherapy) to avoid large surgical procedures. However, definitive radiation treatments can cause side effects (like mouth sores, difficulty swallowing) that often cause weight loss. It has been shown that a significant percentage of the weight loss is due to loss of muscle mass. Resistance exercise training works to increase muscle strength and endurance by doing repetitive exercises with weights, weight machines, or resistance bands.</detailed_description>
