	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether ATIR is safe and effective in reducing transplant-related mortality and improving overall survival, when infused in patients with a hematologic malignancy following a T-cell depleted stem cell graft from a related haploidentical donor.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Donor T-lymphocytes Depleted ex Vivo of Host Alloreactive T-cells (ATIR) in Patients With a Hematologic Malignancy Who Received a Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation From a Haploidentical Donor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study CR-AIR-007 is an exploratory, open-label, multicenter study. After signing informed consent, patients will receive a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a related, haploidentical donor, followed by infusion with ATIR between 28 and 32 days after the HSCT (or later if required by the patient's medical condition). Patients will receive ATIR as a single infusion at a dose of 2x10E6 viable T-cells/kg. All patients treated with ATIR will be followed up until 12 months after the HSCT. Assessments will be performed at weekly visits from the day of ATIR infusion until 8 weeks after ATIR infusion, at monthly visits from 3 until 6 months after the HSCT, every 2 months from 6 until 12 months after the HSCT, and every 6 months from 12 until 24 months after the HSCT.</detailed_description>
