	<brief_summary>The effects of Valacyclovir (VAV) augmentation or placebo (PLA) as adjuncts to conventional antipsychotic drug treatment will be evaluated among patients with schizophrenia who have been exposed to herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Hypothesis: Valacyclovir (VAV) augmentation improves (a) cognitive and (b) overall function among Herpes Simples Virus 1 (HSV-1) exposed early course schizophrenia patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Valacyclovir Augmentation for Cognitive and Functional Remediation in Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design: We propose a randomized double blind placebo controlled study of patients with early course Schizophrenia (SZ) / schizoaffective disorder (SZA) patients exposed to HSV-1, who are receiving antipsychotic drugs. The effects of VAV augmentation or PLA as adjuncts to conventional antipsychotic drug treatment will be evaluated. As outcomes, we will evaluate clinical symptoms, cognitive variables, overall function (including social function) and side effects. The participants will be under the direct care of the Indian investigators during the study. Ratings will be performed blind by research staff. We will pre-screen for HSV-1 exposure. There will be a 2 week placebo run in phase, 16 week augmentation and 4 week follow up to identify post-treatment side effects.</detailed_description>
