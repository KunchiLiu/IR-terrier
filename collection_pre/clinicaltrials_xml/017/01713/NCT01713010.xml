	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate physiological variables to the decision about the appropriate time to discontinuation of mechanical ventilation in patients with traumatic brain injury. It is expected that these variables are effective in predicting the outcome of weaning from mechanical ventilation.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of integrated pressure index of airway occlusion x index breathing fast and shallow (p 0.1 x f/VT) in predicting success and failure of weaning from mechanical ventilation in patients with traumatic brain injury.</detailed_description>
