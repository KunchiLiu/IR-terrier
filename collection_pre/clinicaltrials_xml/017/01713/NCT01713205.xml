	<brief_title>Prediction Study of Complications After Severe Trauma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trauma is a major public health problem worldwide, ranking as the fourth leading cause of death. One of the most serious complications of major trauma is sepsis, which often induces sequential multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). There were still no specific biomarkers to predict the susceptibility of complications and outcomes, which leading to the limited prevention methods and the high mortality rate of severe trauma patients. Previous studies from our and other group have found some sepsis and MODS predictors, including genetic polymorphisms, serum cytokines and cell-surface markers. The purposes of this multi-center observational study is to select biomarkers and evaluate a clinically and economically most effective diagnostic algorithm for prediction of complications in severe trauma patients.</detailed_description>
