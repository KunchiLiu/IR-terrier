	<brief_summary>To determine whether treatment with ustekinumab will alter the ratio of T Regulatory Cell (Treg)/total cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ cells in peripheral blood at day 30 post-hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tacrolimus, Sirolimus and Ustekinumab vs. Tacrolimus and Sirolimus for the Prevention of Acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a comparative study to assess the biologic and clinical activity of the agent ustekinumab when given in concert with our established regimen of SIR/TAC. Patients will be randomly assigned between the standard regimen of tacrolimus/sirolimus (TAC/SIR + placebo) vs. the investigational regimen of tacrolimus/sirolimus/ustekinumab (TAC/SIR/U) in a 1:1 scheme.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Hematologic disorder requiring allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation Adequate vital organ function: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt;/= 45% by multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan FEV1, FVC, and diffusing lung capacity oxygenation (DLCO) &gt;/= 50% of predicted values on pulmonary function tests Transaminases (AST, ALT) &lt; 3 times upper limit of normal values Creatinine clearance &gt;/= 50 cc/min. Performance status: Karnofsky Performance Status Score &gt;/= 60%. Active infection not controlled with appropriate antimicrobial therapy HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C infection Sorror's comorbidity factors with total score &gt; 3 Important modification to comorbidity index calculation: DLCO will not be included in assessment of pulmonary risk, excepting those with DLCO &lt; 50%, who will merit a score of 3 and thereby be excluded from the trial. Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) as part of the conditioning regimen Cyclophosphamide as part of the conditioning regimens</criteria>
