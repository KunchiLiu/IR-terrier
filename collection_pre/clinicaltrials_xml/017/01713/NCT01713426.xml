	<brief_summary>This study is comparing the efficacy and tolerability of Qutenza with that of pregabalin in patients suffering from peripheral neuropathic pain. Treatment allocation will be to one of these treatments and the duration of the study will be about 10 weeks (assuming that from screening to treatment allocation takes 2 weeks). Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires about various aspects relating to their condition throughout the study. This study will include subjects suffering from Postherpetic Neuralgia, Peripheral Nerve Injury or Non Diabetic peripheral polyneuropathy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Documented diagnosis of probable or definite PNP 2. Localized and welldefined area of PNP, suitable for treatment with QUTENZA 3. Documented diagnosis at the Baseline Visit of either: Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) with pain persisting at least 6 months since shingles vesicle crusting Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) including postsurgical or posttraumatic neuropathic pain, persisting for a minimum of 3 months Nondiabetic painful peripheral polyneuropathy with pain which has persisted for a minimum of 3 months, including (i) smallfiber neuropathy, as confirmed by quantitative sensory testing (QST), laser evoked potentials (LEP) or skin biopsy, (ii) chemotherapy induced neuropathy in subjects with stable neoplastic disease, (iii) other, adequately characterized painful peripheral polyneuropathy, based on clinical history and examination 4. Average pain score ≥4 during Screening Period, over a minimum of at least 4 consecutive days (using the "average pain for the past 24 hours" Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) score 5. Intact, nonirritated, dry skin over the painful area(s) to be treated 6. Is either: Naïve to treatment with pregabalin and gabapentin, OR In the opinion of the investigator, has not received an adequate trial of treatment with pregabalin or gabapentin 7. Subject is willing to receive pregabalin or QUTENZA as part of the trial 8. Females of child bearing potential must be willing to use highly effective methods of birth control during the study and for 30 days following study termination 1. Significant ongoing or recurrent pain of etiology other than PHN, PNI or nondiabetic painful peripheral polyneuropathy, for example: compressionrelated neuropathies (e.g. spinal stenosis), radiculopathy, tumorrelated pain, fibromyalgia or arthritis 2. Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS, Type I or II) 3. Neuropathic pain related to previously administered radiotherapy, diabetes mellitus or HIVAN 4. Neuropathic pain areas located only on the face, above the hairline of the scalp, and/or in proximity to mucous membranes 5. Severe loss of heat sensation in the painful area, indicative of Cfiber denervation 6. Reported daily pain score of 10 on the NPRS for at least 4 days during the Screening Period 7. Past or current history of diabetes mellitus 8. Unstable or poorly controlled hypertension or a recent history of a cardiovascular event which, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the subject at risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions related to the patch application procedure 9. Creatinine clearance (CLcr) &lt; 60mL/min according to the CockcroftGault formula 10. Untreated ongoing generalized anxiety disorder according to DSMIV or ICD10 criteria 11. Severe ongoing depression according to DSMIV or ICD10 criteria 12. Evidence of cognitive impairment including dementia that may interfere with subject's ability to complete study evaluations and recall pain levels in the past 24 hours 13. Planned elective surgery during the trial 14. Changes to stable neuropathic pain background medication in the 4 weeks prior to the Baseline Visit 15. Any prior receipt of QUTENZA patches, including blinded patches administered as part of a clinical trial 16. Hypersensitivity to capsaicin (i.e., chilli peppers or Overthecounter [OTC] capsaicin products), any QUTENZA excipients, local anesthetics, or adhesives 17. Treatment with pregabalin or gabapentin within 2 months prior to the Baseline Visit 18. Hypersensitivity to pregabalin or any of the excipients 19. Use of opioids exceeding a total daily dose of morphine of 200 mg/day, or equivalent; or any intravenous opioids or tapentadol, regardless of dose, within 7 days preceding the Baseline Visit 20. Use of any topical pain medication, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, menthol, methyl salicylate, local anesthetics (including patch containing lidocaine), steroids or capsaicin products on the painful areas to be treated within 7 days preceding the Baseline Visit 21. Chemotherapy within 3 months of the Baseline Visit, except maintenance hormone treatment 22. Use of any investigational agent within 30 days prior to Baseline Visit 23. Active substance abuse or history of chronic substance abuse within 1 year prior to screening; or any prior chronic substance abuse (including alcoholism) likely to reoccur during the study period as judged by the investigator 24. Female subjects of childbearing potential with a positive serum or urine pregnancy test prior to treatment</criteria>
