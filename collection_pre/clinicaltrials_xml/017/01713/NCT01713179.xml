	<brief_summary>Ambroxol is a metabolite of bromhexine and possesses mucokinetic and secretolytic properties that are also found in mucolytic agents.1 Ambroxol has been used for decades for the treatment of respiratory disorders associated with excessive mucus, including chronic inflammatory pulmonary conditions, bronchitis, and pneumonia.2,3 The drug changes the biophysical properties of secretions by degrading the mucin polymers, deoxyribonucleic acid, fibrin in airway secretions, and by generally decreasing viscosity.4 In addition, ambroxol increases cyclic nucleotide (cAMP or cGMP),5 which can theoretically increase tear secretion.6 Many systemic medications, such as antihistamines, antidepressants, diuretics, acne drugs, and certain blood pressure medicines can cause or exacerbate a dry eye.7,8 On the other hand, several topical medications, including mucolytics such as ambroxol and bromhexine, may be used to treat tear-deficient dry eyes by promoting lacrimal gland function.9 However, the effects of mucoactive agents on the tear film have not been investigated systemically, and mucoactive agents may have a disturbing effect on the tear film because they modify mucin.10,11 The tear film is composed of 3 unique layers, including the outermost lipid layer, the middle aqueous layer, and the innermost mucus layer; this structure enables it to perform many functions.12 The lipid layer acts as a barrier to prevent tear film evaporation, and the aqueous layer supplies oxygen and important nutrients to the cornea.13 The mucin layer, secreted mostly by conjunctival goblet cells, coats the corneal surface rendering it hydrophilic, and anchors the tear film to the corneal surface.14 Deficiencies in the amount of tear production or alteration in tear composition can lead to ocular surface disease.15 Although many studies have focused on aqueous-deficient dry eye syndrome,16-18 the effect of mucin layer defects on the tear film has not been thoroughly studied. Furthermore, very few reports have determined the effects of oral mucolytic agents on the tear film and ocular surfaces, although a study has reported that filamentary keratopathy was treated with debridement of filaments and application of topical mucolytic agents such as acetylcysteine eyedrops. In the present study, we investigated the effects of oral ambroxol on tear film and ocular surface. Reference 1. Malerba M, Ragnoli B.
