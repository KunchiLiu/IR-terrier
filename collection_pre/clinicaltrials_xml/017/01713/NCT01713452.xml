	<brief_summary>Stoma closure has been associated with a high rate of surgical site infection (SSI). The rate for SSI following stoma closure has been noted to be 7-41%; a rate that is higher than expected for a clean-contaminated operative classification. The ideal stoma site closure technique is still debated in the current literature. The aim of this study was to compare the rate of SSI following two different stoma closure techniques, primary closure versus a skin approximating purse string closure, in a multi-center randomized controlled trial. The investigators hypothesize that purse string closure technique will have a lower rate of SSI than primary closure technique.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial of Ostomy Closure Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will randomize ileostomy takedown patients to either a primary closure or purse string closure technique intraoperatively. Surgeons at both the University of Minnesota and the CHUV hospital in Switzerland will participate in the this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects eligible are those with either a colostomy or ileostomy (end or loop) who are deemed by their surgeon to be appropriate candidates for ostomy closure. There will be no limitations based upon initial indication for formation of the ostomy. Indications for initial ostomy formation for fecal diversion can include: infection (e.g. diverticulitis) and protection of an anastomosis. (following resection for inflammatory bowel disease, benign diseases, or cancer) Subjects will be excluded from the study if: 1. The stoma site is left open to heal by secondary intention due to gross contamination (surgeon discretion) 2. The stoma site is reused (i.e. the same stoma site used for the formation of a new ostomy) 3. A new stoma is created at a different site.</criteria>
