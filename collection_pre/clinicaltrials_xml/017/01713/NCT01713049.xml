	<brief_title>18F-FLT PET for Suspicious Findings on Mammography and Breast Ultrasound</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. To investigate the diagnostic accuracy of 18F-FLT PET for the suspicious lesions on mammograms and ultrasound, using the pathologic result of biopsy as gold standard, and to determine whether 18F-FLT PET can increase the specificity in breast lesion diagnosis and thus reduce the unnecessary biopsy. 2. To evaluate whether 18F-FLT PET is a cost-effective imaging modality for breast cancer diagnosis.</detailed_description>
