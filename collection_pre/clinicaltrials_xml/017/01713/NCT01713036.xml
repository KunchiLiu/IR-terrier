	<criteria>Male subject with pathologically confirmed solid tumor preferentially including, but not limited to pancreatic, thyroid, colorectal, lung, and renal cancer, or melanoma which is locally advanced or metastatic, and either refractory to the respective standard therapy for the disease or for which no effective standard therapy is available Subject has measurable and evaluable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v.1.1) Age greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or equal to 65 years Body mass index greater than or equal to 19 and less than or equal to 30 kilogram per meter square (kg/m^2) Subject has Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) of less than or equal to 1 Male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate method of contraception during and for 4 weeks after the last dose of the trial medication. During this time, female partners should use a contraceptive method with a failure rate of less than 1 percent Subject has read and understood the informed consent form and is willing and able to give written informed consent before any trial related procedures are performed Bone marrow impairment as evidenced by hemoglobin less than 10.0 gram per deciliter (g/dL), neutrophil count less than 1.5 * 10^9 per liter (/L), and/or platelets less than 100 * 10^9/L Renal impairment as evidenced by serum creatinine greater than 1.5 * upper limit of normal (ULN) and calculated creatinine clearance less than 60 milliliter per minute (mL/min) (Cockcroft Gault formula) Liver function and liver cell integrity abnormality as defined by total bilirubin greater than 1.5 * ULN, or aspartate transaminase (AST)/alanine transaminase (ALT) greater than 2.5 * ULN, for subjects with liver metastases AST/ALT greater than 5 * ULN Primary brain tumors or clinical evidence of active brain metastasis. Subjects with a history of previously treated brain tumor are eligible provided that 1 month following treatment they were stable by computed tomography (CT) scan without evidence of cerebral edema, and have no requirements for anticonvulsants or high doses of corticosteroids History of gastrointestinal disease, malabsorption syndrome or difficulty in swallowing, which in the investigator's opinion might impair the absorption of pimasertib Any gastric, small or large bowel surgery that may impact the absorption of pimasertib Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positivity, active hepatitis Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, or molecular targeted cancer therapy within the past 4 weeks or within 5 halflives of the given drug, whatever is longer, prior to start of trial medication or concomitantly within this trial. This restriction does not apply to steroids and bisphosphonates Major surgical procedure within the last 8 weeks prior to start of trial medication History of uveitis and scleritis. Retinal pathology beyond normal agerelated processes History of glaucoma. Subjects are excluded if intraocular pressure is above 21 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) Evidence of a retinal vein occlusion (RVO) on fluorescein angiogram or a history of RVO. Subjects are also excluded if on examination an ophthalmologist finds that their optic disc is at risk for a central RVO Life expectancy of less than 12 weeks Clinically relevant nonmalignant disease which in the investigator's opinion would exclude the subject from the trial, such as significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, endocrine, renal and neurological disease or psychiatric disorder Treatment with strong inhibitors and/or inducers of cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) and cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Consumption of CYP3A4 enzyme inducing or inhibiting herbal drugs, fruit juices and beverages (example, grapefruit, grapefruit juice, quinine [tonic water], star fruit, St John's Wort) within 2 weeks prior to start of trial medication until the end of Day 21 Participation in a drug trial within 30 days prior to start of trial medication. Participation in a trial involving administration of [14C] labeled compound(s) within last 6 months prior to start of trial medication Known hypersensitivity to any of the excipients used Inability to understand the protocol requirements, instructions and trialrelated restrictions, the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the trial Legal incapacity or limited legal capacity</criteria>
