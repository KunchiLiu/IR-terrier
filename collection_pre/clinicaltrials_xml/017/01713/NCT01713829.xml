	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which consuming a cranberry beverage modifies immune function, specifically related to γδ T cells and other innate immune cells. It is hypothesized that cranberry components will interact with immune cells to activate signaling pathways that enhance cell function. Enhanced immune cell function should result in reduced number, duration, and severity of cold and flu symptoms.</brief_summary>
