	<brief_summary>The Oxymizer pendant速 is a special oxygen cannula that can be used to supply high flow long term oxygen therapy. It is compatible with a wide variety of oxygen sources. In a reservoir, the Oxymizer速 stores pure oxygen so that the concentration of inhaled oxygen is increased. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential benefit of the Oxymizer速 with regard to the blood oxygenation during exercise testing. Given that the "endurance time" is very sensitive for little changes in exercise capacity, this test will be used to show the difference between the Oxymizer速 and a conventional nasal cannula regarding exercise duration at 70% of peak Watt and oxygenation. The tests will be accompanied by blood gas analysis, partial pressure of carbon dioxide and heart rate.</brief_summary>
