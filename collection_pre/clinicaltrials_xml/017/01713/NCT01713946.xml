	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of two trough-ranges of everolimus given as adjunctive therapy in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) who have refractory partial-onset seizures. The study consists of 4 phases for each patient [Baseline phase: From Screening Week -8 (V1) to randomization visit at Week 0 (V2)], Core phase, from randomization at Week 0 (V2) to Week 18 (V11)], Extension phase from Week 18 (V11) until 48 weeks after the last patient has completed the core phase, and Post Extension Phase [after the end of the Extension phase until August 31, 2017].</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Male or female between the ages of 2 and 65 years (except in Europe where minimum age will be 1). 2. Clinically definite diagnosis of TSC per modified Gomez criteria 3. Diagnosis of partialonset epilepsy according to the classification of the International League Against Epilepsy (1989) and revised in 2009. 4. Uncontrolled partialonset seizures; must meet the following: 1. At least 16 reported quantifiable partialonset seizures over the Baseline period with no continuous 21day seizurefree period between Visit 1 (Screening Visit) and Visit 2 (Randomization visit), as per data captured in daily seizure diaries. 2. Prior history of failure to control partialonset seizures despite having been treated with two or more sequential regimens of single or combined antiepileptic drugs. 3. Prior or concurrent use of vagal nerve stimulator (VNS) is allowed. If the patient is using VNS, device stimulator parameters must remain constant throughout the study. 4. Prior epilepsy surgery is allowed if performed at least 12 months before study entry. 5. Must be receiving one, two, or three AEDs at a stable dose for at least 4 weeks at the start of the 8week prospective Baseline phase, remain on the same regimen throughout the Baseline phase, and intend to continue the same regimen throughout the 18week double blind Core phase (rescue medications are permitted). 6. If female of child bearing potential, documentation of negative pregnancy test at time of informed consent and must use highly effective contraception during the study and for 8 weeks after stopping treatment 7. Sexually active males must use a condom during intercourse while taking study drug, and for 8 weeks after stopping study treatment 8. Hepatic, renal and blood laboratory values within the following range at screening : 1. AST and ALT levels &lt; 2.5 x ULN 2. serum bilirubin &lt;1.5 × ULN (this limit does not apply to patients with an elevated indirect bilirubin, if they have Gilbert's Syndrome), 3. serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN 4. hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL 5. platelets ≥ 80,000/mm3 6. absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/mm3 9. Written informed consent. Subjects or their legal guardians must have the ability to comprehend the informed consent form and be willing to provide informed consent. 10. Patient or caregiver must be able to reliably record seizures and keep a daily diary and recall adverse events. 1. Patients with seizures secondary to metabolic, toxic, infectious or psychogenic disorder or drug abuse or current seizures related to an acute medical illness. 2. Presence of only nonmotor partial seizures (NOT APPLICABLE per Amendment 2) 3. Patients with TSC who have SEGA in need of immediate surgical intervention. 4. Patients under 2 years of age with untreated infantile spasms. 5. Within 52 weeks prior to study entry, an episode of status epilepticus as defined in the protocol. 6. Patients with history of seizure clusters (where individual seizures cannot be accurately counted according to the judgment of the investigator) occurring within 26 weeks prior to study entry. 7. Patients who require rescue medication during the baseline phase for more than 6 days 8. Patients with nonTSC related progressive encephalopathy. 9. Patients who weigh less than 12 kg. 10. Patients with coexisting malignancies within the 3 years prior to randomization, except for adequately treated carcinoma of the cervix or basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. 11. Patients with any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions at randomization such as: 1. Symptomatic congestive heart failure of New York Heart Association Class III or IV, history of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 50%, QTc interval &gt;460ms, congenital QT syndrome, unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within 6 months of study entry, serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia or any other clinically significant cardiac disease. 2. Significant symptomatic deterioration of lung function 3. Impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may significantly alter the absorption of everolimus (e.g., ulcerative disease, malabsorption syndrome or small bowel resection). 4. liver disease such as cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, and chronic hepatitis 5. Uncontrolled diabetes as defined by fasting serum glucose &gt; 1.5 × ULN. 6. Active skin, mucosa, ocular or GI disorders of Grade &gt; 1. 7. Active (acute or chronic) or uncontrolled severe infections. 8. A known history of HIV seropositivity or other active viral infections. 12. Patients with an active, bleeding diathesis. 13. Patient with uncontrolled hyperlipidemia: fasting serum cholesterol &gt; 300 mg/dL OR &gt;7.75 mmol/L AND fasting triglycerides &gt; 2.5 x ULN. 14. Patients who have had a major surgery or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks of study entry. 15. Patients with a prior history of organ transplant. 16. Patients receiving more than 3 antiepileptic drugs at any time in the baseline phase or at randomization or who change the dose of the AEDs during 4 weeks before screening or during the baseline period. 17. Patients being treated with felbamate, unless treatment has been continuous for ≥ 1 year. 18. Patients currently receiving anticancer therapies or who have received anticancer therapies within 4 weeks of study entry (including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, antibody based therapy, etc.). 19.
