	<brief_summary>This trial is conducted in Africa, Europe and the United States of America (USA). The aim of the trial is to compare the difference in change in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) between insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) and/or oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs) and insulin degludec (IDeg) plus insulin aspart (IAsp)and/or OADs.</brief_summary>
