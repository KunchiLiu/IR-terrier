	<brief_summary>To understand if Multiple Daily Injections (MDI) managed subjects can improve glycaemic control by; 1. regularly checking and understanding Continuous Glucose data &amp; trend arrows at times other than the standard pre-meal bolus calculation test times and 2. review of their glucose profiles (inc. hypoglycaemic risks) with their Health Care Professional (HCP) and adjusting behaviours &amp; therapy from interpretation of the Continuous Glucose profiles.</brief_summary>
