	<brief_summary>This study aims to examine long term effects in the training gain stage of the falls management exercise programs (FaME, from Skelton and Dinan) over 10 weeks on physical functional performance after mechanical SR-WBV, dance therapy and strength training intervention in a frail elderly population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Innovative Training Methods for Frail Elderly in the Training Gain Stage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is based on the guideline of falls management exercise programs (FaME; from Skelton and Dinan). The goals: Skilling up: improvement in neuromuscular control, postural control and strengthening of large muscle groups of the lower extremity. Training Gain: improvement of functional abilities. Maintaining the Gains: muscle growth, improvement of bone density and multi-sensory exercises. First, a pilot study was conducted with untrained elderly ("Effects of stochastic resonance therapy on postural control in the elderly population" (KEK Bern: No.228/09, Clinical Trial Registry: NCT01045746). Following, a second pilot study was conducted with frail elderly (Application of Whole-body Vibration With Stochastic Resonance in Frail Elderly: The Effects on Postural Control Clinical Trial Registry: NCT01543243). It was found that the selected chosen form of recruitment (presentation and advertisement) and the measurements methods are suitable for untrained elderly. But for frail elderly the chosen form of recruitment and the measurement methods are not sufficient. For this study, adapted measurement parameters for balance, strength and cognition will be used. The goals of this study: Evaluate the effects of - functional lower extremity - dynamic balance - reaction time - mobility - muscle strength and cognition. This is a one-group pre-post design study and the participants will be recruited in Canton Bern - Switzerland.</detailed_description>
