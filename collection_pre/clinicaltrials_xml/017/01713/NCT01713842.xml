	<brief_summary>Phase 1: Patients are treated with infusions of Tocilizumab (TCZ) for 3 months. Clinical evaluation is performed using PMR-AS. The PMR-AS is computed by summing the 5 variables after multiplying by 0.1 for weighting purposes: PMR-AS (activity scale = AS) = C reactive protein (CRP) (mg/dl) + patient scale (VASp) (0-10 scale) + physician scale (VASph) (0-10 scale) + morning stiffness(MST) [min]×0.1) + elevation of upper limbs (EUL) (0-3 scale). At the end of the phase 1,the patients stop TCZ and entered in phase 2 at week 12. Phase 2: All the patients are included in the phase 2 and treated with glucocorticoid (GC)for 3 months. Two arms are possible according to the PMR-AS. Either the classical GC treatment (0.3mg/kg), either a low dose group of GC(0.15mg/kg) .</brief_summary>
