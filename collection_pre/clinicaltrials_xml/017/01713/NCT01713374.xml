	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether interventions aimed at increasing sympathetic tone modify endothelial function measures as assessed by the measurement of flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and constriction (FMC). The investigators hypothesize that the three interventions under study will increase FMC while causing a blunting in FMD. Further, the investigators plan to study the circadian variability of FMC and FMD. The investigators hypothesize a peak of FMD in the late hours of the day and a peak of FMC in the early hours.</brief_summary>
