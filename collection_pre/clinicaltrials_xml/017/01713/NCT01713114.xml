	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to assess the acute effects of different meals on satiety. It is hypothesized that a lower carbohydrate meal will result in greater feelings of satiety and reduced food intake at a subsequent meal compared to the higher-carbohydrate or meal skipping conditions.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of a Variety of Meals on Satiety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Satiety refers to feelings of fullness or lack of desire to eat following consumption of a food or meal. A number of dietary factors have been shown to influence satiety, including food volume, food weight, energy density, food palatability, and certain food ingredients. The nutritional composition of a meal appears to also play a significant role in an individual's feelings of satiety and ability to stay full until the next meal.</detailed_description>
