	<brief_summary>Persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have swings in their blood sugar levels that may lead to a higher risk of developing heart disease. An important part of diabetes management involves eating a diet to prevent large swings in blood sugar levels. Walnuts contain fat, protein and fiber that may reduce the swings in blood sugar. The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of a walnut-free American Diabetes Association (ADA) diet versus 2 levels of walnut-enriched ADA diets on blood sugar swings. Eighteen male and female adults with T2DM will participate in the study. Subjects will be randomized to consume an ADA diet with or without walnuts for 3 consecutive days every other week. Subjects must test their blood sugar twice daily and wear a continuous glucose monitor during the three 72-hour study periods. Subjects will be between 40 and 70 years of age and will be recruited from the surrounding community using flyers and public service announcements. Consent will take place in the Department of Nutrition at Loma Linda University by the study investigators. In total, subject participation will last 5 weeks and all meals will be provided during the 3 study periods.</brief_summary>
