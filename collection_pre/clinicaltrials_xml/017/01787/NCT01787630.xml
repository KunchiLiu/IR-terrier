	<brief_summary>The dominating problem after local radiotherapy of prostate cancer is rectal toxicity. If the rectum could be completely moved out of the treated volume, a substantial decrease of rectal toxicity seems reasonable. In this study we will develop and evaluate a new transrectal injection technique where hyaluronic acid (HA) is injected in the space between the prostate and the rectum prior to external beam radiotherapy to increase the physical distance between prostate and rectum.</brief_summary>
