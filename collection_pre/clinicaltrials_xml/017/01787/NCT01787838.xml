	<brief_summary>The purpose of this quality improvement project is to improve the immunization rates of an at-risk adult population seen in an ambulatory healthcare environment, through the use of targeted health education messages regarding pneumococcal immunization. Patients seen in an out-patient pre-surgical testing center will receive 1) a one-page written information sheet that outlines the benefits of pneumococcal immunization and 2) verbal reinforcement of this message, provided by the clinical staff, during the patient's interview. At-risk adult patients (as defined by Centers for Disease Control) seen in an ambulatory healthcare environment (a pre-surgical testing center) will receive a one page, "gain-framed" message that emphasizes the benefits of pneumococcal vaccinations. This educational material will be reviewed and reinforced by clinical staff during the assessment phase of the clinical visit. Among this group, there will be increased vaccination rate compared with at-risk adult patients who did not receive this communication (prospective vs retrospective data).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this project was to improve the immunization rates of an at-risk adult population seen in an ambulatory environment, through the use of targeted and evidence-based health education messages regarding pneumococcal immunization and staff training on the use of gain-framed messaging. We hypothesized that there would be an increase in immunization rates for at-risk adults following implementation of the intervention. The objective of the project was to increase our local immunization rate by 30% (from 20% to 50%) and to provide tools and processes that can be utilized in other ambulatory healthcare settings.</detailed_description>
