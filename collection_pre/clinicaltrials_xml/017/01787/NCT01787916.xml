	<brief_summary>To our knowledge, no trial has specifically studied the effect of liraglutide combined with a basal/bolus insulin regimen in type 1 diabetes in a cross-over, double-blind, unicentric model. Moreover, the potential impact of a glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist on measures of abdominal fat (assessed by CT scan), insulin sensitivity (assessed by the gold standard euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp) and satiety sensations have not been evaluated in this population. Hypothesis Overweight participants with type 1 diabetes on liraglutide/insulin treatment will present improved glucose control with decreased HbA1c, decreased fasting and mean weekly glucose concentrations and glycemic excursions as well as increased insulin sensitivity compared to participants on placebo/insulin treatment. Participants with liraglutide/insulin treatment will also present improved endothelial function, lower body weight, central adipose tissue assessed by CT scan and higher satiety sensations assessed by visual analogue scales.</brief_summary>
