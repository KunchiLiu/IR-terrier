	<brief_summary>The specific aim of the study is to test the following hypothesis: That switching between treatments from bevacizumab to Ozurdex or vice versa in eyes with diabetic macular oedema with no or incomplete response from one therapy is beneficial.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Eyes Previously Treated with bevacizumab: 1. Diabetic macular oedema affecting the fovea that has persisted despite ongoing, monthly intravitreal injections of bevacizumab over at least 6 months, the last being 2 to 3 months prior to the screening visit. 2. There must be an historical OCT available from 14 weeks after the last bevacizumab injection with retinal thickness &gt; 300 microns in the central 1mm subfield on Spectral domain OCT to show the lack of complete response to bevacizumab. 3. At screening, the bevacizumab treated eye must have DMO with retinal thickness &gt; 300 microns in the central 1mm subfield on Spectral domain OCT Eyes Previously Treated with dexamethasone: 4. Diabetic macular oedema affecting the fovea that has persisted despite two dexamethasone implants 5 or fewer months apart, the last being 58 months prior to the screening visit. 5. There must be an historical OCT available from 814 weeks after the last dexamethasone implant with retinal thickness &gt; 300 microns in the central 1mm subfield on Spectral domain OCT to show the lack of complete response to the dexamethasone implant. 6. At screening, the dexamethasone treated eye must have DMO with retinal thickness &gt; 300 microns in central 1mm subfield on Spectral domain OCT 7. Age &gt;= 18 years 8. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus 9. Best corrected visual acuity of 2078 letters (approx 6/120 6/7.5) 10. Previous macular laser treatment, or the investigator believes laser treatment is unlikely to be helpful 11. Intraocular pressure &lt;22mmHg 12. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at the screening visit and prior to treatment. A woman is considered of childbearing potential unless she is postmenopausal and without menses for 12 months or is surgically sterilised 13. Written informed consent has been obtained. Treatment with intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA) within the last 6 months or peribulbar TA within the last 3 months, or anti vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs: ranibizumab and aflibercept, within the last 2 months. Cataract surgery within the last 3 months Retinal laser treatment within the last 3 months For eyes to be switched to Dexamethasone: Patient considered, at the judgement of the investigator, to be atrisk for syphilis, tuberculosis or other potentially infective chorioretinopathies. Patients considered atrisk may be assessed at the investigators discretion to reasonably exclude these conditions. Should these conditions be excluded, the patient may be considered for enrolment.</criteria>
