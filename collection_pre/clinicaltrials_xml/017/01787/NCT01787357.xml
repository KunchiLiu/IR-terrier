	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) on electrocardiogram results (recordings of the electrical activity of the heart) in healthy volunteers after a single therapeutic dose (300 mg) and a single supra-therapeutic dose (4 times higher [1,200 mg] than the anticipated therapeutic dose of 300 mg). The safety and tolerability of canagliflozin will also be assessed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Assess Electrocardiogram Results in Healthy Volunteers Receiving Canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be a randomized (the treatment is assigned by chance), single-center, double-blind (neither investigator nor volunteer knows the identity of the assigned treatment), double-dummy (a technique for retaining the blinded nature of the study when the treatments do not look identical), placebo-controlled (one of the treatments is inactive), positive-controlled (one of the treatments has a known potential effect on electrocardiogram results), four-way cross-over study (all volunteers will receive each of the 4 treatments but in a different order) to assess the effect of canagliflozin (a drug currently being investigated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus) on electrocardiogram results in healthy volunteers. The study will consist of 3 phases: a screening phase, a double-blind treatment phase, and an end-of study (or follow-up) phase. Volunteers will be assigned to 1 of 4 treatment sequence groups (ADBC, DABC, BCDA, or CDAB). The treatment sequence will be decided by randomization. Treatment A will be a single dose of 300 mg of canagliflozin. Treatment B will be a single dose of 1,200 mg of canagliflozin. Treatment C will be a single dose of placebo (inactive medication). Treatment D will be a single dose of 400 mg of moxifloxacin (an antibiotic with known potential to affect electrocardiogram results). Each treatment will be given during a treatment period of 2 days duration; each treatment period will be separated by a washout period (when no medication is given) of 10 to 14 days. Each volunteer will participate in the study for approximately 61 days.</detailed_description>
