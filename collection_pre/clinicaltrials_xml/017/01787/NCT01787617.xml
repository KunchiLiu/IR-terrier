	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of an exercise training intervention on the ability of African American males to use insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that helps the body use glucose.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aerobic Plus Resistance Training and Insulin Sensitivity in African American Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed to assess the effect of exercise training on insulin resistance in African American males. African American males have higher rates of diabetes and lower levels of fitness when compared to Caucasian males. A project such as this is necessary because there is evidence to show that exercise training can reduce the risk of developing diabetes, though no studies have been conducted in African American males. In addition, ARTIIS will test the effect adhering to the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity and 2 days of 20 minutes of muscular strength activity), on insulin resistance in African American men. This study will provide important information that can either strengthen or refine current physical activity recommendations. Furthermore, this intervention will be delivered through community facilities in order to increase the likelihood that the intervention will be sustainable.</detailed_description>
