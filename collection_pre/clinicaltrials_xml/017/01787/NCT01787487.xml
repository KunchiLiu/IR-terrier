	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of ruxolitinib and azacytidine can help to control myelofibrosis and myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm. Ruxolitinib is designed to block a pathway that has been found to be overactive in human cancers and myelofibrosis. Azacytidine is designed to block certain proteins in cancer cells that stop the function of the tumor-fighting proteins. By blocking the "bad" proteins, the tumor-fighting genes may be able to work better.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Ruxolitinib And Azacytidine Combination as a Therapy For Patients With Myelofibrosis And Myelodysplastic Syndrome/ Myeloproliferative Neoplasm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Treatment: A. For patients with myelofibrosis or myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take ruxolitinib 2 times every day by mouth. If you miss or vomit your dose of ruxolitinib, do not make up the dose. Beginning with Cycle 4, on Days 1-5 (+/-6 days), you will receive azacytidine either under the skin or through a needle in your vein. Your dose of ruxolitinib and/or azacytidine may be raised, lowered, and/or delayed if the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will be given a drug diary and asked to write down what time you take the study drugs. Bring in any unused study drugs and bottles to each study visit during the first 15 cycles of treatment. Each cycle is 28 days. Study Visits: Each study visit may be performed at +/- 7 days than the day stated. On Day 1 of Cycles 1-7, 9,12 and then every 3 cycles (+/- 1 Month) starting with cycle 15 all patients in both arms (including myelofibrosis or myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative will be evaluated as follows: - You will be asked if you have had any side effects. - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight. - Your complete medical history will be recorded. - Your transfusion history will be collected. - Your spleen and liver will be measured. - You will complete 2 questionnaires about how you are feeling. After 2 years of protocol treatment, this schedule may be adjusted to every 3 to 6 cycles. Patients with myelofibrosis or myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm will have blood draws once a week during Cycles 1 to 6 and then 1 time each month after that. Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. After Cycles 6 and 12, you will have a bone marrow aspiration to check the status of the disease. Routine blood draws and bone marrow biopsies may be done more or less often if the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. Research Blood Tests: Extra blood will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing and pharmacodynamic (PD). PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points. PD testing measures how the level of study drug in your body may affect the disease. Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for PK testing: - On Day 1 of Cycle 1, before you receive the study drug, and then 1, 2, and 5 hours later - On Day 1 of Cycle 6, before you receive the study drug, and then 1, 2, and 5 hours later - On Day 1 of Cycle 12 (or at the end of study if you go off study early), before you receive the study drug, and then 1, 2, and 5 hours later Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for PD testing: - On Day 1 of Cycle 1, before you receive the study drug and then 2 hours later - On Day 1 of Cycle 3, before you receive the study drug - On Day 1 of Cycle 6, before you receive the study drug and then 2 hours later - On Day 1 of Cycle 9, before you receive the study drug - On Day 1 of Cycle 12 (or at the end of study if you go off study early), before you receive the study drug and then 2 hours later Length of Study: You can take up to 15 cycles of ruxolitinib and 12 cycles of azacytidine. After 15 cycles of ruxolitinib, if your doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you may change over to commercial supply and continue taking it for up to 5 years from study entry. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. You will be called about 30 days after you go off study and asked if you have had any side effects and/or any new treatment(s). You will be called and asked if you have had any side effects and how the disease is doing for up to 5 years after you first started the study. If you take ruxolitinib for longer than 16 cycles, you will need to turn in your study diary after every cycle. This is an investigational study. Ruxolitinib is FDA approved and commercially available to treat myelofibrosis. Azacytidine is FDA approved and commercially available for myelodysplastic syndrome. The combination of ruxolitinib and azacytidine to treat myelofibrosis and myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm is investigational. Up to125 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients with a diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis (PM), post polycythemia vera myelofibrosis (PPV MF), or post essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (PET MF) requiring therapy, including those previously treated and relapsed or refractory, or if newly diagnosed, with intermediate or high risk according to International Working Group (IWGMRT) criteria (appendix G). 2. Patients with a diagnosis of Myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm, unclassifiable (MDS/MPNU)} that requires therapy. 3. Understanding and voluntarily signing an IRBapproved informed consent form. 4. Age&gt;/=18 years at the time of signing the informed consent. 5. ECOG performance status 0 to 2. 6. Adequate liver function (direct bilirubin of &lt;/= 2mg/dL, SGPT &lt;/= 2.5 x ULN or 5 x ULN if related to MF or MDS/MPN associated liver infiltration): if total bilirubin is &lt;/=2 , fractionation is not required for eligibility determination. 7. Creatinine &lt;/= 2.5 mg/dL 8. Platelets &gt;/= 50 x 10^9/L 9. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;/= 1.0 x 10^9/L 1. For the MF and MDS/MPNU arms (arms 1 &amp; 2), use of any other standard drug except hydroxyurea (see section 4.5 for guidelines for allowed hydroxyurea use) anagrelide, growth factors, revlimid, clofarabine, etc) or experimental drug or therapy within 14 days of starting study therapy. 2. Patients previously treated with RUX or AZA (Only applicable for the MF and MDS/MPN arms). 3. Any serious psychological condition or psychiatric illness that would prevent the subject from signing the informed consent document, in the investigator opinion. 4. Pregnant or lactating females 5. Subjects of childbearing potential who are unwilling to take appropriate precautions (from screening through followup) to avoid becoming pregnant or fathering a child. Females of nonchildbearing potential are defined as women who (a) are 55 years of age with history of amenorrhea for 1 year, OR (b) are surgically sterile for at least 3 months. For females of childbearing potential, or for males, pregnancy must be avoided by taking appropriate precautions. These precautions and the methods of contraception should be communicated to the subjects and their understanding confirmed. 6. Any condition, which significantly places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study. 7. Known positive for HIV or with known active infectious hepatitis, type A, B or C. 8. Patients with active malignancy of other type than required for this study are not eligible with the exception of currently treated basal cell, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma "in situ" of the cervix or breast. Patients with malignancies with indolent behavior such as prostate cancer treated with radiation or surgery can be enrolled in the study as long as they have a reasonable expectation to have been cured with the treatment modality received.</criteria>
