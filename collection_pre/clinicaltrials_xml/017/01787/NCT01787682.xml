	<brief_summary>Weight loss commonly occurs in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), negatively influencing their quality of life, treatment response and survival. Loss of muscle protein is generally a central component of weight loss in CHF and COPD patients but patients also have reductions in fat mass and bone density, independent of the severity of the disease state. The purpose of this cross-sectional study is to provide detailed insight in disease related gut function by obtaining information on gut permeability, digestion and absorption of glucose, fat and protein in CHF and COPD patients compared to matched healthy controls. This will provide required information that is necessary to implement new strategies to develop optimal nutritional regimen in CHF and COPD. The hypothesis is that CHF and COPD are related to decreased gut function and absorption, leading to decreased anabolic response. Second, this decreased nutritional status is linked to reduced muscle functioning and possibly decreased cognition. In addition, we will examine the effect of aging on by comparing gut function digestion and absorption of the CHF and COPD aged matched healthy controls to a group of young healthy subjects.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study involves one test day of approximately 7-8 hours. On this test day subjects will ingest a sugar drink to assess gut permeability and gut function, and a protein meal to measure digestion/absorption and the anabolic response to food intake. Subjects will also receive a mixture of amino acids that are made a little heavier than normal, called stable isotopes. This stable isotopes is used to investigate protein behavior in the body (protein kinetics). Blood (100-120 ml in total) and urine samples will be collected over 7 hours.</detailed_description>
