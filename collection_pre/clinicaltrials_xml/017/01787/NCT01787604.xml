	<brief_title>Study of Aortic Root Reimplantation Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A single blind prospective randomized superiority study is conducted. Our hypothesis is that there is difference in the incidence of aortic valve replacement between the standard aortic valve reimplantation procedure and aortic root reimplantation procedure more than 21.1%. If there is truly difference between groups (Aortic Root Reimplantation Procedure and Aortic Valve Reimplantation Procedure), then total 64 patients for both groups are required to be 80% sure that the upper limit of a one-sided 95% confidence interval would reveal a difference in favour of the Aortic Root Reimplantation Procedure of 21.1%. The blinding process is applied to a patient, who is informed about received valve-sparing operation, but don't know the type of the last. The study was approved by Institutional Review Board. Depending on a type of the procedure, the patients are divided into two groups: Aortic Root Reimplantation Procedure group includes 30 patients and Aortic Valve Reimplantation Procedure group consists of 30 patients. Randomization is conducted intraoperatively by using accidental sampling after examining the aortic valve and making a decision on the possibility of a valve-sparing operation.</detailed_description>
