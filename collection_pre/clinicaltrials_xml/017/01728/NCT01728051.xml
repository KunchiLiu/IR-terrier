	<brief_summary>The safety and efficacy of CS-PHP-melphalan has been evaluated in a phase 3 trial conducted in the same patient population as well as using the same melphalan dosing as proposed in this study. This expanded access protocol will provide an experimental alternative treatment option for both physicians and patients until the Delcath CS-PHP System receives marketing approval.</brief_summary>

Active uncontrolled infection 13. History of bleeding disorders or known unresolved venous shunting 14. Requirement for ongoing chronic anticoagulation 15. Evidence of intracranial abnormalities resulting in risk for bleeding with anticoagulation 16. History of alcohol or drug abuse ≤6 mths 17. Other malignancy within 3 yrs before enrollment with the exception of curatively treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or curatively treated cervical, breast carcinoma in situ or prostate cancer 18. History of hypersensitivity to: melphalan or its components; iodine contrast that cannot be controlled by premedication with antihistamines and steroids; latex 19. Known hypersensitivity to heparin in the presence of heparininduced thrombocytopenia antibodies 20. Inadequate hematological or renal function as indicated by any of the following: Platelets &lt;100,000/mm3 Hb ≤10 g/dL Neutrophils &lt;2,000/mm3 S Creat &gt;1.5 mg/dL or measured creatinine clearance &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 21. Inadequate liver function as indicated by any of the following: Tbili ≥3.0 mg/dL INR &gt;1.5 AST/ALT &gt;5xULN 22. Pregnant or nursing 23. Positive pregnancy test in subjects of childbearing potential ≤7 days prior to first CSPHPmelphalan infusion 24.

Sexually active females of childbearing potential and sexually active males with partners of reproductive potential unwilling or unable to use contraception from screening until at least 30 days after last administration of CSPHPmelphalan</criteria>
