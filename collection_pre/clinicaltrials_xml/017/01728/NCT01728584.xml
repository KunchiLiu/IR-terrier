	<brief_summary>The purpose of this pilot study is to compare the use of deep or standard neuromuscular blockade (NMB) in combination with low or standard insufflation pressure in participants undergoing a surgical procedure, laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Insufflation refers to the injection of carbon dioxide into the abdomen during the laparoscopic surgery, to allow visualization of and access to the surgical field. The primary hypothesis of the study is that the use of sustained deep NMB improves the surgeon's overall satisfaction with surgical conditions as compared to standard NMB. The in-patient surgery is performed on Day 1 and the participant remains hospitalized for at least 48 hours following the surgery (or at least 24 hours following the surgery, if local practice does not allow 48 hours of hospitalization post surgery). On Day 8, a follow-up visit/contact including all participants occurs.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>During procedure, surgeon (who was blinded to random assignment) could request that unblinded anesthetist change the randomized treatment conditions (called a "rescue intervention"), if surgeon considered surgical conditions to be unacceptable. This was to be done systematically as follows: If the participant is on standard NMB, the preferred rescue intervention should be to increase the NMB to a depth of 1-2 PTCs; for such a participant the second option (if participant is also on low insufflation pressure) should be the increase of insufflation pressure by 4 mmHg. If the participant is already on deep NMB, the preferred option should be (if participant is also on low insufflation pressure) the increase of insufflation pressure by 4 mmHg.</detailed_description>
