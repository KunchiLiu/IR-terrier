	<brief_title>Intrabone Transplantation of Allogenic Peripheral Blood Stem Cells in Patients With Myeloid and Lymphoid Malignancies.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allogenic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is an established treatment option for haematologic malignancies, especially leukaemias and lymphomas, providing curative potential. The optimal donor is HLA-matched sibling and G-CSF stimulated peripheral blood is nowadays the most common source of stem cells. Routinely used route of stem cell transplantation is intravenous infusion via central venous catheter. Based on the animal studies, only 10-15% of intravenously transplanted stem cells migrate to haematopoietic sites while the rest is lost in other organs. Results of studies of direct intrabone allogenic cord-blood cells transplantation in humans confirm that this route of transplantation is associated with less probability of graft failure and moreover may reduce risk of graft-versus-host disease and malignancy relapse. For those purposes in the current study we investigate intrabone route of allogenic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Our intention is to achieve fast engraftment and minimize risk of relapse and graft graft-versus-host disease.</detailed_description>
