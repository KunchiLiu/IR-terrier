	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of enhancements to the myVisionTrack® in regards to patient compliance and test-retest variability. Additionally, the ability of myVisionTrack® to detect changes in vision function will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diabetic Retinopathy And the Myvisiontrack® (DRAMA) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The results of this study will provide the basis for patient self-monitoring of visual function with the myVisionTrack®, and for reporting, storage, and maintenance of collected data. The myVisionTrack® is intended to be used remotely by patients to monitor their disease. In the case of significant changes, patients will be prompted to visit their ophthalmologist. It is hypothesized that this can lead to earlier detection of disease progression, which, in turn, can lead to earlier treatment and better prevention against vision loss due to diabetic retinopathy (DR).</detailed_description>
