	<brief_summary>This study builds on data that high-density lipoprotein (HDL) has a number of potentially beneficial effects including directly modulating glucose metabolism through multiple mechanisms. The primary objective of this study is to determine the effects of RVX000222 on postprandial plasma glucose in male individuals with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), during a frequently sampled oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).</brief_summary>
