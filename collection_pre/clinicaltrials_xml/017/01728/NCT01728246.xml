	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and effects on Quality of Life (QOL) of tramadol/paracetamol (APAP) as an add-on therapy (medication taken in addition to another medication) in Filipino participants with chronic (lasting a long time) osteoarthritis (disorder, which is seen mostly in older persons, in which the joints become painful and stiff).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Efficacy, Safety and Effects on Quality of Life of Tramadol/Paracetamol as Add-on Therapy in Chronic Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), randomized (study drug assigned by chance), controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and effects on QOL of tramadol/APAP as an add-on therapy in Filipino participants suffering from chronic pain because of chronic osteoarthritis. Participants will be randomly assigned to 2 groups: tramadol/APAP group and non tramadol/APAP group. Participants in tramadol/APAP group will receive celecoxib 200 milligram (mg) and fixed dose combination of tramadol (37.5 mg)/APAP (325 mg) as add on therapy, while the participants in non-tramadol/APAP group will receive celecoxib 200 mg only. The total duration of the study will be 4 weeks. The participants in both the groups will be given celecoxib 200 mg once daily for 4 weeks. In addition, the participants in the tramadol/APAP group will be given add-on tramadol/APAP doses 3 times a day for 4 weeks. Participants will be asked to return for follow-up at Weeks 2 and 4. Efficacy will be assessed using 100 millimeter (mm) Visual Analog Scale (VAS) while QOL will be assessed using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Participant safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
