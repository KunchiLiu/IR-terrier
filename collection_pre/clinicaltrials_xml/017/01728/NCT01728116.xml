	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of EndoBarrier in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Who Are Obese</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double blinded, prospective study. Subjects will be evaluated and randomized to either the device or sham treatment group if they qualify for the study. A comparison of glycemic control between the two groups will be assessed as the primary outcome measurement as well as the safety profile of the device.</detailed_description>
