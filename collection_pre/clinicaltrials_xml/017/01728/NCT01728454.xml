	<brief_title>The Evaluation of Safety and Efficacy of Proellex in the Treatment of Pre-Menopausal Women With Confirmed, Symptomatic Endometriosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a phase 2, 3-arm-study with an 18 week active dosing period and an option for subjects to receive 2 additional 16-week cycles of active treatment at their randomized dose (6 mg or 12 mg/day). Placebo subjects who elect additional treatment will receive treatment at 12 mg/day. The treatment dose will remain double-blind. The study will be conducted in 3 stages. In the first stage, women will receive a daily single-blind placebo. This stage will last as long as it takes to record at least one full menstrual cycle (ovulation until ovulation). For stage 2, following the run-in stage, at Visit 3, 60 subjects will be randomized into one of 3 arms in a 1-1-1 fashion. The start of dosing should commence as soon as possible after ovulation following the end of the previous menstrual event. For stage 3, subjects who are eligible to receive additional cycles of treatment and who elect to continue treatment will be scheduled within a week before the second expected menses (+/- 2 days), following the off-drug interval. Subjects will receive 2 cycles of treatment separated by an off-drug interval (ODI), after which they will be followed until menses has returned.</detailed_description>

Endometriosis diagnosis must have been surgically confirmed within 7 years. A laparoscopic diagnosis is acceptable. Subjects must have a history of at least 3 regular menstrual cycles in which symptoms of endometriosis occurred immediately prior to screening Normal or abnormal but nonclinically significant transvaginal ultrasound History of menstrual events occurring in regular cycles Agreement not to attempt to become pregnant during the trial Agreement to limit alcohol consumption to no more than 2 drinks per week and to avoid alcohol consumption within 48 hours before each visit Ability to complete a daily electronic subject diary and study procedures in compliance with the protocol Women of childbearing potential must be willing to use doublebarrier contraception during the study and for 30 days after discontinuation of study medication. Acceptable doublebarrier methods are: male condom with spermicide; male condom with diaphragm; diaphragm containing spermicide plus additional intravaginal spermicide Has a negative pregnancy test at the Screening and Baseline visits, and subsequent study visits A Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18 and 39 inclusive Is available for all treatment and followup visits Subject is a postmenopausal woman, defined as either; six (6) months or more (immediately prior to screening visit) without a menstrual period, or prior hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy. Subject is pregnant or lactating or is attempting or expecting to become pregnant during the 67 month study period Women with abnormally high liver enzymes or liver disease. (ALT (alanine transaminase) or AST(aspartate aminotransferase ) exceeding 2 x ULN (upper limit of normal) AND total bilirubin exceeding 1.5x ULN at screening and confirmed on repeat). Received an investigational drug in the 30 days prior to the screening for this study Women with a history of PCOS(polycystic ovary syndrome) Concurrent use of any testosterone, androgen, anabolic steroids, DHEA(dehydroepiandrosterone) or hormonal products for at least 2 weeks prior to screening and during the study. Oral contraceptive use for control of endometriosis symptoms is acceptable for the first 28days of the study. Use of DepoProvera® in the preceding 6 months. Use of GnRHas (e.g. Lupron Depot) within 3 months of the first dose of study drug (Lupron Depot must have a washout period of 3 months after the period of duration of the Lupron dose). Has an IUD(intrauterine device) in place. Copper IUDs (nonhormone containing will be permitted). Presence of intramural fibroids that impact the endometrial stripe, submucosal fibroids (any size), or endometrial polyps. Subserosal and intramural fibroids with no impact on the endometrial stripe are acceptable. Presence of endometrioma(s) Present history or condition that causes nonendometriosis related dyspareunia (e.g. vulvar vestibulitis). Past or present history of thrombophlebitis or thromboembolic disorders. Known or suspected carcinoma of the breast or reproductive organs. History of abnormal ECG that, in the opinion of the investigator, is clinically significant and will prevent the subject from completing the study, including a QTc(corrected QT interval) of greater than 450 ms. Cervical dysplasia classified as Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance (ASCUS) associated with highrisk human papilloma virus (HPV) or Low/High Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (LGSIL or HGSIL). History of abnormal endometrial biopsy including the presence of EIN(Endometrial Intraepithelial Neoplasia) . Recent history (within past 6 months) of alcoholism or drug abuse. Known active infection with HIV, Hepatitis A, B or C. Previous history of autoimmune disease and/or positive antinuclear antigen (ANA). Endometrial stripe ≥18 mm in thickness at Visit 1. Women currently taking cimetidine or spironolactone. Clinically significant abnormal findings on screening examination and laboratory assessments or any condition which in the opinion of the investigator would interfere with the participant's ability to comply with the study instructions or endanger the participant if she took part in the study.</criteria>
