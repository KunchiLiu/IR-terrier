Subject has had a noninvasive fat reduction and/or body contouring procedure in the area of intended treatment within the past 6 months. 5. Subject needs to administer, or has a known history of subcutaneous injections into the area of intended treatment (e.g., heparin, insulin) within the past month. 6. Subject has a known history of cryoglobulinemia, cold urticaria, or paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria. 7. Subject has a known history of Raynaud's disease, or any known condition with a response to cold exposure that limits blood flow to the skin. 8. Subject has a history of bleeding disorder or is taking any medication that in the investigator's opinion may increase the subject's risk of bruising. 9. Subject is taking or has taken diet pills or weight control supplements within the past month. 10. Subject has any dermatological conditions, such as moderate to excessive skin laxity, or scars in the location of the treatment sites that may interfere with the treatment or evaluation (stretch marks is not an exclusion). 11. Subject has an active implanted device such as a pacemaker, defibrillator, or drug delivery system. 12. Subject is pregnant or intending to become pregnant in the next 5 months. 13. Subject is lactating or has been lactating in the past 6 months. 14. Subject has a history of hernia in the areas to be treated. 15. Subject is unable or unwilling to comply with the study requirements. 16. Subject is currently enrolled in a clinical study of any other unapproved investigational drug or device. 17.
