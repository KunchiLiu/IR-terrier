	<brief_summary>In obstructive sleep apnea, the upper airway recurrently closes during sleep. The mechanisms that lead to airway closure are not completely understood. While the airway of some people narrows and airflow decreases during inspiration due to increasing inspiratory effort, others maintain constant airflow throughout inspiration. Airway neuromuscular reflexes may protect against airway narrowing that occurs due to increasing inspiratory effort. To test this hypothesis, the investigators will initially measure airway neuromuscular reflex and inspiratory flow and then attenuate neuromuscular reflex through topical pharyngeal anesthesia to observe the effects on inspiratory flow.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The mechanisms that lead to airway closure are not completely understood. While the airway of some people narrows and airflow decreases during inspiration due to increasing inspiratory effort, others maintain constant airflow throughout inspiration (negative effort dependence, NED). The investigators hypothesize that upper airway neuromuscular reflexes may protect against narrowing that occurs due to increasing inspiratory effort. Topical oropharyngeal anesthesia has been shown to reduce neuromuscular reflexes. Thus, the investigators also hypothesize that patients with stable inspiratory flow will develop NED once the reflexes have been impaired with topical anesthetic. The investigators plan to: 1. measure upper airway muscle EMG to assess how it corresponds to the presence or absence of NED. This aim will allow us to test the hypothesis that robust upper airway muscle reflexes can protect against NED. 2. reduce upper airway muscle activity and reflexes by topical oropharyngeal anesthesia. This will allow us to test the hypothesis that attenuated upper airway muscle activity induced by topical anesthesia can induce NED.</detailed_description>
