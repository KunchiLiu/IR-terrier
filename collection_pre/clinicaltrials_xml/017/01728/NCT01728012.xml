	<brief_summary>Mineral metabolism disturbances occur early during the course of chronic kidney disease and eventually affect most patients. For how long such disturbances persist after a successful renal transplantation is mainly unknown. This study will investigate the prevalence of such disturbances in patients more than 10 years following a successful renal transplantation. The patients will be recruited from an existing registry in Norway.</brief_summary>
