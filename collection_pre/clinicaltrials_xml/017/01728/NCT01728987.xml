	<brief_summary>The study will examine the role of adipose tissue in vitamin D physiology, particularly its role as a depot. the study is randomized double blind and placebo controlled.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Significance of Vitamin D Storage in Adipose Tissue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>vitamin d versus placebo will be given for 12 months. Biopsies will be taken at baseline and every 6 month for 2 years. Blood samples will be collected every 6th month. the study will thus give information on storage during vitamin d supplementation as well as use of vitamin d fat stores after stopping vitamin D supplementation</detailed_description>
