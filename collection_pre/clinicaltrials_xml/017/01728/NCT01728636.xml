	<brief_title>The Use of Tranexamic Acid to Reduce Perioperative Blood Loss During High Risk Spine Fusion Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are conflicting studies in the literature reporting different efficacy outcomes for the use of antifibrinolytics in spine fusion surgery. Several studies support the successful use of tranexamic acid for major orthopedic procedures, but the patient populations studied for spine surgery thus far have been small and highly variable, with less than clinically significant results. If TXA if efficacious in reducing not only perioperative blood loss, but RBC transfusion without an increase in thromboembolic events, then its use may be justified for patients at risk for major blood transfusion.</detailed_description>
