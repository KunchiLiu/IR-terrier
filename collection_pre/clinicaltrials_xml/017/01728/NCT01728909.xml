	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of intranasal oxytocin administration on social cognition in patients receiving methadone maintenance treatment (MMT), examine the effects of intranasal oxytocin administration on opioid craving and on the subjective effects of methadone, and examine the effects of intranasal oxytocin administration on implicit preferences for drug-related and social stimuli in patients receiving MMT. Hypothesis 1: Patients will perform better on measures of social cognition (including affect recognition and recognition of sarcasm) after administration of oxytocin compared with placebo. Hypothesis 2: Patients will demonstrate lower craving for opioids and greater subjective effects of methadone after administration of oxytocin compared with placebo. Hypothesis 3: Patients will demonstrate increased implicit preferences for social stimuli and decreased implicit preferences for drug related stimuli after administration of oxytocin compared with placebo.</brief_summary>
