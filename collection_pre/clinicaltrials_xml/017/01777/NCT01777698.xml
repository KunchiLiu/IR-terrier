	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma represents 80-90% of primary hepatic malignant tumors. 80% of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma are associated with cirrhosis. Chemoembolization is a process in which a chemotherapeutic agent is deposited directly into the hepatic tumor where the principal artery is embolized. Bioelectrical impedance bases its evaluation in a model where the body is conformed by two different compartments: fat mass and fat free mass. Bioelectrical impedance is complemented by vectorial analysis, which is independent to the state of hydration and is helpful to monitor any changes in corporal composition. It can be used as a control for the interpretation of the bioelectrical impedance.</brief_summary>
