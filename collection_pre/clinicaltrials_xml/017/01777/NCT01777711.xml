	<brief_summary>This study explores among couples in which both members are obese how the use of mental contrasting along with implementation intentions influence intentions and behavior related to weight loss (eating healthy and exercise), actual weight loss, as well as potential reasons (i.e., mediators) why these changes may occur (e.g., social support, changes in beliefs about weight loss, confidence in being able to eat healthy and diet).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exploring Beliefs and Behaviors About Weight Loss in Couples</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study explores among couples in which both members are obese how the use of mental contrasting along with implementation intentions influence intentions and behaviors related to weight loss (eating healthy and exercise), actual weight loss, as well as potential reasons (i.e., mediators) why these changes may occur (e.g., social support, changes in beliefs about weight loss, confidence in being able to eat healthy and diet). In mental contrasting procedures, people first imagine a desired future (e.g., eating healthy) and then reflect on the current negative reality (e.g., I snack too much). This process makes people aware of changes needed in the present to obtain future positive outcomes, and thus aids in increasing goal commitment and goal pursuit. In implementation intention procedures, individuals form "if-then" statements about how they will enact their goals in their everyday lives. Implementation intentions are highly effective at helping individuals achieve health behavior change. Recent studies suggest that the combined use of mental contrasting and implementation intentions produce more behavior change than either technique alone (e.g., diet) In this study, investigators test whether these procedures vary in their effectiveness when couple members are instructed to focus on themselves versus the relationship, the latter intended to instill a communal coping mindset (i.e., that losing weight is an issue that needs to be addressed as a couple enacted through mutually cooperative behaviors).</detailed_description>
