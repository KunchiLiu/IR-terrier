	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of a booster dose of GSK Biologicals' MenACWY-TT vaccine administered at 6 years post-primary vaccination with either GSK Biologicals' Hib-MenC-TT vaccine (Menitorix™) or Hiberix™ and Meningitec™, in healthy subjects aged 12-18 months at primary vaccination and to evaluate the long-term antibody persistence at 2 years after MenACWY-TT booster vaccination. This is an extension study of the Hib-MenC-TT-016 study (NCT number: NCT00326118).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects' parent(s)/Legally Acceptable Representative(s) who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply, with the requirements of the protocol. A male or female between, and including, 84 and 95 months of age at the time of the booster vaccination. Written informed consent obtained from the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject and written informed assent obtained from the subject in accordance with local laws and regulations. Healthy subjects as established by medical history and historydirected physical examination before entering into the study. Having completed the vaccination in the study [HibMenCTT016 (106445)] as per protocol. Child in care. Use of any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine within 30 days preceding the dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to the vaccine dose. For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone ≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day, or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed. Administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within the period starting 30 days before and ending 30 days after the study vaccine dose, with the exception of a licensed inactivated influenza vaccine which can be administered at any time during the study according to the local recommendations. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a noninvestigational vaccine/product. Previous vaccination with meningococcal vaccine except the meningococcal vaccination received in the HibMenCTT016 study. History of meningococcal disease. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition (congenital or secondary), including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)infection, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required). Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency. History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine, and history of serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) following the administration of vaccine(s). Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness. History of any neurological disorders or seizures, including GBS. History of a simple, single febrile seizure is permitted. Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrollment. Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 37.5°C for oral, axillary or tympanic route, or ≥ 38.0°C for rectal route. The preferred route for recording temperature in this study will be oral. Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory infection) without fever may be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months preceding the study vaccination or planned administration during the booster vaccination phase of the study (i.e. between Visit 1 and Visit 2) and within 3 months preceding the blood sampling at Visit 3. The following criteria should be checked for the longterm persistence phase at two years after booster vaccination (Visit 3): In case an exclusion criterion becomes applicable, the subject will not enter the longterm followup and the reason will be documented. Previous administration of a meningococcal vaccine with the exception of the meningococcal vaccination given in the primary study and the booster vaccination in this particular study. History of meningococcal disease.</criteria>
