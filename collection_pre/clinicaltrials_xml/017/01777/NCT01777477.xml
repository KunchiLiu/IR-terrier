	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety by defining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Choloroquine when combined with Gemcitabine, and to evaluate preliminary efficacy of combined systemic Gemcitabine and Chloroquine. In addition, the influence of the treatment on the anti-cancer immunity and the value of GOLPH2 as serum marker for pancreatic cancer will be assessed within a translational objective. - Trial with medicinal product</brief_summary>
