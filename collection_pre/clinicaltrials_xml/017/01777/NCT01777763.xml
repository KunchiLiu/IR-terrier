	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to collect pharmacokinetic (PK) information related to how well posaconazole tablet is distributed in the body and to determine the safety of this new formulation. The study consists of a Phase 1B study that includes participants with neutropenia undergoing chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplasia (MDS) and a Phase 3 study that includes participants who are undergoing chemotherapy for AML or MDS and participants who are recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Posaconazole Tablet in Participants at High Risk for Invasive Fungal Infections (MK-5592-065/P05615)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants with a blood disease or cancer that can affect their infection-fighting white blood cells and those who have undergone a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and are receiving immunosuppressive therapy and have or are at risk of graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) are eligible for the study. These blood diseases and their treatments can weaken the immune system and may put individuals at high risk for a serious fungal infection of their internal organs or blood (invasive fungal infection). As these infections can be hard to detect early and can be life-threatening, many physicians believe that individuals diagnosed with these diseases should receive antifungal therapy to try to lower their risk of getting this type of infection. Enrollment into this study will take place in several stages (parts). The determination of which part a participant will be in is based on which part is open at the site at the time of enrollment.</detailed_description>
