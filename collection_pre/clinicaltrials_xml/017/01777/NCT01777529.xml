	<brief_summary>Whether the lower immunogenicity of the mumps component obtained in clinical studies with the MMR in Brazil, due to the multidose presentation. Investigations were made on factors that could interfere with immunogenicity of mumps component, as the kits used for the immunoassay method, and potency of the vaccine, but no explanation was found. This study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that the lower immunogenicity of the mumps component of the MMR Bio-Manguinhos vaccine, is due to the multidose presentation. The Main objetctive is evaluate the immunogenicity of MMR after one dose in children 12 to 23 months of life, comparing the performances multidose vial (10 doses per vial of vaccine produced in Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz through technology transfer from GlaxoSmithKline Laboratory - GSK) and single dose vial (1 dose per vial of vaccine produced by GSK).</brief_summary>

Multidose presentation, only from one batch. - MMR (GSK-TV), produced by GlaxoSmithKline, the same age. Monodose presentation, only from one batch.

Concordance of the father or mother, or legal guardian, with the child's participation in the study, and signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF). Disposition of the father or mother, or legal guardian, to provide name, address, telephone number and other information so you can get in touch with this (s) if necessary.

If the charge is not able to sign (illiterate) the ICF may be signed by an impartial witness who has followed the whole procedure. Availability return to collect postvaccination The subjects of research may not be participating in another clinical trial during this study. Not having received the vaccine Immunization Schedule in the last 30 days. Not receiving another vaccine until harvest 2, 42 days after vaccination with MMR. Noninclusion criteria Children with a history of measles, rubella and or mumps. Having previously received MMR vaccination documented in book (eg in situations of conducting national campaign or blocking vaccination before suspected cases of the disease). Have received injectable vaccines of live attenuated (eg. Yellow fever vaccine) in this case, defer vaccination with MMR after 30 days of the last live attenuated vaccine administered. Having received a transfusion of blood or blood products, including immunoglobulins, less than 1 year. Skin lesions at sites of venipuncture. Child subject to abnormal bleeding after injections. Use the last 6 months in immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants. Fever or the day of inclusion in the 3 days prior to the inclusion in this case may be rescheduled for inclusion after 14 days the fever subsides. Use of antibiotic on the day of inclusion or in the last 7 days prior to the date of inclusion in this case, may be rescheduled for inclusion after 14 days of the last day of antibiotic use. Any significant abnormality on physical examination the day of enrollment. Hypersensitivity known systemic neomycin or any other component of the vaccine.
