	<brief_summary>Allergic rhinitis (AR) is defined as inflammation of the nasal mucosa after exposition to an allergen in sensitized patients. AR causes not only nasal symptoms such as sneezing, itchy nose, rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction, but also has a significant impact on quality of life. Symptom control and overall satisfaction in patients undergoing subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) or sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) on the long term has not yet been investigated so far.</brief_summary>
