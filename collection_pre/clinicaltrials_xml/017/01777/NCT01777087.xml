	<brief_summary>This study has two purposes: first, to locate and identify the "brain activation" (the areas of the brain) which respond to pain; and second, to look at how brain activation is influenced by a person's genetics (the traits they inherited from their parents). A Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner will be used to gather pictures of the brain (similar to an x-ray, but based on different scientific principles) that will be used to determine which areas are active. The hypothesis is that the variation in brain activity between people can be partially explained by genetic differences. This study consists of an two pain tasks applied during a one time visit to the MRI suite. There are no followup visits.</brief_summary>
