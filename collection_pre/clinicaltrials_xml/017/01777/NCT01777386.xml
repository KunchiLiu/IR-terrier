	<brief_summary>Tissue expansion methods have been recommended as a means of improving the clinical results with perforator flaps but in plastic surgery literature there are few clinical trials supporting this opinion. The purposes of this clinical study are to address the ''preexpanded perforator flap concept'' by demonstrating a case series of relevant reconstructive procedures and to evaluate the perforator vessel changes that happen during the expansion periods of various perforator flap donor sites.</brief_summary>
