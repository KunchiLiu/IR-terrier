	<brief_summary>This is a in-vitro study to evaluate the pharmacodynamic interaction between ticagrelor and its active metabolite (AR-C124910XX) and their effects on the pharmacodynamics of salicylic acid. The study consist of two parts of in-vitro study as follows; - Part 1 : in-vitro study to evaluate the pharmacodynamic interaction between ticagrelor and its active metabolite. - Part 2 : in vitro study to evaluate the pharmacodynamic interaction between ticagrelor and its active metabolite and their effect on the pharmacodynamics of salicylic acid on platelet aggregation tests with the agonist of arachidonic acid.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a in-vitro study to evaluate the pharmacodynamic interaction between ticagrelor and its active metabolite (AR-C124910XX) and their effects on the pharmacodynamics of salicylic acid. The study consist of two parts of in-vitro study as follows; - Part 1 : in-vitro study to evaluate the pharmacodynamic interaction between ticagrelor and its active metabolite. Platelet aggregation tests with the agonist of adenosine diphosphate(ADP) will be assessed on the in-vitro mixtures of blank plasma and randomized paired concentrations of ticagrelor + AR-C124910XX. - Part 2 : in vitro study to evaluate the pharmacodynamic interaction between ticagrelor and its active metabolite. Platelet aggregation tests with the agonist of arachidonic acid will be assessed on the in-vitro mixtures of blank plasma plus randomized paired concentrations of ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX and the invitro mixtures with blank plasma and ticagrelor + AR-C124910XX + salicylic acid.</detailed_description>
