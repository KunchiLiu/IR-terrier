	<brief_summary>The primary goal in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction is to reperfuse the ischemic myocardium to reduce infarct size. Animal data and human data suggest that whole-body cooling to temperatures below 35°C before revascularisation can additionally reduce infarct size and therefore improves outcome in these patients. The purpose of the study is to determine if a combined cooling strategy started in the out-of-hospital arena is able to reduce infarct size in acute myocardial infarction.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background: Contemporary therapy in patients with an on-going ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is to reperfuse the ischemic myocardium as soon as possible to reduce infarct size and associated complications. A recent pilot-study showed a significant reduction in infarct size by the induction of pre-reperfusion hypothermia. Objectives: To demonstrate a reduction in infarct size/myocardium at risk (measured by magnet resonance imaging) in patients with ST-Elevation myocardial infarction by strategic temperature management with the use of external cooling pads in the out-of-hospital setting and the continuation with cold saline and central venous catheter cooling in hospital. In a parallel translational study, the molecular effects of rapid and early cooling on inflammatory processes at the culprit lesion site will be defined. Methodology: Randomized, prospective, controlled trial Number of subjects: 120 patients (60 per group) Investigational medical device: EMCOOLS flex pad is an external cooling pad, that consists of multiple cooling cells filled with a patented cooling gel. EMCOOLS flex pad will be used in the out-of-hospital setting to initiate cooling. The Philips RTx Endovascular System™ is an endovascular thermal control system that circulates cooled saline through an indwelling central venous catheter in a closed-loop manner. It will be used in combination with 1-2 litres of intravenous cold saline to induce hypothermia below 35 degrees Celsius. Duration: One hour after successful revascularization the cooling procedure will be stopped, subjects will be covered with a blanket and are allowed to passively re-warm. Clinical follow-up for 180 days. Primary endpoint: Myocardial infarct size (as a percentage of myocardium at risk) assessed by cardiac MRI at 4±2 days. Influence of target temperature management on coronary macrophages and monocytes as well as impact on plasma levels of immune cell chemotaxis and activation.</detailed_description>
