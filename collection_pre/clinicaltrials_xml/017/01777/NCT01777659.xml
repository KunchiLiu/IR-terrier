	<brief_summary>The investigators will test the hypothesis that transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) may attenuate peripheral vasoconstriction and to improve blood flow redistribution during handgrip exercise in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients after Coronary Arterial Bypass Graft Surgery (CABG).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation Improves Vascular Conductance After Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thirty-eight patients will be randomized to a (4 times/day; 30 min/session) for 5-day program of TENS (n = 20) or to placebo-TENS (P-TENS, n = 18) applied on cervical region (C7-T4). Acute sympathetic stimulation by cold pressor test (CPT), Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), Femoral blood flow (FBF) and femoral vascular conductance (FVC) will be measured as primary outcome pre and post-CABG, even as the 6-minute walk test (6-MWT), Inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength (PImax and PEmax) and Î²-endorphin as a secondary clinical parameters. In addition, amount of opioid analgesic and pain intensity also will be measured throughout at first 24 hours after CABG (immediately, 6, 12 and 24 hours).</detailed_description>
