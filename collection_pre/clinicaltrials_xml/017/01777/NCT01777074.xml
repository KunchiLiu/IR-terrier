	<detailed_description>The aim of the study is to assess the acceptability of Hepatitis B immunization among general practitioners and open-care paediatricians. This is a national, repeated transversal epidemiological study with two data measurement time-points over a period of two years (T1 in 2009, T2 in 2011, two different samples of physicians) in order to assess immunization practices before introduction of the reimbursement of InfanrixHexa®, during the transition period and then during the period following reimbursement of the vaccine. At each collection time-point, two patient age groups will be investigated: 12-15 months and 24-27 months, thus providing measurements before/after reimbursement.</detailed_description>
