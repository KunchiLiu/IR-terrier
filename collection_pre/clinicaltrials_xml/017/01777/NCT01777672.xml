	<brief_summary>Oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) is a major complaint among many patients with stroke and causes severe complications. There is no specific treatment for these patients. Impaired swallow response is caused by a delay in the timing of oropharyngeal reconfiguration with delayed airway protection. Swallow response is initiated by sensory afferent fibers in the oropharynx and cerebral cortex reaching the central swallowing pattern generator (CPG) in the medulla oblongata and brainstem motor nuclei. Hypothesis: Stimulation of pharyngeal sensory afferent fibers through TRPV1 receptors and electrical stimuli might enhance the stimulation of the CPG and speed the swallow response. Long-term treatment of OD will improve clinical outcome of stroke patients. Aim: To assess the effect of TRPV1 agonists (capsaicin) and that of sensorial pharyngeal electrical stimulation (intrapharyngeal and transcutaneous) on VFS signs and swallow response at 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment in stroke patients with established OD. To compare the clinical effect of classical rehabilitation strategies with that of these new afferent sensorial neurostimulation strategies in terms of nutritional status parameters, incidence of aspiration pneumonia and/or low respiratory tract infection, quality of life, and mortality. Methods: Clinical screening of OD with the volume-viscosity swallow test and assessment by VFS and quantitative measurements of swallow response. Randomized controlled trial assessing the effect of standard rehabilitation with that of afferent sensorial neurostimulation strategies.</brief_summary>
