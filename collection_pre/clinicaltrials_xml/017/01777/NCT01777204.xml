	<brief_summary>Gastrointestinal (GI) complications after renal transplantation are commonly reported as side effects of immunosuppressive agents. Despite this, motility disorders have been scantily studied. Alternating Current Biosusceptometry (ACB) are biomagnetic sensors designed for a wide range of applications. In clinical practice, their non-invasive and radiation free features provide an excellent approach for monitoring of GI transit as alternative to scintigraphy and breath tests. The aim of this study is to examine GI transit and motility of solids in stable renal transplant recipients to determine the potential influence of immunosuppressive therapy on gastrointestinal parameters.</brief_summary>
