	<brief_summary>Our primary objective is to develop a clinical pathway for care of patients having colorectal surgery at the Clinic. In particular, the investigators would like to determine what intraoperative concentration of oxygen is optimal in our patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Supplemental Oxygen in Colorectal Surgery: A Quality Improvement Project</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators therefore propose to test the primary hypothesis that supplemental oxygen (80% versus 30%) reduces the risk of a composite of surgical sites infection and potentially oxygen-related wound complications. Secondarily, the investigators will assess the incremental cost benefit of 80% versus 30% oxygen. As a safety measure, enough oxygen will always be given to maintain oxygen saturation (as determined by pulse oximetry) â‰¥95%.</detailed_description>
