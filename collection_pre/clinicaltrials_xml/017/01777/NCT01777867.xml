	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to provide pilot data on the possible gastrointestinal predictors of respiratory hyper-responsiveness and how these relate to the clinical sub-types of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and visceral acid hypersensitivity.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cough Reflex Sensitivity and Bronchial Hyper-responsiveness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study recruited participants into three groups: reflux patients with non-erosive disease (NERD) with abnormal levels of acid reflux, NERD patients with normal levels of reflux and healthy volunteers. Participants were assessed for cough reflex sensitivity (CRS) to citric acid and bronchial-hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to methacholine challenge, both before (baseline) and after esophageal acid infusion (HCl, 0.15M) or normal saline control (8ml/min). The order of CRS and BHR was randomized, as was the order of the acid/saline infusions.</detailed_description>
