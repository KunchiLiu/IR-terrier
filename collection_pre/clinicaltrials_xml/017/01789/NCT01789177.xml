	<brief_summary>We hypothesize that the addition of modified incentive spirometry to standard postoperative chest physiotherapy will be associated with faster return to baseline/predicted pulmonary function and fewer postoperative pulmonary complications in patients following laparotomy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of Disposable Spirometer for Recovery of Pulmonary Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to determine how quickly patients' peak expiratory flow measurement returns to baseline or predicted values following laparotomy with or without the assistance of modified incentive spirometry. The secondary objective is to assess the effectiveness of modified incentive spirometry in preventing postoperative pulmonary complications in patients following laparotomy. Specifically, this study will track length of stay, mortality, and evidence of pulmonary infection in both treatment and non-treatment arms.</detailed_description>
