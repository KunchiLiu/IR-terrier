	<brief_summary>A prospective observational study on predictors available and on variables of difficult intubation adopting Gliscope video laryngoscope routinely. Primary hypothesis of the current study is that the rate of difficult intubation with Glidescope is low and multiple predictors interact favorably in anticipating difficulties.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Difficult Intubation With Glidescope Video Laryngoscope</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All possible factors involved in difficult intubations were included in this prospective analysis. Main predictors were considered: time to Cormack Lane using Glidescope intubation, Cormack Lane score, experience of the operator (staff or resident), number of bag mask ventilation, number of intubation attempts.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>any patient up to ASA4 eligible for intubation for neurosurgical procedures any anesthesiologist in charge for GA children patient not suitable for clinical evaluation of predictors for difficult intubation (ie. Parkinson's disease)</criteria>
