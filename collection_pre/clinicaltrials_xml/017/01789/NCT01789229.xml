	<brief_summary>Establishment of a tumor bank, consisting of tissue samples of tumor patients (benign and malign tumors) and healthy people as controls. The tissue samples will be collected systematically together with the corresponding clinical data. The biological samples, the clinical date together with prospective experimental date constitute the entity of the tissue tumor bank. This tumor bank for tissue samples, together with our tumorbank for blood samples (NCT01763125) combined constitute the entity "Tumorbank".</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recent progress in diagnosis and therapy of cancer diseases can be ascribed mainly to translational research. The relevance of "translational oncology" will only increase in the future -"From bench to bedside" - the swift implementation of new science research results in clinical studies in order to expedite progress in clinical cancer therapy for the benefit of the patient. Its almost a matter of course in the medical science today to collect biological samples together with clinical information thereby creating the foundation for future excellent fundamental research. The aim of this tumor bank is to consist of biological samples (together with a blood bank - see NCT01763125) and isolates of tumor patients and healthy people as controls. The biological samples, the clinical date together with prospective experimental date constitute the entity of the tumor bank. The content of the tumor bank can provide essential material for current and future research (e.g. analyses of prognostic or predictive tumor markers; genetically analysis (polymorphism, mutation, hypermethylation; verification and characterisation of disseminated tumor cells).</detailed_description>
