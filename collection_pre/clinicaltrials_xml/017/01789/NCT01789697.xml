	<brief_summary>The objectives of this double-blind, randomized, controlled study are to evaluate the efficacy of maintaining contact with low-back pain patients through text messaging and emailing, to decrease anxiety levels, pain, number of follow-up visits through text messaging and emailing, and to improve reporting of surgical site infection after spine surgery through text messaging and emailing. The outcomes that will be measured are anxiety, pain, follow-up visits and received phone calls, and reporting signs of surgical site infection. Participants will include Dr. Oren Gottfried's patients who underwent spine surgery at Duke Hospital or at Duke Raleigh Hospital. Patients will be approached after determination that the patient is going to undergo spinal surgery.
