	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies aldesleukin imaging in viewing tumor growth in patients with stage IV melanoma receiving ipilimumab or pembrolizumab therapy. Diagnostic procedures, such as single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), uses radioactive drugs and a scanner to make detailed pictures of areas inside the body and may be a less invasive way to check for stage IV melanoma. Radioactive drugs, such as technetium Tc 99 hydrazinonicotinamide-tricine-linked interleukin-2, carry radiation directly to cancer cells and may be able to differentiate between tumor growth due to inflammation versus tumor progression in patients with stage IV melanoma receiving therapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Feasibility/biodistribution of 99mTc-HYNIC-IL2 (technetium Tc 99 hydrazinonicotinamide-tricine-linked interleukin 2) scintigraphy in patients with metastatic melanoma undergoing immunotherapy with either ipilimumab (commercial source) or pembrolizumab. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Correlation of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) invasion (scintigraphy/histology) with tumor burden; and description of any clinical side effects associated with imaging. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Correlation of TIL invasion assessed by 99mTc-HYNIC-IL2 scintigraphy vs. histology (total and subsets of TIL), as well as screen for peripheral blood correlates. OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups. COHORT I: Patients undergo technetium Tc 99 hydrazinonicotinamide-tricine-linked interleukin-2 scintigraphy prior to receiving ipilimumab or pembrolizumab and at 12 weeks. COHORT II: Patients undergo technetium Tc 99 hydrazinonicotinamide-tricine-linked interleukin-2 scintigraphy prior to receiving ipilimumab or pembrolizumab, at 3-4 weeks, and at 12 weeks. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30-45 days.</detailed_description>
