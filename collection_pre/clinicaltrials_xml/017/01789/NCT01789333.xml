	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to see if brighter lights will allow for shortening of the treatment time required to stabilize the eyes of patients with keratoconus or a bulging cornea. The investigators will be comparing the therapeutic effects of two different higher brightnesses of ultra violet light on a riboflavin treated eye. One light will be twice as bright as the other and the exposure time of these brighter lights to deliver equivalent energy to the cornea will be reduced from the standard 30 minutes to 10 and 5 minutes. Riboflavin is vitamin B2 and the investigators are trying to determine if an identical clinical effect can be achieved the brighter treatment lights are used for shorter times. The investigators will also monitor the clinical effect and the status of the cornea to see if additional risks are associated with the brighter light.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects who have one or both eyes that meet two of the following criteria will be considered candidates for this study: 1. 18 years of age or older 2. Having a diagnosis of progressive keratoconus or pellucid marginal degeneration. 1. Characteristic pattern of deformity as analyzed by the Pentacam map. 2. Minimal thickness of 350 microns 3. Signed written informed consent 4. Willingness and ability to comply with schedule for followup visits 5. Contact lens removal prior to evaluation and treatment Inclusion criteria for ectasia 1. History of having undergone a keratorefractive procedure and: 1. Steepening by topography, either Pentacam or Humphrey 2. Thinning of cornea 3. Shift in the position of thinnest portion of cornea 4. Unstable refraction with increasing myopia and astigmatism 5. Development of irregular astigmatism 2. At least two of the above criteria must be present. Subjects meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded from this study: 1. Eyes classified as either normal, atypical normal, 2. Corneal pachymetry â‰¤ 350 microns at the thinnest point measured by Pentacam. 3. A history of chemical injury or delayed epithelial healing. 4. Pregnancy (including plan to become pregnant) or lactation during the course of the study 5. A known sensitivity to study medications 6. Patients with nystagmus or any other condition that would prevent a steady gaze during the treatment 7. Inability to cooperate with diagnostic tests. 8. Patients with a current condition that, in the investigator's opinion, would interfere with or prolong epithelial healing. 9. Taking Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) supplements within 1 week of the crosslinking treatment. 10. Patients who are unable to remain supine and tolerate a lid speculum.</criteria>
