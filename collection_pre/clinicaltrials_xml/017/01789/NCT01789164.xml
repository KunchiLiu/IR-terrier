	<brief_summary>The goal of this project is to determine if it is possible to assess Cerebrovascular Reactivity (CVR) to hypercapnia with functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Such a method would be particularly helpful in traumatic brain injury (TBI), where objective measures are needed, and would greatly expand the capacity to make such assessments in standard clinical practice.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measure of Cerebrovascular Dysfunction After TBI With fNIRS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prospective study design will consist of two study groups; the experimental group and the control group. In the Experimental Group (Group 1) we will enroll adult participants with TBI with persistent post-concussion symptoms or abnormalities on neuropsychological testing. In Group 2 we will enroll adult participants to serve as age and gender-matched healthy controls. Our goal is to recruit 100 subjects total in two groups of age and gender matched subjects, as follows: TBI (n = 50) and non-TBI (n = 50). Participants in both groups will undergo NIRS testing with hypercapnia challenge, to measure the increase in hemodynamic flow signal during hypercapnia challenge via 2 methods, the breath holding and the Douglas bag methods. We will test intersessional validity of the NIRS-hypercapnia challenge in the first 20 (10 TBI and 10 non-TBI) subjects who are willing to return for a second visit of repeat testing. The NIRS system is composed of 4 light sources and 10 detectors with a 16 point configuration system applied on the forehead of the subject. In our experiment, light intensity collected at each detector will be transformed into a signal related to the local concentrations of oxy- and de-oxyhemoglobin during the challenge. Each experiment will give a set of subject data, consisting of the peak amplitude and time-to-peak of the hemodynamic signals measured.</detailed_description>
