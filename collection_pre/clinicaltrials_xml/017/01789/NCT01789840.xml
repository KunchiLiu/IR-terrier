	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate improvement of symptoms from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) as assessed by the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) for prostatic artery embolization (PAE) using Embosphere Microspheres compared to conventional transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).</brief_summary>

Patient has a prostate size of at least 50 grams and not more than 90 grams, measured by MRI 6. Patient has BPH symptoms refractory to medical treatment or for whom medication is contraindicated, not tolerated or refused 7. Patient must be a candidate for TURP 8. Patient must meet ONE of the following criteria: Baseline Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) &lt;2.5 ng/mL (no prostate biopsy required) Baseline PSA &gt;2.5 ng/mL and ≤10 ng/mL AND free PSA &gt; 25% of total PSA (no prostate biopsy required) Baseline PSA &gt;2.5 ng/mL and ≤10 ng/mL AND free PSA &lt; 25% of total PSA AND a negative prostate biopsy result (minimum 12 core biopsy) Baseline PSA &gt;10 ng/mL AND a negative prostate biopsy (minimum 12 core biopsy) 1.

Biopsy proven prostate or bladder cancer, or any cancer other than basal or squamous cell skin cancer The following patients must undergo prostate biopsy with a minimum of 12 cores and have a negative histopathology report to be enrolled in the study: Patients with digital rectal examination (DRE) findings suspicious for prostate cancer Patients with baseline PSA levels &gt; 10 ng/mL Patients with baseline PSA levels &gt;2.5 ng/mL and &lt; 10ng/mL AND free PSA &lt; 25% of total PSA Patients with cystoscopy findings suspicious for bladder cancer must undergo biopsy and have a negative histopathology report to be enrolled in the study 3. Bladder atonia, neurogenic bladder disorder or other neurological disorder that is impacting bladder function (eg multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injuries, etc) 4. Urethral stricture, bladder neck contracture, sphincter abnormalities, urinary obstruction due to causes other than BPH, or other potentially confounding bladder or urethral disease or condition 5. Patient has taken beta blockers, antihistamines, anticonvulsants, or antispasmodics within 1 week of study treatment AND has not been on the same drug dosage for 6 months with a stable voiding pattern • Dosage of these medications should not change during study participation unless medically necessary 6. Patient has taken antidepressants, anticholinergics, androgens or gonadotropinreleasing hormonal analogues within 2 months of study treatment AND has not been on the same drug dosage for at least 3 months with a stable voiding pattern 7. Patient has taken 5alpha reductase inhibitors or alpha blockers within 1 month of study treatment AND has not been on the same drug dosage for at least 3 months with a stable voiding pattern 8.

Unable to have MRI imaging (eg metal implant including pacemaker, replacement joint, etc) 12. Patient has an asymmetric prostate, with &gt; 20% difference in size between lobes 13. Cardiac condition including congestive heart failure or arrhythmia, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, significant respiratory disease or known immunosuppression which required hospitalization within the previous 6 months 14. Baseline serum creatinine level &gt; 1.8 mg/dl 15. Known upper tract renal disease 16. Cystolithiasis or chronic hematuria within 3 months prior to study treatment 17. Active prostatitis 18.
