	<brief_summary>In diabetes, the honeymoon period is characterized by the presence of a functional reserve of Î²-cells that favours an adequate metabolic control and low insulin needs in order to control glycaemia. Therefore, the extension of this period could have evident benefits in diabetes management. The investigators aimed to study the influence of regular physical activity on the prolongation of the honeymoon period</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Regular Physical Exercise Extends Honeymoon Phase in Type 1 Diabetes Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Observational study of two groups of type 1 diabetic patients from onset to a two-year period. One group exercised regularly (5 or more hours/week) before onset and continued doing so with the same regularity (group A). The second group either did not perform physical activity or did so sporadically (group S). Consultations were initially performed on a weekly basis for the first month, then once a month for the remaining period. In each consultation, patients were asked about diet accomplishment, glycaemia monitoring, insulin injections and exercise performance. All individuals from group A declared to practice regularly intervallic routines, playing team sports (basketball for n=1 and soccer for n=6). Only one individual declared to perform aerobic exercise (long distance running and swimming). At the end of the first year a second blood sample was extracted in the same conditions from each individual to determine the same parameters. Exercise routine accomplishment and follow-up of diet and insulin injections was followed monthly during one more year. At the end of this period, the study was considered finished and the last blood extraction was performed in order to measure the same parameters. Other subjects were excluded because they were not capable to provide data required for study follow up.</detailed_description>
