	<brief_summary>In an attempt to reduce the risk for anastomotic leakage after low anterior resection it is common to create a diverting stoma at the same procedure. Several studies have shown that ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery)application reduces the risk of surgical stress and postoperative complications after major colorectal surgery. The aim of this study is to evaluate wether a diverting stoma, after low anterior resection for rectal cancer, affects postoperative morbidity in patients treated within an ERAS program.</brief_summary>
