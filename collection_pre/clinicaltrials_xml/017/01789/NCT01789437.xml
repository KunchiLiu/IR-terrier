	<criteria>ability to provide written informed consent and comply with study assessments for the full duration of the study; age &gt; 20 years; decreased visual acuity as a result of clinically detectable ME associated with either CRVO or BRVO; the duration of macular edema was required to be between 4 and 24 weeks for both CRVO and BRVO; retinal thickness in the central subfield (as measured using optical coherence tomography) had to be &gt; 350 Âµm in the study eye. the exclusion criteria were as follows: diabetes; previous intravitreal antiVEGF therapy or intravitreal steroid therapy; previous photodynamic therapy or focal laser; active retinal or optic disc neovascularization; active or history of choroidal neovascularization; presence of rubeosis iridis; any active infection; glaucoma, current ocular hypertension, or a history of steroidinduced intraocular pressure (IOP) increase in either eye; or concurrent eye disease in the study eye that could compromise visual acuity (e.g., choroidal neovascularization, diabetic retinopathy, epiretinal membrane).</criteria>
