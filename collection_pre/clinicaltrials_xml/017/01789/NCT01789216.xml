	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to definitively resolve questions regarding the use of multimodal pharmacologic pain management for orthopedic trauma patients in the context of a multicenter, randomized clinical trial. Also, as a significant proportion of this population develops chronic post traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA), a sub-objective of this study is to examine the etiology and incidence of chronic pain and PTOA in this population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Pain Management and Long Term Outcomes Following High Energy Orthopedic Trauma (Pain Study)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this study, will test whether adjunctive analgesic therapy during the pre and peri-operative period, in addition to standard of care pain management, can improve overall pain control and pain related outcomes without increasing analgesic related side effects. Patients will be randomized into three treatment groups. The intervention will begin within 48 hours of admission and continue for no longer than two weeks or up to the time of definitive fixation. Group 1: standard pain management, plus up to two weeks of oral placebo, plus intravenous and oral placebo for 48 hours at each surgical procedure. Group 2: standard pain management, plus up to two weeks of oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (meloxicam), plus intravenous NSAIDs (ketorolac) and oral placebo for 48 hours at each surgical procedure. Group 3: standard pain management, plus up to two weeks of oral pregabalin, plus intravenous placebo and oral pregabalin for 48 hours at each surgical procedure. Specific Aim 1: Evaluate the effect of standard pain management (Group 1) vs. standard pain management plus pre and peri-operative NSAIDs (Group 2 - meloxicam + ketorolac) in the treatment of severe lower limb fractures. Hypothesis 1a: When compared to patients who received standard of care pain management, patients treated with NSAIDs will: (1) have reduced post operative opioid utilization; (2) report reduced levels of persistent pain; and (3) have noninferior rates of surgery for nonunion. Hypothesis 1b: When compared to patients who received standard of care pain management, patients treated with NSAIDs will benefit from (1) improved post operative pain control; (2) improved pre operative pain control; (3) reduced lengths of stay; (4) reduced pain interference; (5) improved functional outcomes; (6) lower levels of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); (7) improved overall health status; and (8) have noninferior rates of analgesic treatment related side effects. Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the effect of standard pain management (Group 1) vs. standard pain management plus pre and peri-operative pregabalin (Group 3) in the treatment of severe lower limb fractures. Hypothesis 2a : When compared to patients who received standard of care pain management, patients treated with pregabalin will: (1) have reduced post operative opioid utilization; (2) report reduced levels of persistent pain; and (3) have noninferior rates of surgery for nonunion. Hypothesis 2b: When compared to patients who received standard of care pain management, patients treated with pregabalin will benefit from (1) improved post operative pain control; (2) improved pre operative pain control; (3) reduced lengths of stay; (4) reduced pain interference; (5) improved functional outcomes; (6) lower levels of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); (7) improved overall health status; and (8) have noninferior rates of analgesic treatment related side effects. Specific Aim 3: Estimate the incremental cost effectiveness of each adjunctive analgesic therapy relative to standard of care analgesic therapy in the treatment of severe lower limb fractures. Costs will be estimated from both the health care provider perspective and the societal perspective. The time horizon for cost-effectiveness analysis will be based on the actual period of observation . Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will be calculated for: (a) study group 2 (NSAIDS - meloxicam + ketorolac) relative to standard of care; and (b) study group 3 (pregabalin) relative to standard of care. For purpose of cost-effectiveness analysis, the effect will be measured as unit change in specific outcome metrics at 12 months (or longer period as available) compared to baseline. The following cost-effectiveness metrics, all relative to standard of care, will be reported: 1. incremental cost per unit change in the Brief Pain Inventory 2. incremental cost per unit change in the Short Muscular Function Assessment (SFMA) 3. incremental cost per unit change in health state preference ("utility") as derived from the VR-12 PTOA Pilot Study: Additional funding was received from NIH to conduct a pilot, observational study of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA), leveraging current resources of the Pain study. PTOA is an important outcome in the population to be enrolled in the Pain study. The aims of the PTOA Study are to: (1) measure the incidence of PTOA and chronic pain for up to 24 months following fracture reduction surgery and (2) quantify the extent to which fracture severity and post-reduction contact stress are related to the development of PTOA. Accomplishment of these aims will require (1) for all patients in the Pain study: complete a PTOA survey at 12 months and at any subsequent visits that are conducted as part of standard of care and provide access to all standard of care imaging studies completed during the study period and (2) for a subset of 60 pilon fracture patients enrolled in the Pain study for whom post-operative CT scans are not standard of care, obtain additional consent for completion of a study-funded post-operative CT scan and 24 month radiographic study.</detailed_description>
