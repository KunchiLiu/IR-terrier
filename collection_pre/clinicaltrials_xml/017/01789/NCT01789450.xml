	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and sensitivity of nipple-areolar complex (NAC) prospectively due to the section of the dermis after decortication (Schwartzmann's maneuver), in 50 patients undergoing breast reduction surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nipple-Areola Complex Sensitivity After the Section of Periareolar Dermis in Breast Reduction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preservation of the dermis after decortication regions of the areola and periareolar is considered relevant by most plastic surgeons. In patients whose CAP should be mobilized through large distances in order to correct breast ptosis, or in cases of dense breasts where noted little slip of skin over the breast parenchyma, the periareolar dermis causes limitation on the mobility of the NAC. In clinical practice, there is a greater mobilization of NAC when making a careful section of the dermis after decortication. In contrast, the appearance of partial necrosis in these cases has become a rarity, as no case of total necrosis was observed. Given the technical benefit observed due to greater mobilization, there is no report in the literature about how behaves the sensitivity of the NAC in these cases. To evaluate the sensitivity of the NAC will be used Semmes-Weisnstein's monofilament. Each point will be obtained five measurements. The largest will be scorned and the lowest value. The final value of each point corresponds to an arithmetic mean of the three remaining values.</detailed_description>
