	<brief_summary>This Pilot study is a Multicenter, Randomized Trial comparing autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP) versus autologous whole blood versus dry needle tendon fenestration on pain and quality of life in patients with lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow). We want to find out if pain and mobility are improved in people who receive an injection of PRP compared to a group of people who receive an injection of whole blood, a group treated with dry needle tendon fenestration and a group of people who receive no injection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Platelet Rich Plasma Over Alternative Therapies in Patients With Lateral Epicondylitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Platelet rich plasma (PRP) deserves study because it is more expensive than the other treatments. If we learn that PRP is better compared to the other treatments, it would justify the high cost and growing industry associated with the procedure. If we find out that PRP is not better compared to the other treatments, there is the potential to save the health care system millions of dollars. We hope to show that we can recruit eligible participants and and complete the treatment and tests to answer the questions regarding the effectiveness of platelet rich plasma for patients with tennis elbow.</detailed_description>
