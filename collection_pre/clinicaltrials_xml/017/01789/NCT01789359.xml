	<brief_summary>Essentially all of the published data on anthocyanin absorption in humans are from short term studies - a few days or less, most typically 24 h. However human studies demonstrating clinical effects are typically conducted for several weeks or even months. To examine how anthocyanin absorption and metabolism may be affected this study will examine urinary excretion of anthocyanins over one month, followed by a one week washout, and then one more dose of blueberry juice.</brief_summary>
