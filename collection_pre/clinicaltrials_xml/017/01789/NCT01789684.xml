	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Multi-faceted provider education and decision support intervention will increase the rate of appropriate referral of breast cancer patients at increased risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) to genetic counseling. PURPOSE: This cluster randomized controlled trial will compare active and passive interventions to increase the rate of appropriate genetic counseling referrals of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients at increased risk for HBOC to genetic counseling in the community oncology setting.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cluster Randomized Trial Comparing Interventions to Enhance Genetic Counseling Among Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 5-10% of all breast cancer patients have hereditary breast cancer, the majority due to an inherited mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes (BRCA mutation carriers). Breast cancer patients who are BRCA mutation carriers have up to a 65% risk for a new primary breast cancer in the future. Additionally, BRCA mutation carriers have a 10-45% lifetime risk for ovarian cancer. Effective options to decrease these high future cancer risks are available to breast cancer patients who learn they carry a BRCA mutation - including prophylactic mastectomy and oophorectomy. Prophylactic mastectomy and oophorectomy reduce the risks for future primary breast cancer and ovarian cancer, respectively, by more than 90%. Because of the high risks for future cancer and the opportunity for effective risk reduction among mutation carriers, national guidelines consistently recommend referral of breast cancer patients at increased risk for hereditary breast cancer and ovarian cancer (HBOC) to genetic counseling by a qualified genetics professional. Lack of implementation of this standard of care constitutes an error of omission and jeopardizes patient outcomes. We propose a cluster randomized controlled trial to compare a "passive intervention" - dissemination of professional guidelines - with an "active intervention" - a multi-faceted provider education and decision support intervention to improve 1) appropriate referral of breast cancer patients at risk for HBOC to genetic counseling in the community cancer center setting and 2) pre-surgical referral among newly diagnosed patients. Ultimately, these results will lead to decreased breast and ovarian cancer incidence and mortality among breast cancer patients and their family members, as well as improved outcomes of and satisfaction with surgical decision-making.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participant Females 18 years of age or greater Newly diagnosed primary breast cancer prior to initial definitive surgical treatment, including In situ and Invasive cancer, Stages 0 III. Pathologic confirmation of diagnosis is required. Able to read and write in English or Spanish Participant Any previous diagnosis of cancer except for nonmelanoma skin cancer Stage IV breast cancer Received HBOC genetic counseling or mutation testing prior to diagnosis. If the patient was previously tested only for a variant of uncertain clinical significance (i.e., not for known familial mutation, Jewish ethnicity panel/Multisite 3 or comprehensive sequencing) and documentation is provided, they remain eligible.</criteria>
