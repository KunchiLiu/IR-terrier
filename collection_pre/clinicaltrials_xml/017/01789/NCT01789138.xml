	<brief_title>Adherence Support Intervention for Persons Living With HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) on Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) in Estonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific antiretroviral therapy (ART) can suppress HIV replication and consequently preserve the functioning of immune system. ART is a lifelong treatment with several different concomitantly administered oral medications. According to studies, low adherence to treatment is directly related to knowledge and beliefs about ART. Studies have shown the success of different interventions increasing adherence to ART, but additional studies need to be carried out in order to determine the most effective components of the interventions and the methods most suitable considering the local context, that could be easily incorporated into the working routine of an medical institution (clinic) with limited extra resources. Primary locations to implement activities directed at improving treatment adherence are medical institutions, i.e. the departments of infectious diseases where persons living with HIV/AIDS receive their ART. The aim of the study is to conduct a small-scale intervention (randomised controlled) study implementing a brief adherence counseling targeting persons receiving ART.</detailed_description>
