	<brief_summary>The study will look at conducting a medium-intense walking program called Walk With Ease with cancer patients age 60 and above who are starting chemotherapy treatment. We will measure how many of these patients complete their participation in this program.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility of an Evidence-based Walking Program in Cancer Pts 60+ During Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of implementing a moderate-intensity walking program (Walk With Ease/WWE) among cancer patients, age ≥60 years, as they undergo cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment. Feasibility will be determined based on the rate of participation in the WWE program. As secondary objectives, we will also establish the rate of completion of a number of instruments, including a Geriatric Assessment tool, and other instruments that measure self-reported quality of life (e.g., fatigue, depression, and pain), and self-reported physical activity (PA). Data from these instruments, as well as from serial measurements of a biomarker of aging (p16INK4a) will be explored and used to inform future studies designed to evaluate any relationship between these variables and participation in the WWE program. We propose a sample (n=30) of cancer patients ≥60 years of age with potentially curable cancer and a diagnosis of Stage I-III breast cancer, Stage I-III lung cancer, or Stage II-III colon cancer, who are about to begin chemotherapy. Participation will be defined as completing the 6-week WWE program. Results from this study will be used in an RO1 application to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) pertaining to PA interventions among cancer patients and the effects of biomarkers on prognosis and survival.</detailed_description>
