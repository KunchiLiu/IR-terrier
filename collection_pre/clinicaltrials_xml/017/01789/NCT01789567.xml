	<brief_title>Engager Direct Aortic Clinical Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To confirm the safety and performance of the Medtronic Engager™ Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation System via direct aortic approach in patients with symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis at high or extreme risk for surgical aortic valve replacement for which treatment via direct aortic access is preferred.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Aortic Valve Stenosis</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Severe aortic stenosis as defined by Doppler echocardiography: aortic valve area ≤ 0.8 cm2 (or AVA index ≤ 0.5 cm2/m2), or mean gradient ≥ 40 mmHg, or max velocity ≥ 4m/s NYHA Functional Class II or greater; Logistic EuroSCORE I ≥ 20%, or comorbidity judged by the heart team to pose an absolute or relative contraindication for conventional aortic valve replacement; Age ≥ 18 years; The patient has been informed of the nature of the study and has consented to participate, authorizing the collection and release of his/her medical information by signing a consent form ("Patient Informed Consent Form"). Patient should understand the implications of participating in the study and should be legally competent to provide informed consent. Unicuspid or bicuspid aortic valve; Echocardiographic evidence of intracardiac mass, thrombus, or vegetation; Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 25%; Left ventricular outflow obstruction, such as Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy and severe septal hypertrophy; Mitral or tricuspid regurgitation greater than 2+ by angiography or moderate by echocardiography; Patients with life expectancy less than 12 months due to an underlying noncardiac comorbid disease; Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, Nitinol or contrast medium that cannot be adequately controlled with premedication; Sepsis or acute endocarditis; Blood dyscrasia such as acute anemia, leucopenia, or thrombocytopenia; bleeding diathesis, or coagulopathy; Renal insufficiency assessed by creatinine clearance &lt; 20 ml/min and/or endstage renal disease requiring chronic dialysis; Active peptic ulcer or GI bleeding within 3 months from the planned index procedure; Untreated clinically significant coronary artery disease requiring revascularization; Cardiogenic shock, suspected cardiogenic shock, or hemodynamic instability requiring inotropic support or mechanical heart assistance; Significant aortic disease, including abdominal and thoracic aortic aneurysm, defined as maximal luminal diameter of 5 cm or greater; Need for emergency surgery, cardiac or noncardiac; History of myocardial infarction in the last 6 weeks; History of TIA or CVA in the last 6 months; Therapeutic invasive cardiac procedure, with the exception of BAV, performed within 30 days of the planned date of valve implantation, or 6 months in the case of drugeluting stents; Preexisting prosthetic heart valve or prosthetic ring in any position; Patient refuses a blood transfusion; Patient is currently enrolled in another investigational device or drug trial that may influence the outcome of this trial.</criteria>
