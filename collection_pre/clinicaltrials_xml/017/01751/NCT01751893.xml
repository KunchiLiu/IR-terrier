	<brief_summary>The palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) is the only clinical adverse event that commonly occurs with capecitabine and/or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin treatment and it warrants special attention because it is the most common dose-limiting toxicity. this study is designed to test the effectiveness of a henna treatment protocol in the management of capecitabine and/or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin induced palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Testing the Effectiveness of Henna on Managing PPE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study with 80 cancer patients that will receive chemotherapy treatment with capecitabine and/or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. The selection of potential participants will be based on pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients will be randomly allocated either to the treatment group or the placebo group. Treatment will be delivered twice a week and assessments will take place at 0, 3, 4 and 5 weeks. The intervention group will receive the application of henna to the hands and/or feet of the patients and the control group will receive the placebo. At both baseline and follow-up, patients in both groups will be assessed for their degree of palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, the Quality of Life, the need for dose-limiting due to PPE and Pain intensity using standardized rating scales. Data will be analysed with inferential and descriptive statistics.</detailed_description>
