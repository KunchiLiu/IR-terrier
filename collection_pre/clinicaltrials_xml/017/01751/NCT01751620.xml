	<brief_summary>The proposed study is a two-group randomized repeated measures design that will examine the efficacy of Project ACCEPT (Adolescents Coping, Connecting, Empowering and Protecting Together) to improve engagement in care among youth newly diagnosed with HIV at five AMTU sites across the United States. Youth will be randomized into one of two study arms; Project ACCEPT, the intervention, or HEALTH, the health education attention-controlled comparison condition. Both arms consist of two individual sessions followed by six group sessions and a final individual session which is expected to take approximately nine weeks after which youth will have four follow-up visits at the following time points: - post intervention (immediately after the last session); - 3 months post the last session; - 6 months post the last session; and - 12 months post the last session. The trial will be repeated in up to three waves.</brief_summary>
