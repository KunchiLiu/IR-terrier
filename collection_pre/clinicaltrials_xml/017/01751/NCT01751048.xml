	<brief_summary>Investigational products: LEISH-F3 (recombinant protein antigen) + GLA-SE (adjuvant) leishmaniasis vaccine and LEISH-F3 (recombinant protein antigen) + MPL-SE (adjuvant) leishmaniasis vaccine. Stage of development: Phase 1 clinical development. Healthy adult subjects, 18 to 49 will be recruited through a U.S. site. Primary objective: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the LEISH-F3 + GLA-SE vaccine and the LEISH-F3 + MPL-SE vaccine following intramuscular (IM) administration of 20 µg of LEISH-F3 together with 2 or 5 µg of GLA-SE or 10 µg of MPL-SE on Days 0, 28, and 168. Secondary objective: To assess the immunogenicity of LEISH-F3 formulated with GLA-SE, MPL-SE, or SE by evaluating IgG antibody responses to LEISH-F3 at Days 0, 28, 56, 168, 196, and 365, and T cell responses to LEISH-F3 at Days 0, 14, 42, 168, 182, and 365.

	<brief_title>LEISH-F3 + GLA-SE and the LEISH-F3 + MPL-SE Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania. The parasites are transmitted from an animal or human reservoir through the bite of infected female phlebotomine sand flies. This study is a randomized, open-label clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the LEISH-F3 recombinant protein antigen formulated with GLA-SE, MPL-SE, or SE adjuvant in healthy adults 18 to 49 years of age. Each subject's duration of participation will be about 18 months. Subjects will receive a total of 3 doses of vaccine, which will be given by intramuscular injection on Days 0, 28, and 168. The volume of each vaccine dose will be 0.5 mL. A computerized system will be used to acquire any data regarding halting criteria throughout the study. Primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of LEISH-F3 formulated with GLA-SE, MPL-SE, or SE following intramuscular administration of 20 µg of LEISH-F3 together with 5 µg of GLA-SE, 10 µg of MPL-SE, or SE alone. Secondary objective is to assess the immunogenicity of LEISH-F3 formulated with GLA-SE, MPL-SE, or SE by evaluating IgG antibody responses to LEISH-F3 at Days 0, 28, 56, 168, 196, and 365, and T cell responses to LEISH-F3 at Days 0, 14, 42, 168, 182, and 365. A substudy will be performed using up to 12 subjects from each Study Group (Groups 1, 2 and 3) and an additional 12 subjects to serve as controls. This substudy will investigate whether, as in murine cells, cell surface markers (CD11a, CD49d) can be used as a surrogate to identify protective immune CD4+ T cells in human subjects receiving a vaccine antigen.</detailed_description>

In good health, as judged by the investigator and determined by vital signs [temperature &lt; 38 degrees Celsius, heart rate &lt;/= 100 bpm and &gt; 50 bpm, systolic blood pressure &lt;/= 140 mmHg and &gt; 89 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure &lt;/= 90 mmHg and &gt;/= 60 mm Hg, medical history and a targeted physical examination. Athletically trained subjects with a pulse &gt;/= 45 may be enrolled at the discretion of the principal investigator or designated licensed clinical investigator]. 4. Screening laboratory values must be within normal limits. These include blood hemoglobin, white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil count, platelets, creatinine, AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase), ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase), bilirubin (total), glucose (random, must be less than 140), and urine dipstick for protein and glucose. Note: trace proteinuria is acceptable; creatinine, AST, ALT, and bilirubin values lower than the normal range are acceptable. The following serology tests must be negative: HIV (Human immunodeficiency virus) ( 1/2 antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody.

Willing to abstain from donating whole blood or blood derivatives until 90 days after the final study vaccination. Eligibility Criteria for Doses 2 and 3 Subjects must meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria as outlined in sections 5.1 and 5.2 with the exception of clinical safety lab values. Subjects with safety laboratory values that meet Grade 2 or greater severity (according to the toxicity table, Appendix C), that do not return to the protocoldefined normal range prior to the second or third vaccination will not be eligible to receive additional doses of study vaccine.
