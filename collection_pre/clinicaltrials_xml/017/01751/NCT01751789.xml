	<brief_title>Linking Opioid Dependent Patients From Inpatient Detoxification to Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this randomized trial, consenting individuals seeking inpatient opioid detoxification will be assigned to one of two groups. The first group will receive a tapering schedule of buprenorphine during inpatient detoxification to alleviate acute withdrawal symptoms, and referral to a community medical and substance abuse treatment providers (DETOX). The second group will also receive buprenorphine to relieve withdrawal symptoms, but will maintain a stable dose of buprenorphine through inpatient discharge and linkage to an appointment with a primary care provider within a week of discharge (LINKAGE). All participants complete study assessments at baseline, 1-month, 3-months and 6-months post-enrollment. The SSTAR inpatient detoxification program based in Fall River, Massachusetts will serve as the recruitment site of this trial. SSTAR's program has 38 beds and is a 24-hour medically and psychiatrically supervised treatment facility that provides evaluation and withdrawal management. The SSTAR Family Healthcare Center is a 330 Federally Qualified facility also in Fall River that provides primary care and behavioral health services to residents of Community Health Network Area 25 (Fall River, Somerset, Swansea and Westport, Massachusetts). Dr. Bailey, Director of Research at SSTAR, will oversee the provision of buprenorphine treatment to study participants during detoxification and serve as liaison to the primary care providers at the Family Healthcare Center.</detailed_description>
