	<detailed_description>The aim of this study is to generate dengue disease burden data including estimates of incidence rates, prevalence data and the clinical presentation of dengue across different age groups. The study will be conducted in at least three cities: Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, and Manaus. This study will also prepare potential sites for future clinical trials, by setting up the logistics and training staff on site to enroll a cohort of subjects perform dengue surveillance and other study procedures. Households will be randomly selected from communities where a registry system is implemented. All individuals in the household will be eligible for participating in the study. This study will be sponsored by GSK and co-funded by GSK and Fiocruz. As study sponsor, GSK will delegate some activities to Fiocruz, according to the provisions in their Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA).</detailed_description>
