	<brief_title>Choline PET/CT and MRI for Targeted Prostate Biopsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an explorative diagnostic basic research study to assess the value of 18F-choline PET/CT and multi-sequence MRI for prostate cancer in patients undergoing diagnostic prostate biopsy. Patients will receive image-guided (targeted) prostate biopsies and metabolomic profiling of prostate biopsy tissues to evaluate underlying metabolic changes in comparison with pathological Gleason grading.</detailed_description>
