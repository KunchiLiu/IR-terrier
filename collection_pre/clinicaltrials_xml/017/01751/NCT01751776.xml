	<brief_summary>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of BI 655064 administered subcutaneously in healthy volunteers (HVs) and in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. To explore the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters of multiple doses of BI 655064 in healthy volunteers (HVs) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. To assess clinical effect of BI 655064 in RA patients with prior inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX) after 12 weeks of treatment</brief_summary>

For patients who do not tolerate the minimum weekly dose of at least 15 mg due to side effects, a stable weekly dose as low as 7.5 mg is also permitted. 4.

Serum CRP level &gt;= 0.8 mg/dL or ESR &gt;= 28 mm/1h at screening 6. AntiCCP2 or Rheumatoid Factor positivity as per the limits of used assay at screening 7. Female patients who meet any of the following criteria from at least 30 days before the first study drug administration and until at least 6 months after last dose of MTX taken in the current trial: using adequate contraception, e.g. any of the following methods plus condom: implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, intrauterine device (IUD) sexually abstinent have a vasectomised sexual partner (vasectomy at least 1 year prior to enrolment) surgically sterilised (including hysterectomy) postmenopausal defined as at least 1 year of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) above 40 U/L and estradiol below 30 ng/L is confirmatory) OR Male patients who: are documented to be sterile or consistently and correctly use a condom while their female partners (if of childbearing potential) agree to use any of the following adequate contraception methods: implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, intrauterine device (IUD) from the date of screening until at least 6 months after the last dose of MTX taken in the current trial don¿t donate any sperm sample for procreation purposes, from the date of screening until at least 6 months after last dose of MTX taken in the current trial. 8.

Subject is assessed by the investigator as unsuitable for inclusion e.g. considered not able to understand and comply with study requirements or has a condition that would not allow safe participation in the study 19. Positive pregnancy test, pregnancy or plans to become pregnant within 30 days after study completion 20. Lactation Further exclusion criteria applicable for part 1 only are given in the CTP. Part 2 (phase IIa in RA patients): Part 1 (phase Ib) exclusion criteria 7, 9, 12, 13 and 1720 plus: 1. Current or previous use of more than two antiTNF biologic drugs or use of other biologic agent targeting any other approved mechanism (any biologic drug with mechanism of action other than direct antiTNF blockade, (e.g. CTLA4, antiIL6, or anti CD20) or new oral compounds targeting any other approved mechanism (e.g. JAK inhibitors) for treating RA. 2.
