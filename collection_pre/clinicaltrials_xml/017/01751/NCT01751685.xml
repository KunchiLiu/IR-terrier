	<brief_summary>We propose to conduct a randomized, controlled trial among 100 men and women aged 60 or older with hyperkyphosis to an exercise intervention that includes kyphosis-specific spinal muscle strengthening exercises compared to a usual care control group. The study will be conducted in five waves,with 10 participants in the exercise intervention and 10 participants in the control group in each wave.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Hyperkyphosis, Exercise and Function-SHEAF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The experimental interventions will be provided in small groups meeting three sessions per week for 6 months. At baseline and 6 months after the intervention, we will measure kyphosis, physical function, spine muscle strength and density, and quality of life. We will assess the effect of the intervention on the co-primary outcomes of kyphosis, modified Physical Performance Test (PPT) and gait speed measured as change over 6 months. We will also assess the effect of the intervention on secondary outcomes of physical function and health-related quality of life, measured as change in Timed Up and Go, Timed Loaded Standing, Six-Minute Timed Walk, the Scoliosis Research Society SRS-30, PROMISe Global Health and physical function and PACE questionnaires. Furthermore, we will investigate whether changes in kyphosis, spinal muscle strength and/or density mediate the effect of the intervention on change in physical function. After the 6-month intervention, both groups will continue their usual activity and we will assess the durability of the effects of the intervention at 1-year follow-up.</detailed_description>
