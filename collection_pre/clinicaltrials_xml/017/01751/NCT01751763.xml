	<brief_summary>Radical hepatic resection represents one of the treatment options offering a prospect for cure with 5-year survival rates up to 50%. However, unintentionally, quite a proportion of these "radical resection" actually turned out to be non-radical in nature. For these patients who actually received non-radical resection, their by year survival rates were much lower than those who received radical hepatectomy. In this prospective, non-interventional, multi-center study, we are planning to observe the patient characteristics of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who have residual disease after resection with curative intent, as well as treatment pattern, safety and effectiveness of sorafenib for these patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib for Residue Disease After Resection With Curative Intent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Carcinoma, Hepatocellular</mesh_term>
	<mesh_term>Sorafenib</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patients with histologically confirmed HCC and have residual disease after resection with curative intent and for whom a decision to treat with Sorafenib has been made. The definitions of nonradical resection are as follows: Liver tumor rupture or adjacent organ invasion, confirmed by intraoperative or postoperative pathology; Positive resection margin, confirmed by post operative pathology; Lymph node metastasis confirmed by intraoperative or post operative pathology; Residue lesion confirmed by postoperative digital subtraction angiography (DSA); Macroscopic/microscopic tumor thrombi of vein and/or bile duct, confirmed intraoperative / postoperative pathology; Number of tumors &gt;=3, confirmed by preoperative radiographic inspection (CT, MRI or BUS), intraoperative BUS, or postoperative pathology. AFP alpha fetoprotein(AFP) remains higher than Upper Limits of Normal (according to local lab's range), confirmed by local laboratory test at least 2 months after surgery. Confirmation of complete response (no visible residual tumor), on the eligibility scan (CT or MRI) by local radiological review, performed &gt;2 weeks after surgery; Patients must be followed up regularly after surgery (time interval and method based on physician's daily practice), have no documented tumor recurrence by eligibility scan (CT or MRI) before Sorafenib treatment; Patients must have physically/mentally recovered from surgery and considered to be able to tolerant Sorafenib therapy, by investigator's judgment; The approved local product label must be followed for the exclusion criteria</criteria>
