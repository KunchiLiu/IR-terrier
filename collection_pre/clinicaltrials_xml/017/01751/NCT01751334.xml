	<brief_summary>The anatomic landmark for the anteroposterior (AP) axis of the proximal tibia and its variability was investigated in this study in order to determine whether a certain landmark could be employed as a reference axis for the proximal tibia after rotating platform mobile bearing (RP-MB) and fixed bearing (FB) total knee arthroplasties (TKAs).</brief_summary>
