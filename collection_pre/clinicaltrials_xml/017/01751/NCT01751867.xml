	<brief_title>An Effectiveness and Safety Study of Decitabine in Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective (look forward using periodic observations collected predominantly following patient enrollment), open-label (all people involved in the study know the identity of the assigned drug), Phase IIIb study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of decitabine in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Patients are randomized (study drug assigned by chance) in 1:1 ratio to receive treatment with decitabine either 3-day or 5-day course of therapy. When a minimum of 30 patients are reached for 3-day course of therapy, the rest of the patients will all be enrolled into 5-day course of therapy. Each patient in the study treated for a minimum of 4 cycles; however, a complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles. The entire study duration for each patient will be approximately two years. Safety will be evaluated for each patient by monitoring of adverse events, physical examinations, vital signs measurements, electrocardiogram, hematology and clinical chemistry testing.</detailed_description>
