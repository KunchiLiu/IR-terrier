	<brief_summary>The potential for a drug interaction between Darapladib and Rosuvastatin is felt to be low and it would be helpful to quantify this risk in man in order to guide prescribing physicians. The primary aims of this study are to estimate the potential effects of repeat doses of Darapladib on the PK of Rosuvastatin as well as evaluating safety and tolerability. Two part approaches are planned for this study. Part A of the study will examine the effects of repeat doses Darapladib on the PK of Rosuvastatin in healthy volunteers of Caucasian descent. Based on whether a significant increase in Rosuvastatin exposure is observed in Caucasians in Part A, a decision will be made regarding whether to proceed with a conditional Part B to examine this effect in healthy volunteers of Far-East Asian descent. In both parts, subjects will receive Rosuvastatin 10 milligrams (mg) once daily (QD) for 1 day during the first treatment period (Treatment Period 1), followed by a 4 day PK sampling period/wash-out. Subjects will then receive darapladib 160 mg QD for the next 10 days with 24-hour PK sampling on the last day (Day 14 of the study). Immediately following this, all subjects will then receive the combination of Darapladib 160 mg and Rosuvastatin 10 mg for 1 day and continued Darapladib dosing of 160 mg QD for additional 3 days (Treatment Period 2) while blood samples are collected to assess Rosuvastatin PK. Plasma samples collected on Day 15 will be analyzed for both Rosuvastatin and Darapladib concentrations. Subjects will be required to return to the unit approximately 10 to 14 days following the last dose of study medication for a clinic visit for assessments and then will return again at 35 Â±7 days following the last dose for the final follow-up visit of the study. The duration of each subject's participation in the study from screening to follow-up will be approximately three months. Approximately 18 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in Part A and another 18 subjects will be enrolled in Part B (if conducted) to complete dosing and all assessments.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. Male or female between 20 and 64 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. Subject must be of Caucasian or of FarEast Asian Descent. Far East Asian is defined as a person of selfreported Asian ancestry including that of Japanese, Korean or Chinese descent (which includes Taiwanese subjects) [for Part B only]. Far East Asian subjects must have been born in their native countries and have resided less than 10 years outside their native countries [for Part B only]. Far East Asian subjects must have maintained a lifestyle, including diet, without significant change since leaving his/her native country [for Part B only]. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone &gt; 40 milliliter of urine (MlU)/ milliliter (mL) and estradiol &lt; 40 picogram/mL (&lt;147 picomoles/liter is confirmatory] or Childbearing potential and is abstinent or agrees to use one of the contraception methods for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until followup. Body mass index within the range 19 to 37 kilogram/meter^2 (inclusive) A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 months of screening. Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones) A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen. A positive test for human immune virus (HIV) antibody History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as an average weekly intake of &gt;14 drinks for males or &gt;7 drinks for females. One drink is equivalent to 12 gram of alcohol: 12 ounces (360 mL) of beer, 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of 80 proof distilled spirits. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current study: Thirty days, 5 halflives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer). Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day. Unable to refrain from the use of prescription or nonprescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation. Where participation in a previous study or donor bank would result in donation of blood or blood products in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period. Requiring the use of oral or injectable strong cytochrom P3A4 inhibitors. Pregnant females as determined by positive human chorionic gonadotropin test at screening or prior to dosing. Lactating females. Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol. Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated. History of sensitivity to heparin or history of heparininduced thrombocytopenia. History of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid (resembling anaphylaxis) reactions Clinical criteria for diagnosing anaphylaxis or severe allergic responses. Consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit juice &gt;8 ounce within 7 days prior to the first dose of study medication</criteria>
