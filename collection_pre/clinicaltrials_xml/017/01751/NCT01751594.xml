	<brief_summary>The proposed research study aims to conduct a culturally-based secondary prevention intervention targeted toward HIV-positive Black young men who have sex with men (B-YMSM) to explore (1) feasibility and acceptability (Trial 1 and Trial 2) and (2) evidence of potential efficacy (Trial 2). The primary outcomes will be health promotion behaviors (i.e., treatment adherence, sexual risk reduction, reduction in substance use behaviors, and HIV status disclosure). Psychosocial factors (i.e. self-esteem, critical consciousness, and socio-political awareness) will be examined as secondary outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Testing a Secondary Prevention Intervention for HIV-Positive Black Young Men Who Have Sex With Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>First, the protocol team will finalize the development and manualization of Health 4 Life (H4L) a comparison intervention, which will serve as the basis of comparison for Mobilizing Our Voices for Empowerment (MOVE), the treatment intervention. H4L will be a health promotion and life skills intervention to account for time and attention. Following this the protocol team will then implement Trial 1. In this trial, the intervention specialist and a "peer buddy" (intervention co-facilitator) from one AMTU will conduct one wave of both MOVE and H4L. The team will then conduct an analysis of the process data and revise the two interventions (MOVE and H4L). Upon revising the interventions, the protocol team will implement Trial 2. In this trial, the protocol co-chairs and the interventionist from Trial 1 will train interventionists and peer buddies from four new AMTUs; these interventionists and peer buddies will run the revised MOVE and H4L interventions. Each site will be designated as either a treatment or comparison site, and they will conduct two waves of their assigned intervention. The team at that time will conduct data analyses and then modify and manualize the final version of MOVE and H4L.</detailed_description>
