	<brief_title>Additional Effect of Wound Infiltration After Cesarean Section With Optimal Standard Analgesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Continuous wound infiltration with local anaesthetic has been shown as a safe and opioid-sparing analgesic method after caesarean section with minimal standard analgesia. We aim to evaluate if this benefit remains when an optimal analgesia is used. Primary outcome is morphine consumption. Secondary outcomes is pain scores, maternal recovery including breastfeeding, side effects of morphine, nurse workload and maternal satisfaction. Patients scheduled for caesarean delivery will be eligible for the study. Patients with emergency caesarean delivery, contraindication to analgesic drugs, hemostasis disorder, ongoing infection, diabetes treated with insulin or chronic opioid use will be excluded from the study. One group will receive standard analgesia including celecoxib and intravenous morphine for 24 hours with Patient Controlled Analgesia pump. The other group will receive the same standard analgesia with additional levobupivacaine initial bolus followed by a continuous subfascial infiltration of 1.25 mg/ml at 5 ml/h for 48 hours through a multiperforated catheter connected to an elastomeric pump. Total morphine consumption, pain and any associated complications will be recorded for 72 hours. Women wil be asked to fulfill a questionnaire on the second day after cesarean section, assessing recovery, satisfaction and breastfeeding comfort.</detailed_description>
