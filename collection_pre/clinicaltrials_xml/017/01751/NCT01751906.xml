	<brief_summary>The ABSORB III RCT is a prospective randomized, single-blind, multi-center trial. It is the pivotal trial to support the US pre-market approval (PMA) of Absorb™ Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold (BVS). The ABSORB III includes additional two trials i.e. ABSORB III PK (pharmacokinetics) sub-study and ABSORB IV RCT trial which are maintained under one protocol because both trial designs are related, ABSORB IV is the continuation of ABSORB III and the data from ABSORB III and ABSORB IV will be pooled to support the ABSORB IV primary endpoint. Both the trials will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Absorb BVS.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>ABSORB III RCT: A. Primary Objective: The pivotal trial to support the US pre-market approval (PMA) of Absorb BVS. ABSORB III will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Absorb BVS System compared to the XIENCE in the treatment of subjects, including those with diabetes mellitus, with ischemic heart disease caused by up to two de novo native coronary artery lesions in separate epicardial vessels. B. Powered Secondary Objectives: 1. Lead-In Phase Objective: To evaluate the applicability and transferability of the didactic Absorb BVS physician training plan to US clinical practice. The lead-in phase is a non-randomized, single-arm, open label group of up to 50 subjects treated with Absorb BVS at up to 35 US sites. The Lead-In phase will enroll/register subjects prior to the randomization phase of ABSORB III. The Lead-In Phase allows the treatment of up to two de novo native coronary artery lesions in different epicardial vessels with reference vessel diameter (RVD) ≥ 2.75 mm to ≤ 3.25 mm and lesion lengths ≥ 8 to ≤ 14 mm. 2. Imaging Cohort Objective: To evaluate long-term vascular function and patency of the Absorb BVS treated segments compared to XIENCE treated segments in the treatment of subjects with ischemic heart disease caused by up to two de novo native coronary artery lesions in separate epicardial vessels. The imaging cohort-phase is a prospective, randomized (2:1 Absorb BVS to XIENCE), single-blind, multi-center trial, registering approximately 200 subjects. This includes 150 subjects for the angiographic/intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) endpoints analysis and approximately 50 subjects for optical coherence tomography (OCT) endpoints analysis. The 200 subjects are separate from the 2000 subjects included in the primary analysis. Data from two powered secondary endpoints from this cohort will support label claims of superiority of Absorb BVS as compared to XIENCE specific to vasomotion and late lumen enlargement. All other subjects in ABSORB III unless specified will receive treatment of up to two de novo native coronary artery lesions in different epicardial vessels with RVD ≥ 2.5 mm to ≤ 3.75 mm and lesion lengths ≤ 24 mm.</detailed_description>
