	<brief_summary>Adolescents receiving RRFT and their caregivers will report significantly fewer substance use problems (quantity of use, frequency of use, and abuse symptoms) during treatment and follow-up than control adolescents who receive Treatment as Usual (TAU). Adolescents receiving RRFT and their caregivers will report improvement in empirically-demonstrated risk and protective factors for substance use and abuse at the individual level (e.g., coping) and at each level of an adolescent's ecology (e.g., increased number of positive family activities, reduced family conflict, reduced number of peers who use drugs, improved school attendance, increased involvement in pro-social community activities) during treatment and follow-up than control adolescents who receive TAU. Adolescents receiving RRFT will experience less PTSD symptoms (per youth and caregiver reports) during treatment and follow-up than control adolescents who receive TAU. Adolescents receiving RRFT will report engaging in fewer risky sexual behaviors (e.g., increased condom use, fewer partners) during treatment and follow-up than control adolescents who receive TAU. Changes during treatment in family relations (familial cohesiveness and conflict, satisfaction with caregiver-youth relationship) and parenting practices (monitoring) will mediate changes in substance use. Changes during treatment in emotional reactivity will mediate changes in PTSD symptoms.</brief_summary>
