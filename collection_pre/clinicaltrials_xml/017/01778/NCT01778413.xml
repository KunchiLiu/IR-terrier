	<detailed_description>The main objective of this study is to determine the feasibility of maintaining virologic suppression on standard plasma viral load (limit of detection 37 copies / mL) of a dose reduction strategy of ATRIPLA ® once a day to three tablets per week in patients infected with HIV-1 with sustained suppression of plasma viral load standard for more than two years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adults (≥ 18 years) HIV1 infection, clinical stability, and treatment with ATRIPLA ® for the past two years. Standard plasma viral load below the limit of detection for at least 2 years. CD4 count above 350/mm3 at the time of the consideration for the study. Negative pregnancy test in women of childbearing age, and commitment acceptable contraceptive use for at least 2 weeks before day 1 and until at least 6 months after the last dose of study drug. Patients should be given written informed consent In the opinion of the investigator, be able to follow the design of the protocol visits Patients who have experienced virologic failure prior to any antiretroviral regimen Evidence of previous mutations versus efavirenz, tenofovir and emtricitabine Use of any other chronic treatment plus ATRIPLA has been introduced in the 6 months prior to entry of the patient in the study Any contraindication to study drug Any condition not ensure proper adherence to the study at the discretion of the attending physician of the patient Uncontrolled preexisting psychiatric illness Any current sign of alcoholism or other drug use.</criteria>
