	<brief_title>Indacaterol EfectIveness In COPD Patients With Tuberculosis History</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are few clinical studies in patients with COPD with destroyed lung by tuberculosis because tuberculosis patients are usually excluded from (phase II or III) clinical trials for drug registration although they are not prohibited from prescription of COPD drugs. This clinical study will assess efficacy and safety of indacaterol (150㎍ o.d.) in patients with COPD with destroyed lung by tuberculosis.</detailed_description>

Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or to drugs with similar chemical structures including untoward reactions to sympathomimetic amines or inhaled medication or any component thereof. Patients who have had live attenuated vaccinations within 30 days prior to Visit 1 Patients who have had treatment with investigational drugs, within 30 days or 5 halflives prior to Visit 1, whichever is longer.
