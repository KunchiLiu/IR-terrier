	<brief_summary>Hormonal disruption is the inappropriate alteration of the hormonal system by chemical substances that are present in our environment. Some chemical substances are capable of replicating, enhancing or reducing the production, release, transport or action of natural hormones. Therefore, they are called hormonal or endocrine disrupters. Some 'classic' endocrine disrupters such as pesticides and dioxins are considered responsible for infertility, cancer and thyroid problems. Recently, a number of additional chemical substances were stipulated to have endocrine disrupting capabilities. The industrial production of these substances in large quantities has led to an accumulation in our environment and thus possible negative consequences on human health. The aim of this study is to investigate the rol of these chemical substances in the occurence of overweight and obesity.</brief_summary>
