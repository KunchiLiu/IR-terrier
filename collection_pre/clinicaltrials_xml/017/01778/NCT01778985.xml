	<brief_summary>This is a study to determine how vaginal estrogen cream given for several weeks before pelvic reconstructive therapy will effect elastic fiber assembly in the muscularis layer of the vaginal wall. Postmenopausal women with at least Stage 2 pelvic organ prolapse will receive either estrogen vaginal cream or placebo cream 6-8 weeks prior to reconstructive surgery. At time of surgery, full thickness biopsies will be obtained from a standardized location at the top of vagina. The investigators will measure the thickness of the vaginal muscularis, elastic fiber number and morphology, and analyze if elastic fiber synthesis or degradation is affected by estrogen therapy. The results will provide important data to support a larger clinical trial to determine if preoperative and maintenance estrogen therapy alter long-term success rates of pelvic reconstructive surgery for pelvic organ prolapse.</brief_summary>
