	<brief_summary>Despite the prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis in the HIV positive population, relatively little is known about the underlying pathology. This prospective cohort study aims to gain further understanding about a number of issues relating to low bone mineral density in HIV-infected subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HIV UPBEAT: Understanding the Pathology of Bone Disease in HIV-infected Patients.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will follow HIV positive and negative subjects annually for 5 years. The aims of this study include: - to describe the pathology underlying low bone mineral density - to assess the relationship between low bone mineral density and antiretroviral therapy exposure - to assess the relationship between low bone mineral density and vitamin D /PTH status and/or markers of bone metabolism - to assess the relationship between osteopenia and subsequent changes in bone mineral density and markers of bone metabolism - to assess the validity of the currently available fracture risk assessment tool in predicting fractures in HIV positive populations</detailed_description>
