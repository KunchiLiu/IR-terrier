	<brief_title>Deep Brain Stimulation of the Superolateral Branch of the Medial Forebrain Bundle (slMFB) for the Treatment of Refractory Major Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The target point for DBS in major depression disorder is located lateral to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in the midbrain at the branching point of the superolateral branch (slMFB) from the main medial forebrain bundle (MFB). The exact stimulation coordinates are: Montreal Neurologic Institute brain 152 coordinates (MNI152 coordinates): left: x(lat.)=-5, y(ap)=-14, z(vert.)=-8 right: x(lat.)=5, y(ap)=-14, z(vert.)=-9 Mid-commissural point coordinates (MCP coordinates): eft: x(lat.)=-6, y(ap)=-1, z(vert.)=-6 right: x(lat.)=4, y(ap)=-1, z(vert.)=-7 All coordinates refer to the MNI152 brain. Legend: slMFB = superolateral branch of medial forebrain bundle lat. = lateral, ap= anteroposterior, vert. = vertical. More information can be found at: http://goo.gl/n9sWV</detailed_description>
