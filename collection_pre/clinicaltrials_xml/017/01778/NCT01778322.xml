	<brief_summary>The objective of this clinical study is to evaluate clinical utility of the WEB Aneurysm Embolization System used to embolize intracranial aneurysms</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>WEB Clinical Assessment of IntraSaccular Aneurysm Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The following parameters will be evaluated as part of this study: - Aneurysm morphology - Aneurysm size - For ruptured aneurysms: Hunt and Hess Classification of Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) - Size of the embolization device(s) used in the procedure - Intra-procedural assessment of aneurysm occlusion and flow stasis - Degree of aneurysm occlusion post-procedure (percentage occlusion, Raymond Scale and other scores as appropriate) - Aneurysm occlusion durability - Recanalization rate - Device-related changes in Modified Rankin Scale from baseline - Complications/adverse events - Rebleed/new bleed</detailed_description>
