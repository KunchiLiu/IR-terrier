	<brief_summary>In this investigation the investigators utilized NAC administration to foster GSH availability during an 8-day period following eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage in order to test our hypotheses: i) antioxidant supplementation does not disturb performance and adaptations induced by exercise-induced muscle injury and ii) redox status perturbations in skeletal muscle are pivotal for the regulation of muscle' inflammatory response and repair.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NAC Supplementation and Skeletal Muscle Performance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The major thiol-disulfide couple of reduced (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) is a key-regulator of major transcriptional pathways regulating aseptic inflammation and recovery of skeletal muscle following aseptic injury. Antioxidant supplementation may hamper exercise-induced cellular adaptations. Our objective was to examine how thiol-based antioxidant supplementation affects skeletal muscle's performance and redox-sensitive signalling during the inflammatory and repair phases associated with exercise-induced micro-trauma.In a double-blind, counterbalanced design, 12 men received placebo (PLA) or N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 20 mg/kg/day) following muscle-damaging exercise (300 eccentric contractions). In each trial, muscle performance was measured at baseline, post-exercise, 2h post-exercise and daily for 8 consecutive days. Muscle biopsies from vastus lateralis and blood samples were collected pre-exercise and 2h, 2d, and 8d post-exercise.</detailed_description>
