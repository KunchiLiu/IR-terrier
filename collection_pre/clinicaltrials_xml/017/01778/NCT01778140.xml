	<brief_title>Comparing Effects of Patient-specific Versus Non-patient-specific Computerized Reminder System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize that a clinical decision support system (CDSS) designed with "Patient-specific" reminders yields superior performance than that with "Non-patient-specific" reminders in preventing contrast-induced nephropathy. A 3-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be performed by cluster randomization using physicians as the unit of allocation. Physicians in 3 university medical centers will be randomly assigned into 1) patient-specific arm with Anti Contrast-Induced-Nephropathy(Anti-CIN) reminder, 2) non-patient-specific reminder arm, and 3) the control arm without any reminders, respectively. The patient-specific alert, Anti-CIN system, is designed as a real-time CDSS implementation on CPOE for monitoring physician's contrast-enhanced CT and IVP orders. Computerized pop-up reminders provide the patient-specific encounters with optimal decision options when patients are at a high CIN risk or patients with unknown risk factors are encountered. Non-patient-specific reminders always pop up no matter whether the patient is at a high risk or not.</detailed_description>
