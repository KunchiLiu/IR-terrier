	<brief_summary>The serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor is the most abundant excitatory serotonin (5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine) receptor in the human brain, and multiple positron emission tomography (PET) studies have investigated the 5-HT2A receptors in the human brain using antagonist radioligands. However, the currently available antagonist PET radioligands bind the total pool of 5-HT2A receptor receptors whereas a 5-HT2A receptor agonist binds the high-affinity subgroup of the receptors which are also G-protein coupled, and thus hypothesized to be the functional relevant population of receptors. At the Center for Integrated Molecular Brain Imaging (CIMBI), a novel agonist PET radioligands for brain imaging of 5-HT2A receptors was recently validated in animals (Ettrup et al. 2011, EJNMMI). In the human brain, [11C]Cimbi-36 was validated as a selective 5-HT2A receptor agonist PET radioligand through a blocking study with the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist pharmaceutical ketanserin. In this validation study, the biodistribution and kinetic modelling of [11C]Cimbi-36 binding in the human brain was also validated. With these studies, investigators will test the most promising of these, [11C]Cimbi-36, in clinical trials, where it will provide a novel method for detecting dysfunction in the 5-HT system. The specific aim of this clinical trial is: - To examine the effect of acute alterations in 5-HT levels on cerebral [11C]Cimbi-36 binding in healthy volunteers who will be PET-scanned at baseline and after pharmacological or dietary interventions that either increase or decrease cerebral 5-HT levels. It is hypothesized that this novel agonist radioligand will provide both a more physiological relevant measure of the 5-HT2A receptors and also reflect levels of cerebral 5-HT in humans, more specifically: BP will decrease after pindolol and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment and increase after acute tryptophan depletion (ATD). Placebo will leave binding potential (BP) unchanged.</brief_summary>
