	<brief_title>Not Invasive Monitoring of Pleural Drainage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>25 patients &gt; 18 years old with pleura effusion will be examined with regard to the feasibility of non invasive sensor measurements corresponding to the course of thorax impedance and respiration parameters during body fluids loss before and after pleural drainage. The measured data will be compared to standard routine reference measurements (heart rate, medication, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), heart minute volume). Additionally heart sound analysis via electronic stethoscope will be compared to standard methods. Also 25 healthy controls will undergo the same measurements to receive standard values.</detailed_description>
