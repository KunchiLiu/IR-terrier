	<brief_title>Endometrial Genomic Profile in Endometrial Priming</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We analyze the genomic profile of egg donors in different endometrial priming protocols, compared with natural cycle, including the conventional single long acting GnRH agonist injection in the mid luteal phase of the previous cycle of the endometrial priming and the single daily antagonist injection (Cetrorelix 0.25 mg) administered in the early follicular phase followed by endometrial priming. Endometrial biopsy will be taken in luteinizing hormone - 7 or with P4 +5 in cases with endometrial priming with oestrogens therapy.</detailed_description>
