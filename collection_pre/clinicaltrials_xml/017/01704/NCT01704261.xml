	<brief_summary>This study will examine the safety and efficacy of the addition of omarigliptin in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus with inadequate glycemic control on metformin and glimepiride. The primary hypothesis is that after 24 weeks, the addition of treatment with omarigliptin provides a greater reduction in hemoglobin A1c (A1C) compared with the addition of placebo.</brief_summary>
