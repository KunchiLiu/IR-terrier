	<brief_summary>Opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) is most broadly defined as a state of nociceptive sensitization caused by exposure to opioids. In humans, the evidence of OIH is strong but conflicting. Previous clinical studies mostly used experimental or non-standardized surgical stimuli to assess OIH. We therefore sought to certify a presence of OIH using a standardized, clinical pain stimuli in cancer patients receiving opioid therapy and opioid-naive patients.</brief_summary>
