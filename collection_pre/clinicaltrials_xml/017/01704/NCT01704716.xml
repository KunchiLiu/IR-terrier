	<brief_summary>This is a randomised study of the European SIOP Neuroblastoma Group (SIOPEN) in high-risk neuroblastoma (stages 2, 3, 4 and 4s MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma, stage 4 MYCN non amplified &gt; 12 months at diagnosis). The protocol consists of a rapid, dose intensive induction chemotherapy (R3 randomisation - Rapid COJEC vs modified N7), peripheral blood stem cell harvest, attempted complete excision of the primary tumour, myeloablative therapy (BuMel) followed by peripheral blood stem cell rescue, radiotherapy to the site of the primary tumour and immunotherapy (R4 randomisation - isotretinoin and ch14.18/CHO, with or without aldesleukin (IL-2). In the induction phase, all patients with stage 4 neuroblastoma and those with stage 4s MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma will be randomised (R3) to Rapid COJEC or modified N7; localised patients receive Rapid COJEC (Rapid COJEC is given with G-CSF support based on the results of the R0 randomisation running between 2002 and 2005). Following induction treatment peripheral blood stem cell harvest (PBSCH) will be performed and complete excision of the primary tumour will be attempted. Patients with an inadequate metastatic response to allow BuMel MAT followed by PBSCR at the end of induction should receive 2 TVD (Topotecan, Vincristine, Doxorubicin) cycles. After Rapid COJEC induction, localised patients will proceed to consolidation. Patients aged 12-18 months at diagnosis, with stage 4 neuroblastoma, no MYCN amplification and without segmental chromosomal alterations (SCA) are thought to have a good prognosis and will stop treatment after induction therapy and surgery to the primary tumour. Consolidation consists of BuMel MAT (following the results of the R1 randomisation) followed by peripheral blood stem cell rescue (PBSCR) and radiotherapy to the site of the primary tumour. During the immunotherapy phase, patients will be randomised (R4) to immunotherapy with isotretinoin (13-cis-RA) and ch14.18/CHO, with or without aldesleukin (IL-2).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Risk Neuroblastoma Study 1.7 of SIOP-Europe (SIOPEN)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this protocol the term high-risk neuroblastoma refers to children with either - disseminated disease (INSS stage 4: about 40 to 50% of all neuroblastoma) over the age of one or - INSS stage 2 and 3 disease with amplification of the MycN proto-oncogene Between 10% and 20% of children with stage 3 and occasional patients with stage 2 disease are characterised by amplification of the MycN gene in their tumours. This biological characteristic has clearly been shown to be associated with a greater risk of relapse and death from disease progression. These patients may benefit from very aggressive treatment and, based on this hypothesis, they are included in this protocol. - Infants (&lt; 12 months at diagnosis) with MYCN amplified tumours are included. Children with this type of presentation and age represent the largest neuroblastoma subgroup. Their prognosis remains poor in most cases and our ability to predict the clinical course and the outcome of the individual patient is modest. Primary objectives: R0 randomisation: R0 was opened with the study activation in February 2002 and closed in November 2005. The randomised use of G-CSF during COJEC induction resulted in the recommendation of the prophylactic use of G-CSF to prevent episodes of febrile neutropenia R1 randomisation: R1 was opened with the study activation in February 2002 and closed in 10/2010 following the results showing significant superiority of myeloablative therapy (MAT) with busulfan and melphalan over continuous infusion of carboplatin, etoposide and melphalan (CEM). BuMel is now the standard MAT. R2 randomisation: R2 was activated in November 2006 (13-cis retinoic acid +/- chimeric ch14.18/CHO antibody), modified in July 2009 and suspended in August 2013. R2 randomisation tested the hypothesis that immunotherapy with chimeric 14.18/CHO and subcutaneous aldesleukin (IL-2, Proleukin®), following MAT and autologous stem cell transplantation, in addition to differentiation therapy with 13-cis retinoic acid, will improve 3-year EFS in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma. R3 randomisation: R3 was opened in June 2011 and tests the hypothesis that modified N7 induction regimen will improve the metastatic response rates or event free survival (EFS) as compared to Rapid COJEC. R4 randomisation: R4 was activated in April 2014. The SIOPEN long term infusion (LTI) ch14.18/CHO trial successfully lowered the toxicity profile by prolonging the infusion time of the same total ch14.18/CHO antibody dose of 100mg/m² to 10 days of continuous infusion in relapsed /refractory patients. Hence the HRNBL1.7/SIOPEN study committee wishes to implement this more favourable immunotherapy dosing schedule for the time till the induction question R3 is answered and the HRNBL1.7/SIOPEN trial may be closed. Considering the high R2 dropout rate of patients unable to receive all immunotherapy cycles in the IL-2 s.c. combination treatment arm and not observing this effect in the current SIOPEN LTI trial, it is suggested to address the IL-2sc dose in the new R4. Therefore the potential synergistic effect of sc IL-2 will be addressed again with 50% of the original s.c. IL-2 dose. The IL-2sc dose will hence be reduced to 3 x 106 IU IL-2/m2/day s.c. in the HR-NBL1/SIOPEN R4 amendment instead of 6 x 106 IU IL-2/m2/day s.c as used in the SIOPEN LTI trial. In the second week of each IT course s.c.IL-2 will be given on days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 in parallel to the ch14.18/CHO ctn infusion and not during the first 5 days in week 2 as scheduled in the SIOPEN LTI trial.</detailed_description>
