	<brief_summary>This study is being done to compare survival using pembrolizumab (SCH 900475, MK-3475) or standard chemotherapy for participants with advanced melanoma (MEL) who have progressed after prior therapy. Participants were initially randomized to receive either low dose pembrolizumab, higher dose pembrolizumab or Investigator-choice chemotherapy (ICC). The randomization to either pembrolizumab or Investigator choice chemotherapy was conducted in an open-label fashion. The pembrolizumab dose was initially blinded to Investigators and participants until Amendment 03. With Amendment 03, all ongoing pembrolizumab participants will be treated with open-label, fixed dose pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W), instead of weight-based dosing of pembrolizumab. The four standard chemotherapy choices were carboplatin + paclitaxel, paclitaxel alone, dacarbazine, or temozolomide. Participants on standard chemotherapy who experienced disease progression may have been eligible to crossover to treatment with pembrolizumab provided they met protocol-specified requirements for crossover. With Amendment 03, all crossover participants will be treated with open-label, fixed dose pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W instead of weight-based dosing of pembrolizumab.</brief_summary>
