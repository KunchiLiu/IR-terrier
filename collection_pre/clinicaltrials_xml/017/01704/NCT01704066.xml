	<brief_summary>The original American-European Consensus Conference (AECC) definition of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) required bilateral infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema on frontal chest X-ray (CXR), but there is poor inter-observer reliability in interpreting CXR using this definition among intensivists and radiologists. As a result, the newly published Berlin definition of ARDS specified that the CXR criterion should include bilateral opacities consistent with pulmonary edema not fully explained by effusions, lobar/lung collapse, or nodules/masses on CXR. In order to improve inter-observer agreement, the panel have also developed a set of CXRs judged as consistent, inconsistent, or equivocal for the diagnosis of ARDS. The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of this training set on inter-observer reliability in applying the radiographic definition for ARDS.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study is composed of 3 phases: Phase 1: All participants will be required to independently interpret a set of 12 CXRs, as provided by the consensus panel. The possible radiographic interpretations include consistent, inconsistent, or equivocal for the diagnosis of ARDS. Phase 2: Training materials adapted according to the recently published Berlin definition of ARDS, with its expanded rationale and interpretation of all 12 CXRs, will be sent to all participants. Phase 3: The same set of 12 CXRs, in different order, will be sent to all participants for interpretation for the second time.</detailed_description>
