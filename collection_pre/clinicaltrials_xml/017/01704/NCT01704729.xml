	<detailed_description>Phase I: Focus groups on different designs of adjustable glasses and standard glasses (August-September 2012) Phase II: Two-month randomized trial comparing four groups: self-refraction with adjustable glasses, receiving custom standard glasses; subjective refraction by an expert refractionist after cycloplegic automated refraction and receiving custom standard glasses; subjective refraction by a rural refractionist after cycloplegic automated refraction, receiving custom standard glasses; and subjective refraction by an expert refractionist after cycloplegic automated refraction receiving ready made glasses (September 2012 - August 2013)</detailed_description>
