	<brief_summary>Open elective abdominal aortic surgery is a high risk procedure involving clamping of the aorta. Indications include abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) or aortic occlusive disease (AOD) causing lower limb ischaemia. These patients are often regarded as one entity in postoperative study settings. However, previous studies indicate that risk profiles, inflammatory activity, and haemodynamic capacity may differ between these groups. The first aim of this study was to evaluate postoperative ICU-requirements after open elective abdominal aortic surgery, hypothesising that AAA-patients had longer ICU-stays and needed more mechanical ventilation or acute dialysis than did patients with AOD. The investigators see a relatively high incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) following aortic surgery. Neutrophil Gelatinase Associated Lipocalcin (NGAL) may be useful in the early diagnosis of postopeative AKI. However, NGAL is also known as a marker of inflammatory activation. The ischaemia-reperfusion injury and subsequent inflammatory response to aortic cross clamping may per se induce a rise in NGAL despite intact renal function. Therefore NGAL may not be a reliable marker of AKI after AAS. The second aim of this study is to describe the changes in NGAL after AAS in patients with and without postoperative dialysis-dependent AKI.</brief_summary>
