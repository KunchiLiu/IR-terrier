	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to study the effect of fingolimod on cardiac autonomic regulation in patients with relapse-remitting multiple sclerosis. This will be done by measuring heart rate variability from the 24-hour Holter recording and myocardial ventricular repolarisation patterns from the 12-lead electrocardiogram tracings. The fingolimod treatment is prescribed according to the accepted drug label.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study will include 30 relapse-remitting multiple sclerosis patients. Assessments of heart rate variability and myocardial ventricular repolarisation pattern will be done 1) before fingolimod, 2) first day of fingolimod 3) after 3 months use and 4) after 12 months use of fingolimod.</detailed_description>
