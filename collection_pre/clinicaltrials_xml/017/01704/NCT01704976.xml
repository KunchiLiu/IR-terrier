	<brief_title>SR-WBV Training for Frail Elderly in the Skilling up Stage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is based on the guideline of falls management exercise programs (FaME; from Skelton and Dinan). The goals: Skilling up: improvement in neuromuscular control, postural control and strengthening of large muscle groups of the lower extremity. Training Gain: improvement of functional abilities. Maintaining the Gains: muscle growth, improvement of bone density and multi-sensory exercises. First, a pilot study was conducted with untrained elderly ("Effects of stochastic resonance therapy on postural control in the elderly population" (KEK Bern: No.228/09, Clinical Trial Registry: NCT01045746). Following, a second pilot study was conducted with frail elderly (Application of Whole-body Vibration With Stochastic Resonance in Frail Elderly: The Effects on Postural Control Clinical Trial Registry:NCT01543243). It was found that the selected chosen form of recruitment (presentation and advertisement) and the measurements methods are suitable for untrained elderly. But for frail elderly the chosen form of recruitment and the measurement methods are not sufficient. For this study, measurement parameters for functional performance and strength will be used. Goals of the study in the skilling up phase: 1. Feasibility 2. Study the effect on physical functional performance 3. Study the effects on muscle strength. The participants will be recruited in Canton Bern - Swizerland and will be randomly allocated to an intervention group or sham group.</detailed_description>
