	<brief_title>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Paranoia in Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Paranoia-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (PFCBT) is a manualized intervention that combines group and individual modalities to reduce paranoia-biased information-processing and social avoidance, and to increase insight and reality testing capacity. This is a randomized controlled clinical trial. Twenty four adults ages 18-65 with the primary DSM-IV Schizophrenia and Schizoaffective disorder and drug-refractory persecutory delusions will be recruited from outpatient clinics in New York City Metropolitan area. Participants will be randomly assigned to either experimental or control group. The experimental group will receive PFCBT in addition to standard care and the control group will receive standard care alone. PFCBT will include participation in one group session and one individual therapy session weekly over the 15 weeks. The preliminary efficacy of the intervention will be evaluated using standardized measures by blind evaluators conducted at baseline, post-treatment, and at 6-months post-termination follow-up.</detailed_description>
