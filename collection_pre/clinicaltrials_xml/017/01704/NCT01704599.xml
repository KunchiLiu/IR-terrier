	<brief_summary>Vitamins modulating homocysteine affect both TNF-alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor, and theoretically enhance the anti-inflammatory version of NOS thus hopefully increasing the efficacy and reducing the chance of some toxicities of adalimumab as determined by blood testing and EKGs.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Addition of Modulators of Homocysteine to Adalimumab Therapy in the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a pilot study designed to evaluate whether addition of oral vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and folic acid to the use of adalimumab for psoriasis leads to further improvement of a patient's psoriasis and quality of life.</detailed_description>
