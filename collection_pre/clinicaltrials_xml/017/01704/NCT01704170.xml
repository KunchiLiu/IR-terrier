	<brief_summary>This study is a prospective, multi-center trial wherein each included subject will receive the experimental externally focused ultrasound renal denervation therapy. It will be conducted on a maximum of fifty patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria and have signed the informed consent form. Safety is the primary endpoint of this study and will be assessed by incidence and evaluation of any serious adverse effects associated with the investigational procedure through the 52-week evaluation. Clinical utility is the secondary endpoint of this study and will be evaluated by assessing pre and post therapy systolic and diastolic blood pressure.</brief_summary>
