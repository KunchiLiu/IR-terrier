	<brief_summary>Purpose of study: To assess the effects of wearing custom orthotics as opposed to placebo foot inserts on the duration of chiropractic correction of spinal fixations and muscle imbalances using applied kinesiology techniques.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Duration of Spinal Manipulation Effects as Influenced by Orthotics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants with chronic lower back pain of greater than one month duration will be randomized to receive custom foot orthotics or placebo flat inserts. Both groups will receive chiropractic treatment 5 times over the course of 4 weeks following receipt of orthotics. Subjects and treating doctor will be blind to the insert type. Patients will report present, average, best and worst pain at each visit, and complete a Roland-Morris questionnaire. Secondary outcome measures will be number of fixated vertebral levels identified by motion palpation and challenge and number of muscles testing grade 4 and below from a list of 5 muscles to be tested bilaterally before and after each treatment.</detailed_description>
