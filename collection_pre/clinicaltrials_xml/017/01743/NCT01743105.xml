	<brief_summary>The main objective of this study is to evaluate the inter-rater reproducibility of diaphragmatic excursion measures via time-motion-mode ultrasound (evaluation performed on the first measure) in patients experiencing acute respiratory distress emergencies.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The secondary objectives of this study are: - To assess the feasibility of measuring the diaphragmatic excursion in the context of emergency management (ratio of measured patients / included patients). - To evaluate the time required for the measurement. - To assess the intra-rater reproducibility of measurements of diaphragmatic excursion (comparison of first and second measures).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient must have given his/her informed and signed consent The patient must be insured or beneficiary of a health insurance plan The patient has acute respiratory distress defined by a respiratory rate &gt; 25, and / or signs of struggle and hypoxia, oxygen saturation (SpO2) &lt;90% and / or pH &lt;7.35 and carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO2) &gt; 6 kPa (45 mm Hg) The patient breathes spontaneously (no respirator) The patient is participating in another study The patient is in an exclusion period determined by a previous study The patient is under judicial protection, under tutorship or curatorship The patient or his/her representative refuses to sign the consent It is impossible to correctly inform the patient, or to correctly inform his/her representative The patient is pregnant, parturient, or breastfeeding The patient has a neurological or neuromuscular disease that modifies diaphragm function/movement; this does not include cases of decompensation (polyradiculoneuropathy, Lou Gehrig's disease, Myasthenia ...). Patient admitted with respiratory support treatment in progress Patient admitted with respiratory failure requiring immediate implementation of mechanical ventilation, thus preventing ultrasound measurements</criteria>
