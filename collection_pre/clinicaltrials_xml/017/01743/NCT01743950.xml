	<brief_summary>To determine the efficacy of Pulse Reduced Dose Rate (PRDR) radiation when given in 27 fraction over 5.5 weeks with concurrent bevacizumab followed by adjuvant bevacizumab until time of progression in patients with recurrent high grade gliomas (grade III and grade IV). Patients will be placed in 1 of 4 groups based on their histologic diagnosis and prior exposure to bevacizumab.</brief_summary>
