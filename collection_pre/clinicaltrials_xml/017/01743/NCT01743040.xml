Inclusion criteria: Age 22 years or older Willing and able to give informed consent Clinical indication for nuclear stress test evaluation Chest pain syndrome Two or more coronary artery disease risk factors as defined by: 1. Dyslipidemia: LDL &gt;130 mm/dL or HDL &lt;35 mm/dL or on treatment for dyslipidemia 2.
