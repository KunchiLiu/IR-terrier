	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to determine the absorption of isothiocyanates (ITC) after ingestion of kailan-hybrid broccoli through the analysis of the correspondent urinary biomarkers. Furthermore, the effect of cooking (microwave) on the mentioned metabolic fate of these ITC was studied comparing to the uncooked vegetable.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Glucosinolates (sulphur-containing compounds) are hydrolyzed by the plant enzyme myrosinase to ITC, which have chemopreventive properties. No information has been reported about the metabolic fate of ITC in the kailan-hybrid broccoli, which physicochemical characteristics could greatly influence that metabolic fate. Previous studies have shown that cooking process of vegetables may vary the human absorption of the correspondent nutritional and bioactive compounds. Research Methods &amp; Procedures A cross-over-design study of 7 subjects after ingestion of 200-g raw or microwaved kailan-hybrid broccoli was conducted. Total ITC equivalents in the vegetable, urine and blood samples were determined by HPLC as the cyclocondensation product of 1,2-benzenedithiol.</detailed_description>
