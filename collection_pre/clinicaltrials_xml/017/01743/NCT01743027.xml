	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of an Ophthalmic Solution in Patients With Allergic Conjunctivitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Enrolled participants will be tested for the presence of common allergies using the Conjunctival Allergen Challenge (CAC) model. Drops of increasing concentration of a solubilized allergen will be instilled in both eyes until a positive reaction occurred. The test will be repeated to confirm the allergic reaction. Participants with confirmed reactions will be administered the test article (Day 0) and undergo a CAC 24 hours post-instillation (Day 1). On Day 14, participants will be administered the test article and undergo an additional CAC.</detailed_description>
