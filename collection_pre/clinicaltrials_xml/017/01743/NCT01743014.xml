	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination with ramipril and clopidogrel leads to further improvement of endothelial function, reduction of oxidative stress and reduction of vascular inflammation, compared with ramipril monotherapy, in patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 2 and diabetic nephropathy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ramipril and Clopidogrel in Oxidative Stress, Vascular Inflammation and Endothelial Dysfunction in Type 2 Diabetes and Diabetic Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of deaths in diabetic population with diabetic nephropathy. - Pharmacologic therapy for patients with diabetes and hypertension should be with a regimen that includes either an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) - Diabetic patients at increased cardiovascular risk should receive an antiplatelet agent for primary prevention. Methods: An open label,randomized, two period cross-over design study, involving patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy. After a 4 weeks wash out period for ACE inhibitors or Angiotensin receptor blockers (week 0, baseline) 60 patients will be randomized to receive ramipril(10 mg) only or ramipril (10 mg) and clopidogrel (75mg) for 12 weeks exchanging their treatment for a further 12 weeks, after a 2 week wash out period for clopidogrel. Patients will be examined and measurements will be taken at baseline (week 0), and at the end of 12, 14, and 26 weeks.</detailed_description>
