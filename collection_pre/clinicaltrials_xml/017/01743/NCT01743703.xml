	<brief_summary>The diagnosis of abuse in children relies heavily on the presence of skeletal and extraskeletal injuries. However, some lesions are not seen by initial skeletal survey. And the investigators have to complete the skeletal survey with either bone-scan or CT scan or whole-body MRI. whole-body MRI has proved its worth in the pediatric population for the evaluation of skeletal and extraskeletal lesions in children with cancer or infectious diseases. Thus, whole-body MRI would allowed to have total picture of children without ionising radiation exposure.</brief_summary>
