	<brief_summary>The current most important topical treatments for psoriasis are vitamin D3 analogues and/or corticosteroids. The possibility of another effective treatment for psoriasis could be based on the immunosuppressive efficacy of selective blockers of a lymphocyte potassium channel. The aim of the clinical trial is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and anti-psoriatic efficacy of topical SPS4251 formulations in comparison to placebo and to a marketed topical Vitamin-D analogue ointment in a psoriasis plaque test.</brief_summary>
