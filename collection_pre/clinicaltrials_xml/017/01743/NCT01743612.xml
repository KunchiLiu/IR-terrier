	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to determine if postocclusive hyperemia of palmar and dorsal face of the hand with Laser speckle contrast imaging discriminate between patients with systemic sclerosis, subjects with primary Raynaud's phenomenon and healthy subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging for Cutaneous Microvascular Dysfunction Detection in Systemic Sclerosis.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Microvascular dysfunction is a key event in the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis. There are currently no test measuring it in clinical practice. Response to humeral occlusion is interesting and this response has been studied with laser Doppler flowmetry. More recently, laser imaging has been used analysing the granularity of the laser: laser Speckle Contrast Imaging which allow combining high temporal resolution to high spatial resolution. The investigators proposed, in this study, to compare this imaging at basal and after post-occlusive hyperaemia of dorsal and palmar face of hand in 3 groups: healthy subjects, primary Raynaud's phenomenon and systemic sclerosis.</detailed_description>
