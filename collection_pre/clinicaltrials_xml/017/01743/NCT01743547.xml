	<brief_title>The Effects Of Yoga On Quality Of Life Among A Population Of Ovarian/ Fallopian Tube/ Primary Peritoneal Cancer Patients Receiving Chemotherapy: A Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of implementing a yoga program among gynecologic cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. The investigators concluded that it is not feasible due to the lack of participation and difficulty in recruiting patients. Of 25 consented patients, 16 agreed to participate in the control arm, 9 agreed to participate in the Yoga classes. Three (3) of those 9 changed their minds and withdrew consent. Of the 6 remaining patients, only 3 attended at least 1 of the 8 classes.</detailed_description>
