	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if using a computer survey about preferences for treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is useful and if it will improve patient satisfaction with clinical care and decision making. This study is a two-part study. The first pilot tests the computerized tool to ensure it is understood by patients, then the second part is a randomized study (computerized tool versus usual care) to see if improvements are made in satisfaction and if there are reductions in decision regret.</brief_summary>
