	<brief_summary>This study is a randomized, multi-center study that will compare the efficacy and safety of selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) using SIR-Spheres microspheres plus a standard chemotherapy regimen of FOLFOX6m versus FOLFOX6m alone as first-line therapy in patients with non-resectable liver metastases from primary colorectal carcinoma. Treatment with the biologic agent bevacizumab, if part of the standard of care at participating institutions, is allowed within this study at the discretion of the Investigator.</brief_summary>
