	<brief_summary>Design: Prospective randomised cross-over study. Fifty-two eligible patients will be randomised to a treatment time of either 6 hours or 4 hours for a period of 24 weeks and following a washout period of 4 weeks, switch to the alternative treatment time for an additional 24 weeks. Aims: To examine the feasibility and effect of extended dialysis treatment time, 6 hours thrice weekly, versus the standard, 4 hours thrice weekly, comparing the differences from baseline in outcome measures over a total 12-month period. Primary outcome measure 1]Serum albumin Secondary outcome measures Nutritional status 1. Malnutrition-inflammation score 2. Dietary intake 3. Hand-Grip strength 4. Energy expenditure Quality of life 1. Patient reported quality of life and 2. time to recovery from dialysis Serum biomarkers 1. BNP 2. Troponin 3. MCP-1 Others 24- hour Ambulatory blood pressure 24-hour accelerometer Population: Local haemodialysis population of 1200 patients Eligibility: Minimum 90days on haemodialysis treatment Duration: Fifty-six weeks</brief_summary>
