	<brief_summary>This study is to evaluate the steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) and confirm the dose of the elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF) single tablet regimen (STR) in HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral (ARV) treatment-naive adolescents. Safety, tolerability, and efficacy will also be evaluated through Week 48. A total of 50 adolescent participants (12 to &lt; 18 years of age) will be enrolled to receive EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF as follows: - Part A: Twelve to 16 eligible participants will be enrolled to evaluate steady-state PK, and confirm the dose, with the intent to enroll at least 4 participants 12 to &lt; 15 and at least 4 participants 15 to &lt; 18 years of age. - Part B: Following confirmation of EVG exposure in at least 12 participants from Part A, 34 to 38 participants in addition to those enrolled in Part A will be enrolled to evaluate the safety, tolerability and antiviral activity of EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF STR.</brief_summary>
