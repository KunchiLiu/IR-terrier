	<brief_summary>This study seeks to develop a new induction chemotherapy regimen which is a combination of two pill drugs taken by mouth and two drugs given by vein. This is a phase I study, which means that the primary goal is to establish the recommended dose of an investigational drug when added to chemotherapy. The researchers wish to evaluate the effects, good and bad, of the investigational drug.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Department of Pathology at MSKCC confirmation of diagnosis of oropharynx squamous cell cancer, stage IVA/IVB, that is HPV associated. Evidence of HPV can be p16 immunohistochemistry and/or HPV in situ hybridization positive test result on tumor tissue, either at MSKCC or other CLIAapproved lab. Age ≥ 18 years of age Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 80 Adequate organ function, as follows: Adequate bone marrow reserve: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 X 109/L, platelets ≥ 160 X 109/L, hemoglobin ≥ 12 g/dL Hepatic: total bilirubin within normal limits (≤ 1.0 mg/dL); alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 1.5 X ULN (upper limit of normal) Renal: Serum creatinine ≤ 1.3 mg/dL. Patients with serum creatinine &gt; 1.3 mg/dL may be eligible if creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 55 mL/min based on the standard Cockroft and Gault formula. Patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days of treatment. Patients must agree to use a reliable method of birth control during and for 6 months following the last dose of study drug. Ability to swallow oral medication. Expansion Cohort only: At least one unstained slide from pretreatment diagnostic biopsy or fine needle aspirate must be available for correlative immunohistochemistry study. Prior chemotherapy or radiation for tonsillar or base of tongue squamous cell cancer History of hemolytic anemia or thalassemia Active infection or serious underlying medical condition that would impair the patient's ability to receive protocol treatment. Current therapeutic anticoagulation with Coumadin (warfarin) Current or prior treatment with ribavirin Known active Hepatitis B or C Any prior documented history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or cerebrovascular accident (CVA) New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive heart failure Clinically significant peripheral vascular disease Inability to discontinue any of the following potent Pgp inhibitors (cyclosporine, erythromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, quinidine, phenobarbital salt with quinidine, ritonavir, valspodar, verapamil) or inducers (St John's wort, rifampicin). Known preexisting interstitial lung disease. Presence of poorly controlled gastrointestinal disorders that could affect the absorption of the trial drug (e.g. Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, malabsorption, or CTC grade ≥2 diarrhea of any etiology) based on treating physician assessment.</criteria>
