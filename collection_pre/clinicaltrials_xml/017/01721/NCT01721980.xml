	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability after multiple ascending oral doses of GLPG0974 given to healthy male subjects for 14 days, compared to placebo. Furthermore, during the course of the study, the amount of GLPG0974 present in the blood and urine (pharmacokinetics) as well as the effects of GLPG0974 on mechanism of action-related parameters in the blood and stool samples (pharmacodynamics) will be characterized compared to placebo. Also, the effect of the compound on glucose tolerance will be explored as well as the potential of cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 induction by repeated dosing with GLPG0974.</brief_summary>
