	<brief_title>The Effect of IPS-MA- A Modified Early Supported Employment Intervention for Individuals With Mood or Anxiety Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: The IPS-MA method is a modified Individual Placement and Support (IPS) intervention, aiming at supporting people with mood or anxiety disorders regain their workability and return to work or education. Previous studies have showed, that IPS has an effect on employment when offered to people with severe mental illness. Further studies are crucial to demonstrate whether the modified IPS, the IPS-MA method, has an effect when offered to people with mood or anxiety disorders who are not yet chronified. Methods/design:The trial design is a randomized, assessor-blinded, clinical trial of the IPS-MA method in addition to treatment as usual compared to treatment as usual alone for 326 participants diagnosed with a mood or anxiety disorder, living in the Capital Region of Denmark. The primary outcome is competitive employment or education. Secondary outcomes are days of competitive employment or education, disease symptoms, level of functioning, and quality of life at follow-up 12 and 24 months after baseline.</detailed_description>
