	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine prospectively the value of a recently identified proteomic signature in identifying those patients with lung cancer, who are likely to benefit from and respond favourably to erlotinib therapy. This is a prospective study of serum proteomics as a predictor of response to erlotinib therapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Screening/Baseline 1. Routine blood tests (Haematology and Biochemistry) as per hospital practice 2. Research serum sample for proteomic studies (10ml blood sample) 3. Routine pre-treatment CT but with formal RECIST/WHO measurements of tumour size 2 months Post Commencement of Treatment with erlotinib: Routine CT with RECIST/WHO assessment 4 months Post Commencement of Treatment with erlotinib: Routine CT with RECIST/WHO assessment 1 year Post Commencement of Treatment with erlotinib (as per current standard of care): Routine CT with RECIST/WHO assessment Response Assessment: CT scans at baseline, at 2 and 4 months post commencement of therapy and one year after treatment with erlotinib will be analyzed with the emphasis on identification of disease progression. Follow Up: Subsequent follow-up as per routine.</detailed_description>
