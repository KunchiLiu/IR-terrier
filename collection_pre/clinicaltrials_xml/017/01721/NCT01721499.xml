	<brief_summary>This is a study of treatment approaches aimed to improve self-control and decrease stress and unhealthy/maladaptive behaviors such as drinking, overeating, and smoking. High levels of stress may make it harder to maintain self-control, especially when trying to control our unhealthy behaviors. Training on improving self control and decreasing stress may help decrease unhealthy behaviors. The goal of this new training program will be to decrease a subject's unhealthy behavior by helping them better manage their stress and improve their self control over unhealthy habits.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Decreasing Stress and Improving Self-control With "Stress in Control" (Sync) Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study proposes to pilot a mindfulness based affect-regulation treatment approach to improve self-control and physiological and biochemical indicators of stress, as well as decrease unhealthy/maladaptive behaviors such as drinking, overeating, and smoking. The broad aims of the treatment approach will be to teach participants to (1) observe and increase awareness of cognitive, affective, bodily sensations/expressions and action-urge components of emotional/compulsion experiences; and (2) develop alternate affective, behavioral and cognitive coping strategies in managing and regulating affect/urge experiences. It is hoped that the findings from this study will aid in the further development of treatment and prevention programs targeting stress reduction and coping to improve control over maladaptive behaviors and decrease physical and mental health symptoms. Aims: 1. Develop a mindfulness based affect-regulation therapy manual, and training materials to train therapists on a treatment approach aimed at improving self-control over unhealthy addictive behaviors. 2. Develop and implement "Stress in Control" (SynC) training competence and adherence rating scales; 3. Conduct a preliminary study using the SynC manual, which will evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of SynC in comparison to a Primary Care Treatment Control Group and a Historical Control Group approach for 100 individuals interested in help in decreasing targeted unhealthy behaviors. Primary outcomes will be a reduction in unhealthy problem behaviors, and secondary outcomes will be decrease in measures of stress, and increases in emotion regulation and self control. 4. (secondary aim) Collect baseline data on measures of self control, mood, coping, personality, cognitive functioning, acute and chronic stress, and mental and physical health on a large sample of subjects seeking help in decreasing unhealthy behaviors.</detailed_description>
