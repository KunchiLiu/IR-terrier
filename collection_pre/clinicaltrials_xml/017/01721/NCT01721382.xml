	<brief_summary>This pilot study will be conducted in adolescents with cystic fibrosis (CF) without diabetes but with abnormal glucose tolerance, and will assess the effects of sitagliptin on glucose regulation. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT), will be performed at baseline and again ~4 weeks after treatment with study drug. We will also look at blood sugars throughout the day using a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) before each time the MMTT/OGTT are performed. Several hormones that may affect the way the body regulates blood sugars will be measured in blood when the OGTT and MMTT are done. We will assess the effect this medicine has on blood sugars (using CGM) and the effect the medicine has on the hormones measured during the OGTT and MMTT.</brief_summary>
