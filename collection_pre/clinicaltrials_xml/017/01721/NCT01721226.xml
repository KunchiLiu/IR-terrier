	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether an intervention (CARE+ Corrections) delivered to HIV-infected detainees within the DC Department of Corrections (DOC) and recently -released ex-detainees in the community can improve linkage to community HIV care and adherence to HIV medications after release, and ultimately achieve or maintain HIV viral suppression following community re-entry.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CARE Corrections: Technology for Jail HIV/HCV Testing, Linkage, and Care (TLC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The intervention is modeled after CARE, a technology based HIV-counseling tool used in other settings. The investigators have adapted CARE to create CARE+ Corrections, a tool designed specifically for incarcerated and recently-released populations. New and innovative information communication tools (ICT), including a cell phone/text messaging component delivered in the community after release from jail, will be included in the intervention. The study is a randomized controlled trial. One half of the participants will receive the intervention either inside the jail, in addition to standard discharge planning services, or in the community right after release. The other half of the participants will view an educational video related to the prevention of drug overdose following release, in addition to standard discharge planning services, or in the community right after release. The investigators will follow all participants for 6 months post release/study enrollment and determine if the linkage to community care and adherence to HIV medications was higher in the intervention arm. The study also has an evaluation component to it. The evaluation component consists in a series of qualitative interviews with the goal of gaining a better understanding of the barriers and facilitators involved in implementing the CARE+ Corrections intervention and to better assess the usability and participants' experiences with the CARE+ Corrections intervention. The semi-structured interviews are being conducted among the following groups: 1) managers and staff at local correctional facilities and agencies which have interaction with HIV+ individuals transitioning to the community; 2) leadership and selected staff at relevant and targeted community-based organizations; and 3) selected study participants from the intervention group of the RCT. the interviews elicit perspectives on the foreseen facilitators and challenges in implementing the CARE+ Corrections tool at their respective organizations as well as their perception on the acceptability of the tool. We also ask their views about the intervention and the post-release experiences of HIV-positive individuals who complete the CARE+ Corrections Tool and receive the text message plan. No prisoners will be involved in this subsection of the study.</detailed_description>
