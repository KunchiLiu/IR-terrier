	<brief_summary>The purpose of the current study is to investigate whether changes in patients' sleep quality and quantity will be followed by improvements in parameters related to physical and mental fatigue in patients receiving hemodialysis therapy. More specific, the current project will investigate the effect of a 9 months intradialytic exercise training in aspects related to fatigue, quality of life and depression.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sleep and Training Aspects in Dialysis Fatigue - Exercise Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic renal disease is a "silent epidemic" affecting up to 10% of the population in the EU, USA, and Asian with some of the sufferers progressing into end-stage renal failure. Renal disease patients are characterized by progressively worsening muscle weakness and muscle atrophy due to both a metabolic and a disuse component collectively described as uremic myopathy. While various interventions in stable HD patients have helped these patients improve their functionality, they still have not proven enough to bring their muscle quality and quantity up to the levels of a healthy sedentary person. Moreover, patients present with sleep problems, neurological and quality of life issues, anxiety and/or symptoms of depression but most notably they complain of chronic fatigue and "lack of energy". Other factors that contribute to the excessive fatigue are a lack of restorative sleep, excess pre-dialysis weight, poor nutritional status, restless legs syndrome and the overall mental status of the patients. Evidently, of all of these factors can contribute to a self-exacerbating process, a vicious circle, of fatigue due to inactivity and further inactivity due to fatigue. This sensation of an enduring fatigue interferes with physical and social activities and feeds perceptions of increased restrictions and barriers, and leads to a significant reduction of physical activity and functional capacity, which in turn contributes to the increased cardiovascular risk and a high mortality rate among these patients. Rationale: The investigators hypothesize that by improving the patients fitness levels, it will lead in more energy during day and therefore less fatigue. Our mission is to help the HD patient to better cope with their sensation of fatigue.</detailed_description>
