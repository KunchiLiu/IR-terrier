	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to find out whether dexmedetomidine changes brain cell activity in the subthalamic nucleus (STN). In order to find whether dexmedetomidine is optimal for sedation during Deep brain stimulation surgery, we will measure the electrical activity in the STN during Deep brain stimulation surgery, and measure how this activity is changed during administration of Dexmedetomidine. We hypothesize that dexmedetomidine does not change the firing rate and pattern in the STN.</brief_summary>
