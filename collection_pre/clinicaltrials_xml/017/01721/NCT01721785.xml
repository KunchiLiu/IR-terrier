	<brief_title>Diagnostic Value of Novel MR Imaging Techniques for the Primary Staging and Restaging of Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rectal cancer is a common form of cancer, and the treatment stratification depends on tumour and nodal stage as determined on MRI. Unfortunately, the information provided by standard T2-weighted MRI is not sufficient to accurately assess nodal involvement and tumour response after neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Additional functional information is required for reliable (re)staging. Diffusion-weighted imaging and gadofosveset-enhanced MRI are two new imaging techniques that have all shown great potential in rectal cancer staging. In order to provide definite evidence there is a need for a multicenter study with a large patient population.</detailed_description>
