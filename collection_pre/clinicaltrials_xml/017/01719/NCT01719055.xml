	<brief_title>RELIEF - A Global Registry to Evaluate Long-Term Effectiveness of Neurostimulation Therapy for Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is a prospective, multi-center, global registry of Boston Scientific neurostimulation systems for pain. The study treatment will consist of neurostimulation trial therapy with any commercially approved Boston Scientific Corporation neurostimulator for pain. Positive trials, subjects with a successful trial outcome, may progress to permanent implant of a neurostimulation system. Individualization of neurostimulation therapy for pain will be determined according to investigator discretion and site routine care, and in accordance with inclusion and exclusion criteria.</detailed_description>
