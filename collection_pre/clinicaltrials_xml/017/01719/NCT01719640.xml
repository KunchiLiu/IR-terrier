	<brief_summary>Central nervous system (CNS) injury leads to morbidity in patients, which has few good rehabilitation measures. Mesenchymal stem cells seem to have regenerative and tissue-repairing capabilities. The investigators design this study to infuse mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) intrathecally to CNS injury patients, and observe the safety and efficacy by recording the change of nervous system scores, trying to prove the effect of MSC in rehabilitate CNS injury.</brief_summary>
