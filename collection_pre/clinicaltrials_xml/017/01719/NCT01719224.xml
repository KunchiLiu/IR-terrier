	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesized that sleeping in a 45 degrees elevated body position decreases the likelihood of upper airway vulnerability to collapse. Furthermore, the investigators want to elucidate the anatomical and physiological risk factors that contribute in the upper airway obstruction in post-partum patients.</brief_summary>
