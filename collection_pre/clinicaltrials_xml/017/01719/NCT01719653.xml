	<criteria>Patients at least 18 years old planning to undergo an elective colonoscopy will be eligible for inclusion in our study. We would prefer to exclude as few groups as possible since in clinical practice these less well studied groups often need a colonoscopy and will need to have a colonoscopy preparation. 1. Patients who are allergic (this is very rare) or intolerant to any of the study drugs. 2. Patients who are pregnant. 3. Patients who required multiple day colon preparations (2 days prior and 1 day prior) in the past will be excluded. 4. Patients with ileus, gastrointestinal obstruction, gastric retention, bowel perforation, toxic colitis or toxic megacolon would not be considered elective colonoscopies and are excluded. 5. Patients with known renal disease (baseline creatinine greater than 1.50 mg/dl) will need to be excluded due to the magnesium in SUPREP which is contraindicated in patients with significant renal disease.</criteria>
