	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies how well buparlisib works in treating patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has returned after a period of improvement or has not responded to previous treatment. Buparlisib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Buparlisib in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the clinical benefit rate (complete response [CR], partial response [PR] or standard disease [SD] &gt;= 6 months) with BKM120 (buparlisib) in patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate overall response rate, overall survival, progression-free survival and duration of response. II. To describe the toxicities associated with BKM120 in lymphoma. III. To evaluate prognostic factors for aggressive lymphoma and whether there's a correlation with clinical benefit. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess serum cytokines before and after BKM120 therapy. II. To assess phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway member expression on paraffin-embedded tumor samples pre-treatment. III. To assess on paired fresh tumor tissue obtained from consenting patients pre- and post-therapy the change in activation of PI3K pathway members. OUTLINE: Patients receive buparlisib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.</detailed_description>
