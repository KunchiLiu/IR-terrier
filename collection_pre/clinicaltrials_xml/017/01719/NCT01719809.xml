	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, observational, single-center study. Patients with at least 3 months of experience using topical medications for glaucoma and who state that they administer their own eye drops will be recruited. Subjects will be videotaped instilling a sterile artificial eye drop, will be identified at the time of a regularly scheduled exam. If the patient can get a drop onto the eye and also not touch their lids or ocular surface with the eye drop bottle, the subject will be thanked but not enrolled. All other patients who agree to participate will be enrolled. Upon completion of videotaped instillation of an eye drop, each enrolled patient will be shown a video demonstrating an instillation technique and will be given an instructional handout highlighting a proper drop instillation technique. If necessary, an instillation technique will be demonstrated to them by an investigator or trained personnel. A patient will be identified as properly instilling a drop if they satisfy the following criteia: They are able to instill one (and only one) drop to the ocular surface or lower fornix without allowing the bottle touch the adnexa, eyelid, eye lashes or eye. All patients routinely return between 3 and 6 months. At this regularly scheduled visit,the investigator or trained personnel would direct the patient to instill an eye drop into the study eye.Additionally, the short glaucoma self-efficacy questionnaire will be re-administered. All of the video-recordings of participants' eye drop instillation techniques will be reviewed and assessed using a standard checklist. Their ability to administer an eye drop after training will be compared to baseline.</brief_summary>
