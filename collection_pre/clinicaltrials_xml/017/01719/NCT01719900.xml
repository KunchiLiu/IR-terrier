	<brief_summary>The recent dramatic increase in obesity has been linked to a reduction of dietary fibre intake. We hypothesized that supplementing the diet of overweight and obesity adults with pulse fibre will improve their metabolic status, chiefly defined as greater weight loss. Other metabolic health improvements may include improved glucose control and reduced inflammatory markers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Pulse Fibre Supplementation on Obesity and the Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective of our study is to assess the effects of pulse fibre supplementation on weight loss in an overweight and obese adult population. Primary objective - To determine the effects of a 12 week intake of 15g/day of pea hull fibre on weight loss supported by body composition measures. Secondary objective - To measure glucose control and appetite regulation in overweight and obese adults consuming 15g/day of pea hull fibre compared to a placebo control with the use of plasma HbA1c and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).</detailed_description>
