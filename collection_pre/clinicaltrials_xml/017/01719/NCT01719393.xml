	<brief_summary>Our hypothesis is that radial arterial pulse may reflect the severity and airway function in asthmatics. The aims of this study are to investigate the pulse spectrim of the radial artery in adult asthmatics, and evaluate its correlation with airy inflammation an lung funtion in asthmatics.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The microcirculation is directly involved in the cellular matabolism and homeostasis. Our hypothesis is that radial arterial pulse spectrum may reflect the airway condition in asthmatics. The aims of this study are to investigate the pulse spectrim of the radial artery in adult asthmatics, and evaluate its correlation with lung function, asthma control status,exhaled nitric oxide, and metabolites in the exhaed breath condensates.</detailed_description>
