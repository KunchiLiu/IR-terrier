	<brief_summary>This is a pilot study that aims to develop a lung cancer screening program for workers in British Columbia, Canada exposed to asbestos who are at risk of developing lung cancer/pleural mesothelioma. This is high risk population is at of respiratory system diseases as a result of their occupational exposures. Additionally, knowledge garnered from this study will allow us to develop other studies that will further our understanding of asbestos related lung cancer and mesothelioma.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Women or men age 50 to 79 years history of exposure to asbestos at work and one or more of the following: lung cancer risk â‰¥2% over 3 years or asbestosis or pleural plaques on a chest xray or abnormal autoantibodies level using the EarlyCDT test Capable of providing informed consent for screening procedures (low dose spiral CT, lung function, blood biomarkers). Any medical condition, such as severe heart disease (e.g. unstable angina, chronic congestive heart failure), acute or chronic respiratory failure, or any disorder, that in the opinion of the physician unlikely to benefit from screening due to shortened lifeexpectancy from coexisting illnesses Have been previously diagnosed with mesothelioma Have had other cancer within the past 5 years with the exception of the following cancers: nonmelanomatous skin cancer,localized prostate cancer, carcinoma in situ (CIS) of the cervix, or superficial bladder cancer. Treatment of the exceptions must have ended &gt;6 months before registration into this study Pregnancy Unwilling to have a low dose CT scan of chest Unwilling to sign a consent</criteria>
