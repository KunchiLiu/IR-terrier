Receipt of immune globulin or other blood products within three months prior to study enrollment or planned receipt of such products during the period of subject participation in the study. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 consecutivelyprescribed days) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodulating therapy within six months prior to study enrollment.
