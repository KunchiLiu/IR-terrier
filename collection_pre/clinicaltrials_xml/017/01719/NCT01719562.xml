	<brief_summary>This trial studies how well magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) works in detecting heart damage in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy. Diagnostic procedures, such as MRI, may help doctors predict whether patients will have heart damage caused by chemotherapy in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI in Detecting Heart Damage in Patients With Cancer Receiving Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To design an automated MRI hardware/software platform for measuring and reporting left ventricular (LV) function (volumes, strain, and ejection fraction [EF]), T1 myocardial signal, and aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV). II. To determine if pre- to 3 month post-anthracycline-based chemotherapy (Anth-bC) changes in our MRI platform generated measures of LV volumes, EF, strain, myocardial T1, and aortic PWV predict pre- to 24 month post-Anth-bC differences in these same parameters. OUTLINE: Patients undergo MRI scans for LV function, T1 myocardial signal, and aortic PWV at baseline, 3 months, and 24 months.</detailed_description>
