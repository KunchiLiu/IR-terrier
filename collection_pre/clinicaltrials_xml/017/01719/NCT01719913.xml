	<brief_summary>Objective: To identify how specific changes of the gluten content in the diet affect the host-gut microbiome interactions with implications for metabolic health. Design: A randomized, controlled, single-blinded, cross-over intervention trial consisting of two 8-week interventions periods, separated by a 6-week wash-out period. A total number of 60 participants will be included. Intervention: low vs high gluten intake.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study is designed as a randomized, controlled, single-blinded, cross-over intervention trial consisting of two 8-week interventions periods, separated by a 6-week wash-out period. A total number of 60 participants will be included. Participants consume, in randomized order, a gluten-poor diet (&lt;5 g/d) in the active treatment period and a gluten-rich diet (&gt;25 g/d) during the control period. Measurements: Altered quantitative metagenomics at bacterial gene- and species levels is the primary outcome of this study. Secondary outcomes include metabolic and inflammatory markers, circulating appetite hormone levels,serum metabolomics, gastrointestinal transit time and intestinal permeability. Furthermore, selected control measures are included; 4-day food records and a study intervention dietary records.</detailed_description>
