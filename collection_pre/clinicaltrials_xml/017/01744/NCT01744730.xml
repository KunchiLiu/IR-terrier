	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to better understand how clindamycin works in children who fall in the 85th percentile or higher for body mass index (BMI - a ratio of weight to height). The results of the study will help better understand if children in higher BMI ranges process the medication differently and whether dosing should be adjusted in these children.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, open-label pharmacokinetic and safety study of multiple doses of IV and oral clindamycin in overweight and obese children ages 2 to 17 years of age. The total study duration is expected to be approximately 24 months; each subject will participate in the study for up to 18 days (screening day; treatment days 1-14 [may be as short as 2 days] followed by an observation period of 3 days post discontinuation of clindamycin therapy or after day 17 (on day 18) of therapy in those who are treated with more than 14 days of clindamycin).</detailed_description>
