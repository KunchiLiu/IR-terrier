	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerance, and Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Profile Of 1 SR Formulation of EB-1020</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- To investigate the safety and tolerance of single doses of EB-1020 immediate release (IR) versus three sustained release (SR) formulations. - To investigate the safety and tolerance of a single oral dose of a SR formulation of EB-1020 in the fed and fasted state. - To investigate the safety, tolerance, and cognitive effects of multiple oral rising doses of a SR formulation of EB-1020. Secondary Objectives - To characterize the single dose and steady state pharmacokinetic profiles of EB-1020 SR formulations. - To investigate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetic profile of EB-1020 SR following single oral doses.</detailed_description>

Be in general good health without clinically significant medical history 5. Have clinical laboratory test results that are within the laboratory reference range; or if out of range are not clinically relevant and are acceptable to the Investigator and Sponsor medical representative 6. Negative Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B and Hepatitis Screening test 7. Able and willing to give written informed consent 1. Receipt of any investigational agent or drug within 3 months of entry into the study 2. Use of prescription drugs within 4 weeks prior to first dosing. Subjects who have used over the counter medication excluding paracetamol, topical over the counter medications and routine vitamins but including megadose (intake of 20 to 600 times the recommended daily dose) vitamin therapy within 7 days of first dosing, unless agreed as nonclinically relevant by the Principal Investigator and Sponsor 3. A history of, or current evidence for, suicidal ideation, based upon clinical interview and a psychiatric questionnaire 4. A history of known or suspected seizures, spasms, infantile spasms, febrile convulsions, unexplained significant and recent loss of consciousness or history of significant head trauma with loss of consciousness or a family history (first degree relative) of epilepsy or seizures (fits) 5. A history of sleep problems in the last 3 months 6. A history of relevant atopy or drug hypersensitivity 7. A history (within the last 5 years) or evidence of alcohol or drug abuse. Subject who consume more than 14 units (female) or 21 (male) units of alcohol a week (unit = 1 glass (125 mL) of wine = 1 measure of spirits = Â½ pint of beer) will also be ineligible 8. A positive urine test for drugs of abuse or alcohol at Screening or on the day of admittance to the Study Unit 9. A history of smoking in the last 3 months 10. Have a significant infection (such as influenza) or known inflammatory process on screening or admission 11. Have acute gastrointestinal symptoms at the time of screening or admission (e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, heartburn ) 12. Have previously received EB1020 13. Be vegetarians, vegans or have medical dietary restrictions 14. Any major surgical procedure within one month of entry into the study 15. Have difficulties communicating reliably with the Investigator or appear unlikely to cooperate with the requirements of the study in the investigator's judgment. 16. Any other condition which in the view of the Investigator is likely to interfere with study or put the subject at risk.</criteria>
