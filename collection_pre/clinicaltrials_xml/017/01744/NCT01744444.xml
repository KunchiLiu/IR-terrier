	<brief_summary>Different treatment trials have been published in acquired nystagmus in the last decade; gabapentin and memantine have been found to be efficient in treating pendular nystagmus in Multiple Sclerosis. The effects of treatments are measured on nystagmus velocity, amplitude, frequency and on visual acuity. None of the trials measured a functional visual score or oscillopsia score. The aim of our study is to evaluate the effect of gabapentin and memantine on the mean velocity, amplitude and frequency of pendular nystagmus, as well as on oscillopsia, visual acuity and vision-specific health-related quality of life score, in 10 patients with multiple sclerosis. The primary object is to find out the best variable to evaluate the efficiency of nystagmus treatment and the secondary, to compare the efficiency of both gabapentin and memantine in a common population of patients.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All patients may have a clinically definite, laboratorysupported diagnosis of multiple sclerosis according to the Mac Donald criteria. All patients may present a chronic acquired pendular nystagmus due to MS, observed over a period of 6 months. All patients will be informed about the design and purpose of the study, and all will give their informed, written consent to the protocol, which may have been approved by the local ethics committee. Age: above 18 Able to understand the instructions Having a health coverage Able to sit down for 1 hour Stable dosage of previous medications (beginning 3 weeks previously and terminating at the end of the trial duration), except for steroids, gabapentin or memantine. Ophthalmological Other ophthalmological disorder that could impair corrected visual acuity (Maculopathy, Retinopathyâ€¦) Neurological Ongoing seizure Severe handicap that does not allow sitting down position for 1 hour Suicidal behavior or risk Treatment Under memantine or gabapentin medication (these medications should have been stopped for at least 1 week for gabapentin and 3 weeks for memantine) Under morphine, NmethylDaspartate such as amantadine, ketamine or dextromethorphan Steroid medication for a current relapse (beginning 3 weeks previously and terminating at the end of the trial duration) Known hypersensitivity to memantine or gabapentin General Unstable medical state Patient with a galactose intolerance, a lapp lactase deficiency or glucosegalactose malabsorption Moderate renal failure (creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/min on bioassay dated from less than one month) Recent heart infarction (&lt;3months) Unstable congestive heart insufficiency Unstable arterial hypertension Leucopenia (&lt;2500/mm3) Transaminase increase (&gt;5 time normal values) Pregnancy (on questioning) Tutelage or any legal protection measure</criteria>
