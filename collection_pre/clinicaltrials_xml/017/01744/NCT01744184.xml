	<brief_summary>This study aims to determine whether Entonox (gas and air) is at least as good as intravenous midazolam in providing analgesia and sedation during gastroscopy. Entonox is used as an adjunct in lower gastrointestinal procedures but is not routinely used in gastroscopy, and there is only one similar published study to date, which was performed in children. The main advantage of Entonox over midazolam is the quick recovery time following withdrawal of the agent, which enables patients to return to independent normal life. The investigators would like to be able to offer Entonox to patients as an option for sedation during gastroscopy, this study is being conducted to determine if it is a safe and feasible option.</brief_summary>
