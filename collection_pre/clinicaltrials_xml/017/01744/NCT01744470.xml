	<brief_summary>This prospective, interventional, open label, randomized, multicenter study was designed to determine the risk/benefit ratio of a 50 % reduction of Advagraf® daily dose, 4 months after transplantation. Randomized patients are to be stable with their tacrolimus daily dose required to reach targeted tacrolimus trough levels. Based on Month-3 eligibility assessments, patients will be randomized in two groups (1:1): patients with 50 % reduction of the daily dose of Advagraf® 4 months after transplantation, and patients kept on their usual dose. The benefit/risk ratio will include the assessment of renal function, histological lesions from both alloreactivity and CNI nephrotoxicity, and safety data (metabolic and infectious diseases).</brief_summary>
