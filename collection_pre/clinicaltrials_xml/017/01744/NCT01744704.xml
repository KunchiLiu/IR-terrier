	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of rhNGF Eye Drops in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I, randomised, double-masked, placebo-controlled eye drops administration study of rh-NGF in healthy male and female subjects. This study consists of a single ascending dose part (part 0 one drop single application). Then single ascending dose part (part A; one drop three times a day) and a multiple ascending dose part (part B; one drop three times a day for five days). All parts of the study will consist of 3 ascending dose levels. In order to support the dose escalation MAD phase from Covance, Basel to Covance, Leeds, an additional cohort (0M) will be conducted at Covance, Leeds at the same dose level as cohort 1M to ensure a degree of consistency between the two sites, i.e. that no dose escalation stopping criteria were met at either site. In Part 0, each ascending dose cohort will include 3 subjects treated with one dose of rh-NGF. In part A, each ascending dose cohort will include 6 subjects treated with rh-NGF and 2 with placebo. In part B, each ascending dose cohort will include 9 subjects treated with rh-NGF drug and 3 with placebo, in addition to cohort 0M, which will include 3 subjects treated with rh-NGF and 1 with placebo</detailed_description>

Subject's systemic and ocular medical history must be considered normal in the opinion of the investigator at the Screening and Baseline visits. Best corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) score ≤ 0.00 LogMAR (≥83 ETDRS letters, 20/20 Snellen or 1.0 decimal fraction) in each eye at the Screening and Baseline visits. Normal anterior segment on external and slit lamp examination in both eyes at the Screening and Baseline visits. Normal posterior segment on fundus ophthalmoscopic examination in both eyes at the Screening and Baseline visits. Subject must be considered in good systemic health in the opinion of the investigator at the Screening and Baseline visits, as determined by: 1.
