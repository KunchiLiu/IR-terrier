	<brief_summary>Patients who present to our institution with a traumatic injury to their elbow who need operative management will be randomized to one of two groups; a treatment arm and a control arm. The treatment arm will receive a three-week postoperative course of indomethacin while the control group will not. We will follow both groups to assess whether or not indomethacin prophylaxis affects the rate of heterotopic ossification.</brief_summary>
