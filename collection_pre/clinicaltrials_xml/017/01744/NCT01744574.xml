	<brief_summary>Data suggest that progesterone may improve smoking cessation outcomes perhaps by reducing impulsive behavior. However, the clinical literature on this topic is lacking. Therefore, in Project I we are proposing a double-blind randomized controlled trial to assess the role of exogenous progesterone on impulsivity and smoking cessation in a sample of males and females who are motivated to quit smoking.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects will be stratified by sex and then randomly assigned to active progesterone (PRO) or placebo (PBO). Telephone screening and visit invitation leads to the consent process and in-person screening including medical-psychiatric evaluation for inclusion/exclusion, then randomization and medication induction, stable medication with medication reduction and final evaluation for secondary outcomes.</detailed_description>
