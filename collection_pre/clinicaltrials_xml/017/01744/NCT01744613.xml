	<brief_summary>Antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel is recommended following peripheral endovascular procedures. The clinical significance of an inadequate response to clopidogrel following percutaneous coronary interventions has been recently recognized.This study was designed to investigate platelet responsiveness to Clopidogrel following endovascular therapy of peripheral arterial disease using the VerifyNow P2Y12 point-of-care testing and to determine the optimal P2Y12 reactive unites (PRU) cut-off value of platelet inhibition influencing outcomes of infrainguinal angioplasty or stenting in patients receiving clopidogrel antiplatelet therapy.</brief_summary>
