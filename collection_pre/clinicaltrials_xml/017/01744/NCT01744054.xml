	<brief_summary>The successful localization of the y90 microspheres by PET/MR and/or PET/CT scans would be a useful tool in individualizing patient care after the radioembolization procedure. The information from a PET/MR or PET/CT scan would allow for early evaluation of the technical success of the procedure.</brief_summary>
