	<brief_summary>This study will explore the safety, tolerability, and serum uric acid lowering effect of lesinurad in healthy Japanese males to allow comparison with the Western population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single and Multiple Dose Study in Japanese</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While there is extensive clinical experience with lesinurad in the Western population, it is recognized that both intrinsic and extrinsic factors may impact the PK, PD, safety, and dose response in different ethnic populations. The purpose of this study is to explore the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) of single and multiple doses of lesinurad in healthy Japanese males, and to allow comparison of these parameters with the Western population.</detailed_description>
