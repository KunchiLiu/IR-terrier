	<brief_summary>In resource-limited setting, concerns remain regarding the emergence of virologic failure and high-level drug resistance mutations (DRM) during WHO recommended first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) based regimens for Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV1) infected patients. The study hypothesis is that a boosted-protease inhibitor regimen has a better outcome than a NNRTI-based regimen with a low genetic barrier to resistance. The study is a randomized, multicenter, factorial trial (conducted in Congo), in treatment- naïve adults receiving for 96 weeks ritonavir- boosted lopinavir(LPV/r) or nevirapine (NVP) each in combination with tenofovir (TDF) /emtricitabine (FTC) or zidovudine (ZDV)/lamivudine (3TC). The primary end point is the incidence of therapeutic (clinical and/or virologic)failure by study week 24.</brief_summary>
