	<brief_summary>Epidemiological studies suggest dietary (poly) phenols decrease the risk of death from cardiovascular diseases. (Poly)phenol-rich foods include fruits and vegetables as well as tea, coffee, red wine, and chocolate. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether endothelial function is altered by ingestion of phenolic acids. Moreover, the investigators will evaluate the effect of phenolic acids on blood pressure and platelet adhesion.</brief_summary>
