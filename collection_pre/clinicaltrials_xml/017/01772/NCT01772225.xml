	<brief_summary>The aim of this observational study is to identify and quantify the humanistic and economic burden of illness of patients with complete resection (no residual disease) of stage IB-IIIA NSCLC in three European countries (France, Germany, and the United Kingdom [UK]). Data collection will be conducted through patient medical record abstraction and patient survey.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study procedures will have no effect on the medical care delivered to enrolled patients. Physicians will continue to provide usual medical care to patients. There is no study intervention, and no drug or other intervention will be provided to the site as part of the study. Methodology: the study will consist of two components: - Medical record abstraction. Medical records of eligible patients (both living and deceased) will be reviewed, and data will be extracted for the study. Data collected will include patient demographic and disease characteristics, details of medical care received (including adjuvant treatment), and information about disease recurrence/progression. - Patient survey. Living patients will be asked to participate in a patient survey. Living patients who agree to participate will be administered a brief patient questionnaire to collect information that is not available in the clinical sites' medical records [e.g., local medical care, patient out-of-pocket expenses, work loss, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL)]. The site may exclude individual patients from the survey if site staff feel that it would be inappropriate for that individual; the study will not collect patient survey information from the families of deceased patients. Informed consent will be collected from living patients who participate in the patient survey, apart from the abstraction of their medical records. Country-specific requirements will be followed. The medical records of patients (living or deceased) with complete resection of stage IB-IIIA NSCLC between 01 August 2009 and 31 July 2012 will be identified. No vaccine or drug was administered during this study.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient medical records will be screened using the following criteria: Patients must be aged 18 years or older at the time of first presentation with clinical stage IBIIIA NSCLC. Patients must have complete resection of pathologic stage IBIIIA NSCLC at least 1 calendar month prior to the date of screening, according to the current classification recommended by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (2009). The investigator/study site must have been the main care provider for the patient during the period of treatment or management of the patient's NSCLC. Patients who underwent wedge resection. Patients whose resection was less than 1 calendar month before the date of screening. Patients who received adjuvant systemic treatment within a clinical trial if the type of adjuvant treatment is either unknown or is not recommended by international clinical guidelines [European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)]. Patients who are lost to followup: Living patients who are no longer under the care of the site or can no longer be contacted. Deceased patients who were transferred to another NSCLC treatment centre before death. Patients with concomitant malignancies who received treatment for other cancers at any time during their treatment or followup for NSCLC.</criteria>
