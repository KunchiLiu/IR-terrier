	<brief_summary>Eligible subjects with chronic neck pain will be randomly allocated to one of two intervention groups: real vs control spinal manipulation. They will receive three intervention sessions. H1: Chronic neck pain patients treated longitudinally over a series of three encounters in one week by random assignment to treatment group with either of the dual delivery procedures (Intervention 1=typical-control or Intervention 2=control-control) will have a 50% error rate of self-report of group allocation at exit interview. H2: Patients treated by the typical-control dual procedure over a typical sequence of encounters (3 times in one week) will show statistically significant improvement in clinical outcomes; defined quantitatively by visual analogue pain scale (VAS), Neck Disability Index (NDI), range of motion and pressure algometry; compared to those treated by the control-control dual procedure. H3: Patients stratified by 'a priori' patient expectation for treatment outcome will show no significant difference in self-report of group allocation or clinical outcome measures. A total of 372 subjects will be recruited.</brief_summary>
