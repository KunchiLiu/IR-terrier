	<brief_summary>The most notable tolerability finding from these multiple dosing studies has been the occurrence of mild to moderate rash at doses of 450 mg BID and 600 mg BID. Based upon this finding, the current four week study is designed to examine whether a slow titration regimen up to a lower maintenance dose of 450 mg BID is able to reduce the incidence of rash.</brief_summary>
