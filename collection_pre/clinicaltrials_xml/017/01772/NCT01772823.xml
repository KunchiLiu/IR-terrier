	<brief_summary>Approximately 200 HIV-uninfected young men who have sex with men (YMSM) at high risk of acquiring HIV infection, ages 18-22 years, inclusive, will be recruited across all participating Adolescent Medicine Trials Units (AMTU). The behavioral intervention will be assigned at the level of the site, which include Many Men, Many Voices (3MV) and Personalized Cognitive Counseling (PCC). Subjects will first complete the behavioral intervention offered at their respective site and then be provided with open label emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir (TDF) (Truvada®) as PrEP. Behavioral and biomedical data will be collected at baseline and 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks. Any subjects who become HIV infected during the course of the study will be discontinued from the study agent and followed for an additional 24 weeks after the study visit at which HIV infection is confirmed. Those subjects who meet specific bone or renal criteria at the Week 48 visit or the 24-Week HIV Seropositive visit will be followed for an additional 48 weeks in the Extension Phase to more closely monitor longer-term outcome of potential concerns.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open Label Demonstration Project and Phase II Safety Study of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objectives of the study are to provide additional safety data regarding FTC/TDF (Truvada®) use as PrEP in YMSM, to examine acceptability, patterns of use, rates of adherence, measure levels of drug exposure and patterns of risk behavior when YMSM are provided open label FTC/TDF (Truvada®). The study will also examine information regarding safety and efficacy of PrEP from prior studies.</detailed_description>
