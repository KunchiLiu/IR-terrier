	<brief_title>Safety Study of Human Spinal Cord-derived Neural Stem Cell Transplantation for the Treatment of Chronic SCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase I, open-label, single-site, safety study of human spinal cord-derived neural stem cell (HSSC) transplantation for the treatment of chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) defined as at least one year but no more than 2 years after traumatic SCI. A maximum of 4 subjects with chronic SCI with American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) A who meet eligibility criteria will be enrolled. No control group will be included. All subjects will receive spinal cord injections of HSSC: Group A: 4 patients with T2-T12 cord injury. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be convened at approximately 1 month (4 weeks) intervals after the first subject and will review all available safety data for all treated subjects. Study duration will be for 6 months for each subject. Post study, all subjects will be followed for additional 54 months by bi-annual visits during which safety assessments will be conducted as specified in the protocol.</detailed_description>
