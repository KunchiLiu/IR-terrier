	<brief_title>Safety Study of Intravenous Biapenem (RPX2003) and RPX7009 Given Alone and in Combination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The worldwide spread of resistance to antibiotics among Gram-negative bacteria, particularly members of the ESKAPE group of pathogens, has resulted in a crisis in the treatment of hospital acquired infections. In particular, the recent dissemination of a serine carbapenemase (e.g., KPC) in Enterobacteriaceae in US hospitals now poses a considerable threat to the carbapenems and other members of the beta-lactam class of antimicrobial agents. Rempex is developing a fixed combination antibiotic of a carbapenem (RPX2003 or biapenem) plus a new beta-lactamase inhibitor (RPX7009) which has activity against serine beta-lactamases, including KPC. This Phase 1 study will assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Intravenous Biapenem and RPX7009, administered alone and in combination in healthy adult subjects.</detailed_description>
