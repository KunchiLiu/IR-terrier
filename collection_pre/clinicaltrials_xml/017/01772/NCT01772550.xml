	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare multidetector computed tomography (CT) image quality following peripheral venous high pressure injection of iodinated intravenous contrast media between a 20 gauge (GA) fenestrated, intravenous catheter (BD Nexiva™ Diffusics™) and an 18 GA non-fenestrated, intravenous catheter. In the contrast enhanced CT procedure (CECT), a machine (power injector) is used to rapidly deliver contrast agent to an individual's circulatory system. The contrast allows for greater differentiation of tissues in images of the area of interest, affording a better opportunity to visually assess the area and hence make a more accurate diagnosis. CECT often requires a high rate of contrast flow (≥ 5 mL/sec) through the IV catheter to provide sufficient contrast for an acceptable image. Typically an 18 GA IV catheter is required to achieve these high flow rates; however, often the patient does not have a vein that will accommodate this large size catheter. The BD Nexiva™ Diffusics™ IV catheter is designed to deliver a higher flow rate than a conventional catheter of the same gauge by incorporating fenestrations (small openings) near the tip of the catheter that allow fluid to exit the catheter in addition to that which normally exits through the main opening at the tip of the catheter.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This is a prospective study performed in adult human subjects who have been referred for a CECT. The study will occur during a single visit. Once consented and enrolled, subjects whose antecubital veins can accommodate an 18 GA IV catheter (as assessed by the Inserter or designee of the PI), will be randomized to receive either a conventional 18 GA IV catheter (reference, control) or a 20 GA BD Nexiva™ Diffusics™ IV catheter (test). Subjects whose veins are not considered suitable for an 18 GA IV catheter will be placed in a non-randomized cohort for placement of a 20 GA BD Nexiva™ Diffusics™ IV catheter. Subjects will receive one (1) catheter for the study. The primary objective of this study is to compare multidetector computed tomography (CT) image quality following peripheral venous high pressure injection of iodinated intravenous contrast media between a 20 GA fenestrated, intravenous catheter (BD Nexiva™ Diffusics™) and an 18 GA non-fenestrated, intravenous catheter. The 20 GA BD Nexiva™ Diffusics™ IV catheter will be considered non-inferior to conventional 18 GA IV catheters if the 95% upper bound for the difference in percentage of images of acceptable quality between the images acquired using the 18 GA IV catheters and the 20 GA BD Nexiva™ Diffusics™ IV catheters is less than 15%. Study catheters will be inserted by appropriately licensed healthcare professionals (Inserters). Prior to enrollment, potential Inserters will be trained and qualified by the Sponsor on proper use of the BD Nexiva™ Diffusics™ IV catheter in both an artificial hand model and then in human patients. Inserters will then be expected to use the test product for a period of two (2) weeks, in order to gain familiarity with the product. Because BD Nexiva™ Diffusics™ IV catheters are not currently used in the Johns Hopkins Outpatient Center, the Sponsor will provide BD Nexiva™ Diffusics™ IV catheters for use during this training and familiarization period.</detailed_description>
