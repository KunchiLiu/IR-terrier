	<brief_summary>Research has shown that questionnaires completed on the internet have the potential to provide more complete and honest data with fewer errors in a more efficient manner than questionnaires completed using the paper and pencil format. Despite the numerous advantages of internet-administered questionnaires, it is important to make sure that the internet questionnaires will yield comparable results to the well-established paper and pencil versions. No one has studied internet administration of scoliosis specific questionnaires in adolescents with scoliosis. The investigators will test whether the internet administration of scoliosis questionnaires is as reliable as the traditional paper and pencil version. The investigators predict that the internet-administered questionnaire will provide the same reliability as the paper-administered questionnaires.</brief_summary>
