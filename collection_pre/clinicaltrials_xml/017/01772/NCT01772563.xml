	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the present study is to investigate the influence of co-administration of itraconazole and volasertib on the pharmacokinetic profile of volasertib without co-administration of itraconazole. Secondary objectives are to investigate safety, tolerability and preliminary therapeutic effects following intravenous administration of volasertib.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced, non resectable and / or metastatic solid tumour, for whom conventional treatment has failed, or for whom no therapy of proven efficacy exists, or who are not amenable to established forms of treatment based on the investigator's assessment 2. Male or female 3. Age =&gt;18 and =&lt;70 years 4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score =&lt; 2 5. Recovery from Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade &gt;= 2 therapyrelated toxicities from previous chemo, hormone, immuno, or radiotherapy (except alopecia) Exclusion criteria: 1. Serious concomitant nononcological disease considered by the investigator to be incompatible with the protocol 2. Active infectious disease 3. Viral hepatitis, HIV infection 4. Clinical evidence of active brain metastasis or leptomeningeal disease during the past 6 months 5. Second malignancy currently requiring active therapy (except for hormonal / antihormonal treatment e.g. in prostate or breast cancer) 6. Absolute neutrophil count less than 1,500/mm3 7. Platelet count less than 100,000/mm3 8. Total bilirubin greater than 1.5 mg/dL (&gt; 26 Âµmol/L, SI unit equivalent) 9. Aspartate amino transferase (AST) and / or alanine amino transferase (ALT) greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (if related to liver metastases greater than five times the upper limit of normal) 10. Serum creatinine greater than 2x upper limit of normal (ULN) 11. QTcF prolongation &gt; 470 ms or QT prolongation deemed clinically relevant by the investigator (e.g., congenital long QT syndrome).The QTcF will be calculated as the mean of the 3 ECGs taken at screening 12. Female patients with childbearing potential and unwilling to use a medically acceptable method of contraception during the trial and for at least six months after end of active therapy. Woman of childbearing potential (premenopausal female) is defined as the female who is not surgically sterilised by hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation or postmenopausal for at least 12 months. 13. Treatment with other investigational drugs or participation in another clinical trial within the past four weeks prior to start of therapy or concomitantly with this trial 14. Chemo, radio immuno, or moleculartargeted cancertherapy within the past four weeks prior to start of therapy or concomitantly with this trial. This restriction does not apply to steroids, bisphosphonates hormonal / antihormonal treatment (e.g. in prostate or breast cancer). 15. Alcohol abuse more than an average 3 units of alcoholic beverages per day or more than 21 units per week (1 unit equals 0.5 pint [285 mL] of beer or lager, 1 glass [125 mL] of wine, 25 mL shot of 40% spirit) or drug abuse 16. Life expectancy less than 12 weeks 17. Potent CYP 3A4 and Pglycoprotein inhibitors other than the study drug or inducers between one week prior to first drug administration or expected treatment with a respective drug until the last PK sample is collected 1. Strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors: atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole (other then study drug), ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin 2. CYP 3A4 inducers: carbamazepine, rifampicin 3. Pgp inhibitors: cyclosporine, erythromycin, itraconazole (other then study drug), ketoconazole, quinidine, phenobarbital salt with quinidine, ritonavir, valspodar, verapamil 4. Pgp inducers: hypericum perforatum, rifampicin</criteria>
