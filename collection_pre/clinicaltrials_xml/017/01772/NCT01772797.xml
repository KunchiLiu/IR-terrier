	<brief_summary>The primary purpose of the study is to estimate the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of LDK378 and AUY922. This study will assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity of the combination of LDK378 and AUY922 in ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer.</brief_summary>
