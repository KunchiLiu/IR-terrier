	<brief_summary>The relapsing nature of atopic dermatitis (AD) presents a challenge for its long-term treatment. Efficacy and safety of corticosteroids have been proven in the acute treatment of AD, but not its efficacy and security to reduce or prevent relapses. Objectives To investigate long-term management (16 weeks) of AD with fluticasone propionate (FP) 0,05% cream twice weekly in addition to an emollient (vehicle) after stabilization of an acute flare of AD with FP cream.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Topical Twice Weekly Fluticasone Treatment to Reduce Relapse in Atopic Dermatitis in Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients 2-10 years of age with a history of mild to moderate AD will be eligible for this multicentre, randomized, double-blind, controlled study if they present an acute flare of AD (&lt;30% affected body surface area; no head). After successful treatment of the flare in an acute phase, patients will receive either, FP twice weekly plus vehicle or vehicle alone over a 16-week maintenance phase. The primary study end point will be probability of a relapse of AD occurring. We will conduct survivor analysis of results.</detailed_description>
