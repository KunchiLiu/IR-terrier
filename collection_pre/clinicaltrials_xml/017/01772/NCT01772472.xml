	<brief_summary>This 2-arm, randomized, open-label study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab emtansine versus trastuzumab as adjuvant therapy in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer who have residual tumor present in the breast or axillary lymph nodes following preoperative therapy. Eligible patients will be randomized to receive either trastuzumab emtansine 3.6 mg/kg or trastuzumab 6 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for 14 cycles. Radiotherapy and/or hormone therapy will be given in addition if indicated.</brief_summary>
