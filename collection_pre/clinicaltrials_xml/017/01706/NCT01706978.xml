	<brief_summary>This Clinical Trial is being conducted to study two adjunctive treatments for rotator cuff repair; soft tissue and bone trephination. "Trephination" is a procedure that involves making small perforations either in the torn tendon near its edge, or in the bone that the tendon is repaired to. The rotator cuff is repaired by sewing the tendon down to the bone in the shoulder. Trephination is a new technique that is used in addition to the standard method of repairing the rotator cuff tendon. This study will help to determine whether this technique improves the speed of healing, the strength and the re-tear rate of the repair. You are being asked to take part in this study because you have a tear of the rotator cuff that requires surgical treatment. A total of 90 participants will participate in this study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Patients who have failed standard nonsurgical management of their rotator cuff tear, and who would benefit from a surgical repair of the cuff. Failed medical management will be defined as persistent pain and disability despite adequate standard nonoperative management for 6 months. Medical management will be defined as: The use of drugs including analgesics and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs Physiotherapy consisting of stretching, strengthening and local modalities (ultrasound, cryotherapy, etc) Activity modification Imaging, and intraoperative findings confirming a full thickness tear of the rotator cuff. 1. Characteristics of the cuff tear that render the cuff irrepairable: fatty infiltration in the muscles grade III (50%) or greater; superior subluxation of the humeral head; retraction of the cuff to the level of the glenoid rim. 2. Partial thickness cuff tears. 3. Significant shoulder comorbidities e.g. Bankart lesion, osteoarthritis 4. Previous surgery on affected shoulder e.g. Previous rotator cuff repair. 5. Patients with active worker's compensation claims 6. Active joint or systemic infection 7. Significant muscle paralysis 8. Rotator cuff tear arthropathy 9. Charcot's arthropathy 10. Significant medical comorbidity that could alter the effectiveness of the surgical intervention (eg. Cervical radiculopathy, polymyalgia rheumatica) 11. Major medical illness (life expectancy less then 1 year or unacceptably high operative risk) 12. Unable to speak or read English/French 13. Psychiatric illness that precludes informed consent 14. Unwilling to be followed for 1 year 15. Advanced physiologic age</criteria>
