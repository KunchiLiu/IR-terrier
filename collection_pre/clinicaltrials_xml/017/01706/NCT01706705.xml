	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Brachytherapy Applicator Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment planning for patients with cervical cancer treated at MD Anderson is usually performed based on x-ray films taken while the patient is under anesthesia in the operating room. In this study, you will have an MRI and CT scan performed after recovering from anesthesia in addition to the standard x-rays. In order to allow MRI images to be taken, special MRI compatible applicators will be used. The CT and MRI images will be reviewed by the doctor in charge of radiation treatment and will also be used for research purposes. Study Procedures: If you agree to take part in this study, an applicator made of a material that can be used during an MRI will be used. You will have a CT scan and an MRI scan performed after the implant is placed in the operating room. The CT scan should take about 20 minutes and the MRI about 55 minutes. These scans will be performed after you wake up from general anesthesia. Pain medicine will be given if you feel any discomfort from the placement of the implant. The additional scans will be used to confirm appropriate placement of the applicator and may result in small adjustments to your radiation treatment plan. Length of Study: Your active participation on this study will be complete once you have the CT and MRI scans. Your medical record may be reviewed after the scans for the purposes of the study, but you will not be contacted in the future. This is an investigational study. The applicator that best fits your personal anatomy will be used in this study. A selection of MRI compatible applicators are available. Many of the MRI applicators that will be used are FDA approved. However, in some cases you may have a novel device with a moveable shield placed. This applicator is not FDA approved or commercially available. Up to 57 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1) Women with stage greater than or equal to IB2 cervical cancer treated with definitive chemoradiation or radiation therapy who require intracavitary brachytherapy. 1. Patient or tumor anatomy that requires use of a nonMRIcompatible applicator. 2. Patients who require interstitial brachytherapy. 3. Patients whose treating physician feels that they require additional 3D imaging at the time of implant based on physical exam or initial findings. 4. Patients with implantable cardioverterdefibrillator, pacemaker or other implanted device, which precludes MRI acquisition.</criteria>
