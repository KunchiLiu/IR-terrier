	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial studies hypofractionated image guided radiation therapy in treating patients with stage IV breast cancer. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Giving radiation therapy in different ways may kill more tumor cells</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypofractionated Image Guided Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage IV Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the feasibility of correlating changes in the number of circulating tumor cells in metastatic breast cancer patients with time to progression following hypofractionated image guided radiotherapy to all known sites (=&lt; 5) of disease. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the progression free survival, overall survival, pattern of failure, and toxicity of hypofractionated image guided radiotherapy to all active sites (=&lt; 5) of metastatic disease. II. To assess the feasibility of the Interferon-Related DNA Damage Resistance Gene Signature (IRDS) for its predictive value in treatment failure, both in and out of the radiation field. OUTLINE: Patients with metastases in the lung, liver, abdomen, and extremities undergo 10 fractions or less of hypofractionated radiation therapy and patients with brain metastases undergo a single fraction of stereotactic radiosurgery. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 weeks for 2 months, at 3 months, every 3 months for a year, and then every 6 months thereafter.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically or cytologically proven diagnosis of breast cancer (invasive ductal, lobular, medullary, papillary, colloid, tubular) Completion of standard of care treatment for local and regional disease with no known residual American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) (6th edition, 2002) Stage IV ( Any T, Any N, M1) based upon the following minimum diagnostic workup: History/physical examination within 8 weeks prior to registration Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or positron emission tomography (PET) CT of the whole body within 60 days prior to registration MRI of the brain, if clinically indicated Documentation of 15 sites of metastatic tumor; each individual site of tumor must be =&lt; 10 cm or &lt; 500 cc volume and amenable to radiation therapy as seen on standard imaging (CT, MRI, bone scan) Pathology from at least one metastatic site confirming breast primary is recommended Zubrod performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%) Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,800 cells/mm^3 Platelets &gt;= 100,000 cells/mm^3 Hemoglobin &gt;= 8.0 g/dl (Note: The use of transfusion or other intervention to achieve hemoglobin [Hgb] &gt;= 8.0 g/dl is acceptable) Total bilirubin within institutional limits Albumin &gt; 2.9 g/dl Alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2.5x upper limit of normal (ULN) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 2.5 x ULN Room air saturation (saturated oxygen [Sa02]) &gt; 90% Life expectancy &gt; 3 months Patient complete study specific informed consent process and sign consent form prior to study entry Patients with prior metastatic treatment are eligible if they have been disease free for &gt; 3 years; participants may receive hormonal and Herceptin treatment at any time Patients are ineligible if they have had prior treatment for their metastatic disease within 3 years Prior radiotherapy that would result in overlap of radiation therapy fields Coexisting or prior invasive malignancy (except nonmelanomatous skin cancer) unless disease free for a minimum of 3 years (for example, carcinoma in situ of the breast, oral cavity, or cervix are all permissible) Severe, active comorbidity, defined as follows: Clinically significant pulmonary dysfunction, cardiomyopathy, any history of clinically significant congestive heart failure (CHF), unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac arrhythmia Transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time of registration Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness requiring hospitalization or precluding study therapy at the time of registration Hepatic insufficiency resulting in clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defects; note, however, that laboratory tests for liver function and coagulation parameters are not required for entry into this protocol Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) based upon current Centers for Disease Control (CDC) definition; note, however, that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing is not required for entry into this protocol; the need to exclude patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the treatments involved in this protocol may be significantly immunosuppressive; protocolspecific requirements may also exclude immunocompromised patients Pregnancy, breast feeding or women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active and not willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception during treatment and for at least three months following completion; this exclusion is necessary because the treatment involved in this study may be significantly teratogenic Prior treatment with antiangiogenic therapy Significant atelectasis such that CT definition of the gross tumor volume (GTV) is difficult to determine Exudative, bloody or cytologically malignant effusions Evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion prior to study start; patients with pleural effusion that is transudative, cytologically negative, and nonbloody are eligible; if a pleural effusion is too small for diagnostic thoracentesis, the patient will be eligible</criteria>
