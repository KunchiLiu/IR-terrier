	<brief_summary>The study hypothesis under test is that administration of a CCR2/5 antagonist to subjects with type 2 diabetes and overt nephropathy will result in a reduction in urinary albumin, a surrogate for improved glomerular filtration.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes together with stages 2, 3a, 3b or 4 CKD, based on an eGFR of 2075 mL/min/1.73m2. Evidence of persistent, overt albuminuria; defined as a UACR &gt;=300 mg/g (&gt;=33.9 mg/mmol) or UPCR &gt;=390 mg/g (44.1 mg/mmol), or equivalent, for 3 months or longer. Stable background therapy of RAAS inhibition (ie, an ACE inhibitor and/or an ARB, which may also include an aldosterone antagonist in double RAAS but not triple RAAS inhibitor therapy) for at least 3 months before screening and to be maintained for the duration of the study. Subjects with CKD resulting from type 1 diabetes or nondiabetic CKD. Subjects who are diagnosed with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPCKD), severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD) or obstructive uropathy.</criteria>
