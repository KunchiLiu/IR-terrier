	<brief_title>Vapocoolant (Pain Ease) Use for Venipuncture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, randomized, blinded, comparator study. This study design is considered standard for establishing safety and efficacy data. Active treatment vapocoolant spray (Pain Ease Medium Stream) spray) will be used. There will be a placebo (sterile water) in this study. The population selected for this study, adults (excluding the very old, &gt; 80 years old) represents a patient population that may benefit from vapocoolant spray. This is a patient population that according to the treating health care provider already requires venipuncture for "blood draw" but not intravenous cannulation. Because venipuncture is a painful procedure, vapocoolant may confer benefit for the relief of pain.</detailed_description>
