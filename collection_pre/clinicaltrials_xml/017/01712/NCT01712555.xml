	<brief_summary>After people lose an eye, for whatever reason, they often experience fat atrophy of the tissues in the orbit. This leads to a sunken appearance that is often not correctable by a cosmetic shell prosthesis. Current techniques to correct this deformity are inadequate/ invasive. Injection of various gels (Restylane, Radiesse) are temporary had have their own disadvantages. This study seeks to demonstrate an improvement in the retention of injected autologous fat by mixing in autologous PRP (platelet rich plasma).</brief_summary>
