	<brief_summary>No studies have reported the effect of pre-meal snacking on raisins compared to other commonly consumed snacks on energy intake in children. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to examine appetite and energy intake following consumption of ad libitum snack of raisins, grapes or mix of almonds and raisins, compared with a water control, on appetite and food intake 30 min later in 8 - 11 y old normal weight children. The investigators hypothesized that raisins would lower subsequent energy intake in children and reduce hunger.</brief_summary>
