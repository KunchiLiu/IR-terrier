	<brief_summary>Background and Objectives: All modern surgical procedures require a high level of cognitive and psychomotor skills achieved using different training methods, but could be influenced by fatigue and other psychological factors. We evaluate the effect of warm-up exercises on operative laparoscopic performances in gynecologic laparoscopic procedures. Methods: The surgical team operates on a consecutive series of 20 patients and perform laparoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy. Patients are randomly allocated in 2 groups: group A to be operated on without warm-up exercises and group B to be operated on after a short-term warm-up. All patients are operated on by the same surgical team. The full-time records of the operation were analyzed by 2 independent reviewers. Laparoscopic procedures are recorded and assessed by 2 independent observers using the generic OSATS rating scale. A training module using the Lap Sim simulator was designed for the warm-up.</brief_summary>
