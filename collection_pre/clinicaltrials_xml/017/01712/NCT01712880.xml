	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the success rate of two treatments for infection after total hip replacement: single stage arthroplasty exchange (your surgeon will take out your original implants and replace them with a complete new set) compared to irrigation and debridement with modular exchange (your surgeon will clean your implants with a surgical solution and take out the plastic liner and replace it with a new one - the rest of your hip implants will stay in place). The goal is to see if one is better than the other for the treatment of hip infection after a total hip replacement. A successful treatment means that you did not have to have another surgery on your hip for an infection-related reason.</brief_summary>
