	<criteria>Male or female subject, 18 years or older who has a diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) as defined by the 1987revised American College of Rheumatology (ACR)classification criteria or the new American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) diagnostic criteria for RA 2010classification criteria and has a disease duration for a minimum of 3 months. Subjects must be naïve to biologic therapy. Subject must meet the following criteria for the joint assessment: • At least 6 swollen joints out of 66 assessed. • At least 6 tender joints out of 68 assessed. Prior Disease Modifying Antirheumatic Drug (DMARD) therapy: a) Subjects not on methotrexate at baseline must remain without methotrexate throughout the study. Subjects on prior Methotrexate (MTX) must have discontinued at least 28 days prior to Week 0 (Day 1). b) Subjects on Disease Modifying Antirheumatic Drug (DMARD) therapy other than Methotrexate (MTX) (except prednisone/prednisolone less than or equal to 10 mg) must discontinue it for at least 28 days before the first dose of investigational product at Week 0 (Day 1). Female subjects are either not of childbearing potential, defined as postmenopausal for at least 1 year or surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy and/or hysterectomy), or are practicing at least 1 of the following methods of birth control throughout the study and for at least 150 days after the last dose of study drug: • Condoms, sponge, foams, jellies, diaphragm or intrauterine device (IUD). • Hormonal contraceptives for 90 days prior to study drug administration. • Vasectomized partner(s). Subjects must be able and willing to selfadminister subcutaneous (SC) injections or have a qualified person available to administer subcutaneous (SC) injections. Subject is judged to be in good general health as determined by the Principal Investigator based upon the results of medical history, physical examination, laboratory profile, chest xray (CXR), and 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed during Screening. Subject has a negative Tuberculosis (TB) screening assessment (including a (Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) test or QuantiFERONTuberculosis (TB) Gold test or equivalent) and negative chest xray (PosteriorAnterior (PA) and lateral view) at Screening. If a subject has evidence of a latent Tuberculosis (TB) infection, the subject must initiate and complete a minimum of 2 weeks of antiTuberculosis (TB) therapy or have documented completion of a course of antiTuberculosis (TB) therapy prior to Baseline. Subjects must be willing to provide written consent and to comply with the requirements of this study protocol. Subject has been treated with intraarticular or parenteral administration of corticosteroids in the preceding 4 weeks from Baseline visit. Inhaled corticosteroids for stable medical conditions are allowed. Oral of less than or equal to 10 mg/d prednisone equivalent are allowed. Subject has been treated with any investigational drug of a chemical or biological nature within a minimum of 30 days or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) of the drug prior to Baseline Visit. Subject has a history of acute inflammatory joint disease of different origin other than Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) (e.g., seronegative spondyloarthropathy, psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, gouty arthritis, or any arthritis with onset prior to age 17 years). Known hypersensitivity to adalimumab or its excipients. Subject currently uses or plans to use antiretroviral therapy at any time during the study. History of demyelinating disease (including myelitis) or neurologic symptoms suggestive of demyelinating disease. History of invasive infection (e.g., listeriosis and histoplasmosis), human immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV). Chronic recurring infections or active Tuberculosis (TB). History of moderate to severe congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV), recent cerebrovascular accident and any other condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the subject at risk by participation in the protocol. Evidence of dysplasia or history of malignancy (including lymphoma and leukemia) other than a successfully treated nonmetastatic cutaneous squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma or localized carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Subject received any live vaccine within 3 months prior to study drug administration. Subject has a history of clinically significant hematologic (e.g., severe anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia), renal or liver disease (e.g., fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatitis). Positive pregnancy test at Screening or Baseline. Subject is considered by the investigator, for any reason, to be unsuitable candidate for the study</criteria>
