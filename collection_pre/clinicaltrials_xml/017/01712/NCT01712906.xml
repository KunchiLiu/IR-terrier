	<brief_summary>Mumps is an acute infectious respiratory disease caused by the mumps virus (MuV), which occurs mainly in children and adolescents. Its main clinical symptoms were parotid gland suppurative swelling and pain with fever. The pathological changes and harm caused by mumps was not only confined to the parotid gland, on the contrary, the social harm caused by serious complications cannot be ignored. As mumps is a vaccine-preventable infectious disease, vaccination is a fundamental strategy for controlling mumps. So far, there are 13 genotypes of MuV. Based on the analysis of molecular epidemiology, the main epidemic strain of MuV in China was the F genotype. The commonly used vaccine strains represented only a small number of known genotypes, e.g. Jeryl-Lynn (JL) and Rubini strains, which belong to type A, Urabe strain belongs to type B, and L-Zagreb strains belongs to type D. Virus seed of Live Attenuated Mumps Vaccine (Human diploid cell) developed by the institute was SP-A strain, which was the first separation and preparation of the attenuated mumps viruses in China. SP-A belongs to F genotype, which was the domestic epidemic genotype. In addition, the cell substrate prepared for vaccine was human diploid cell (KMB-17 strain), which is much safer to use. The preliminary test results showed that the vaccine possessed good immunogenicity and good antigenic cross-reactivity. The application of this vaccine will provide more effective means to prevent and control of mumps epidemic.</brief_summary>
