	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to demonstrate safety and immunogenicity of the quadrivalent influenza intradermal (QIV-ID) vaccine compared to the trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) containing the B strain from the primary (Yamagata) lineage (TIV-ID1) and the trivalent influenza vaccine containing B strain from the alternate (Victoria) lineage (TIV-ID2) vaccines in producing protection against four strains of influenza virus. Primary Objective: - To demonstrate that QIV-ID induces an immune response (as assessed by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) geometric mean titers (GMTs) and seroconversion rates) that is non-inferior to responses induced by TIV-ID1 and TIV-ID2 for the 4 virus strains at 28 days post-vaccination. Secondary Objectives: - To demonstrate that each B strain in QIV-ID induces an immune response (as assessed by HAI GMTs and seroconversion rates) that is superior to the response induced by the TIV-ID that does not contain the corresponding B strain. - To describe the rate of post-vaccination seroprotection induced by QIV-ID and TIV-ID. - To describe post-vaccination immunogenicity stratified by age (18-49 years and 50-64 years), race, ethnicity, gender, previous vaccination status, and baseline seropositivity status. - To describe the safety profile for subjects who receive QIV-ID and TIV-ID. Observational Objectives: - To demonstrate non-inferiority of QIV-ID compared to TIV-ID in terms of all Grade 2 or Grade 3 solicited systemic reactions combined - To demonstrate non-inferiority of QIV-ID compared to TIV-ID in terms of all Grade 3 solicited injection site reactions combined.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Intradermal Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine in Adults Aged 18 Through 64 Years</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All participants will receive a single dose of their assigned vaccine on Day 0. A subset of the participants will be assessed for immunologic response on Day 0 before vaccination and Day 28 after vaccination. All subjects will be monitored for safety for up to 6 months after vaccination.</detailed_description>
