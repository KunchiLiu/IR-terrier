	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if sotatercept can help to control MPN-associated myelofibrosis and anemia. The safety of this drug will also be studied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Sotatercept (ACE-011) in Subjects With Myeloproliferative Neoplasm (MPN)-Associated Myelofibrosis (MF) and Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups: If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will be assigned to 1 of 3 study groups, that will receive different doses of the study drug, based on when they join this study. Participants who are already on treatment with ruxolitinib will be assigned to Group 3. - Group 1 will receive sotatercept 1 time every 3 weeks (at a lower dose). - Group 2 will receive will receive sotatercept 1 time every 3 weeks (at a higher dose). - Group 3 will receive sotatercept 1 time every 3 weeks (at a lower dose). Study Drug Administration: Each cycle is 21 days. Participant will receive sotatercept at the clinic as an injection under the skin on Day 1 of every cycle. The injections will be given in the upper arm, abdomen, or thigh. Study Visits: On Day 1 of every cycle: - Participant will have a physical exam, including measurement of their weight and vital signs (blood pressure, breathing rate, temperature, and heart rate). - Participant's spleen and/or liver will be measured by feeling their abdomen. - Participant will be asked about any drugs they are taking and about recent blood transfusions they may have had. - Participant will also be asked about any new side effects or medical conditions they may have experienced. - Participant's performance status will be recorded. - Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests - Urine will be collected for kidney function tests. Weekly during Cycle 1-5 only: - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. - Participant will have vital signs measured on Day 1 of Week 3 (around Day 15 of Cycle 1). On Day 1 of Cycle 6, and then every 6-12 cycles after that if the disease responds to treatment, a bone marrow biopsy will be performed to check the status of the disease. On Day 1 of Cycles 1-5, 7, 9, and 11, then every 6 cycles after that: Â° Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for antibody testing and pharmacokinetic (PK) testing. Antibodies are created by the immune system and may attack foreign cells or substances, such as the study drug. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points. Length of Study: Participant may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in their best interest. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if they are unable to follow study directions. Patient's participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits. End-of-Treatment Visit: After participant's last dose of study drug, they will have an end-of-study visit and the following tests and procedures will be performed: - Participant will have a physical exam, including measurement of their weight and vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate, and temperature) and their spleen and/or liver will be measured by feeling their abdomen. - Participant's performance status will be recorded. - Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests. - Participant will be asked about any drugs they are taking and about recent blood transfusions they may have had. - Participant will also be asked about any new side effects or medical conditions they may have experienced. Follow-up Visit: About 1 month after participant's last dose of study drug, they will receive a telephone call from someone on the study team. Participant will be asked about any drugs they are taking, any recent blood transfusions they may have had, any new side effects or medical conditions they may have experienced. This phone call should last about 10 minutes. This is an investigational study. Sotatercept is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is currently being used for research purposes only. Up to 60 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
