	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Study of Pediatric Subjects With Tinea Cruris and Tinea Pedis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study population, diagnosis, and main criteria for inclusion: Tinea pedis and Tinea cruris (NAFT-500): Male or non-pregnant female subjects aged 12 to 17 years, 11 months old of any race with Tinea pedis and Tinea cruris infections confirmed by a positive potassium hydroxide (KOH) analysis from both the feet and bikini area. Both cases (feet and bikini area) must be characterized by clinical evidence of a Tinea pedis and Tinea cruris infection. Additional, approximately 4 pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluable adult subjects with the same condition will serve as a control. Tinea pedis (NAFT-600): Male or non-pregnant female subjects aged 12 to 17 years, 11 months old of any race with Tinea pedis infection confirmed by a positive potassium hydroxide (KOH) analysis from both feet. Both feet must be characterized by clinical evidence of a Tinea pedis infection.
