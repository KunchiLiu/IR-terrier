	<brief_summary>Tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) and its recovery during a vascular occlusion test (VOT) will be measured in elective cardiac surgery patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass using a non-invasive near infrared spectrometry (NIRS) machine. The purpose of this study is to determine whether changes in VOT measurements occur in patients during cardiac surgery.</brief_summary>
