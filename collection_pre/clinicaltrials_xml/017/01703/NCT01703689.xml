	<brief_summary>Introduction: Efficacy of audit and feedback interventions on nursing home (NH)quality indicators is not well-established. The main objective: The main purpose of the IQUARE study was to examine the impact of two types of audit and feedback interventions on NH quality indicators and on residents dependence levels in a 18-month follow-up. Study hypothesis: We hypothesised that audit and feedback associated to educational and professional supportive interventions are more efficacy in improving NH quality indicators than audit and feedback only. Secondary objectives: Investigate the impact of the interventions on 1. Residents: - Functional decline rate - Drug prescriptions (quantity and quality) - Prevalence of adverse health outcomes (e.g., falls) 2. NHs: - Planning and implementation of therapeutic measures</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>IQUARE is a multicentric individually-tailored controlled trial comparing two types of audit and feedback interventions: - audit and feedback associated to cooperative work meetings between hospital geriatricians and nursing home (NH) staff in a 6-month intervention (strong intervention) - audit and feedback only (light intervention) Power statistics and sample size calculations indicated that each group should be composed of at least 2 500 individuals. The strong intervention will last 6 months and is composed of two face-to-face cooperative meetings (hospital geriatricians and NH staff). Data will be collected at baseline and in a 18-month follow-up.</detailed_description>
