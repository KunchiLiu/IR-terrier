Has a historical diagnosis of NASH, established no more than 12 months prior to study entry based on histology (liver biopsy). 4. Has a NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) of ≥3, with a score of at least 1 in steatosis and lobular inflammation the subcomponents of NAS. It is acceptable if the score for hepatocyte ballooning is "zero". 5. The subject has a MRI determined liver fat fraction of equal or higher than 7 percent. 6. The subject is female or male and aged 18 to 80 years, inclusive. 7. A male who is nonsterilized and sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential agrees to use adequate contraception from signing of informed consent throughout the duration of the study and for 30 weeks after last dose. 8. A female of childbearing potential who is sexually active with a nonsterilized male partner agrees to use routinely adequate contraception from signing of informed consent throughout the duration of the study and for 30 days after last dose. 9. If taking Vitamin E and/or pentoxifylline, the subject has been receiving a stable dose for 6 months prior to randomization, started Vitamin E and/or pentoxifylline therapy prior to the qualifying liver biopsy, and agrees to maintain a stable dose throughout the study when possible. 10. Subject has an ALT level at Screening between 55 and 250 IU/L, inclusive, and between 60 and 250 IU/L at one other occasion during the 6 months prior to Randomization. 11.

If diabetic, the subject is on a stable dose of metformin, dipeptidyl peptidase4 inhibitor, sulfonylurea or insulin or a combination thereof for at least 3 months prior to Screening. 1. The subject has a history of chronic liver disease other than NASH eg, chronic or acute hepatitis, Wilson's disease, alcoholic liver diseases or any other nonNASH active liver disease. 2. Subjects with liver cirrhosis (of any cause) or laboratory or clinical signs of functional liver failure 3.

The subject had a diastolic blood pressure greater than 100 mm Hg or a systolic blood pressure of greater than 160 mm Hg (The mean of the 3 serial BP measurements will be used to determine subject eligibility). 18. The subject has presence or history of psychotic disorder that may be associated with suicidal thinking, ideation or behavior. These disorders include, but are not limited to, depression, psychosis, psychotic disorder, and schizophrenia. Subjects will be monitored by ColumbiaSuicide Severity Rating Scales throughout the duration of the study. 19. The subject has a history of drug abuse (defined as illicit drug use) or a history of alcohol abuse (defined as regular or daily consumption of more than 2 alcoholic drinks per day for women or 3 alcoholic drinks per day for men. One drink is equivalent to a 12ounce beer, a 4ounce glass of wine, or a 1ounce shot of hard liquor.) within 1 year prior to the Screening visit. 20. The subject has a hemoglobin &lt;120 g/L for men and &lt;100 g/L for women. 21. The subject has received pioglitazone or roflumilast in a previous clinical study or as a therapeutic agent within 1 year prior to screening. 22. If female, the subject is pregnant or lactating or intending to become pregnant before, during, or within 1 month after participating in this study; or intending to donate ova during such time period. 23.
