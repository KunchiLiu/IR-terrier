	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if a type of MRI scan called diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) is accurate in checking the status of tumors. Researchers also want to learn if DWI can predict how tumors will respond to radiation therapy.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If you agree to take part in this study, information will be collected from your medical record including your age, sex, and status of the disease. For the MRI scans, you will receive a routine contrast drug by vein. Contrast drugs are used by doctors in order to see MRI images more clearly. A modified MRI scan will performed right after your scheduled standard-of-care MRI scan. This modified MRI scan is the investigational scan. To complete the modified MRI scan, you will need to stay in the MRI scanner for about 8 extra minutes. It should take about 47 minutes total to complete both scans. The way that researchers program the MRI machine and the order in which the images are taken is what is being modified for the investigational scan. These changes may help researchers capture better images. Length of Study: Your participation on this study will be over after the modified MRI scan is complete. This is an investigational study. The standard-of-care MRI scan method is FDA approved and commercially available for the diagnosis of several diseases. The modified MRI scan method is being used in research only. Up to 25 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>
