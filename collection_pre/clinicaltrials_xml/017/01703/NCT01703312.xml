	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the efficacy of QGE031 compared to omalizumab in patients with allergic asthma. Each treatment's effect in changing the concentration of inhaled allergen that is required to elicit a 15% fall in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) at 12 weeks compared to baseline will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
