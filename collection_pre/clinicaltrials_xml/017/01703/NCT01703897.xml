	<brief_title>Esophageal Manometry and Impedance Study in Obese Patients Before and During Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity is an increasing heath problem in western countries and is associated with increased risks during anesthesia. Using high-resolution solid-state manometry the investigators aim to study esophageal pressures and measure the incidence of regurgitation of gastric contents during anesthesia induction in obese patients. The investigators aim to include 16 obese patients, with BMI &gt; 35, undergoing laparoscopic gastric by-pass.</detailed_description>
