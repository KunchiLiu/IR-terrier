	<brief_summary>Specific aim: To test the effects of nasal expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) therapy on sleep apnea severity among patients with recent ischemic stroke. Hypothesis 1: Ischemic stroke patients with sleep apnea will have less severe sleep apnea, as measured by the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), with nasal EPAP therapy compared with a control night. Hypothesis 2: Ischemic stroke patients will have higher mean levels of oxygen saturation with nasal EPAP therapy compared with a control night.</brief_summary>
