	<brief_title>A Safety Study of NNZ-2566 in Patients With Rett Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rett Syndrome is a developmental disorder primarily if not exclusively affecting females. The disorder is characterized by apparent normal development in early infancy (6-18 months), followed by a period of regression with onset of systemic and neurological signs. The CNS symptoms of Rett Syndrome include learning disability, autism and epilepsy and these can be severe and highly debilitating. Affected individuals also show signs of autonomic dysfunction, reflected in cardiovascular and respiratory abnormalities. There is no currently effective treatment for Rett Syndrome. This study will investigate the safety and tolerability of treatment with oral administration of NNZ-2566 at 35 mg/kg or 70 mg/kg BID in adolescent or adult females with Rett Syndrome. The study also will also investigate measures of efficacy during treatment.</detailed_description>
