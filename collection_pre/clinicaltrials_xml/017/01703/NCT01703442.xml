	<brief_summary>A single-center prospective observational study. This study examines urine flow and haemodynamic parameters during abdominal surgery and analyses the association to postoperative renal function and markers and to postoperative clinical outcome. Primary hypothesis: • Within a goal-directed haemodynamic protocol during gynecologic cancer surgery there are phases of temporary anuria. Secondary hypothesis: - Perioperative anuric phases are directly associated to the postoperative increase of NGAL (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin) and creatinine - Perioperative renal dysfunction is directly associated to postoperative complications and functional recovery of patients - A response of urine flow to a standardized postoperative diuretic bolus can identify patients who benefit from a pharmaceutical fluid mobilization - Within a goal-directed haemodynamic protocol during gynaecologic cancer surgery, the methods for the measurement of stroke volume of the heart differ</brief_summary>
