	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is 1. to determine whether the perfusion parameters in the normal pancreas and the pancreas cancer (adenocarcinoma or neuroendocrine tumor) are different on perfusion CT 2. to determine whether initial perfusion parameters as well as perfusion parameter change in pancreas adenocarcinoma before and after chemotherapy are different between chemotherapy response group (CR, PR according to RECIST 1.1) and non response group (SD, PD according to RECIST 1.1).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1. Performance of preoperative perfusion CT for preoperative staging is assessed by comparing with operative finding and histologic disease staging 2. Estimation of initial or change of pancreas cancer perfusion parameters and whether those can provide cut-off value for predicting response of chemotherapy in patients with pancreas adenocarcinoma</detailed_description>

	<criteria>patients who are older than eighteen years patients in whom operation and preoperative computed tomography are scheduled for resectable pancreas adenocarcinoma or pancreas neuroendocrine tumor patients in whom chemotherapy is scheduled for histologically confirmed pancreas adenocarcinoma patients in whom chemotherapy is planned for highly suspicious pancreas adenocarcinoma on imaging workup patients who agree with the study and whose informed consent is obtained. patients who are younger than eighteen years old patients in whom previously radiation therapy was performed and the RTx field includes pancreas patients with recurred pancreas adenocarcinoma patient who are pregnant or nursing patients patients with renal failure (GFR&lt;30mL/min) patients with history of malignancy, except malignancy is in complete remission after operation or iodine therapy for at least five years) patients with hypersensitivity for iodine or contrast media or other causes of contraindication of contrastmedia enhanced CT scan Any other condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would make the patient unsuitable for enrollment or could interfere with the completion of the study.</criteria>
