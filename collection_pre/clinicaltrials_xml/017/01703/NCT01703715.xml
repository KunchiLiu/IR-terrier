	<brief_summary>Dehydration is recognised as a major issue in healthcare. Recovery after illness, extended length of stay, pressure sores and slow tissue recovery can all be impacted by dehydration. One of the biggest problems for many people with regard to getting a drink is easy, independent access - if they can't reach the jug/cup without a struggle then they often will go thirsty and potentially become dehydrated. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of dehydration on outcome in patients 65 years and over. Furthermore we aim to assess the impact of providing easy, 24 hour, independently accessible fluids on reducing dehydration as well as improving patient experience. We hypothesise that patients who are dehydration will take longer to recover from illness and stay in hospital for longer periods.</brief_summary>
