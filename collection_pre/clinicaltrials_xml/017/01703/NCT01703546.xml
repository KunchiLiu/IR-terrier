	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to evaluate whether combining laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (AKA: lap-band surgery, LAGB) and laparoscopic gastric plication (making tucks in the large curve of the stomach with stitches) to lap-band surgery alone will result in a greater loss of excess weight over time. We anticipate that the average percent of excess body weight loss for study subjects will exceed 29% at 12 months.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Banding when combined with gastric plication will provide lasting weight loss benefits to patients. We are projecting that the percent of Excess Body Weight Loss (% EWL) will be greater in study subjects when compared with our control group with LAGB alone. Furthermore, it is anticipated that the % EWL in study subjects will be similar to patients who have laparoscopic Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass.</detailed_description>
