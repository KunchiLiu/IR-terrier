	<detailed_description>This is a cluster-randomised study in which the health facility is the unit of randomisation. 16 health facilities will be randomised to intervention and control. At the community level women will be encouraged to access ANC early in the pregnancy, attend follow-up antenatal visits throughout the pregnancy and deliver at the facility. The current recommended standard of care will be provided to all women attending antenatal and obstetric care. In the intervention area, obstetric, medical, drug-exposure histories will be collected at ANC visits. In addition, in the last trimester of the pregnancy (&gt; 28 weeks of pregnancy), women will be systematically evaluated with selected diagnostic test for whether they have malaria parasites and treated effectively. Skilled birth attendants at the facility will be trained in emergency obstetric and neonatal care and the assessment of neonates for danger signs, low birth weight and external/observable birth defects. In the control area, women will be provided with standard practice of care. In both areas, women will be diagnosed and treated at delivery if they are positive.</detailed_description>
