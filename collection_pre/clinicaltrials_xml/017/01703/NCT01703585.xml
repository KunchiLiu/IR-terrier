	<brief_summary>This is a feasibility study to look for genetic alterations in tissue and blood samples that may be useful in determining what treatments may be useful in the patient's cancer care.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Study of Genomic Profiling Methods and Timing in Tumor Samples</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As part of the study, patients will have archival tumor tissue collected, and have tumor biopsies and blood samples taken. The samples will be tested for genetic alterations, and the results will be discussed with the patient including potential treatments. If patients agree, after they have received treatment for their cancer and their disease progresses, a second biopsy procedure will be done.</detailed_description>
