	<brief_summary>Contrast enhanced EUS with the sonographic contrast agent DEFINITY™ has the potential to detect pancreatic cancer at an earlier stage, to improve current method of T staging and assessment of surgical resectability and also to distinguish between benign and malignant pancreatic masses. All these will translate into better clinical outcome, and also avoid unnecessary surgery in situations of unresectable cancers.</brief_summary>
