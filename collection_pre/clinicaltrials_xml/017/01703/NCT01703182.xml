	<brief_summary>TCOM is a multicentre prospective cohort study in patients undergoing lower limb amputations. Patients will provide oxygen and carbon dioxide measurements in the lower limb for 20 to 30 minutes before their surgery and will be followed up until 6 months after their surgery. The purpose of the TCOM study is to determine the ability of oxygen and carbon dioxide measurements in the legs of patients undergoing lower limb amputation to predict wound healing complications and to determine an optimum cutoff value for both oxygen and carbon dioxide levels beyond which healing complications are likely to occur and a closer amputation level is indicated.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lower limb amputation is a serious and unfortunate outcome for many patients with vascular disease, especially those with diabetes. It results in significant decreases in all aspects of quality of life. The need for further surgery to revise the amputation to a more proximal level leads to increased potential for serious and life-threatening complications, as well as a decrease in patient morale. From surveys and background literature, it can be estimated that there are approximately 8600 vascular disease-related lower limb amputations in Canada each year. As the epidemic of diabetes continues to unfold and the mean age of the population increases, this number is expected to increase. The results of this study may significantly assist in the surgical and clinical care of this patient population by providing clinicians with a means to assess appropriate lower limb amputation levels. Further, the modalities of transcutaneous measures may assist in guiding further intervention studies in higher risk patients to improve clinically important outcomes. This study will act in part as a feasibility trial for a randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy of supplemental oxygen therapy, including hyperbaric oxygen therapy, as a therapeutic tool to increase rates of healing after lower limb amputation.</detailed_description>
