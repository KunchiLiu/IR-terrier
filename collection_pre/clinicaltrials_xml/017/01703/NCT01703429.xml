	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, observational study designed to describe disease progression, symptom change, quality of life, diet and lifestyle habits, and frequency of adverse events among patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). In addition to describing the patterns of CAM use, this study will also identify and describe the positive deviants, those individuals with the highest quality of life and least amount of disease activity. Positive deviants will be compared to controls in order to describe medication, diet, and lifestyle patterns associated with a lack of MS disease progression and high quality of life.</brief_summary>
