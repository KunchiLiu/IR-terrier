	<brief_summary>Psoriatic nails can significantly affect a quality of life of patients. Psoriasis affects both nail matrix and nail bed. Pitting, leukonychia and red spots in lunula indicate a defect in the nail matrix. Psoriasis can change the nail bed as the results in onycholysis, discoloration, splinter hemorrhage and subungual hyperkeratosis. The main treatment of psoriatic nails is using topical high- potent steroids however topical steroids are limited their ability to penetrate deep nail matrix or nail bed which are the main pathology. Use of such a treatment can lead to skin atrophy and report in the case of "Disappearing digits". Previous studies of steroid injection in the treatment of psoriatic nails show satisfactory results without any serious permanent adverse effects. At present, there is no comparison study between intralesional steroid and ultrapotent topical steroid for the treatment of psoriatic nails. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intralesional triamcinolone comparing to 0.05% clobetasol ointment in the treatment of psoriatic nails.</brief_summary>
