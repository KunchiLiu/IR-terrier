	<brief_title>Peritoneal Nebulization of Ropivacaine for Pain Control After Laparoscopic Colectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently intraperitoneal nebulization of local anesthetic has been used as an alternative to direct intraperitoneal instillation. Intraperitoneal aerosolization of Bupivacaine 50 mg after laparoscopic cholecystectomy significantly reduced postoperative pain, morphine consumption and incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting and it is associated with rapid mobilization compared with patients receiving direct instillation of Bupivacaine 50 mg or placebo. In a recent study the investigators found that nebulization of Ropivacaine 30 mg with the AeronebProÂ® before or after laparoscopic cholecystectomy and gynecologic laparoscopic surgery reduces postoperative pain and morphine consumption. Patients receiving preoperative nebulization of Ropivacaine presented significantly less postoperative pain (-50% clinical setting) and consumed significant less morphine (-50% and -40% respectively) than patients in control groups during the first 48 hours after surgery. The effects of peritoneal nebulization of ropivacaine during laparoscopic colectomy on pain control and morphine consumption were not evaluated. The investigators hypothesize that intraperitoneal nebulization of Ropivacaine may produce better pain control and less morphine consumption than nebulization of saline after laparoscopic colectomy.</detailed_description>
