Have failed pregabalin treatment due to lack of improvement of symptoms at doses of greater than or equal to 300 mg daily, cannot tolerate pregabalin or any pregabalin ingredient, or participated in a pregabalin clinical trial. If the subject has taken pregabalin and discontinued for reason other than lack of improvement or intolerance, then they will be eligible. Pregabalin use within the last 30 days (prior to V1) is not permitted. Patients with severe or unstable depression are not eligible. Patients with other types of pain or conditions that may make it difficult to evaluate fibromyalgia symptoms are not eligible Any subject considered at risk of suicide or self harm based on investigator judgment and/or the details of a risk assessment</criteria>
