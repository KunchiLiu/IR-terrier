	<brief_summary>Safety in seconds is a randomized controlled trial of a computer tailored Injury Prevention program which was conducted in the waiting area of a level 1 pediatric trauma center. A computer kiosk was used to randomly assign participants to study groups, collect baseline data and generate tailored reports based on responses to assessment items. An intervention group received a personalized and stage-tailored safety report and a control group received a personalized, but otherwise generic report on other child health topics. Telephone follow-up interviews were conducted 2-4 weeks and again 4-6 months after enrollment. Home visits were completed for a subset (n=100) of parents who completed the 4-6 month follow-up interview. The study aimed to increase knowledge, self reported and observed safety behaviors.</brief_summary>
