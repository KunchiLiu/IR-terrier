	<brief_summary>This study will measure resting state network central nervous system activity by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during 4 separate interactions with a clinician. 1. Hypothesis 1. Because they are different sensory systems, there will be different patterns of Mirror Neuron System (MNS)and Resting State Network (RSN) Central Nervous System (CNS) activity for visual vs. tactile stimulation, regardless of Loving Kindness Meditation (LKM). Hypothesis 2. Because of unconscious, non-verbal signals, such as the practitioner's facial expression and respiratory rate, subjects' patterns of MNS and RSN CNS activity will differ for LKM+ vs. LKM- stimulation for both visual and tactile interventions. Hypothesis 3. Because there is greater opportunity to detect signals from two sensory systems than one, the differences between CNS MNS and RSN activity patterns for LKM+ and LKM- will be greater for combined visual + tactile than for either visual or tactile stimulation alone.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project builds on our previous research to build a platform for a successful NIH proposal to address a key gap in our understanding of the mechanism of non-verbal clinician-patient communication on physiology and behavior. Social neuroscience is a rapidly growing area of research that offers unique opportunities to better understand the mechanisms underlying common observations about clinician-patient interactions.The purpose of this study is to better understand the CNS mechanisms underlying the observed changes in self-reported well-being and ANS activity by evaluating resting fMRI activity under controlled conditions. The specific aims are to compare resting fMRI activity in the mirror neuron system (MNS) and resting state networks (RSN), reflected specifically in the Insula, Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC), Precuneus, Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC), Amygdala, Bilateral Inferior Parietal Cortex, Primary Motor-Visual System, and Dorsal Medulla while viewing touch with lovingkindness meditation lovingkindness meditation vs no lovingkindness meditation, receiving touch with lovingkindness meditation vs no lovingkindness meditation and both viewing and receiving touch with lovingkindness meditation vs no lovingkindness meditation. This is a descriptive study to generate sample size estimates for an NIH RO1 proposal.</detailed_description>
