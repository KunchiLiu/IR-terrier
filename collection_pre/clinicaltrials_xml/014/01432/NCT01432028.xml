	<brief_summary>This is cross-over, randomized clinical trial, with objective to evaluate the effects of low-dose oral hormone therapy and non-oral hormone therapy on endothelial function markers (fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, c-reactive protein), natriuretic peptide and on anthropometric, metabolic and hormonal variables in early and healthy postmenopausal women and analyzing polymorphisms in the estrogen receptor gene and FTO polymorphisms Patients will be randomized to receive oral hormone treatment or non-oral hormone treatment The investigators hypothesis is that a different genotypes in the receptor estrogen gene and FTO may have an influences on treatment response in metabolic markers and cardiovascular risk</brief_summary>
