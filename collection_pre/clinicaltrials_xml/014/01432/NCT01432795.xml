	<brief_summary>Medical compression stockings are highly effective in the prevention, treatment, and secondary prevention of chronic venous insufficiency and of post-thrombotic syndrome. Non-adherence to the prescribed compression treatment concerns approximately 40% of patients. Elderly patients are often unable to handle stockings in order to put them on properly in the morning and to undress in the evening. Gliding aids and stocking "butlers" are two types of tools to facilitate the dressing manoeuvre with medical stockings. The present study evaluates four different gliding aids and two different stocking "butlers" to put on three different types of compression stockings. The study is conducted with forty consenting subjects with advanced chronic venous insufficiency.</brief_summary>
