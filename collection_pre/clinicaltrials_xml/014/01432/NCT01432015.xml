	<brief_summary>Nausea and vomiting are two of the more concerning adverse outcomes associated with chemotherapy in the treatment of gynecologic malignancies. In fact, nearly 90% of cancer patients develop chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) following treatment with carboplatin and paclitaxel. The successful control of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is thus, of paramount importance in ensuring optimal treatment and sustaining a cancer patient's quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fosaprepitant Versus Aprepitant in the Prevention of Chemotherapy Induced Nausea and Vomiting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies have indicated that oral and intravenous anti-emetics are equivalent with regard to efficacy; when evaluating cost and convenience, the intravenous route may be preferable. Fosaprepitant, a water-soluble phosphoryl prodrug for aprepitant, is converted to aprepitant via phosphatases following intravenous administration. Given the rapid conversion of fosaprepitant to the active form (i.e., aprepitant), the two medications appear to provide a similarly effective antiemetic impact. Clinical reports have additionally suggested that fosaprepitant could be appropriate as an intravenous alternative to the oral aprepitant.</detailed_description>
