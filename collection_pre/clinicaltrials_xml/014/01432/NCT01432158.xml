	<brief_summary>This is an open-label phase III clinical trial. The purpose of this trial is to investigate in detail the kinetics of the immune response to Prevenar-13, a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, compared to Pneumovax-II, a pneumococcal plain polysaccharide vaccine. With their consent, healthy adults (n=2 in each group) aged over 18 years who have not received any pneumococcal vaccine in the past will receive either vaccine at their first visit. Blood will be taken before vaccination and at day 0,1,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,23,26,30,35 as well as 2,6 and 12 months following vaccination. With specific consent, a small volume of blood will be used to store DNA and RNA for analysis of the genetic associations with immune responses and adverse reactions to vaccines as well as the RNA expression following a vaccination. Serum or plasma will be used to assess antibody level and available whole blood will be used for B cell assays and to examine immunoglobulin gene usage in B cells.</brief_summary>
