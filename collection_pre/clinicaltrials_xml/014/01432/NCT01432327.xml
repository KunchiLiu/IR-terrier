	<brief_title>The Impact of Real-time Feedback on Physical Activity Patterns in Flemish Employees</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this intervention study is to determine the effectiveness of continuous self-monitoring and real-time feedback from the SenseWear Armband (BodyMedia) alone and in combination with Personal Coaching to enhance physical activity and influence consciousness about its own physical activity patterns over a 12-month period in sedentary Flemish employees. The investigators hypothesize that the use of the feedback will increase awareness and subsequent physical activity levels of inactive office workers. Another hypothesizes is that the weekly meeting with a Personal Coach will add a controlling element and therefore employees of the 'coaching group' will have a higher physical activity level at the end of the intervention period compared to the other groups.</detailed_description>
