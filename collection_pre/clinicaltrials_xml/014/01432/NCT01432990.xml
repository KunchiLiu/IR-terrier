	<brief_summary>Until now, there's still no any strong evidence supported "which is the best way to restoration walking ability" in spinal cord injury. Most of the evidence suggest that, there is somehow better after gait rehabilitation for ASIA classification C and D but not improved walking ability for ASIA classification A and B. There is an RCT showed the evidence of repetitive locomotor training and physiotherapy could be improved walking and basic activities of daily living after stroke, these might be also really effect in SCI patients.</brief_summary>
