	<brief_summary>Warfarin is a commonly used drug to prevent the blood from clotting. The purpose of this study is to determine if dulaglutide (LY2189265) affects how warfarin works. The study involves two different treatments (Treatment 1: warfarin; Treatment 2: dulaglutide + warfarin) separated by a minimum washout period of 24 days. In Treatment 1, the participant will receive 10 milligrams (mg) of warfarin on Day 1. In Treatment 2, the participant will receive a 1.5-mg dose of dulaglutide (LY2189265) as an injection on Day 1 and then a 10 mg dose of warfarin on Day 3. Participants will be randomly assigned into different treatment sequences. Participants in Treatment Sequence A will receive Treatment 1 then Treatment 2. Participants in Treatment Sequence B will receive Treatment 2 then Treatment 1.</brief_summary>
