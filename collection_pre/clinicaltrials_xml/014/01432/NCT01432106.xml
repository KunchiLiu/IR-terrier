	<brief_summary>Study purpose: African Americans with hypertension and markers of metabolic syndrome (small elevations in blood glucose, triglycerides and or weight) are at a high risk of cardiovascular (heart and blood vessel) problems. There is a circulating factor called angiotensin II that increases risk and may be more important in African Americans who have up to 20 times greater risk of losing kidney function and requiring dialysis. Research Investigators, including those at the University of Michigan, found one drug (Ramipril) that blocks angiotensin II effects significantly and improves kidney function in African Americans. The purpose of The SAAVE Study is to determine whether the combination of two new blockers (Valsartan and Aliskiren) of angiotensin II, are better able to lower blood pressure, also improve some of the risk factors for cardiovascular problems and provide greater protection to the heart and kidneys.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Study of Novel Dual Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System (RAAS) Blockade; Valsartan/Aliskiren in African American Patients With Hypertension and the Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific hypothesis of this proposal is that the combination of Valsartan/Aliskiren will provide incremental reduction in blood pressure when compared to traditional blockade of Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System (RAAS) with ramipril. As an exploratory analysis, we propose that the blood pressure effect will be associated with suppressing plasma aldosterone levels, preserving the availability of nitric oxide, and preventing the development of insulin resistance. Other variables of interest include changes from baseline in adiponectin, Procollagen 1 and 3, osteopontin, cystatin C, and serum K+. In a nested cohort we will determine the impact of novel dual RAAS blockade on left ventricular remodeling. Should our hypotheses be proven correct and novel dual RAAS blockade is more effective than ramipril in reducing blood pressure, plasma aldosterone, preserving the availability of nitric oxide, as reflected by an increase in asymmetric dimethly arginine (ADMA) levels, and improves cardiovascular remodeling, this would have important implications for the long term prevention of target organ damage and cardiovascular events in this high risk ethnic group.</detailed_description>
