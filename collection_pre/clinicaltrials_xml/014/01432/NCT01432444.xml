	<brief_title>Open-label Study to Compare Hospitalization Rates of Schizophrenic Patients Treated With Oral Antipsychotics Versus IM Depot Aripiprazole</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nonadherence to antipsychotic medications remains a frequent cause of relapse among patients with schizophrenia, increasing hospitalization rates, hospitalization days, and hospitalization costs. Among hospitalized adults, schizophrenia is the fourth most commonly diagnosed illness and has the seventh longest mean duration of hospital stay in the US. Frequent relapses and hospitalization can affect quality of life in these patients. Long-acting injections (intramuscular depot) antipsychotic medication is a means to treatment adherence and increased quality of life for patients with schizophrenia.</detailed_description>
