	<brief_title>Occupational Therapy for Cancer Patients: a Randomised, Controlled Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Cancer patients often experience serious dysfunctions leading to problems with activities of daily living (ADL) and reduced quality of life. Occupational therapy is believed to be effective in handling many of the problems with ADL experienced by patients with cancer, but the evidence is sparse. Aim The purpose of this study is to analyse the effects of an occupational therapy intervention targeting cancer patients. Outcome measures are the patients self-reported quality of life and the patients ability to perform ADL. Methods Randomised controlled trial with 288 patients with cancer treated at Naestved hospital in Denmark. Occupational therapy intervention programme for the intervention group (N=144) and standard treatment and care for the controls (N=144). A systematic review including studies of ADL intervention for cancer patients will be carried out. Feasibility of the recruitment and the intervention will be analysed and published. The patients need for occupational therapy will be analysed using baseline information from the randomised controlled trial. The effects of the intervention will be analysed using patient validated questionnaires including EORTC QLQ-C30 and the ADL taxonomy questionnaire.</detailed_description>
