	<brief_summary>Vitamin A is necessary in the human diet. The form of vitamin A found in fruits and vegetables is not "active" and must be converted to the active form in the human body. However, information on the ability of humans to absorb and convert vitamin A to the active form is still lacking. In this study, the investigators will observe the absorption and conversion of vitamin A from orange tomato sauce and/or carrots after a meal with fat (from avocado fruit) and a meal without fat. The investigators will also test whether eating these foods might protect the blood against damage that could lead to heart disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Provitamin A Absorption and Conversion With Avocados</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study will be to demonstrate that adding avocados to a carotene rich meal will promote the absorption of provitamin A carotenoids and enhance the delivery of greater quantities of vitamin A. This objective will be accomplished by quantitation of the immediate post-prandial plasma concentrations of parent carotenoids and vitamin A metabolites after subjects consume a meal with or without avocado in combination with a serving of tomato sauce (containing nutritionally relevant amounts of beta-carotene) or carrots. The secondary objective of this study will be to determine if higher levels of carotenoids and other antioxidants transported in the bloodstream will have a protective role in promoting cardiovascular health. This objective will be accomplished by testing the oxidation capacity of lipoprotein fractions before and after meal supplementation.</detailed_description>
