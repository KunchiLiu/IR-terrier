	<brief_title>Feasibility Trial to Maintain Normal Cerebral Oxygen Saturation in High-Risk Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proportion of high-risk patients requiring cardiac surgery and of high-risk cardiac surgeries is increasing. These populations of patients are at increased risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) evaluation in cardiac surgery has been shown to impact on the perioperative management of patients and to improve outcomes. Near infrared-reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) is a technique that has been employed since the mid-1970's and that can be used as a non-invasive and continuous monitor of the balance between cerebral oxygen delivery and consumption. Two recent randomized trials have shown an association between correction of cerebral desaturation and shorter recovery room and hospital stay in non-cardiac surgery, and with a decrease in major organ dysfunction and in intensive care length of stay after coronary artery bypass. By combining NIRS and TEE in high-risk patients, optimal tissue perfusion could be achieved and perioperative morbidity and mortality could be reduced.</detailed_description>
