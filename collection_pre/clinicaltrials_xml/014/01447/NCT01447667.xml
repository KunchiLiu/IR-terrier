	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine: - The efficacy of MRE score as a predictor of HCC recurrence within 2 years after RFA treatment - The efficacy of each indicator (MRE score, non-invasive serum markers) compared to the gold-standard histology score predicting hepatic fibrosis</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) as a Predictor of HCC Recurrence After Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate whether MRE score reflecting hepatic fibrosis can predict the recurrence of HCC within 2 years after RFA treatment - Local recurrence/intrahepatic distant recurrence - Multivariable analysis including several related factors to find whether MRE score is an independent predictor of HCC recurrence even after adjusting other factors (etiology of liver disease, size of HCC, vessel invasion, HBsAg titer, etc.) To find the efficacy of each indicator (MRE score, non-invasive serum markers) compared to the gold-standard histology score predicting hepatic fibrosis.</detailed_description>
