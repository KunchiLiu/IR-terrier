	<brief_summary>This is a two-part, Phase 1 open label, multi-center, dose escalation study of CEP-37250/KHK2804 as monotherapy in subjects with advanced solid tumors who no longer respond to standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy is available.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1 Study of CEP-37250/KHK2804 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be conducted in two parts. In Part 1, a standard 3+3 designed dose escalation phase, subjects will receive CEP-37250/KHK2804, administered iv, once every week. A treatment cycle will consists of total of four doses per cycle. Part 2 of the study will enroll subjects with either colon cancer or pancreatic cancer to receive CEP-37250/KHK2804 at a dose to be determined following completion of Part 1. All subjects will receive study therapy until disease progression, the development of unacceptable toxicity, noncompliance or withdrawal of consent by the subject, or Investigator decision, up to a maximum of six cycles (approximately six months). After six cycles of CEP-37250/KHK2804 therapy, the subject may continue to receive CEP-37250/KHK2804 after discussion with the Sponsor and determination that the subject is experiencing a best response of at least stable disease (SD) and is not experiencing any unacceptable toxicities or dose limiting toxicities (DLTs).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adequate hepatic, renal, and hematologic function; Life expectancy &gt; 3 months; Part 1 and 2: The subject has histopathologically or cytologically documented, measurable, unresectable, locally advanced primary or recurrent, metastatic solid tumor, locally advanced primary or recurrent, metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma and must have received at least one prior treatment regimen containing gemcitabine or 5FU, and locally advanced primary or recurrent, metastatic colon adenocarcinoma. Parts 1 and 2: 1. Malignant melanoma, Merkel cell cancer, small cell lung cancer, lymphoepithelial carcinoma, malignant mesothelioma, GIST, Hodgkin and NHL, thymoma, neuroendocrine, neuronal tumors, and sarcomas. This list of excluded tumors may be modified as additional research findings become available on target antigen expression; 2. The subject has received anticancer chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, or investigational agents within 4 weeks (6 weeks for mitomycin C and nitrosoureas) prior to the first dose of CEP37250/KHK2804; 3. The subject has received monoclonal antibodies of any type or for any form of disease within 4 weeks of the first dose of CEP37250/KHK2804; 4. Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to the first dose; 5. Known symptomatic brain metastases (screening magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is only required when there is clinical suspicion of central nervous system [CNS] involvement or past history of treated brain metastasis). Subjects with treated brain metastasis (radiotherapy and/or surgery) will be eligible if they: Have completed treatment for their brain metastasis &gt; 4 weeks prior to scheduled study treatment start date; Are neurologically stable; Are on corticosteroids in doses no greater than physiological replacement (e.g., dexamethasone &lt; 1.5 mg/day); and Have a screening MRI scan of the brain that specifically verifies no evidence of CNS hemorrhage and no active gadolinium enhancing lesions; Subjects with primary brain/CNS malignancy (e.g., gliomas, lymphomas) are excluded. Hypersensitivity reaction to monoclonal antibodies, other therapeutic proteins, or allergy to any component of the CEP37250/KHK2804 finished drug and the reaction could not be controlled or prevented on subsequent infusion with standard therapies such as antihistamines, 5HT3 antagonists, or corticosteroids.</criteria>
