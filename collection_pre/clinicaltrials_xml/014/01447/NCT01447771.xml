	<brief_summary>Breast cancer is a common malignancy among women in the United States. There are a variety of treatment decisions that need to be made. This study has been developed after a review of the literature demonstrated that women with breast cancer are making decisions regarding complex therapy issues in a way that is not congruent with their decision-making control preference. Some patients want to be empowered with information so that they can actively participate in the decision making about their care; others want to rely on the recommendations made by the oncologist. This is important because patients who were not satisfied with their adjuvant treatment decision noted a negative effect on quality of life and self image. These patients had more difficulties with treatment side effects; including aches, hot flashes, pain, and mood alteration. In additions the Institute of Medicine recommended that patient centeredness be a key aim of health care organizations and that all patients be given the opportunity to exercise the degree of control they choose over health care decisions that affect them. It is hypothesized that women making decisions regarding adjuvant therapy who are supported to make decisions based on their preferred level of control will have positive psychological outcomes.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Decision Support for Women With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This evidence based study has been developed after a review of the literature demonstrated that 14 - 58% of women with breast cancer are making decisions regarding complex therapy issues in a way that is not congruent with their decision-making control preference. Because of the prevalence of decision-making control preference incongruence and strong evidence that providing support for a woman's decision making control preference is related to quality of life measures, this study will test the implementation of a nursing intervention to support the decision making of women with breast cancer. Using sample randomization with assignment to one of two groups, this study will explore whether using Degner's Control Preference (DCP) Scale supports decision making control preferences in women who are making decisions about breast cancer treatment. Results of the study will guide implementation of sustainable evidence-based behavioral practices that can have significant effects on quality of care outcomes. This study will assess satisfaction with decision involvement, depression, and decision making distress in women with early stage breast cancer after a decision support intervention to support a woman's preferred decision control preference. It is hypothesized that a decision support intervention that consists of providing information from the Degner Control Preference (DCP) Scale to the provider and patient will have a positive effect on psychological outcomes (decision satisfaction, decision making distress, and depression) in women making decisions about breast cancer treatment. Testing the effect of the decision support intervention on decision satisfaction, decision making distress and depression will be measured using t-Tests. Patients with early stage breast cancer who are scheduled to have a medical oncology consultation, to decide an adjuvant therapy regimen, will be asked to participate. 128 patients will be randomly assigned to a group in which the patient and their oncologist would know the patient's preferred level of decision making control (intervention group) or a group that would receive information about a balanced diet (attention control group). Two nurses on the research team will consent participants, participate in the intervention, and collect data through interviews. Post intervention interviews will occur within 24 hours of the intervention and 4 weeks later.</detailed_description>
