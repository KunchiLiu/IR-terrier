	<criteria>Chronic hepatitis C, Genotype 1 or 4 HCV Ribonucleic acid (RNA) â‰¥ 100,000 IU/mL at screening Liver biopsy documenting no cirrhosis (within prior 2 years) or cirrhosis (from any time prior to randomization). Where approved for staging of liver disease, noninvasive imaging may be used to assess the extent of liver disease. Subjects with compensated cirrhosis can enroll and will be capped at 10% Naive to prior antiHCV therapy Infected with HCV other than Genotype 1 or 4 Positive Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or Human immunodeficiency virus1 (HIV1)/HIV2 antibody or hepatitis D virus (HDV) at screening Evidence of liver disease other than HCV Active substance abuse Use of hematologic growth factors within 90 days prior to study randomization Evidence of decompensated cirrhosis based on radiologic criteria or biopsy results and clinical criteria</criteria>
