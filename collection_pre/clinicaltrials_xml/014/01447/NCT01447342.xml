Subject is willing and able to comply with study instructions and commit to all followup visits for the duration of the study. 5. Subject is in good general health and free of any disease state or physical condition that might impair evaluation of forehead and/or glabellar wrinkle rating or which, in the investigator's opinion, exposes the subject to an unacceptable risk by study participation. 1. Subject is currently enrolled in an investigational drug or device study. 2. Subject has used an investigational drug or investigational device treatment within 30 days prior to first administration of the device. 3. Subject has a clotting disorder or has used an anticoagulant (e.g., Coumadin, clopidogrel, etc.) within seven (7) days prior to administration of the device. 4. Subject has used aspirin, or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, e.g., ibuprofen, and naproxen) within seven (7) days prior to administration of the device. 5. Subject has had prior surgery that alters the subcutaneous anatomy of the target treatment sites. 6. Subject has undergone another facial cosmetic procedure at or above the level of the cheekbones within the past six (6) months. 7. Subject has any of the following conditions: 1. History of facial nerve palsy, 2. Marked facial asymmetry, 3. Ptosis, 4. History of neuromuscular disorder, 5. Chronic dry eye symptoms, 6. Allergy or intolerance to lidocaine, 7. Other local skin condition (e.g., skin infection) at target treatment site, 8. Any physical or psychiatric condition that in the investigator's opinion would prevent adequate study participation. 9. Chronic medical condition that in the investigator's opinion would affect study participation (such as diabetes, hepatitis, HIV, etc.). 10. Any chronic condition contraindicated for the use of nerve mapping device including heart disease, use of a cardiac pacemaker, and pregnancy. 8. Subject is known to be noncompliant or is unlikely to comply with the requirements of the study protocol (e.g., due to alcoholism, drug dependency, mental incapacity) in the opinion of the investigator.</criteria>
