	<brief_summary>Bridges to the Future: Economic Empowerment for AIDS-Orphaned Children in Uganda, represents the first study that measures medium-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a family economic empowerment intervention for AIDS-orphaned children. The usual care provided to AIDS orphans in sub-Saharan Africa consists mainly of informal counseling as well as limited material support (e.g., specifically school lunches, textbooks for the required subjects, and note-books). Given the challenges facing these children and their caregivers, further supports are needed in order to help them successfully make the transition from primary school to secondary school and into adolescence. In the context of resource-poor countries, interventions that improve families' economic capabilities are likely to be particularly consequential. Both theory and prior research indicate that economic instability (including poverty) constitutes one of the primary risk factors for AIDS-orphaned children's risk-taking behaviors (including sexual risk-taking), poor mental health functioning, and poor educational outcomes. Thus, the lack of economic security constitutes an important risk factor for AIDS-orphaned children. Yet, to-date, few interventions aimed at care and support of AIDS-orphaned children have incorporated components to address family-level poverty/economic instability of the children and their caregiving families. Within this context, there is a need for innovative interventions that promote sustainable (more than short-term) economic and behavior change among AIDS-orphaned children and create the supports necessary to sustain these changes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall goal of the proposed research is to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of an innovative family-based economic empowerment intervention for AIDS-orphaned children. This will be accomplished via a three-group cluster randomized control trial (RCT). The three groups are: Bridges, Bridges PLUS, and usual care for AIDS-orphaned children. There will be five assessment points: baseline (pretest), 12, 24, 36, and 48-months post-intervention initiation. The intervention, "Bridges to the Future" (Bridges) will be guided by asset-theory and both Bridges and Bridges PLUS will include the following intervention components tested in the two earlier pilot studies, SEED-Uganda and SUUBI-Uganda: 1) workshops focused on asset building, future planning, and protection from risks; 2) mentors to reinforce learning and build optimism; 3) a Child Development Account (CDA) that can be used for secondary education by the AIDS-orphaned child; and 4) a family income generating/micro-enterprise promotion component for children enrolled in Bridges and Bridges PLUS, and their families.</detailed_description>
