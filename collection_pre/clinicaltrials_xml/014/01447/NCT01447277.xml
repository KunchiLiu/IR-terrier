	<brief_summary>The investigators propose that a preoperative femoral and sciatic blocks vs a femoral block only, prior to ambulatory anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction will lead to a decrease in opiate consumption, pain scores, post operative nausea/vomiting, and post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) length of stay. The investigators are prospectively randomizing patients to either a femoral or a fem/sciatic block and monitor outcomes.</brief_summary>
