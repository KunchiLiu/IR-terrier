	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study are: 1. to evaluate the involvement of CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 (through dextromethorphan and caffeine challenges), and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)in MDMA metabolism 2. to evaluate gender differences in the human pharmacology of MDMA 3. to study the influence of some genetic polymorphisms (CYP2D6, COMT, SERT) in the effects and pharmacokinetics of MDMA.</brief_summary>
