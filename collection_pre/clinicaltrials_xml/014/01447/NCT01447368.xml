	<brief_summary>This is a pilot, prospective randomized controlled study with the primary objective to evaluate and compare medical treatment of SHPT, namely oral cinacalcet versus surgical treatment, that is, parathyroidectomy with forearm autografting, on the progression of coronary artery and valvular calcification in endstage renal disease patients over 12 months. The change in arterial stiffening and bone mineral density as well as nutritional status will be evaluated as secondary objectives of this study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cinacalcet Versus Parathyroidectomy in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) are frequently complicated with vascular calcification. There is some suggestion that subtotal parathyroidectomy may reduce or stabilize vascular calcium scores in dialysis patients. Experimental data suggests that SHPT plays an important role in mediating uraemic arterial disease and that parathyroidectomy largely prevented the development of calcification. Cinacalcet has emerged as a novel therapy for the treatment of SHPT and has been shown to reduce the need for surgical parathyroidectomy. However, their effects on vascular and bone status have not been evaluatedand compared with parathyroidectomy.</detailed_description>
