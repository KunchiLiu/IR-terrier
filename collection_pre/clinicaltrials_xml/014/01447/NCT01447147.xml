	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of CCX140-B in Subjects With Diabetic Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CCX140-B in subjects with diabetic nephropathy based on subject incidence of adverse events. The secondary objectives of this study include evaluation of the effect of CCX140-B on several measures of effectiveness commonly used in the evaluation of diabetes and renal medications.</detailed_description>
