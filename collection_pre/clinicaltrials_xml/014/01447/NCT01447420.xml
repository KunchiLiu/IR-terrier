	<brief_summary>This multi-center, open-label study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Pegasys (peginterferon alfa-2a) and Copegus (ribavirin) in relation to IL28-b gene expression in treatment-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1. Patients will receive Pegasys (180 mcg sc weekly) and Copegus ( 1'000 or 1'200 mg orally daily) for 48 weeks. Anticipated time of study treatment is 48 weeks, follow-up is 24 weeks.</brief_summary>
