	<brief_title>Tailored Intervention to Promote Positive Airway Pressure Adherence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Poor adherence to CPAP is a significant problem among OSA patients resulting in suboptimal health and functional outcomes. Intervention studies to promote CPAP adherence have shown relatively small effects in selected samples and were costly. The overall objective of this research is to examine the effect, feasibility, and acceptability of a tailored intervention on CPAP adherence among adults with newly-diagnosed, CPAP treated OSA. The central hypothesis is that critically timed tailored interventions that focus on sociocultural aspects and cognitive perceptions of the individual experience with OSA diagnosis and treatment will improve overall CPAP adherence rates. The pilot randomized controlled trial will examine CPAP adherence outcomes at 1wk, 1mo, and 3mo among those randomly assigned to the tailored intervention or usual (standard) care and examine specific feasibility and participant acceptability outcomes in order to design and conduct a subsequent larger randomized controlled trial testing the overall efficacy of the tailored intervention.</detailed_description>
