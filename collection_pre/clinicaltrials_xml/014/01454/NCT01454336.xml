	<brief_summary>Liver cirrhosis (LC) is the final destiny in chronic liver disease. Liver transplantation is the only effective therapy available to these patients. However, limited number of donors, post surgical complications, immunological rejection, and financial considerations are it`s essential problems. The immuomodulatory impact of MSCs in fibrosis was confirmed, and several clinical studies have applied MSCs to eliminate the progression of fibrosis. In this research the investigators will study the affect of MSCs and Pioglitazone in the process of fibrosis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transplantation of Autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cell in Decompensate Cirrhotic Patients With Pioglitazone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BM Aspiration will be done twice (6 months interval) from the iliac crest according to standard procedures under general anesthesia and is collected (200ML) in plastic bags containing anti coagulant. After precipitation of red blood cells, mononuclear cells will be collected by centrifugation in Ficoll-Paque density gradient. MNCs will be cultured in T150 flasks. Cells will be expanded in several subcultures.MSCs will be injected (6 months interval) via portal vein under sonography monitoring.Each patient will receive 30mg Pioglitazone daily for 24 months. After cell therapy, patients are followed up every week for 6 months, and laboratory data are analyzed for 6 months.</detailed_description>
