	<brief_summary>This study consists of evaluations, using blood tests, various immune, inflammatory and coagulation parameters in the perioperative settings (different substudies), without changing anything to what is expected. This will allow us to clarify the possible impact of surgery and analgesia on perioperative activation of these pathways.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Perioperative Evaluation of Immuno-inflammatory Parameters</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A significant number of published data can be concluded that surgery and anesthetic and analgesic techniques have an impact on immunity and inflammation. However, none of these studies have been performed with modern techniques, much more reliable evaluation of immune activity, such as the assessment of monocytic degranulation by flow cytometry. It is therefore important to document immune activity using these new techniques, our patients, perioperative. This will be analyzed, so observational, the potential impact of different therapeutic interventions the patient receives. This study consists of evaluations, using blood tests, various immune, inflammatory and coagulation parameters in the perioperative settings (different substudies), without changing anything to what is expected. This will allow us to clarify the possible impact of surgery and analgesia on perioperative activation of these pathways.</detailed_description>
