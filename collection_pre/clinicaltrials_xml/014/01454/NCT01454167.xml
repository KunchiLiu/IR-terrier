	<detailed_description>our objective is evaluation of a connection between PH,PCO2,HCO3,PO2,Na,K,Glu and Lactate patterns in vacum drains of different plastic operational wounds and its relation to infections and seroma formation. it is possible that early changes in this values might point out an infection or seroma formation of a wound before clinical signs appear.</detailed_description>
