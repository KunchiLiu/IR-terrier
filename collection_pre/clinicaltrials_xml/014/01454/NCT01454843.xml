	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to compare the results of LASIK surgery when using Alcon Allegretto wavefront-guided excimer laser system compared to AMO Visx Custom wavefront-guided excimer laser system in patients with nearsightedness with and without astigmatism.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LASIK Using the Alcon Allegretto Wavefront-Guided Excimer Laser vs AMO Visx Wavefront-Guided Excimer Laser</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patients will have a comprehensive eye examination once they express an interest in the study. This includes a slit lamp examination of the front of the eye and a dilated fundoscopic examination of the back of the eye. if there is any pathology noted that would exclude the patient from the study, then we will inform the patient and make an appropriate referral. If the patient is deemed appropriate for the study after a comprehensive examination included computerized videokeratography, then they can be enrolled. The patient will undergo bilateral simultaneous eye surgery. Which eye is treated with a wavefront-guided excimer laser and which eye is treated with wavefront-optimized will be randomized so there is a 50% chance for either eye to receive one treatment. The patients will be seen on the day of surgery, post op day one, post op day 4-7, one month, three months, six months and one year. The patient will receive topical antibiotics in each eye for one week following the procedure. LASIK treated eyes will receive pred forte 1% ophthalmic drops for one week after treatment. All of this is within the usual and customary standard of care for the treatment of patients undergoing lasik surgery. The research procedures are the least risky that can be performed consistent with sound research design.</detailed_description>
