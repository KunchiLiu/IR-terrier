	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to compare an acellular epithelial skin substitute with autologous split-thickness skin grafts (STSGs) in deep partial-thickness burns. The objective is to evaluate skin quality and scar formation by using subjective and objective burn scar assessments in order to present valuable data for another additional option of wound coverage in deep partial-thickness burns. The investigators hypothesized that the acellular epithelial skin substitute is at least not inferior to autologous skin grafts.</brief_summary>
