	<brief_title>Partial Posterior Hyaloidectomy in Macular Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The induction of a posterior vitreous detachment (IPVD) during vitrectomy have been suggested as one of the etiologies of iatrogenic retinal break related to vitrectomy.The iatrogenic retinal breaks related to IPVD usually develop near or anterior to the equatorial region. Thus, the investigators hypothesized that this complication could be prevented by restricting the extent of IPVD, and planned a modified procedure of vitrectomy in which the extent of IPVD and removal of vitreous cortex was restricted to about slightly beyond the margin of temporal major vascular arcade. The investigators have termed this procedure, partial posterior hyaloidectomy. Unlike RRD or proliferative diabetic retinopathy, lesions are localized within the major vascular arcade in macular disorders so that macular disorders could be an eligible indication for this procedure.</detailed_description>
