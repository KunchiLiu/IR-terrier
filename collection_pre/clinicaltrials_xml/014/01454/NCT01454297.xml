	<brief_title>Relating Clinical Outcomes in Multiple Myeloma to Personal Assessment of Genetic Profile</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Understanding the molecular basis of cancer is a critical step toward devising the most effective treatment of the patient as an individual. The promise of molecular targeted therapeutics and personalized cancer care has been demonstrated in breast and lung cancer and chronic myeloid leukemia. However, similar examples of success in multiple myeloma have not been achieved despite extensive basic research as well as clinical advances. What is well understood is that myeloma is a heterogeneous disease with great genetic and epigenetic complexity.22, 23 Therefore, there remains a critical need to understand myeloma patient biology in the context of current patient care.24 The objective of this longitudinal study is to identify patient subgroups and phenotypes defined by molecular profiling and clinical features. These profiles will enable a better understanding of mechanisms of disease, drug response and patient relapse. Ultimately the study is intended to drive successful drug development and patient care in multiple myeloma.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient is at least 18 years old. Patient has been diagnosed with symptomatic MM with measurable disease that includes at least one of the following: Serum M protein ≥ 1g/dl Urine M protein ≥ 200 mg/24 hrs Involved free light chain level ≥ 10 mg/dl and an abnormal serum free light chain ratio (&lt;0.26 or &gt;1.65). The patient is a candidate for systemic therapy that includes an IMiD® (e.g., lenalidomide, pomalidomide, thalidomide) and/or proteasome inhibitor (e.g., bortezomib, carfilzomib) as part of the initial regimen. No more than 30 days from baseline bone marrow evaluation as per this protocol to initiation of firstline therapy. Patient has read, understood and signed informed consent. Patient is already receiving systemic therapy for MM (a single dose of bisphosphonates and up to 100 mg total dose of dexamethasone or equivalent corticosteroids are permitted prior to registration on study). Patient had another malignancy within the last 5 years (except for basal or squamous cell carcinoma, or in situ cancer of the cervix). Patient is enrolled in a blinded clinical trial for the firstline treatment of multiple myeloma. Patients may be enrolled in subsequent clinical trials as long as continued access to data and tissue, as per this protocol, is not prohibited.</criteria>
