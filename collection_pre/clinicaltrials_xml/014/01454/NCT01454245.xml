	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and relative bioavailability of a single dose of 3 capsule formulations of JNJ-39439335 in healthy adult male volunteers. The effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of one of the capsule formulations of JNJ-39439335 will also be evaluated during the study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Bioavailability and Food Effect of JNJ-39439335 in Healthy Adult Male Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (the name of the study drug will be known to the healthy volunteers participating in this study as well as to all study staff), randomized (volunteers will be assigned by chance to 1 of 6 possible treatment sequences of a single dose of 3 different capsule formulations of JNJ-39439335) to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (blood levels of drug) and relative bioavailability (i.e., the rate and extent of absorption of the drug in the body) of JNJ-39439335 (Part 1 of the study). The effect of food on the administration of JNJ-39439335 will then be evaluated on 1 capsule formulation of JNJ-39439335 (Part 2 of the study). The safety and tolerability of JNJ-39439335 will be monitored throughout Part 1 and 2 of the study. In Part 1, healthy volunteers will be randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatment sequences and will receive a total of 3 single doses of JNJ-39439335. Each dose (2 capsules) will be separated by 21 days. In Part 2, healthy volunteers will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment sequences and will receive a total of 2 single doses of one formulation selected from Part 1; each dose will be separated by 21 days. Doses will be administered to healthy volunteers under fed and fasted conditions.</detailed_description>
