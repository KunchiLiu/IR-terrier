	<brief_summary>This is a single, one time, limited dose infusion of Paclitaxel, that will potentially prevent recurrent stenosis secondary to intimal hyperplasia when compared to the control group at 10 months.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators study consists of enrolling subjects that are already scheduled to have the blood vessels in their legs re-opened. The entire study is considered standard of care, except the administration of Paclitaxel. Subjects will be consented prior to any study related procedures and prior to procedure. Subjects that meet inclusion/exclusion and the infusion of Paclitaxel has been given, will then be enrolled in the study. After the plaque area has been treated with either angioplasty (inflation of a balloon compacting it against the artery wall), stent (a wire mesh tube that presses the plaque against the artery wall and opens the artery), and/or atherectomy(removal of plaque from the artery), Dr Kelly, Dr. Schultz, Dr, Laurich, or Dr. Santos will then use an infusion balloon (a balloon with an outer layer that has holes that allows a medication to be given) to administer the Paclitaxel. Every time the infusion balloon is blown up, a single dose of medication (Paclitaxel) will be applied to the target lesion. This will be repeated until all of the target lesions have been treated or a maximum dose of 10 mg of Paclitaxel has been given. All persons enrolled in this study will be treated with Paclitaxel. Subjects are expected to attend all follow up visits. These visits would occur even if the subject were not on the trial. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) (done by measuring blood pressure at the ankle and in the arm while a person is at rest. This test indicates if leg blockages are present) and Duplexes (An ultrasound that measures blood flow rates through the vessels. This test will indicate if leg blockages are present) will be done at the follow up visits. Both of these tests and all follow up visits are considered standard of care and will be charged to the subject or subject's insurance.</detailed_description>
