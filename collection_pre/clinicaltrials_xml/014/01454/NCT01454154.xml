	<brief_title>Glyburide (RP-1127) for Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary efficacy objective of this study is to assess whether patients with severe, moderate, or complicated mild TBI administered RP-1127 will show a decrease in MRI-defined edema and/or hemorrhage, compared to patients administered placebo. The primary safety objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of RP-1127 compared to placebo in patients with severe, moderate, or complicated mild TBI.</detailed_description>

Complicated mild must have GCS 1314 and one or more of the following: Intraparenchymal clots or contusions in aggregate &gt; 10cc; Midline shift &gt; 5mm; IVH, SDH, EDH seen on more than one CT scan slice. 4. Age 1875 years 5. Patients in whom a dedicated peripheral IV line can be placed for study drug administration 6. Written consent obtained from legally authorized representative (LAR) 1. No documented TBI or time of impact not certain 2. Penetrating brain injury 3. Spinal column instability and/or spinal cord injury with neurodeficit 4. Concomitant severe non survivable injury 5. Pregnant, or a positive pregnancy test 6. Women who intend to breastfeed during Study Days 14. 7. Blood glucose &lt;50mg/dL 8.

INR&gt;1.4 11. Systolic BP&lt;90 mm Hg not responsive to fluid resuscitation 12. Blood alcohol &gt; 250mg/dL 13. Inability to have MRI (pacemaker, nonMR compatible pressure monitor, etc.) 14. Hospitalization for brain injury, psychiatric or neurological disease within previous 3 years 15. Emergent or urgent surgical operation anticipated (in OR, bedside procedures excluded) that would prevent dosing with study drug within 8 hours of injury. 16. Known use of Coumadin (warfarin), Plavix (clopidogrel), Effient (prasugrel) or Pletal (cilostazol), heparin, low molecular weight heparin, heparinoids, or abciximab or similar antiplatelet agents in the previous 72 hours (Note that patients later found to have taken these medications will not be automatically excluded from the study.) 17. Use of sulfonylurea drugs within the prior 30 days 18. Treatment with another investigational drug within the prior 30 days 19. Allergy to sulfonylurea drugs 20. Known diagnosis of G6PD enzyme deficiency 21. PaO2 &lt; 60 mm Hg on admission (for patients in whom blood gases are drawn per standard of care) 22. NonEnglish speaking legally authorized representative and subjects (University of Maryland only) 23. Prisoners or others who may be unable to make a truly voluntary and uncoerced decision whether or not to participate in the study 24. Any other clinical condition which in the opinion of the investigator makes the patient unsuitable for inclusion into the study</criteria>
