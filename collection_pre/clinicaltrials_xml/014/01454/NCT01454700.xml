	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to investigate whether the combination of insulin pump therapy and continued glucose monitoring (CGM) is superior to multiple daily insulin injections to prevent progression of albuminuria in patients with type 1 diabetes</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of CSII and CGM on Progression of Late Diabetic Complications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>80 type 1 diabetic patients with kidney function (GFR &gt; 45 ml/min), but with urine albumin excretion of at least 30 mg/day and HbA1c 7.5-13.0% are randomised to either multiple daily insulin injections (control group) or insulin pump therapy plus continued glucose monitoring (CGM) (intervention group). Patients must be in stable RAAS blockade before entering the study. Before the study is initiated all patients receive education in intensive diabetes treatment and self-care including carbohydrate counting. Patients return to the clinic after 1,3,6,9, and 12 months for measurement of urine albumine excretion, clinical examination including blood pressure, CGM sensor readings, four-point self monitored blood glucose (SMBG) profiles, blood samples and fulfillment of questionnaire to assess quality of life. At entry and after 12 months, eye fundus foto, 24-hour blood pressure, GFR, and carotis intima media thickness (CIMT)are also evaluated.</detailed_description>
