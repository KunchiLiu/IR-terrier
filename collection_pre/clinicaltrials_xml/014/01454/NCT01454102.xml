	<brief_summary>There is no formal research hypothesis to be statistically tested in this protocol. - The study is evaluating the safety and tolerability of Nivolumab (BMS-936558) when combined with three platinum-based doublet chemotherapy regimens (Cisplatin/Gemcitabine; Cisplatin/Pemetrexed; and Carboplatin/Paclitaxel) in subjects with NSCLC. - The study is evaluating the safety and tolerability of Nivolumab as maintenance therapy in combination with Bevacizumab/Avastin that will be given after at least 4 cycles of platinum doublet chemotherapy. - The study is evaluating the safety and tolerability of Nivolumab in combination with Erlotinib among epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation positive non-squamous NSCLC subjects and as monotherapy in subjects with NSCLC. - The study is evaluating the safety and tolerability of Nivolumab in combination with Ipilimumab in subjects with squamous and non-squamous NSCLC. - The study is evaluating the safety and tolerability of Nivolumab as switch maintenance therapy in subjects with squamous and non-squamous NSCLC. - The study is evaluating the safety and tolerability of Nivolumab as monotherapy among subjects with untreated, asymptomatic brain metastases and no evidence of cerebral edema.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>For more information regarding BMS clinical trial participation, please visit www.BMSStudyConnect.com Newly diagnosed and confirmed Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC Previously treated NSCLC with asymptomatic brain metastases (eligible for Arm M) See additional details below Men and women aged ≥18 years Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1 Subject must be chemotherapy naive (except Arm D, K, L and M). Prior use of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is acceptable. For Arms D, K, and L, subjects must be nonprogressors within 42 days after completion of firstline treatment with ≥4 cycles of Platinum Doublet chemotherapy with or without Bevacizumab. See below for Arm M Either a formalin fixed tissue block or a minimum of 10 slides of tumor sample (archived or fresh) must be available for biomarker evaluation (a local pathologist must review for adequacy of sampling) Life expectancy of at least 3 months Prior radiotherapy must have been completed at least 2 weeks prior to study entry For Arm M: No more than 4 brain metastases Each brain metastases ≤3 cm in size No evidence of cerebral edema Subjects must be free of neurologic symptoms related to metastatic brain lesions and must not have required or received systemic corticosteroids for ≥10 days prior to initiation of study treatment At least 1 measurable target brain lesion &gt;0.5 cm and no larger than 3 cm in diameter and/or 2 measurable brain target lesions &gt;0.3 cm No prior radiation therapy, surgery, or other local therapy for target brain lesions Must have received at least one prior systemic anticancer therapy for NSCLC Subjects with symptomatic brain metastases, spinal cord compression, or intractable back pain due to a compressive or destructive mass Subjects who require emergent use of systemic steroids, emergent surgery and/or radiotherapy Any active or history of a known autoimmune disease Subjects with previous malignancies (except nonmelanoma skin cancers, in situ bladder cancer, gastric, or colon cancers or cervical cancers/dysplasia, or breast carcinoma in situ) are excluded unless a complete remission was achieved at least 2 years prior to study entry and no additional therapy is required or anticipated to be required during the study period History of Grade ≥2 neuropathy Subjects with interstitial lung disease that is symptomatic or may interfere with the detection or management of suspected drugrelated pulmonary toxicity</criteria>
