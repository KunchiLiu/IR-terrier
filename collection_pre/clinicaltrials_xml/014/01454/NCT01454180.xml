	<brief_title>Study of Individualized Selection of Chemotherapy in Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Carcinoma According to Therapeutic Targets</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase II, open two branches, in which conventional treatment is administered to patients diagnosed with metastatic pancreatic carcinoma. Patients will be randomized (1:1) to a treatment arm or control arm of experimental treatment guided by the therapeutic targets. Patients in the control treatment arm will be treated with any of the schemes used in the study according to the discretion of the physician responsible. Patients will be analyzed as "intention to treat." In the experimental treatment arm (therapeutic targets) and within 15 days will determine the markers of therapeutic targets detailed in the protocol, either from pre-existing tumor sample or a fresh sample obtained by biopsy. Based on the results of this analysis, we prescribe a chemotherapy treatment determined for possible treatments currently used in pancreatic carcinoma, gemcitabine, gemcitabine and capecitabine, gemcitabine and erlotinib, FOLFIRINOX, FOLFOX, FOLFIRI. Treatment duration is indefinite .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histological or cytological diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma. Patients&gt; 18 years. Measurable or not measurable disease. Life expectancy&gt; 3 months at the discretion of the investigator. Good general condition determined by the ECOG scale (score 01) Candidate for firstline systemic chemotherapy according to standard practice. Availability of tumor tissue or opportunity for tumor biopsy for the determination of biomarkers and their correlation with treatment. Adequate hematologic function: ANC&gt; 1.5 x 103 / L, absolute count of platelets&gt; 100 x 109 / L, normal values of INR and PTT. Adequate liver function: total serum bilirubin &lt;2 mg / dL, ALT and AST &lt;3 times the upper limit established by the laboratory (LSR) or &lt;5 LSR in patients with liver metastases. Adequate renal function: serum creatinine &lt;1.5 LSR. Patients who have received prior chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic carcinoma. Will not result excluding patients who had previously received adjuvant treatment with gemcitabine or fluoropyrimidines. Also not will be excluded patients who had previously received preoperative neoadjuvant treatment for localized disease with chemotherapy and / or radiotherapy. Patients for whom is contraindicated the administration of either drug used in firstline treatment for pancreatic cancer: Gemcitabine, 5'Fluouracilo, Leucovorin, Capecitabine, Oxaliplatin, Irinotecan, Erlotinib.
