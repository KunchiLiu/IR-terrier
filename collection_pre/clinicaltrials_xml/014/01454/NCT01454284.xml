	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is: - To compare the blood sugar control on LY2605541 with insulin glargine after 52 weeks of treatment. - To compare the number of nocturnal low blood sugar episodes on LY2605541 with insulin glargine during 52 weeks of treatment. - To compare the number of patients on LY2605541 reaching blood sugar targets without low blood sugar episodes at night to those taking insulin glargine after 52 weeks of treatment. - To compare the total number of low blood sugar episodes on LY2605541 with insulin glargine after 52 weeks of treatment</brief_summary>
