	<brief_summary>In Germany nearly half of the population present elevated values of blood pressure, with - as a result of lifestyle factors and a growing average age - further increasing numbers. Consequences of arterial hypertension may be cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular events, and renal insufficiency. Thus, hypertension therapy focuses on the reduction of these complications. The aims of the 3A-registry are the characterization of outpatients with hypertension, their diagnostic procedures and medical treatment (esp. with renin inhibitors), therapy compliance and success, clinical events, and an assessment of overall guideline adherence in the treatment of these patients. Patients fulfilling the relevant criteria are enrolled and followed up by their general practitioner or medical specialist.</brief_summary>
