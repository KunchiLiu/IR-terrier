So, it become a diagnostic challenge, its prevalence always underestimated. The prevalence of rhinitis has increased in recent years. The phenomenon of underestimate is caused by variety of personal and environmental factors. Allergic rhinitis had increased direct and indirect social and economic burden. Geographic tongue is a benign tongue performance. Geographic tongue has been reported their relevance to allergy. Geographic tongue is a chronic tongue situation.

The investigators hope that geographic tongue could play a role in the diagnostic of allergic rhinitis. The prevalence of geographic tongue in the United States is about 1.8%, white Americans and Mexicans have a higher incidence rate. This study will investigate the relevance between allergic rhinitis and geographic tongue. The investigators will analyze the relevant gender, age, severity of inspection reports.
