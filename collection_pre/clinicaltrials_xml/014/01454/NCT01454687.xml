	<brief_summary>The term epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is used to describe a group of genetic skin diseases associated with skin weakness, blisters, and chronic wounds. "Revertant mosaicism" means that there are two genetically different populations of cells due to spontaneous mutations. Some EB patients have normal, non-fragile skin patches which may be areas of revertant mosaicism. In the revertant areas, the proteins function normally, like non-EB skin. In this study, we plan to culture cells from the revertant areas and graft them on to the wounded areas.</brief_summary>
