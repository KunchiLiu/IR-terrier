	<criteria>Male or female patients 18 years or older Patients must have a diagnosis of histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic and/or advanced solid tumor malignancy or lymphoma for which no effective standard treatment is available Female patients who are postmenopausal at least 1 year, OR surgically sterile, OR if of childbearing potential, agree to practice 2 effective methods of contraception, at the same time from the time of signing the consent form through 90 days after the last dose of study drug, or agree to practice true abstinence Male patients, even if surgically sterilized, agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and through 90 days after the last dose of study drug OR agree to practice true abstinence Voluntary written informed consent Clinical laboratory values as specified in protocol Suitable venous access Recovered (ie, &lt; Grade 1 toxicity or patient's baseline status) from the reversible effects of prior anticancer therapy Peripheral neuropathy &gt; Grade 2 on clinical examination Systemic treatment with strong inhibitors of CYP1A2, strong inhibitors of CYP3A, or strong CYP3A inducers or use of ginkgo biloba or St. John's wort within 14 days before the first dose of IXAZOMIB Patient has symptomatic brain metastasis. Patients with brain metastases must: have stable neurologic status following surgery or radiation for at least 2 weeks after completion of the definitive therapy; AND be without neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events Female patients who are pregnant or lactating Serious illness that could interfere with protocol completion Autologous stem cell transplant within 6 months before Day 1 of Cycle 1, or prior allogeneic stem cell transplant at any time Prior treatment with rituximab or other unconjugated any antibody treatment within 42 days (21 days if there is clear evidence of progressive disease or immediate treatment is mandated) Ongoing treatment with corticosteroids Radiotherapy within 21 days before the first dose of study drug Major surgery within 14 days before the first dose of study drug Infection requiring systemic antibiotic therapy or other serious infection within 14 days prior to first dose of study drug Lifethreatening illness unrelated to cancer Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive, hepatitis B surface antigenpositive, or suspected hepatitis C infection Diagnosis or treatment of another malignancy within 2 years preceding first dose, OR previously diagnosed with another malignancy and have any evidence of residual disease. Patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of any type are not excluded if they have undergone complete resection Evidence of uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions QTc &gt; 500 milliseconds on a 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) Known gastrointestinal disease or procedure that could interfere with the oral absorption or tolerance of IXAZOMIB including difficulty swallowing capsules; diarrhea &gt; Grade 1 despite supportive therapy Patients with gastric achlorhydria Patients who have used any nicotine containing products within 14 days before the first dose of study drug (Arm 1, Arm 4, and Arm 5) Treatment with any investigational products or systemic antineoplastic therapies within 21 days before the first dose of IXAZOMIB</criteria>
