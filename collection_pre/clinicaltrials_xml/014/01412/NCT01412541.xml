	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the superior efficacy and non-inferior safety of the Moxy Drug Coated Balloon by direct comparison to standard percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) catheter for treatment of stenosis of the femoropopliteal arteries.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Moxy Drug Coated Balloon vs. Standard Balloon Angioplasty for the Treatment of Femoropopliteal Arteries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Moxy Drug Coated Balloon is indicated for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of obstructive de novo or non-stented restenotic lesions in native femoropopliteal arteries up to 15 cm in length and ≥4.0 to ≤6.0 mm in diameter. This study will randomize approximately 476 patients who will receive either the Moxy balloon or standard balloon angioplasty at 55 global investigational sites. Subjects will be blinded to treatment until 12 months and will participate in long term follow-up for 5 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Clinical 1. Male or nonpregnant female ≥18 years of age; 2. Rutherford Clinical Category 24; 3. Patient is willing to provide informed consent, is geographically stable and comply with the required follow up visits, testing schedule and medication regimen; Angiographic Lesion 4. Length ≤15 cm; 5. Up to two focal lesions or segments within the designated 15 cm length of vessel may be treated (e.g. two discrete segments, separated by several cm, but both falling within a composite length of &lt;15 cm); 6. ≥70% stenosis by visual estimate; 7. Lesion location starts ≥1 cm below the common femoral bifurcation and terminates distally ≤2 cm below the tibial plateau AND ≥1 cm above the origin of the TP trunk; 8. de novo lesion(s) or nonstented restenotic lesion(s) &gt;90 days from prior angioplasty procedure; 9. Lesion is located at least 3 cm from any stent, if target vessel was previously stented; 10. Target vessel diameter between ≥4 and ≤6 mm and able to be treated with available device size matrix; 11. Successful, uncomplicated (without use of a crossing device) antegrade wire crossing of lesion; 12. A patent inflow artery free from significant lesion (≥50% stenosis) as confirmed by angiography (treatment of target lesion acceptable after successful treatment of inflow artery lesions); NOTE: Successful inflow artery treatment is defined as attainment of residual diameter stenosis ≤30% without death or major vascular complication. 13. At least one patent native outflow artery to the ankle, free from significant (≥50%) stenosis as confirmed by angiography that has not previously been revascularized (treatment of outflow disease is NOT permitted during the index procedure); 14. Contralateral limb lesion(s) cannot be treated within 2 weeks before and/or planned 30 days after the protocol treatment in order to avoid confounding complications; 15. No other prior vascular interventions within 2 weeks before and/or planned 30 days after the protocol treatment. Patients will be excluded if ANY of the following conditions apply: 1. Pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant or men intending to father children; 2. Life expectancy of &lt;5 years; 3. Patient is currently participating in an investigational drug or other device study or previously enrolled in this study; NOTE: Enrollment in another clinical trial during the follow up period is not allowed. 4. History of hemorrhagic stroke within 3 months; 5. Previous or planned surgical or interventional procedure within 2 weeks before or within 30 days after the index procedure; 6. History of myocardial infarction (MI), thrombolysis or angina within 2 weeks of enrollment; 7. Rutherford Class 0, 1, 5 or 6; 8. Renal failure or chronic kidney disease with modification in diet in renal disease glomerular filtration rate (MDRD GFR) ≤30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (or serum creatinine ≥2.5 mg/L within 30 days of index procedure or treated with dialysis); 9. Prior vascular surgery of the index limb, with the exception of remote common femoral patch angioplasty separated by at least 2 cm from the target lesion; 10. Inability to take required study medications or allergy to contrast that cannot be adequately managed with pre and postprocedure medication; 11. Anticipated use of IIb/IIIa inhibitor prior to randomization; 12. Ipsilateral retrograde access; 13. Composite lesion length is &gt;15 cm or there is no normal proximal arterial segment in which duplex flow velocity can be measured; 14. Significant inflow disease. Successful treatment of inflow disease allowed prior to target lesion treatment; 15. Known inadequate distal outflow (&gt;50 % stenosis of distal popliteal and/or all three tibial vessels), or planned future treatment of vascular disease distal to the target lesion; 16. Sudden symptom onset, acute vessel occlusion, or acute or subacute thrombus in target vessel; 17. Severe calcification that renders the lesion undilatable; 18. Use of adjunctive treatment modalities (i.e. laser, atherectomy, cryoplasty, scoring/cutting balloon, etc.).</criteria>
