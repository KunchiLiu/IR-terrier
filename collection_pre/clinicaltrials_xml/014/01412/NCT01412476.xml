	<brief_summary>Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a significant risk factor of cardiovascular disease. However, the relationships between coenzyme Q10, antioxidant vitamins (Vitamin A, C, E) and the prevention of the risk of MS are still inconsistent. The purposes of this study are going to investigate the relation of coenzyme Q10, antioxidant vitamins concentration with the blood lipid levels, the markers of lipid peroxidation (TBARS), antioxidant enzymes activities (catalase, glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase), and the inflammatory markers (hs-CRP,IL-6 and adiponectin). The investigators will recruit MS patients (case group, n = 100) and age-gender matched healthy subjects from previous study(n = 105) as a control group . The inclusion criteria of MS are according to the Bureau of Health Promotion, Department of Health in Taiwan (2007).Hopefully, the results of this study could provide the information to what has been know in MS subjects. The investigators expect coenzyme Q10 or antioxidant vitamins could be a preventive supplement to reduce the risk of MS.</brief_summary>
