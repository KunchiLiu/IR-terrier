	<brief_title>The Effect of Long-Acting Mesalamine on Post-Infective Irritable Bowel Syndrome- A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will test long acting mesalamine in the management of PI-IBS. It has the potential to improve QOL and perhaps gastrointestinal symptoms, in patients with PI-IBS. The results of this study, if positive, will provide preliminary data for a large scale clinical trial. This study will also provide information about plasma cytokines in patients with PI-IBS and whether improvement in symptoms correlates with improvement in plasma cytokines.</detailed_description>
