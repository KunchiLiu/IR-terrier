	<brief_summary>Cosmetic result after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) would impose great effect upon patient's quality of life. Although peri-areolar incision has been widely used in benign breast tumor excision, mastopexy procedures and skin-sparing mastectomy with primary reconstruction, the actual safety and aesthetic outcome of the peri-areolar incision approach in BCS for cancer patients has not been established by randomized, controlled trials. This trial was design to compare the Safety and aesthetic outcomes of breast conserving surgery between peri-areolar incision approach and traditional methods.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Aesthetic Outcomes of Breast Conserving Surgery With Peri-areolar Incision Approach</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Trial aims to determine whether BCS with the peri-areolar approach: 1) is safe in terms of the rates of recurrence and metastasis; 2) can improve the post-operative aesthetic score and QOL score.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>patients desire for breast conserving surgery; fulfills criteria for breast conserving surgery; the maximum diameter of the tumor should be less than the semiperimeter of the areola and that the proximal margin of tumor should be at least 1 cm away from the areola; patients suitable to receive BCS with either the periareolar incision or the traditional incision were included; patients not suitable for breast conserving surgery; skin or subcutaneous tumor invasion as definite contraindication of skinsparing; male or bilateral breast cancers who might bring up bias in deciding aesthetic outcomes and expenditure; Patients who were supposed to benefit from a certain kind of incision were also excluded at the researcher's discretion.</criteria>
