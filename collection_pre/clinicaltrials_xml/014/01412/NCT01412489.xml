	<brief_title>Intrauterine Adhesion Rate After Hysteroscopic Myomectomy and Application of HYALOBARRIER Gel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hysteroscopic myomectomy is the referent surgical treatment for submucous myoma. But intrauterine adhesion rate was evaluated about 7 to 15% after this procedure. The investigators hypothetically believe that application of HYALOBARRIER Gel at the end of the procedure, could be reduce the mean intrauterine rate to 50%. Thus, the investigators performed a multicenter (n = 20) prospective study non randomized in 220 patients with submucous myoma &lt; 3 cm of diameter, evaluated by preoperative ultrasound. The investigators prefer this study design, because the principal reason is the number of enrolled patient were more 200 patients in each group with a double blind randomized study. Now, in all patients, after hysteroscopic myomectomy which performed with a same technique in each center (bipolar coagulation and physiologic serum), a diagnostic hysteroscopy was performed at 2 month to determinate the existence of intrauterine adhesion. Secondary end points were in this study the tolerance and side effects of HYALOBARRIER Gel and the subsequent fertility at 2 years.</detailed_description>
