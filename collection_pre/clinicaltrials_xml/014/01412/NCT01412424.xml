	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Octreotide (MYCAPSSA™ [Formerly Octreolin™]) for Acromegaly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consisted of 2 periods, a Core Treatment Period of up to 7 months and an optional Extension Treatment Period of up to 6 months, for a total study duration of up to 13 months. The Core Treatment Period consisted of 2 phases, a Dose Escalation Phase of at least 2 months to identify the therapeutic dose for each study participant and a Fixed Dose Phase of 2 to 5 months during which the therapeutic dose was maintained. Participants were eligible to enter the Fixed Dose Phase of the Core Treatment Period if they were clinically and biochemically controlled. The same criteria were used to allow entry into the voluntary 6-month Extension Treatment Period. The Core Treatment Period of the study was completed if the participant had at least 2 months of treatment in the Fixed Dose Phase and a total treatment duration of at least 7 months. Participants who elected to continue into the Extension Treatment Period maintained their therapeutic dose during this period. At the end of the study (after the last dose of MYCAPSSA in either the Core Treatment Period or the Extension Treatment Period), there was a 2-week follow-up period for safety assessments.</detailed_description>
