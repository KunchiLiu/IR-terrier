	<brief_summary>This study concerns the nearest relatives of patients who have passed away within 3 days of admission to an ICU due to: (1) brain death with multiple organ donation +/- tissues or (2) death via limitation and / or cessation of active treatment (LATA) without brain death or (3) sudden death of a previously healthy patient (no physical or mental limitations; MacCabe score = 0) within 3 days of admission to ICU without LATA nor brain death. Our primary objective is to determine the proportion of nearest relatives at risk for post traumatic stress disorder as defined by an Impact of Event Scale score greater than 37, and to compare this factor between the three above-mentioned groups.</brief_summary>
