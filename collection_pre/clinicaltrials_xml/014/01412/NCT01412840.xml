	<brief_summary>Ureterolithiasis pain is a severe condition for which it takes some 30 minutes for standard treatment to yield maximal pain relief, a period during which the patient suffers severe to intolerable pain. It would thus be valuable to further evaluate sterile water injection as a method for achieving rapid relief for this type of pain.</brief_summary>
