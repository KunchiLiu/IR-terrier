	<criteria>Diagnosis of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) Wildtype (without mutation in codons 12 and 13) KRAS gene in tumor tissue confirmed by a central laboratory Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1 or 2 At least 1 measurable or nonmeasurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 guidelines. Treatment failure (defined as failure due to either disease progression [clinical or radiological] or toxicity [treatment intolerance]) of a prior regimen containing irinotecan for metastatic disease and a prior regimen containing oxaliplatin for metastatic disease. Oxaliplatin and irinotecan may have been administered sequentially or in combination. Disease relapse within 6 months after completing adjuvant chemotherapy (with either an irinotecan or oxaliplatin containing regimen) will also be considered as treatment failure of a prior regimen for metastatic disease Must have previously received a thymidylate synthase inhibitor (eg, fluorouracil, capecitabine, raltitrexed, or fluorouraciluracil) at any point for treatment of CRC Man or woman at least 18 years of age Adequate hematologic, renal, hepatic and metabolic function Negative pregnancy test within 72 hours before randomization (for women of childbearing potential only) Subject or subject's legally acceptable representative has provided informed consent. Other protocolspecified criteria may apply Symptomatic brain metastases requiring treatment History of another primary cancer within 5 years of randomization Prior antiepidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody therapy (eg, panitumumab or cetuximab) or treatment with small molecule EGFR inhibitors (eg, gefitinib, erlotinib, lapatinib) Antitumor therapy (eg, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, antibody therapy) within 21 days before randomization Radiotherapy within 14 days before randomization. Exclusion Criteria for corrected QT (QTc) Evaluation Subpart of the Study: Prolongation of QT/QTc interval &gt; 450 milliseconds at screening Other protocolspecified criteria may apply</criteria>
