	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate potential metabolic effects of resveratrol in men with metabolic syndrome(otherwise healthy). The investigators hypothesize that resveratrol has an anti-inflammatory effect, and will increase insulin sensitivity, change the fat- and sugar-metabolism, and down-regulate bone-turnover.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study will be done in a collaboration between two PhD students, who focus on effects in adipose- and muscle- tissue, and bone tissue respectively. The investigators will look at changes in - inflammation-markers - biochemical markers of fat- and sugar-metabolism - gene-expression in fat- and muscle-tissue - body composition (DXA (whole body) and MR spectroscopy) - biochemical markers of bone-metabolism - Bone Mineral Density (DXA scans) - bone structure (QCT) - gene-expression and cytokines in bone marrow Some of the volunteers will have their insulin sensitivity measured.</detailed_description>
