	<brief_title>XParTS: Capecitabine/Cisplatin(XP) for Recurrent Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>S-1/Cisplatin (SP) is one of the standard treatments of advanced gastric cancer. However, evidence of SP on gastric cancer recurrence after adjuvant therapy by the same drug (S-1) is not established. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Capecitabine/Cisplatin (XP) for gastric cancer patients who relapsed after adjuvant chemotherapy by S-1.</detailed_description>
