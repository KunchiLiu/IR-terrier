	<brief_summary>The "All-inside" method is a new minimally invasive procedure for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL). It consists of incomplete bone tunnels drilling and cortical fixation. In the so-called "classical" method, the fixation is achieved with interference screws. The hypothesis of this study was that the "All-inside" technique causes less pain than the conventional technique. The main objective was to evaluate the immediate postoperative pain for the first ten days and at one month from the intervention.</brief_summary>
