	<brief_summary>Obesity affects millions of American children and increases their risk of adult obesity, a myriad of serious illnesses, increased healthcare costs, and premature death. It is vital to find ways to reverse this epidemic. Multidisciplinary behavioral weight management programs offer the promise of effectively treating childhood obesity. However, participants in such programs often find it challenging to follow recommended treatment plans and frequently drop out from programs without completing them. The proposed project aims to address these problems through frequent contact with patients between office visits. This interim contact will be achieved by automatically sending tailored messages to the mobile phones of adolescents enrolled in a multidisciplinary weight management program (the MPOWER program), as an adjunct to clinic visits. The investigators hypothesize that program participants who receive the tailored text messages will experience lower attrition rates, increased treatment adherence, and greater weight loss compared to those program participants who do not receive the messages.</brief_summary>
