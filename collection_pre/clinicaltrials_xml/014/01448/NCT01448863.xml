	<brief_summary>The present study aims to elucidate if there is a metabolomic profile alteration in the embryos of obese women in order to understand if the reduced implantation rate observed in these patients is directly related to this factor. Furthermore, the investigators seek to establish if there is any difference between obese women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCO) and without PCO. The investigators compare these metabolomic profile embryos with embryos of egg-donation programme.</brief_summary>
