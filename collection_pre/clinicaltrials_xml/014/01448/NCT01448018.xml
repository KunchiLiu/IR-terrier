	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare ranibizumab injection to hemodilution at the early phase of Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO) and to determine if the combination of both treatments may have a synergic effect.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hemodilution Versus Ranibizumab in Early-onset Central Retinal Vein Occlusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with recent-onset CRVO (lasting for less than 1 month)are randomly assigned to one of 3 groups: hemodilution using erythrocytapheresis alone, 3 monthly injection of ranibizumab alone, or both. Patients are followed monthly during the 6-month study.</detailed_description>
