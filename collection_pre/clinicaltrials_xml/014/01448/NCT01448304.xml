Use of a medication or nutraceutical in order to alter serum lipids within 4 weeks prior to screening (Day 21 to 2), including but not limited to statins, ezetimibe, fibrates, niacin, or omega3 fatty acids, bile acid resins. Fasting serum triglycerides &gt;200 mg/dL measured after an 8 to 12 hour fast. History of a hypersensitivity reaction to doxycycline or similar compound.
