	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of MEDI8968 in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A Phase 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of MEDI8968 in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. The study will have a screening phase of 23 days, treatment phase from Week 1 to 53 and follow-up phase from Week 53 to 69. Participants will receive either MEDI8968 600 milligram (mg) as intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 1 followed by 300 mg injection subcutaneously (SC) every 4 weeks up to Week 53 or matching placebo in the same fashion. Participants will primarily be assessed for incidence rate of moderate or severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). Safety will be monitored throughout the study.</detailed_description>
