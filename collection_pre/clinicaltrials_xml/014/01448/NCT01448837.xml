	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this crossover 24-hour Intraocular Pressure (IOP) trial is to compare the control obtained after 3 months of therapy with the bimatoprost/timolol fixed combination (BTFC, Ganfort) given once in the evening (20:00) versus latanoprost (Xalatan) administered once in the evening (20:00) in newly-diagnosed patients with exfoliation syndrome (XFS) and ocular hypertension, or exfoliative glaucoma (XFG) previously untreated and IOP greater than 29 mm Hg.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient has exfoliation syndrome with ocular hypertension, or exfoliative glaucoma and is older than 29 years Patient is newly diagnosed, or currently untreated and exhibits untreated morning IOP (2 separate IOP readings at 10:00)greater than 29 mm Hg in the study eye Study patients should have mild to moderate exfoliative glaucoma (VF loss &lt;12 dB; cupping 0.8 or less) Patient with exfoliation syndrome should fulfill the IOP criterion (IOP &gt; 29 mm Hg at 10:00) Patient deemed by investigator to require significant IOP reduction to obtain desired target IOP Patient agrees to be treated for at least 3 months with latanoprost and bimatoprost/timolol fixed combination drops dosed in the evening In study eye distance best corrected Snelen visual acuity greater than 1/10 Contraindications to therapy with latanoprost, bimatoprost, or Î²blockers History of nonadherence or previously recorded evidence of lack of response (&lt;10% morning IOP reduction) to any antiglaucoma medication Patient can not understand the instructions and adhere to medications Patient is a female of childbearing potential or lactating mother Past history of trauma, inflammation, surgery, past use of steroids (within 2 months), severe dry eyes and use of contact lenses Signs of ocular infection, except blepharitis, or corneal abnormality that may affect IOP measurements The other eye can not receive the same therapy, or remain without medical therapy Closed angles</criteria>
