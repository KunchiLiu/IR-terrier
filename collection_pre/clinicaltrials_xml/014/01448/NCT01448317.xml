	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To assess the safety and tolerability of ascending single doses of subcutaneously (SC) administered alirocumab (SAR236553/REGN727) in Japanese healthy male subjects. Secondary Objectives: - To assess the pharmacodynamics effect of a single SC dose of alirocumab on serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and other lipids and apolipoproteins such as total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, Triglycerides, Apolipoprotein B, Apolipoprotein A1 and Lipoprotein(a). - To assess the Pharmacokinetic profile of a single SC dose of alirocumab. - To assess the immunogenicity of a single SC dose of alirocumab.</brief_summary>
