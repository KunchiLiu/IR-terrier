	<brief_title>Arthrodesis Versus Extra-articular Plate Fixation in Lisfranc Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We want to compare arthrodesis of TMT 1 to temporary bridge plating of TMT 1 in acute Lisfranc injuries where at least tarsometatarsal joints 1-3 are involved. We preform arthrodesis of TMT 2 and 3 in both groups.</detailed_description>
