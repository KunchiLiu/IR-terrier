	<brief_summary>Vitrification is a method of cryopreserving tissue for future use. It is widely used to preserve extra, good quality embryos generated from infertility treatments. It is becoming popular for the preservation of oocytes (eggs) as well, but is still considered investigational in this respect. The purpose of this study is to provide egg freezing for patients desiring fertility preservation. Although commonly used in clinics around the world, it should be offered as an IRB approved study procedure until it is no longer considered investigational by the American Society of Reproductive Medicine.</brief_summary>
