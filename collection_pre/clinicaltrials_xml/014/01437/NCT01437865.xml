	<brief_summary>The aim of this pilot-study is to examine the accuracy of gadofosveset enhanced MRI compared to current nodal staging methods. The accuracy of MRL will be determined on the basis of a node-to-node matching of imaged nodes to the definitive histopathology. The pathologic examination of the SNLB or ALND will be regarded as the golden standard for nodal involvement.</brief_summary>
