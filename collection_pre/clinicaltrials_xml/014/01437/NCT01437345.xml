	<brief_summary>This study is an observational study that aims to advance our knowledge on infantile onset FSHD. The study will include 50 participants of all ages who have presented with symptoms of FSHD between birth and 10 years of age. Study participation will involve a single day of assessments at one of the participating CINRG centers (to include physical exam, cognitive testing, eye exam, hearing test, strength testing and speech evaluations). The procedures may be split over additional days for scheduling purposes.</brief_summary>
