	<brief_summary>HBV vaccination is of paramount importance among HIV positive persons due to an increased risk of infection and disease progression. The most widely used ENGERIX B vaccine reaches a lower rate of vaccination (20-70%) among HIV positive vaccinees (compared to over 90% in the normal population). Sci-B-Vac is novel vaccine containing 3 antigens and is therefore more immunogenic (as opposed to one in ENGERIX B). Its use has been associated with higher and more rapid vaccination rates. Therefore, it has a theoretical advantage in HIV positive individuals.</brief_summary>
