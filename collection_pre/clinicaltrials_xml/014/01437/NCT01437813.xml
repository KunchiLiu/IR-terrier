	<brief_summary>Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of food intake in bioavailability (BA) of the combination Glimepiride/ extended release Metformin GLI/METXR (4/850mg) in healthy Mexican volunteers. Methods: A prospective, longitudinal, open label, non randomized study, was performed. A single oral dose of GLI/METXR (4/850 mg)was administered to 24 health Mexican volunteers 30 min after a high fat meal. Blood samples were collected before the administration and 0.33, 0.67, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6.7, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24 and 30 hours post-administration. Plasma concentration of the drug was measured by using HPLC. Plasma concentration of botk drugs were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Plasma concentration time curves were plotted for each volunteers, and pharmacokinetic parameters (PK) were calculated. Adverse events were determined using clinical and laboratory test results throughout the study.</brief_summary>
