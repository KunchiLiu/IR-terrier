	<brief_summary>Specific proteins and other signaling molecules are increased and decreased following nerve injury. Some of these are important in producing pain or explaining why pain persists after traumatic nerve injuries or in disease states such as diabetes. In this study, the investigators hypothesize that it is possible to detect changes in specific signaling molecules and that these will provide insights into novel treatment strategies. The patients to be included are those who are undergoing the removal of tissue during surgery. The tissues that would otherwise be discarded will be included in the study as appropriate.</brief_summary>
