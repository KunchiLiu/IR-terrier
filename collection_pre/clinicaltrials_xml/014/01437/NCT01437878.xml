	<brief_summary>This is a phase 2, Multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effects of inhaled Iloprost in patients with pulmonary hypertension secondary to COPD. The main objective is to investigate the effect of iloprost on exercise endurance time during constant work rate cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Other efficacy and safety endpoints will additionally be analyzed.</brief_summary>
