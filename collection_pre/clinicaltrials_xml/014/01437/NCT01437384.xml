	<brief_summary>36 healthy adult men and women will be enrolled with the goal of having 24 subjects complete the entire study. The study will consist of a pre-treatment phase and a treatment phase. The pre-treatment phase will include screening and baseline period 1. The treatment phase consists of 4 treatment period: Treatment Period 1 - administration of the first E5501 oral dose; Treatment Period 2 - administration of verapamil and the second E5501 oral dose; Treatment Period 3 - administration of the third E5501 dose; Treatment Period 4 - concomitant administration of cyclosporine and the fourth E5501 dose. A baseline period will precede each treatment period. The screening period will be up to 13 days in duration. After fulfilling screening requirements, subjects will check into the clinic on Day -1 for baseline assessments. They will be domiciled in the clinical testing facility for 6 days for Treatment Periods 1, 3, and 4 and will return intermittently for study procedures for 8 outpatient visits. They will be domiciled in the clinical testing facility for at least 14 days for Treatment Period 2 and will return intermittently for study procedures for 7 outpatient visits.</brief_summary>
