	<brief_summary>The etiology of bladder pain syndrome is unknown. Therefore the management is directed to pain relief, as bladder pain is believed to drive both voiding frequency and nocturia. Botulinum toxin A has been shown to decrease noxious input. Several studies showed efficacy of botox for treatment of painful bladder. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Botulinum toxin in patients who are suffering bladder pain syndrome with Hunner lesions during cystoscopy.</brief_summary>
