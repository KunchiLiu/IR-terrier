	<brief_summary>Patients who have had a thyroidectomy for cancer routinely have a Tc-99m Pertechnetate [GPERT] scan at the Cross Cancer Institute to check for thyroid tissue remnants prior to radioactive iodine therapy. The first 10 subjects will receive one CPTERT [cyclotron made] Tc-99m Pertechnetate scan after surgery. Vital signs and blood work, pre-injection and post-imaging will be done. The second group of 20 subjects (2 for each CPERT subject) will be matched as to age and gender and have a GPERT scan for qualitative comparison.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Phase I Study of Cyclotron-produced Tc-99m Pertechnetate (CPERT) in Patients With Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Canadian Government supports R&amp;D into alternative methods of medical isotope production that [1] do not require the construction of new nuclear reactors, [2] are not dependent on government subsidies and [3] will lead to a RP market. The cyclotron production model of pertechnetate (CPERT) has received significant validation. The University of Alberta's Edmonton PET Center and the ERC is a cyclotron/radiopharmacy unit, providing a safe, cost effective, unsubsidized and reliable supply of RPs.</detailed_description>
