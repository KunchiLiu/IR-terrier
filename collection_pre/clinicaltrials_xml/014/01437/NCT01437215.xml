	<criteria>Informed consent understood and signed and pt agrees to all followup visits; Abdominal aortic aneurysm with diameter ≥5cm or ≥4cm which has increased by 0.5cm or more in the past six months Adequate iliac/femoral access compatible with the required delivery systems Nonaneurysmal infrarenal aortic neck &lt;15mm in length Most caudal renal artery to aortoiliac bifurcation length at least 70mm Proximal nonaneurysmal aortic neck below the SMA with: diameter 18 to 34 mm; length at least 15 mm; angle (clock face) &lt;60° to the aneurysm sac; Angle &lt;60° (clock face) between the SMA and celiac artery Renal arteries both distal to the SMA by 035mm, within 30mm of each other axially, with 4 to 8mm lumen diameter, and with clockface angle of 90° to 210° to each other Iliac anatomy suitable for commercial bifurcated stent graft; Minimum 3cm overlap achievable between fenestrated and bifurcated stent grafts Life expectancy &lt;1 year as judged by the investigator; Psychiatric or other condition that may interfere with the study; Participating in the enrollment or 30day followup phase of another clinical study; Known allergy to any device component; Coagulopathy or uncontrolled bleeding disorder; Contraindication to contrast media or anticoagulants; Ruptured, leaking, dissecting, or mycotic aneurysm; Serum creatinine (SCr) level &gt;2.0 mg/dL; Traumatic vascular injury; Active systemic or localized groin infection; Connective tissue disease (e.g., Marfan's Syndrome); Recent (within prior three months) cerebrovascular accident or myocardial infarction; Prior renal transplant; Length of either renal artery to be stented &lt;13mm; Significant occlusive disease or calcification of either renal artery; An essential accessory renal artery; Indispensable inferior mesenteric artery; Untreated aneurysmal disease of the descending thoracic aorta; Clinically significant mural thrombus circumferentially in the suprarenal segment; Prior iliac artery stent implanted that may interfere with delivery system introduction; Unsuitable vascular anatomy Pregnancy (female patient of childbearing potential only)</criteria>
