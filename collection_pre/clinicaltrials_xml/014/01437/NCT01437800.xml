	<brief_summary>Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the oral bioavailability of the combination Glimepiride/ extended release Metformin (GLI/METXR) (4/850mg) in healthy Mexican volunteers. Methods: A prospective, longitudinal, open label, non randomized study, was performed, 24 volunteers were administrated with a single oral dose of GLI/METXR (4/850 mg). Blood samples were collected over 30 hours. Plasma concentration of both drugs were measured by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Plasma concentration-time curves were plotted for each volunteer, and pharmacokinetic parameters (PK) were calculated. Adverse events were determined using clinical and laboratory test results, throughout the study.</brief_summary>
