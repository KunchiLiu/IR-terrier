	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the virological and clinical efficacy of etravirine plus 2 active nucleos(t)ide reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in HIV-infected patients. Additionally, the safety of these regimens, specially lipid profiles, will be assessed.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Etravirine Plus 2 Analogs in HIV-infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods: prospective, single arm multicenter clinical trial without entry restrictions on plasma HIV-RNA (VL) or CD4 with a planned duration of 52 weeks. The primary clinical endpoint is the percentage of subjects with therapeutic success on etravirine 400 mg/day (200 mg bid or 400 mg qd) plus 2 active NRTIs after 12 months. Efficacy data will be analyzed by on-treatment and by intention-to-treat analyses (noncomplete/missing equals failure), considering treatment failure as either treatment interruption whatever the reason (adverse events, death, or loss to follow-up) or virological failure, defined as inability to suppress the VL to less than 50 copies/ml after 24 weeks on treatment or a confirmed VL of more than 200 copies/ml in patients who had previously achieved a viral suppression or had an undetectable viral load at inclusion. Patients missing two consecutive scheduled visits were considered lost to follow-up. The safety and tolerability of the studied medications will be evaluated by means of clinical adverse events, physical examination and laboratory results. NRTIs prescribed as part of HAART were selected by the responsible physicians on the basis of previous antiretroviral treatments and/or genotypic resistance testing.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Older than 18 years, starting an antiretroviral regimen based on etravirine plus 2 NRTIs between January 2009 and June 2010, evidence of activity of all drugs on the basis of treatment history and genotypic resistance testing, informed consent, and at least one followup visit. Genotypic resistance tests with evidence of resistance to any drug used, and concomitant use of drugs with potentially adverse interactions with etravirine pharmacokinetics, such as rifampin.</criteria>
