	<brief_summary>Since the duration of most studies with IV iron in IBD subjects have been only 4-12 weeks studies there is a need to follow-up on long term safety and efficacy of any maintenance iron therapy. This study represents subjects from the Lead-in Study (P-Monofer-IBD-01) on iron isomaltoside 1000 (Monofer®) to assess the long term safety of iron isomaltoside 1000 (Monofer®) and its ability to maintain stable haemoglobin in IBD subjects with Iron Deficiency Anaemia (IDA).</brief_summary>
