	<brief_summary>Study aims to: (1) evaluate the role of morphological and physiological characteristics of the pelvic floor, pain-related psychological and -psychophysical variables in prediction of the success of myofascial physical therapy (MPT) for the treatment of painful bladder syndrome Patients with clinical symptoms of PBS will undergo physical examination, sensory testing in the genital area, perineal ultrasound examination for the evaluation of the length of the levator muscles before MPT and following 10 consecutive sessions of MPT. Improvement in clinical symptoms will be assessed and evaluated for correlations with psychophysical examinations.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identifying Predictors of Treatment Success in Painful Bladder Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) is highly prevalent, yet its etiology and the treatment approach are not clear. Painful bladder syndrome (PBS), a subtype of CPPS, is commonly treated by Myofascial physical therapy (MPT), however its efficiency is limited to portion of patients. The relative contribution of local factors such as pelvic anatomical and physiological function compared with systemic pain- related psychological and psychophysical parameters in the prediction of MPT outcome has not been illumined yet. Hypothesis and aims: Assuming that MPT has mainly local effect its treatment success can be predicted by local impairment of pelvic anatomical and physiological function assessed pretreatment. Study aims to: (1) evaluate the role of morphological and physiological characteristics of the pelvic floor, pain-related psychological and -psychophysical variables in prediction of MPT success, (2) to assess the effect of MPT on these parameters. Methods: PBS patients will be evaluated for symptoms severity prior to MPT by: (1) pelvic physical examination for identification of trigger points, (2) self-report of pelvic pain intensity on visual analogue scale (VAS), (3) filling a questionnaire for urinary urgency symptoms, (4) evaluation of morphological and physiological characters of pelvic muscles floor by ultrasound and Doppler, respectively, (5) assessment of pain-related psychological variables (depression, somatization and pain catastrophizing) by questionnaires, and (6) psychophysical tests of experimental pain perception. Following 3 months treatment of MPT, patients will be reevaluated for the same tests. Treatment success will be determined by 30% reduction in pain and urinary urgency. Expected results: Patients with shorter levator muscles and reduced blood flow in the pelvic region will benefit from MPT compared to patients with augmented pain sensitivity and higher depression, pain catastrophizing and somatization scores. MPT will elongate levator muscles and increased blood flow to the pelvic region that will be associated with the improvement in PBS symptoms. Importance: The significance of the proposed study stems from its potential to extend conceptualizing of mechanisms associated with PBS and its treatment success.</detailed_description>
