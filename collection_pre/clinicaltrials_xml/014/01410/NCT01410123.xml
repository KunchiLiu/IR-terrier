	<brief_summary>The study is a series of 3 linked randomized clinical trials of 6 month duration, with a total of 12 month follow-up, to evaluate the effect of Integrated Stepped Care on drinking outcomes and HIV biologic markers (including VACS index) in HIV-infected patients with unhealthy alcohol use.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Integrated Stepped Care for Unhealthy Alcohol Use in HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Unhealthy alcohol use threatens the health benefits seen with antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV-infected (HIV+) patients. Although research has demonstrated the efficacy of brief interventions, motivational counseling, and medications to treat unhealthy alcohol use in HIV uninfected patients, there is limited research or use of these treatments in HIV+ patients. We have demonstrated that integrated treatment of addiction in HIV clinics is feasible. Stepped care algorithms can facilitate the evaluation of varying intensities of treatments for unhealthy alcohol use. The proposed study will compare onsite Integrated Stepped Care treatment (ISC) to treatment as usual (TAU) in three, linked, 6-month randomized clinical trials in 642 HIV+ patients with unhealthy alcohol use. Screened patients are randomized to ISC or TAU after determining that they meet criteria for either 1) at-risk drinking, 2) alcohol abuse or dependence or 3) moderate alcohol consumption in the presence of liver disease. ISC and TAU are tailored to the drinking category. ISC for at-risk drinkers and those with Moderate Alcohol use and Liver Disease begins with a brief intervention and is stepped up to Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET) in those who meet predefined failure criteria. ISC for abuse or dependence begins with addiction physician management (APM) including alcohol pharmacotherapy if not contraindicated. APM is stepped up to include MET if predefined failure criteria are met. The study will test the hypothesis that ISC leads to decreased alcohol consumption and improved HIV biomarkers. Data analyses will be conducted on the intention to treat sample.</detailed_description>
