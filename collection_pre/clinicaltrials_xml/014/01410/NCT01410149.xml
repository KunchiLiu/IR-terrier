	<brief_summary>Patients requiring mechanical ventilation in the ICU will undergo three consecutive nights of polysomnography to record sleep patterns while receiving three modes of mechanical ventilation; Proportional assist ventilation (PAV), Pressure support ventilation (PSV), Assist control ventilation (ACV), applied in random order. The purpose is to determine the effect of mode of mechanical ventilation on patient-ventilator asynchrony and sleep quality.</brief_summary>
