	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for SAR245409 when administered in combination with rituximab or bendamustine plus rituximab Secondary Objectives: - To determine the safety and tolerability of SAR245409 in combination with rituximab or bendamustine plus rituximab in subjects with indolent Hon-Hodgkin Lymphoma (iNHL) Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) or Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) - To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of SAR245409, bendamustine and rituximab when used in combination in subjects with iNHL, MCL or CLL - To determine the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of SAR245409 in combination with rituximab or bendamustine plus rituximab in subjects with iNHL, MCL or CLL - To determine the antitumor activity of SAR245409 in combination with rituximab or bendamustine plus rituximab in subjects with iNHL, MCL or CLL</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Combining SAR245409 With Rituximab or Bendamustine Plus Rituximab in Patients With Indolent Lymphoma, Mantle Cell Lymphoma and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All subjects will take SAR245409 twice daily. All subjects will receive SAR245409 as long as there is clinical benefit. Combination therapy with SAR245409, bendamustine and rituximab , will be administered over a 28 day cycle for up to 6 to 8 cycles. Subjects receiving the doublet combination , SAR245409 plus rituximab will receive weekly rituximab for 4 - 8 weeks. Monthly Rituximab may be continued beyond 8 weeks.</detailed_description>
