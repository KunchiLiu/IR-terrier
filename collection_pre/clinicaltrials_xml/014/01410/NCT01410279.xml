	<brief_title>Inspiratory Muscle Training in Pulmonary Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a syndrome, in the case of hemodynamic alteration of a number of diseases and processes, such as the progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance, right heart failure and early death. Frequently patients with PH have reduced functional capacity, quality of life and survival. It was demonstrated recently that patients with HP also have inspiratory muscle weakness, possibly further increase the fatigue and dyspnea during exercise. To meet this need, inspiratory muscle training can lead to significant improvement in respiratory muscle strength, exercise tolerance and dyspnea, thus resulting in reduction of discomfort during activities of daily living, increase in exercise capacity and improved quality of life in different situations.</detailed_description>
