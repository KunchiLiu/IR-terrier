	<brief_title>Evaluation of Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Quality of Life in Patients With Sphincter of Oddi Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sphincter of Oddi is a complex muscular structure which regulates the biliary and pancreatic outflow into the duodenum. Resting pressures &gt;40mm of Hg are considered abnormal. Individuals with elevated resting/basal biliary or pancreatic sphincter pressures are thought to have sphincter of oddi dysfunction. Sphincter dysfunction often manifests as pain and the nature of the pain is dependent on the involvement of either the biliary or the pancreatic sphincter. In most instances the pain is debilitating and could impair the quality of life. Endoscopic therapy- either biliary or pancreatic sphincterotomy, is often performed for relief of symptoms. Data regarding the efficacy of such an approach are limited. A recent systematic review by the Cochrane reviewers has found only two randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of sphincterotomy for relief of symptoms in those with sphincter of Oddi dysfunction and there were no data evaluating the quality of life or the health economics of such an approach.</detailed_description>
