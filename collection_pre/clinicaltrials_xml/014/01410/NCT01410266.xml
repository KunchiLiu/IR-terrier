	<brief_title>Reducing the Need for In-Clinic Follow-Up for Medical Abortion in Moldova and Uzbekistan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Medical abortion using mifepristone and misoprostol is a highly effective procedure, but access to it may be impeded by the fact that not all women can afford or want to return for a follow-up visit. This often results in a high loss to follow-up rate. Additionally, with medical abortions of those women who do return for follow-up, higher costs are borne by both the woman and the healthcare system. This study compares two methods of follow-up after medical abortion: standard of care versus alternative follow-up. The former involves a routine clinic visit two weeks after misoprostol administration. The latter consists of a low-sensitivity pregnancy test and a self-administered questionnaire. Based on the results of the test and questionnaire, women may be flagged as needing in-clinic follow-up or discharged from the study if their abortion is complete.</detailed_description>
