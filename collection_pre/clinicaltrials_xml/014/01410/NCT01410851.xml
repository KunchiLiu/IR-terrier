	<brief_summary>Pulses have the potential to be positioned as a food for body weight and metabolic control based on their composition, effects on rate of digestion and absorption of fat and carbohydrates, and effects on satiety. However, the role of individual pulses incorporated into a mixed meal on regulation of food intake, satiety and glycaemic control remains unclear. Therefore, the objective of our study was to determine the effects of ad libitum consumption of pulse meals (treatments) on food intake at an ad libitum pulse meal, food intake at an ad libitum pizza meal at four hours, subjective appetite and blood glucose.</brief_summary>
