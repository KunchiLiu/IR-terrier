	<brief_summary>Renal and kidney pancreas transplant patients will be randomized to once daily Advagraf or twice daily Prograf to assess changes in tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil exposure, renal allograft function, other relevant biochemical parameters and treatment related adverse effects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Advagraf/Prograf Conversion Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<mesh_term>Tacrolimus</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Renal transplant or Renal Pancreas patients who are &gt; 12 months post transplant Stable allograft function defined as eGFR &gt; 3060ml/min Renal patients who have a stable tacrolimus trough level of 58ng/ml in prior 3 months; Renal pancreas patients who have a stable tacrolimus trough level of 310 mg/ml in prior 3 months Receiving concomitant therapy with mycophenolate mofetil in a dose of 5001000mg bid or equivalent Any surgical or medical condition, which in the opinion of the investigator, may place the patient at higher risk from his/her participation in the study, or is likely to prevent the patient from complying with the requirements of the study or completing the study. History of malignancy of any organ system, treated or untreated, within the past 5 years whether or not there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases, with the exception of localized basal cell carcinoma of the skin. Treated rejection within 3 months of randomization. Increased serum creatinine &gt; 20% within 3 months of randomization. Subject is pregnant or breastfeeding Subject has significant comorbid disease (eg. Malignancy or uncontrolled infection) or disability (e.g. cognitive deficit) which prevents understanding of, or adherence to, the protocol</criteria>
