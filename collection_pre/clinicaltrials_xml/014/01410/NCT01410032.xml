	<brief_title>Reconstruction Plate Compared With Flexible Intramedullary Nailing for Midshaft Clavicular Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Midshaft clavicular fractures are classically treated with non-surgical methods, supported by many authors as an effective treatment. However, different researches have shown high rates of nonunion and clavicle malunion related to the nonoperative treatment. Currently, indications for surgical treatment are wider and include mainly the following: shortening greater than or equal to 2.0 cm, multiple trauma, open fractures or with imminent exposure and associated neurovascular injury. Plate fixation of midshaft clavicular fractures is widely described in the literature, and is considered the gold standard by different authors, associated with a high union rate and a low complication rate. Different types of plates have been used, including reconstruction plates, dynamic compression plates (DCP), low-contact dynamic compression plates (LC-DCP), semi-tubular plates, and pre-molded locking plates. Possible complications are postoperative infection, hardware loosening or failure, peri-incision paresthesia, neurovascular iatrogenic lesions, nonunion, and hardware related symptoms. Elastic stable intramedullary nailing (ESIN) technique has been used in recent years in the treatment of midshaft clavicular fractures. Different studies report excellent functional results and low complication rates. Some theoretical advantages in relation to plates are the 3-point flexible nail support, which provides superior biomechanics resistance and uses the relative stability principle, favoring callus formation. When compared to plain steel wires, titanium nails have lower migration risk, due to its greater flexibility and better bone fixation. The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical and radiographic results of patients with midshaft clavicular fractures treated with reconstruction plates or ESIN.</detailed_description>
