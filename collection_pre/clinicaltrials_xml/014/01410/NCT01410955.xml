	<brief_summary>Irinotecan is one of key drug used in the treatment of colorectal cancer. The incidence of irinotecan induced diarrhea varies between 60-90%, with severe diarrhea in 20-40%. The main cause of diarrhea is one of irinotecan metabolites, SN-38 which is in the liver glucuronidated and subsequently expelled into the intestine. Due to the bacterial enzyme beta-D-glucuronidase in intestinal lumen it is deconjugated. This form causes direct damage of intestinal mucosa associated with malabsorption and the development of diarrhea. It is known that probiotic bacteria, reduce activity of intestinal beta-D-glucuronidase and therefore these bacteria could be applied in the prevention of diarrhea in patients treated by this food supplement. Given their low toxicity, good tolerability, probiotics may be an important part of supportive therapy. This is a first study aimed to determine the effectiveness of the probiotics in the prophylaxis of irinotecan induced diarrhea due to reduction intestinal beta-D-glucuronidase activity.</brief_summary>
