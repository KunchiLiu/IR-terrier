	<brief_summary>Metabolomics is a large-scale approach to monitoring the compounds involved in cellular processes. It may reflect changes in biological function. Collection of exhaled breath is a newly developed, noninvasive method that may allow clinicians and researchers to assess biochemical profiles in the airway. This study is conducted for the metabolomic analysis of the exhaled gas in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and bronchiectasis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metabolomic Analysis of Exhaled Breath Condensates in Patients With COPD and Bronchiectasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metabolomics is a large-scale approach to monitoring as many as possible of the compounds involved in cellular processes in a single assay to derive metabolic profiles. Compared with genomics or proteomics, metabolomics reflects changes in phenotype and therefore function. Collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a newly developed, noninvasive method that may allow clinicians and researchers to assess biochemical profiles in the alveolar lining fluid. The aims of this study are: (1)Collecting and metabolomic profiling of the EBCs from patients with COPD/bronchiectasis; (2) Comparing the profiles of these patients obtained during stable and acute exacerbation periods; (3) Comparing the profiles of these patients with and without Pseudomonas colonization/infection; (4) Correlation of EBC metabolomic profiles with clinical phenotypes, severity and outcomes of these patients.</detailed_description>
