	<brief_summary>This study is designed to assess the pathophysiology of ST by studying the main procedural and anatomical factors involved in the genesis of ST such as those related to stent and the vascular wall, as well as to the individual platelet residual reactivity.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>previous PCI with bare metal stent (BMS) or drug eluting stent (DES) and a definite subacute coronary ST previous PCI with DES and a definite late or very late coronary ST Development of ST within 72 hours of stent implantation (acute and early subacute ST). Late and very late ST of BMS. Absence of informed consent. Age less than 18 years. Creatinine values greater than 2.5 g/dl (this is to avoid the negative effects related to the contrast medium necessary to perform the OCT evaluation).</criteria>
