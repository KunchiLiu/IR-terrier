	<brief_summary>This project is a randomized trial to determine if motivational interviewing (MI) is an effective intervention to help women in abusive intimate relationships. The study objective is to motivate abused women to identify and achieve their own specific goals that can help them address the violence in their lives. This project will be integrated into the setting of a busy family planning clinic in the mid-western United States, which serves a largely rural population. Intimate partner violence (IPV) is screened using the Women's Experience with Battering Scale (WEB), a modified Abuse Assessment Screen (AAS), and the Danger Assessment Screen (DAS). An expected 250 women who screen positive for IPV will be enrolled, randomized to the intervention or to usual care group, and complete the 6-month study protocol. All subjects complete a self-administered computer-based questionnaire at the initial and 6-month follow up visits to measure self-efficacy (primary outcome), stage of readiness to change, selected IPV-related health correlates (e.g., depression), and steps taken and resources used. The MI intervention is an "active listening" counseling technique aimed at guiding the patient towards identifying feasible, personalized goals and steps she can take to increase her self-efficacy and control in the relationship. The trained study interviewer will work with participants to identify steps they can safely take and local resources to help them meet their goals. The MI protocol consists of a face-to-face counseling session at baseline with follow-up telephone interviews conducted at 1-, 2-, and 4-months post-intervention to reinforce the intervention and assess the participants' level safety. The control group will receive usual care, which includes talking with a Level 3 Domestic Violence Advocate and receiving a comprehensive list of domestic violence resources. Effectiveness of the MI intervention will be determined by increased self-efficacy, measured by the Domestic Violence Coping and Self-Efficacy Scale, a validated tool for use among women with a recent history of domestic abuse; and by a reduction in depressive symptoms (CESD-10). The impact of the intervention will be assessed by an increase in participants' readiness-to-change, and extent of their involvement in a wide variety of self-help and coping activities over the follow-up period. If successful, this screening and intervention program will be translated to other clinical settings.</brief_summary>
