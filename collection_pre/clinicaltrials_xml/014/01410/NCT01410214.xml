	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the effect and safety of erlotinib versus NVB plus cisplatin (NP) as adjuvant treatment in patients with stage IIIA NSCLC after complete resection with EGFR activating mutations and to explore a new treatment strategy for this subset.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib Versus Vinorelbine/Cisplatin as Adjuvant Treatment in Stage IIIA NSCLC Patients With EGFR Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The LACE meta-analysis identified four cycles of platinum-based program to improve II~IIIA stage completely resected NSCLC pts the role of 5-year survival, but its treatment-related life threatening toxicity limits its use. The EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) may provide a dramatic response in pts with pulmonary adenocarcinoma carrying EGFR activating mutations in the metastatic setting. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of erlotinib versus NVB plus cisplatin (NP) as adjuvant treatment in pts with stage IIIA NSCLC after Complete Resection with EGFR activating mutations and to explore a new treatment strategy for this subset.</detailed_description>

All female Patients, except those who are postmenopausal or surgically sterilized, must have a negative prestudy serum or urine pregnancy test. . Patients with prior exposure to agents directed at the HER axis (e.g. erlotinib, gefitinib, cetuximab, trastuzumab). Patients with prior chemotherapy or therapy with systemic antitumour therapy. Patients with prior radiotherapy. History of another malignancy in the last 5 years with the exception of the following:Cured basal cell carcinoma of the skin and cured in situ carcinoma of the uterine cervix are permitted. Any evidence confirmed tumor recurrence before adjuvant treatment. Any unstable systemic disease (including active infection, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within the previous year, serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication, hepatic, renal, or metabolic disease). Any evidence of clinically active interstitial lung disease. Eye inflammation or eye infection not fully treated or conditions predisposing the subject to this. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Known hypersensitivity to Tarceva or NVB or cisplatin. Pregnancy or breastfeeding women. ECOG performance status ≥ 2. Ingredients mixed with small cell lung cancer patients Evidence of any other disease, neurological or metabolic dysfunction, physical examination or laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicated the use of an investigational drug or puts the subject at high risk for treatmentrelated complications.</criteria>
