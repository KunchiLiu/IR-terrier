	<brief_summary>ISIS- ICD study has been designed to evaluate the impact of PARAD+ algorithm on inappropriate shocks, in a general population implanted for primary or secondary prevention with a dual or tri chamber device at one year follow-up</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inappropriate Shock Reduction wIth PARAD+ Rhythm DiScrimination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary endpoint is to demonstrate that 95% of patients implanted with PARAD+ algorithm are free from inapproporiate shock compared to 92.5% in general ICD population.</detailed_description>
