	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to understand if small proteins found on the surface of myeloma cells (called CXCR4 and CD47) or inside the myeloma cells (Pim kinases, sphingolipids, and pS6) can predict how patients will respond to chemotherapy-treatment and if a small molecule inside the myeloma cells (called Pim kinase) can be used as a treatment target for myeloma. A sample from the bone marrow biopsy (a small amount of tissue removed from the body for laboratory testing) and aspirate (a small amount of fluid is removed from the body for laboratory testing) that had been done before the subject entered this study will be provided for research purposes. Based on preliminary data, it is hypothesized that CXCR4, CD47, sphingolipids, and Pim kinases could be used as prognostic/predictive markers and that Pim kinase inhibitors provide a new agent for the treatment of multiple myeloma.</brief_summary>
