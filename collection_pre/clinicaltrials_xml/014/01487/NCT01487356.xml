	<brief_summary>Colonoscopy withdrawal times are a critical element in determining quality of colonoscopy; however, few studies have evaluated specific factors that may influence the duration of withdrawal, and specifically short withdrawal times. Other factors affecting polyp detection rate, one element of quality of colonoscopy, also need further study. By collecting data on hundreds of colonoscopies performed by 9 endoscopists, our goal was to identify factors associated with withdrawal time, inappropriately short withdrawal times, and polyp detection rate during colonoscopy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Factors Associated With Short Withdrawal Time and Polyp Detection Rate During Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Colonoscopy withdrawal times are a critical element in determining quality of colonoscopy; however, few studies have evaluated specific factors that may influence the duration of withdrawal, and specifically short withdrawal times. Other factors affecting polyp detection rate, one element of quality of colonoscopy, also need further study. Objective: To identify factors associated with withdrawal time, inappropriately short withdrawal times, and polyp detection rate during colonoscopy. Design: Data were prospectively collected (05/08-06/09) on 802 colonoscopies conducted by 9 blinded endoscopists, including patient age and sex, indication, colonoscope insertion and withdrawal time, biopsies performed, number/size of polyps and method of resection, bowel preparation quality, time of day, day of week, endoscopist, position of the procedure within the endoscopist's slate, and call status of the endoscopist. Setting: This study was conducted at a single tertiary care hospital, St. Paul's Hospital, in Vancouver, British Columbia.</detailed_description>
