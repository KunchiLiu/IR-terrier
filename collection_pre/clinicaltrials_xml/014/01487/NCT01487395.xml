	<brief_summary>The early assessment of new drugs for Alzheimer's disease remains difficult because of the lack of predictive end-point. The use of a battery including different parameters could improve this early development of new drugs. Nevertheless, the interest of such a battery should previously be validated with the yet marketed AD drugs</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim of the present study is to test the effect of a 15-day treatment with donepezil on a mixed battery associating cognitive assessment, imaging and neurophysiological tests in healthy volunteers. This multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study is double-blind controlled and is conducted in 3 centers located in France (Lille, Marseille and Toulouse). 18-30 years old, healthy volunteers, without any neurological or psychiatric impairment, will complete 2 test sessions in a randomized order: one with a 15-day treatment with donepezil, the other with placebo, and will be submitted to a mixed battery during the 14th and 15th day of the treatment. The primary outcome of the study will be based on cognitive assessment, imaging parameters and neurophysiological parameters.</detailed_description>
