	<brief_summary>Lung cancer is the leading cause of death in the world. Overall 5-year survival rate is fewer than 10% and the effectiveness of conventional chemotherapy is limited. The new knowledge shows the correlation between genetic alteration and effective of chemotherapy. Therefore non-surgical modalities to obtain tumor specimens for genetic alteration analysis are particularly critical in lung cancer, since many patients have advanced disease at the time of first presentation, and are therefore not eligible for radical surgery. Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) samples obtained during diagnosis of lung cancer can be used for molecular analysis that will predict response to treatment and prognosis. In this study, we will detect specific target molecules related to the effectiveness of treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) and prognosis in patients with lung cancer using EBUS-TBNA samples and its combined with xenograft technology.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age 18 years or older. Patients with confirmed or suspected lung cancer who require EBUSTBNA as part of their staging investigations of the mediastinum will be considered for the trial. Patients with undiagnosed enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum suspicious for lung cancer in which a tissue diagnosis is required. Patients who are deemed on clinical grounds not to be medically fit for a bronchoscopy. Patients where there is a high clinical suspicion of lymphoma.</criteria>
