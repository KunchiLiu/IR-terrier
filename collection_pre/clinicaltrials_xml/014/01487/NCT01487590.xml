	<brief_title>Cephalic Version by Acupuncture-Moxibustion for Breech Presentation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Monocentric controlled randomized trial in a simple blind fashion, comparing acupuncture-moxibustion versus a placebo in singleton pregnancies with breech presentation between 33+5 to 35+5 weeks of gestation. The intervention arm consists of acupuncture-moxibustion at the BL67 acupuncture point, for six seances of twenty minutes two days apart. In the placebo group, the cold light of an inactivated laser is to be applied in the same point during the same time. When cephalic version fail, a manual external cephalic version is to be proposed. The main outcome measure is cephalic presentation at 37+2 weeks of gestation.</detailed_description>
