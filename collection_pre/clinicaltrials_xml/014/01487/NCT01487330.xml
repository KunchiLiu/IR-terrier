	<brief_summary>The purpose of this first-in-human study is to assess the technical feasibility, deployment characteristics, and safety of the 23mm SJM Transfemoral Transcatheter Heart Valve and delivery system in subjects with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS). This is a single center, prospective, non-randomized, first-in-human investigational study without concurrent or matched controls.</brief_summary>
