	<brief_summary>The investigators expect to find higher levels of both classical and minor antiphospholipid (APL) antibodies among the stroke cases. Furthermore, the investigators expect to find not only classical APLA but also minor antibodies. The investigators believe that minor antibodies have a major role in the hypercoagulability state.</brief_summary>
