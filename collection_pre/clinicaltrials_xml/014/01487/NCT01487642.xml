	<brief_title>Comparison of Four Different Smoking Cessation Programmes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Smoking remains the most important threat to public health. The majority of smokers wish to quit smoking and every year a substantial part of smokers makes a quit attempt. However, the majority of smokers tries to quit unassisted and existing smoking cessation interventions are underused. In this study we test the effectiveness of four different smoking cessation interventions in a randomized controlled trial. The study provides knowledge on factors important for recruitment and gives indication on potential reach of interventions among the general population. This knowledge can help us in designing interventions that is both effective but also have a high reach in the general population.</detailed_description>
