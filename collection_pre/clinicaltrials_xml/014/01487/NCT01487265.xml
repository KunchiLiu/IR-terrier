	<brief_summary>Preclinical data in lung cancer cell lines showed that EGFR mutation can potentially be a positive predictor for sensitivity to BKM120. Furthermore, when the erlotinib-resistant model H1975 (LR858 and T790M mutation) was treated with BKM120, significant tumor control was observed (Novartis internal data). Therefore, combining BKM120 with erlotinib could potentially down-modulate PI3K-Akt activity resulting in a synergistic effect on cell growth inhibition and enhancing the response to erlotinib.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial of Erlotinib and BKM120 in Patients With Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer Previously Sensitive to Erlotinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicentered, open-label, non-randomized Phase II study of BKM120 and erlotinib in patients with advanced NSCLC previously sensitive to erlotinib. After six patients are enrolled and complete one treatment cycle a safety analysis of adverse events (AEs) will be conducted to assure there are no unexpected or prohibitive toxicities of the combination. The planned study enrollment will continue to up to 37 patients. Duration of a patient's participation in the study will vary. Treatment will continue as long as the patient is benefitting from the treatment, has no evidence of disease progression, and does not meet any criteria for discontinuation or withdrawal.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have recovered to Grade 1 or better from any adverse events (except alopecia) related to prior antineoplastic therapy before screening procedures are initiated. 1. Patients with progressive NSCLC (any histology) 2. Prior sensitivity to erlotinib or gefitinib or other EGFR TKI. Sensitivity is defined as follows: Patients treated with erlotinib (or gefitinib or other EGFR TKI) for any duration in the presence of a known EGFR activating mutation that confers sensitivity to TKI treatment. These include, but are not limited to mutations in L858R (Exon 21); Exon 19 deletion; G719S, G719A, G719C mutations (Exon 19);or L861Q (laboratory report required at enrollment). Prior treatment with erlotinib (or gefitinib, or other EGFR TKI), regardless of mutation status, where there was ≥6 months of disease control (no disease progression). 3. At least one site of measurable disease as defined by RECIST criteria Version 1.1 4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 to 2 5. Archival tumor tissue available for correlative testing (analysis of resistance mechanism to erlotinib). 6. Failure of at least 1, and no more than 3, prior systemic treatments for advanced disease (either due to progressive disease or toxicity). 7. Male or female ≥18 years of age. 8. Patients may have received radiation for palliation prior to starting study drug if they have recovered from the side effects of such therapy. Time from last palliative radiation to beginning of study treatment should be ≥1 week. Patients may have received prior widefield radiation prior to starting study drug if they have recovered from the side effects of such therapy. Time from last widefield radiation to beginning of study treatment should be ≥2 weeks. 9. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≤120 mg/dL (6.7 mmol/L) 10. Adequate hematologic, hepatic and renal function. 11. Total calcium (corrected for serum albumin) WNL (bisphosphonate use for malignant hypercalcemia control is allowed) 12. Magnesium ≥ the lower limit of normal (LLN) 13. Potassium WNL for the institution 14. Serum amylase and lipase ≤ ULN 15. Ability to swallow oral medication 16. Fertile males, defined as all males physiologically capable of conceiving offspring, must use condoms during treatment, and for an additional 24 weeks (6 months in total after study drug discontinuation), and should not father a child in this period. 17. Female patients who are not of childbearing potential, and female patients of childbearing potential who agree to use adequate contraceptive measures, who are not breastfeeding, and who have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test performed within 48 hours prior to start of treatment. 18. Willingness and ability to comply with study and followup procedures. 19. Ability to understand the investigational nature of this study and give written informed consent. 1. Prior treatment with a phosphatidylinositide 3kinase (PI3K) inhibitor 2. Known hypersensitivity to BKM120, and/or erlotinib/gefitinib 3. Failure to recover to Grade 1 or better from any AEs (except alopecia) related to previous antineoplastic therapy before screening procedures are initiated. 4. Untreated brain metastases. Patients with treated brain metastases may participate in this study, if the patient is ≥2 weeks from therapy completion (including radiation and/or surgery), has recovered from all effects of treatment, is clinically stable at the time of study entry, and is not receiving highdose steroid therapy (patients on a low stable dose of steroids may be enrolled). 5. Acute or chronic liver or renal disease or pancreatitis 6. The following mood disorders, as judged by the Investigator or a Psychiatrist, or as a result of patient's mood assessment questionnaire: Medically documented history of active major depressive episode, bipolar disorder (I or II), obsessivecompulsive disorder, schizophrenia, a history of suicidal attempt or ideation, or homicidal ideation (immediate risk of doing harm to others) ≥ Grade 3 anxiety Meets the cutoff score of ≥10 12 in the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) or a cutoff of ≥15 in the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD7) mood scale, respectively, or selects a positive response of "1, 2, or 3" to question number 9 regarding potential for suicidal thoughts in the PHQ9 (independent of the total score of the PHQ9) will be excluded from the study. 7. Active cardiac disease including any of the following: Angina pectoris that requires the use of antianginal medication Ventricular arrhythmias except for benign premature ventricular contractions Supraventricular and nodal arrhythmias requiring a pacemaker or not controlled with medication Conduction abnormality requiring a pacemaker Valvular disease with documented compromise in cardiac function Symptomatic pericarditis Uncontrolled hypertension 8.

Diarrhea ≥ Grade 2. 13. Impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of study drugs (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small bowel resection). 14.
