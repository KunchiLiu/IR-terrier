	<brief_title>Weight Maintenance Through Physical Activity and Social Support in Rural Middle-Aged Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this research project is to evaluate the influence of a theory-based intervention using the Health Effects of Life Transitions for Women Model to promote maintenance of initial weight loss. The intervention will be designed to promote physical activity to prevent weight regain among an underserved and vulnerable population of rural, mid-life women. The intervention delivered through action plans, videos, discussion boards and health behavior tracking (weight, calories in and out, pedometer steps) to facilitate health management, resourcefulness and health status will be compared with the standard advice group who receives newsletters and health behavior tracking (weight) to initiate, increase, or sustain physical activity for weight maintenance.</detailed_description>
