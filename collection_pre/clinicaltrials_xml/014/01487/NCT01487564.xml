	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Profile of OROS Hydromorphone in Healthy Taiwanese Participants With Different Genotypes for the UGT2B7 Gene</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-center, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-dose study in healthy adult Taiwanese participants. A minimum of 6 participants identified as having the UGT2B7 *2/*2 variant genotype and 12 participants identified as having the UGT2B7 *1/*1 wild type genotype will be included in the study. The study will explore the impact of genetic polymorphism in the UGT2B7 gene (occurrence of variants of this gene) on the pharmacokinetics (how the drug is absorbed in the body, distributed within the body, and how it is removed from the body over time) of OROS hydromorphone. This study consists of a screening phase followed by a 5-day open-label treatment phase. During the screening phase, a blood sample will be collected for a genetic test to confirm the presence of the UGT2B7 gene. During the study period, upon completion of a 12-hour overnight fast, participants will receive a single oral 16-mg dose of OROS hydromorphone in the morning of Day 1. Blood samples will be collected through 72 hours after dosing for the determination of plasma hydromorphone and hydromorphone 3-glucuronide concentrations. The safety and tolerability of 16-mg OROS hydromorphone will also be assessed. The total study duration for each participant is approximately 33 days.</detailed_description>
