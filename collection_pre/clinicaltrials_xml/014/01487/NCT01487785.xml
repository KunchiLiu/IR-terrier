	<brief_summary>This phase Ib study includes two phases: dose escalation phase and safety expansion phase. During the dose escalation phase, successive cohorts of eligible patients (minimum 3 and maximum 6 evaluable patients per cohort) will receive increasing oral doses of LDE225 administered on a continuous once daily (QD) dose in combination of gemcitabine. This phase of the study will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/ or recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of LDE225 administered in combination with gemcitabine in locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients. During the safety expansion phase, once the MTD of LDE225 is established, additional patients will be enrolled and treated at the MTD of LDE225 in combination with gemcitabine in order to further evaluate its safety, tolerability and explore the potential efficacy of the combined treatments on the patients in locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.</brief_summary>
