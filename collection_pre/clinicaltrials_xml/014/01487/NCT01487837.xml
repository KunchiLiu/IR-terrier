	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare two different thromboelastometry (ROTEM) trigger levels for administration of human fibrinogen concentrate (Haemocomplettan P) in the treatment of perioperative dilutional coagulopathy during major pediatric surgery. The study hypothesis is that administration of fibrinogen concentrate triggered by a ROTEM FibTEM MCF &lt; 13 mm might reduce the total amount of transfused red cell concentrate during 24 hours after start of surgery as compared to a trigger level of ROTEM FibTEM MCF &lt; 8 mm.</brief_summary>
