	<brief_title>Phase 1 Study to Assess the Effects of EVP-6124 on the QT/QTc Interval in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be randomized to six treatment sequences of 10 subjects each. Subjects will be admitted to the clinic on Day -1 before dosing. Each of the EVP-6124 and placebo treatment periods (blinded) will include a 10-day/9-night confinement to the Clinical Pharmacology Unit (CPU) with study drugs being administered on Day 1 and Day 2. The moxifloxacin treatment period (open-label) will include a 3-day/2-night confinement to the CPU with moxifloxacin administration on Day 1. The study will include 2 washout periods in which each washout starts from the time of the last dose of the preceding treatment period to the first dose of the next treatment period. The washouts following the EVP-6124 or placebo treatments will be 30 days while the washout following the moxifloxacin treatment will be 7 days. Follow-up visit (5 to 10 days following discharge from the CPU).</detailed_description>
