	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Study of FX006 in Patients With Osteoarthritis of the Knee</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, active comparator design. Twenty-four patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) will be randomized to be treated with a single IA injection of 10, 40, or 60 mg of FX006 or 40 mg of commercially available triamcinolone acetonide. Each patient will be evaluated for a total of 6 weeks following a single IA injection. Following screening, safety, PK and pharmacodynamics will be evaluated during one (1) 48-hour in-patient period (Day -1 to Day 2), two (2) 24-hour in-patient periods (Day 14-15 and Day 42-43) and seven (7) out-patient visits (Days 3, 4, 5, 8, 22, 29 and 36).</detailed_description>
