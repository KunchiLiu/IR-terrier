	<brief_summary>Delayed cord clamping (DCC, clamping after cessation of pulsations in the cord around 2-3 min after delivery) is effective in increasing (low birth weight) infant haemoglobin and iron status until six months after birth, without increasing the risk of polycythaemia or other adverse events. We hypothesize that this intervention will also benefit low birth weight infants in South Africa.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Pregnant mothers with SFH measurements below the cutpoint are eligible for inclusion. We aim to include infants with a birth weight below 2500 grams, but the actual birthweight can only be assessed after birth. We therefore accept an error of 500 grams (20%) and will include newborns up to 3000 grams. Birthweight will be measured after randomisation and study treatment. 1. twin pregnancy 2. history of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) 3. (gestational) diabetes 4. preeclampsia 5. abruptio placentae 6. caesarian section 7. necessity of early clamping due to tight nuchal cord 8. need for resuscitation immediately after birth 9. major congenital abnormalities</criteria>
