Use of inhaled, intranasal, intraarticular, and topical steroids is allowed. treatment with any investigational vaccine or immunotherapy a history of stage III or greater cancer, excluding prostate cancer. Basal or squamous cell skin cancers must have been adequately treated and the subject must be diseasefree at the time of registration. Subjects with a history of stage I or II cancer must have been adequately treated and been diseasefree for ≥ 3 years at the time of registration. myocardial infarction or ventricular or atrial arrhythmia within 6 months prior to registration ongoing antiandrogen withdrawal response. systemic steroid use within ≤ 60 days of registration treatment with denosumab (Xgeva(R) or Prolia (R)) within ≤ 3 months prior to registration positive test for HIV or HTLV infections. Subjects with a positive test for hepatitis B or hepatitis C are allowed provided they meet the LFT criteria and have no signs of acute infection or active disease. treatment with any of the following medications or interventions within 28 days prior to registration: external beam radiation or major surgery requiring general anesthetic; saw palmetto; megestrol acetate (Megace(R)), diethylstilbestrol, and cyproterone; 5alphareductase inhibitors (e.g. finasteride [Proscar(R)], dutasteride [Avodart(R)]); steroidal antiandrogen therapy; any other systemic therapy for prostate cancer, except for medical castration; treatment with any other investigational product for prostate cancer; substrates of CYP2D6 (e.g. including but not limited to thioridazine); inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. including but not limited to ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, telithromycin, and voriconazole); inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g. including but not limited to phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifapentine, and phenobarbital) a requirement for treatment with opioid analgesics within 21 days prior to registration an active infection or infection requiring parenteral antibiotic therapy or causing fever within 7 days of registration any medical intervention, or other condition, or any other circumstance that, in the opinion of the Investigator or the Dendreon Medical Monitor, could compromise adherence with study requirements or otherwise compromise the study's objectives</criteria>
