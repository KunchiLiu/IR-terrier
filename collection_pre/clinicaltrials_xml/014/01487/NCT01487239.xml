	<brief_title>Study to Investigate the Absorption, Metabolism, and Excretion of [14C]-GDC-0980 Following Single Oral Dose Administration in Healthy Postmenopausal Female Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Medically healthy as determined by the absence of clinically significant findings in the medical history, physical examination, vital signs, 12lead ECG, and clinical laboratory evaluations within the reference range for the test laboratory, unless deemed not clinically significant by the Investigator Female subjects of nonchildbearing potential, as defined as either: postmenopausal and without recent history of menorrhea as documented either by physician note or confirmed by serum folliclestimulating hormone level consistent with postmenopausal status, or surgically sterile BMI range within 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2, inclusive Negative test for selected drugs of abuse at Screening and at Checkin Negative hepatitis panel (including hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg], hepatitis C virus antibody [antiHCV] and negative HIV antibody screens Minimum of 1 to 2 bowel movements per day Significant history or clinical manifestation of any significant metabolic, allergic, dermatological, hepatic, renal, hematological, pulmonary, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurological, or psychiatric disorder History of significant hypersensitivity, intolerance, or allergy to any drug compound, food, or other substance History of stomach or intestinal surgery or resection that would potentially alter absorption and/or excretion of orally administered drugs History or presence of inflammatory diseases, including those with small or large intestine inflammation such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, which required immunosuppressants Use of potent protonpump inhibitors such as omeprazole, lansoprazole, dexlansoprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole, and rabeprazole History of Gilbert's Syndrome History of diabetes mellitus and/or elevated fasting glucose at baseline History or presence of an abnormal ECG History of alcoholism or drug addiction within 1 year prior to Checkin Participation in more than one other radiolabeled investigational study drug trial within 12 months prior to Checkin. The previous radiolabeled study drug must have been received more than 6 months prior to Checkin for this study and the total exposure from this study and the previous study will be within the recommended levels considered safe Exposure to significant radiation 12 months prior to Checkin Use of any tobaccocontaining or nicotinecontaining products within 3 months/approximately 90 days prior to Checkin or positive urine screening for cotinine Participation in any other investigational study drug trial in which receipt of an investigational study drug occurred within 5 halflives or 30 days, whichever is longer, prior to Checkin Use of any prescription medications/products within 14 days prior to Checkin, unless deemed acceptable by the Investigator Use of any overthecounter (OTC), nonprescription preparations within 7 days prior to Checkin Use of alcohol, grapefruit, or caffeinecontaining foods or beverages within 72 hours Poor peripheral venous access Donation of blood from 30 days prior to Screening or of plasma from 2 weeks prior to Screening Receipt of blood products within 2 months prior to Checkin Any acute or chronic condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would limit the subject's ability to complete and/or participate in this clinical study</criteria>
