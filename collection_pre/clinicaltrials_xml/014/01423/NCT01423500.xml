	<brief_summary>With this protocol the ALL-SCT BFM international study group wants - to evaluate whether hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from matched family or unrelated donors (MD) is equivalent to the HSCT from matched sibling donors (MSD). - to evaluate the efficacy of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)from mismatched family or unrelated donors (MMD) as compared to HSCT from matched sibling donors or matched donors. - to determine whether therapy has been carried out according to the main HSCT protocol recommendations. The standardisation of the treatment options during HSCT from different donor types aims at the achievement of an optimal comparison of survival after HSCT with survival after chemotherapy only. - to prospectively evaluate and compare the incidence of acute and chronic Graft-versus-Host-Disease (GvHD) after HSCT from matched sibling donor (MSD), from matched donor (MD) and from mismatched donor (MMD).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients with high risk or relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) have a worse prognosis compared to all other patients with ALL. For these patients additional therapy approaches are required after they have achieved remission with multimodal chemotherapy. Allogeneic haematopoetic stem cell transplantation shows promising results mainly due to an immunological antileukaemic control by the graft-versus-leukaemia effect but treatment related mortality and morbidity remains a serious problem.</detailed_description>
