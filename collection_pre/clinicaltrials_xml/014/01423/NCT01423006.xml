	<brief_title>Pilot Study on Focal Prostate Radio-Frequency Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RFA is a minimally invasive procedure. It is an image-guided technique that heats and destroys cancer cells. In RFA, imaging techniques such as ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used to help guide a needle electrode into a cancerous tumor. High-frequency electrical currents are then passed through the electrode, destroying the cancer cells. Use of an RFA device was approved by the Food and Drug Association (FDA) in 1997 for the purposes of treating soft tissue tumors. The device we (Moffitt Cancer Center) will be using in this study has clearance for clinical use from the FDA. The effectiveness of the device is measured using biopsy cores at the site of the cancer after the RFA procedure. To evaluate the benefits of this procedure, we will also evaluate the change in quality-of-life indicators from baseline to 6 months following RFA. RFA is being developed as a minimally invasive potential treatment for prostate cancer. This research study is a pilot clinical trial. Pilot clinical trials are smaller versions of larger studies that are conducted to prepare for the larger study. This pilot study pre-tests a research device before a large-scale multicenter study is launched. The specific purpose of this pilot trial is to find out if RFA can effectively treat prostate cancer with fewer side effects including effects on urination, bowel function, and sexual function. RFA for early stage prostate cancer is designed to affect only the part of the prostate where cancer has been detected. The reasoning for this approach is the smaller the area given RFA, the less damage to surrounding tissues.</detailed_description>
