	<brief_summary>The 3 weekly combination of trastuzumab and paclitaxel has been approved for the treatment of advanced breast cancer based on a large pivotal study. However, mono and combination chemotherapy trials suggest that weekly paclitaxel has a better therapeutic index, especially in the palliative setting. The present trial examines the efficacy and safety of weekly paclitaxel over a limited duration combined with continued trastuzumab in HER2+ patients.</brief_summary>
