	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to establish pharmacodynamics (PD), pharmacokinetics (PK), and adverse event (AE) profile of OPC-34712 administered to schizophrenic/schizoaffective subjects. The goals of this trial are three-fold: - To determine the effect of OPC-34712 on the individual QT interval (QTcI) corrected for placebo - To determine the effect of moxifloxacin on QTcI - To examine the concentration-effect relationship of OPC-34712 and moxifloxacin on QTcI</brief_summary>

Subjects with a current DSMIVTR Axis I diagnosis other than schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Hospitalization for an exacerbation of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder within 3 months prior to randomization. Subjects who have a history of or who have evidence of other medical and/or neurological conditions that would expose them to an undue risk of a significant AE or interfere with assessments of safety or efficacy during the course of the trial.
