	<brief_summary>Syncope affects about 50% of Canadians, is the cause of 1 - 2% of all emergency room visits, and probably is responsible for CDN $250 million in health care spending each year. It is associated with decreased quality of life, trauma, loss of employment, and limitations in daily activities. It is a particular problem for older people, partly because of increased frailty, and partly because of a difficult differential diagnosis. One of the causes in older adults is intermittent complete heart block in the setting of bifascicular heart block, but they may also faint due to a variety of tachyarrhythmias, sick sinus syndrome, and several neurally mediated syncopes. Often treatment decisions should be made before the true cause is apparent.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Syncope: Pacing or Recording in the Later Years</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are two general approaches to the patient with syncope and bifascicular block, a common substrate for intermittent heart block. The first is to assume that intermittent heart block is the cause, and simply implant a pacemaker. The second is to implant a digital ECG loop recorder with a lifespan of 2 - 3 years, determine the rhythm abnormalities during the next faint, and treat accordingly. Both approaches expose patients to a risk of fainting and its sequelae, and both carry device-related complications.Which approach is superior is unknown.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients are eligible if they have: &gt;1 syncopal spell within 1 year preceding enrollment, and bifascicular block on a 12lead ECG, and Age &gt; 50 years and written informed consent. Syncope will be defined based on history using a standardized form. Patients will be excluded if they have criteria related to study strategies, including: 1. previous pacemaker, ICD, or Implantable Loop Recorder in situ, 2. ACC/AHA/HRS Class I indication for permanent pacing or ICD implantation, 3. left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 35% mandating ICD therapy, 4. contraindication to a transvenous pacemaker such as artificial tricuspid valve or active sepsis. Patients will also be excluded if a potential competing cause of syncope poses a threat to life, such as: 5. hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 6. documented sustained ventricular tachycardia or 7. inducible, sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia on EP study. They will be excluded if they have: 8. a history of myocardial infarction within 3 months prior to enrollment, and 9. a major chronic comorbid medical condition that would preclude 24 months of followup.</criteria>
