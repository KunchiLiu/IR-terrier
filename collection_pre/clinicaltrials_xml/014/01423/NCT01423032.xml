	<brief_summary>Bendamustine demonstrated clinical activity in pre-treated hematological malignancies due to its unique mechanism of action distinct from standard alkylating agents. This study assesses its efficacy in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia pre-treated with an alkylator, in comparison to fludarabine. Patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia requiring treatment after one previous systemic regimen (usually chlorambucil-based) are randomized to either receive bendamustine 100 mg/m² on days 1 and 2 of a 4-week cycle, or standard fludarabine treatment consisting of 25 mg/m² on days 1 to 5 every four weeks. The primary objective was to achieve non-inferior progression-free survival with bendamustine.</brief_summary>
