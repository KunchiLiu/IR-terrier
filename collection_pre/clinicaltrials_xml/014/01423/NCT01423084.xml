	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the equivalence of rMenB+OMV NZ lot 1 to rMenB+OMV NZ lot 2 when administered to adolescents, as measured by human serum bactericidal activity (hSBA) geometric mean titers (GMTs) against 3 N. meningitidis serogroup B reference strains (H44/76, 5/99, and NZ98/254) and as measured by ELISA geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) against vaccine antigen 287-953, approximately 30 days after a primary vaccination course of two doses administered one month apart.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Novartis will consider this study a success if, at one month following the second vaccination, the two-sided 95% CI of the ratio of the hSBA GMTs for each of 3 serogroup B reference strains (H44/76, 5/99, and NZ98/254) and the two-sided 95% CI of the ratio of the ELISA GMCs against vaccine antigen 287-953 are contained within the interval (0.5, 2.0).</detailed_description>
