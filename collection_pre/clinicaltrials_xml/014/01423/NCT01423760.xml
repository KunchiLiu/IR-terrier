	<brief_summary>This is an open-label, common follow-up trial. Subjects who were enrolled in a Merck KGaA, EMD Serono or Merck Serono Japan sponsored trial with tecemotide (L-BLP25) were enrolled in this follow-up trial to continue their maintenance treatment with tecemotide (L-BLP25). Subjects were transferred once the feeder trial (EMR 63325-005 [NCT00157209], EMR 63325-006 [NCT00157196] and EMR 63325-008 [NCT01094548]) objectives were met. Subjects who received tecemotide (L-BLP25) in a feeder trial continued tecemotide (L-BLP25) treatment in this follow-up trial and have safety assessments performed as well as were observed for progressive disease (PD) and survival in 6- month intervals. Subjects who had not received tecemotide (L-BLP25) in feeder trials, or discontinued treatment were only observed for PD and survival in 6-month intervals and were not provided treatment with tecemotide (L-BLP25).</brief_summary>
