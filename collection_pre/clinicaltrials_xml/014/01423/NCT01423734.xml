	<brief_summary>Imaging with CT (Computed Tomography) or MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is normally used to see how tumors respond to treatment. If tumors shrink after therapy, doctors continue with the same treatment. On the other hand, growing tumors in a patient can bring about a change in therapy. Unfortunately, it often takes three to six months, or even longer before the investigators see tumors shrink or grow on scans. Doctors are looking for new imaging tools that can look at how tumors respond early on during treatment. This study will help us decide if such an MRI technology called DWI (Diffusion Weighted Imaging) can be used as a helpful imaging tool.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histopathologic evidence of well differentiated neuroendocrine tumor of gastroenteropancreatic origin Evidence of metastatic disease of at least 2.0 cm in the liver by MRI or CT imaging. Patient â‰¥18 years of age on the day of signing informed consent. Any contraindication to MRI based on departmental MR questionnaire Inability to cooperate for an MR exam Patient has a history of a second active malignancy with evidence of metastases. Patients with a history of resected prior malignancy or one that would not interfere with the MRI results is allowed. Patient has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would, in the opinion of the treating investigator, interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.</criteria>
