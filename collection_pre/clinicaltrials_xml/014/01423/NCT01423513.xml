	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of ankle taping on improving muscle function and ankle motion in individuals who frequently twist (sprain) their ankle. It is thought that ankle taping may increase muscle function and ankle motion which would benefit individuals who frequently sprain their ankle.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Ankle Support on Muscle Activation and Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous research has demonstrated improved dynamic balance following the application of fibular taping. The effects of fibular taping on ankle dorsiflexion ROM and muscle activation in individuals with CAI are unknown. The purpose of this study is to determine the acute effects of fibular taping on muscle activation of the fibularis longus (peroneus) and soleus muscles, ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM) and dynamic balance. The investigators hypothesize that fibular taping will have similar effectiveness as mobilization interventions which have been shown to improve muscle activation, ankle dorsiflexion ROM,and dynamic balance. Outcomes will be measured immediately before and after intervention. A crossover design will be used and participants will complete two visits at least 48 hours apart, but not more than 1 week apart. After participants complete both arms of the study their participation will be complete (average time to completion for each subject is 1 week).</detailed_description>
