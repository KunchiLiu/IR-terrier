	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether subjects taking a supplement designed to increase metabolic rate will have a positive effect on body composition (fat mass, muscle mass, and bone density.)</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparative Effectiveness Study Evaluating the Effects of Thermogenic Supplements on Body Composition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In a previous randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled pilot study, subjects taking the nutritional supplements contained in these two weight loss plans had a short-term statistically significant increase in their resting metabolic rates as compared to taking a placebo. No increases were found in blood pressure, resting heart rate, or self-reported discomfort when taking the supplement. The current study was designed to extend the findings of the pilot study over a 60-day study period using a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled protocol with the same weight loss interventions.</detailed_description>
