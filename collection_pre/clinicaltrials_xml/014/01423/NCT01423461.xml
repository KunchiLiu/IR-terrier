	<brief_summary>"Individualized health care" refers to the development of strategies for disease management and health promotion that are informed by specific data on genetics and physiological processes that uniquely determine each person's health profile and potential responsiveness to interventions or susceptibility to environmental exposures. Asthma, an inflammatory disorder of the airway, appears to be determined by multiple interacting genetic and environmental factors. Such risk factors include allergic responses, small airways, excess body weight, specific properties of airway smooth muscle, airway and generalized metabolic and inflammatory homeostasis, and exposures to environmental irritants, allergens, and psychosocial stressors. To date, asthma treatment strategies have been guided by "severity" guidelines rather than by characteristics of the child's specific phenotype (a child's underlying allergic tendency, extent of airway inflammation and airway smooth muscle dysfunction, or underlying obesity and metabolic perturbations). The growing availability of new classes of asthma medications that more directly target specific pathophysiological derangements will require accessing data on each child's asthma risk profiles to optimize selection of medications and other interventions that most specifically address the underlying pathophysiology while minimizing adverse treatment side effects. The investigators propose to develop a model program for collecting relevant clinical information and genetic data on a high risk group of asthmatic children, including data on common co-morbidities, specifically obesity and sleep disorders; use this information to develop a comprehensive model database for characterizing children according to their health profiles; and use this characterization to initiate targeted interventions, while continuing long term follow up of these children to determine differential responsiveness to medications.</brief_summary>
