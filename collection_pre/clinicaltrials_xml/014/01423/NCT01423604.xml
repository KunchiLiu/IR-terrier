	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to determine whether ruxolitinib added to capecitabine is effective in improving the overall survival of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Ruxolitinib in Pancreatic Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consisted of an open-label, safety run-in period that was composed of 1 patient cohort with 9 patients/cohort. This phase of the study determined the safety of the capecitabine/ruxolitinib combination in this patient population. A randomized, double-blind study with two treatment arms was conducted once the safety run-in results from the first part of the study showed that the capecitabine/ruxolitinib combination was safe and additional patients could be treated. All patients have received capecitabine therapy in addition to the ruxolitinib or placebo (Study Drug). Treatment for all patients consisted of repeating 21-day cycles. Capecitabine was self-administered for the first 14 days of each cycle, and the Study Drug was self-administered during the entire 21-day cycle. Treatment cycles continued as long as the regimen was tolerated and the patient did not meet any of the discontinuation criteria. In the event of disease progression, capecitabine therapy was discontinued but the Study Drug could continue to be administered. Subjects who discontinued treatment with the Study Drug continued to be followed to obtain information regarding subsequent treatment regimens and survival.</detailed_description>
