	<brief_summary>The overall purpose of this pilot study is to examine effects of Hatha yoga and cardiovascular exercise on craving, mood, cue reactivity, and smoking behavior. Our preliminary study indicated that a single session of either form of activity intervention improved mood, and the yoga intervention appeared to decrease cravings to smoke. The proposed study will extend this preliminary research in several ways.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of Yoga and Cardiovascular Exercise on Smoking Motivation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>First, the investigators will expand the exercise-based interventions from one to three sessions, which will more closely resemble how these interventions may be used in the context of smoking cessation. Second, the investigators will recruit smokers who are motivated to quit smoking, further increasing the clinical relevance of the research. Finally, the investigators will examine the effects of the interventions on actual smoking behavior within and outside of the laboratory setting. This may appropriately be considered a "proof of concept" study, as the investigators will not be powered to detect treatment outcome (smoking cessation) differences, nor are the interventions designed to maximize clinical smoking cessation outcomes. Participants will be randomized to receive 3-sessions of yoga instruction, 3-sessions of cardiovascular exercise, or to a no activity control group. Sessions will be scheduled to occur approximately 7 days apart, with a minimum of 4 between sessions. Mood and craving will be assessed before and after each session, and smoking behavior will be assessed following each session. Finally, a detailed cue reactivity assessment will be conducted prior to the first session and following the last session. Analyses will examine intervention effects on craving, mood, cue reactivity, and smoking behavior. In addition, the investigators will examine several potential mediators and moderators of intervention effects on smoking behavior. Finally, the investigators will continue to examine the feasibility and potential acceptability of each active intervention, to assist in developing future clinical applications of these techniques in the context of smoking cessation.</detailed_description>
