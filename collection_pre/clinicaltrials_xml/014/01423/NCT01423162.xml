	<brief_summary>This study will follow a double blinded randomized controlled study design to enroll 20 apparently healthy 6 year old children. The children will be fed with two different nutrient fortified oat drinks labeled with stable isotopes of iron (Fe-57 or Fe-58 as NaFeEDTA). Fourteen days after consumption of meals on Day 2, blood will be drawn from the children for stable isotope measurements and iron absorption will be calculated.</brief_summary>
