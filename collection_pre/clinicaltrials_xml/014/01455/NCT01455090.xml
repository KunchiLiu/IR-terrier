	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to estimate the rate of sustained virologic response (SVR) SVR12, where SVR12 is defined as HCV RNA &lt; LOQ (detectable or undetectable) 12 weeks post-treatment in Genotype 1 &amp; Genotype 4 treatment naive patients, and Genotype (GT1) infected patients who are prior null responders to pegIFN/ribavirin</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Men and women, ages ≥18 years of age Subjects who are naive to HCV treatment, defined as no previous exposure to an Interferon (IFN), Ribavirin (RBV); or any HCVspecific direct acting antiviral or experimental therapy or subjects who are null responders to previous pegylated Interferon alfa (pegIFNα) plus Ribavirin (RBV) treatment Subjects should have chronic hepatitis C (CHC) as documented by: 1. Positive for antiHCV antibody, HCV RNA, or a positive HCV genotype test at least 6 months prior to screening, and positive for HCV RNA and AntiHCV antibody at the time of screening, or 2. Positive for antiHCV antibody and HCV RNA at the time of screening with a liver biopsy consistent with chronic HCV infection (or a liver biopsy performed prior to enrollment with evidence of CHC disease, such as the presence of fibrosis) HCV genotype 1a, 1b or 4 only HCV RNA viral load of ≥10,000 IU/mL at screening Have one of the following: 1. Documented Fibrotest score of ≤0.72 and aspartate transferase (transminase) to platelet ratio index (APRI) ≤2; OR 2. Documented liver biopsy within 36 months preceding Day 1 showing absence of cirrhosis OR 3. Documented Fibroscan® ultrasound (where approved) within 12 months of screening showing absence of cirrhosis Body mass index (BMI) of 18.0 to 35.0 kg/m2, inclusive Subjects with compensated ChildPugh A cirrhosis as documented by history of cirrhosis with any prior liver biopsy or Fibroscan® ultrasound (where approved) within 12 months prior to screening Evidence of a medical condition associated with chronic liver disease other than HCV (such as but not limited to: hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis,metabolic liver disease, alcoholic liver disease, toxin exposures) History of variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, or ascites requiring management with diuretics or paracentesis Current or known history of cancer (except in situ carcinoma of the cervix or adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin) within 5 years prior to enrollment Documented or suspected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) Positive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus1 (HIV1) and/or Human Immunodeficiency Virus2 (HIV2) antibodies Alanine transferase (transminase) (ALT) &gt;5x upper limit of normal (ULN) Total Bilirubin ≥2 mg/dL</criteria>
