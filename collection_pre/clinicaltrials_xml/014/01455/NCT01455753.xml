	<brief_summary>The aim of this project is to investigate whether the proximity of employees to flu-shot clinics will increase the uptake rates of employees participating in these clinics. The investigators hypothesize that ease of access is an important factor in whether or not employees receive an influenza vaccination.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Proximity on Flu-Shot Participation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2010, flu shots were provided to our partner company's headquarters in their second headquarters building (H2) in an obscure conference room. The investigators are proposing to move the flu shot clinic to a high traffic area, near a café in H2. The location of the flu shot clinic will be prominent and employees would pass by the flu shot clinic several times a day. Two weeks after the flu shot clinic in H2, the investigators will have a two day flu shot clinic in the first headquarters building (H1), near a highly traveled café in H1. Our partner company will not tell employees that there will be a flu shot clinic in H1 until after the flu shot clinic ends in H2. The unexpected factor of the flu shot clinic in H1 will be used to test H2's location versus H1's location without the bias of having employees wait or procrastinate to choose one location over another. The two locations will allow us to identify whether moving from one convenient location to another, even more convenient location would make a significant difference in participation rates.</detailed_description>
