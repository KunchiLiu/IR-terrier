	<brief_summary>The goal is to improve HIV patients' adherence to medication regimens. The investigators are planning an intervention in which the patient is given financial incentives to take clinic attendance seriously, and then given the option to make these incentives contingent on taking medications as prescribedâ€”that is, to require better behavior from themselves to earn the same reward. Past studies have shown that conditional payments improve adherence to HIV treatment, but only while payments are being made. The investigators expect that patients will be willing to give up some payments to commit themselves to better adherence. The investigators also hope to see some patients maintaining good adherence after financial incentives are removed, among those who are given the opportunity to choose this commitment.</brief_summary>
