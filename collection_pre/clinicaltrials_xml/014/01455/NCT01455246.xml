	<brief_title>Daptomycin + Meropenem Versus Ceftazidime in the Treatment of Nosocomial Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a well known complication in patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites. Nosocomial SBP is defined as SBP that occurs after 48 hours of hospitalization. It has been shown that patients with nosocomial SBP have a worse prognosis than patients with community-acquired SBP. It has also been shown that nosocomial SBP is frequently caused by multi drug resistant bacteria such as extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing enterobacteria or meticillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus. Currently the empirical treatment of SBP is the use of third generation cephalosporins or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. In patients affected by nosocomial SBP these treatment could be ineffective. Up to now an empirical approach with a broader spectrum strategy (such as an association between meropenem and daptomycin) has never been compared to standard therapy in the treatment of nosocomial SBP. Thus, the aim of the study is to compare daptomycin + meropenem vs ceftazidime in the treatment of nosocomial SBP in patients with cirrhosis.</detailed_description>
