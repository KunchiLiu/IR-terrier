	<brief_title>Phase I Study to Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose and to Assess the Safety and Pharmacokinetic Profile of HM781-36B in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Besides the main objective, there are 3 other objectives as follows: 1. To determine dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of HM781-36B 2. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of HM781-36B, following oral administration of HM781-36B 3. To evaluate anticancer activity of HM781-36B in patients with advanced solid malignancies Groups of 3 patients per cohort or dose level will be treated with escalating doses of HM781-36B</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1) Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid tumor 2) Patients who have experienced progressive disease despite of conventional anticancer therapy.
