	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of physical training in patients with type 2 diabetes during treatment with the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide (Victoza®) in a 16-weeks double-blinded, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial. Hypothesis: Physical training leads to better metabolic control in type 2 diabetic patients when training is combined with liraglutide (Victoza®) treatment.</brief_summary>
