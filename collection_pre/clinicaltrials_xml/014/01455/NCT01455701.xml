	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center, open label single arm study to investigate the pharmacokinetics and safety of tocilizumab (TCZ) (RoActemra/Actemra) in participants less than 2 years old with active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA). Participants will receive tocilizumab infusions every 2 weeks. The anticipated time on study treatment is 12 weeks (Main evaluation period). Participants will have the option to continue TCZ treatment until participant reaches 2 years of age or up to one year from baseline, whichever is longer. An optional extension period will follow the main evaluation period.</brief_summary>

Greater than or equal to (&gt;/=) 2 active joints at screening and baseline, with at least 14 consecutive days of temperature recordings, which may include the presence or absence of fever (&gt;/=38 degree celsius) during the time between screening and baseline; or 2. &gt;/=2 active joints at screening and baseline, with a fever &gt;/=38 degree celsius for at least 5 consecutive days during the time between screening and baseline; under these circumstances a participants does not need to complete a full 14 days of temperature diary entries to meet this inclusion criteria Not currently receiving corticosteroids (CS) or if taking oral CS like prednisone or equivalent, the dose should be less than or equal to (&lt;/=) 1 milligrams per kilogram per day (mg/kg/day) and the dose has remained stable for at least 2 weeks prior to baseline Not currently receiving methotrexate (MTX) or if taking MTX (together with either folic acid or folinic acid according to local standardofcare), the dose has remained stable or has been discontinued for at least 4 weeks prior to baseline Not currently receiving nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or if taking NSAID, the dose has remained stable or has been discontinued for at least 2 weeks prior to baseline If the participants has received previous treatment with any of the following biologic agents, these must have been discontinued according to the following timelines prior to the baseline visit and are not permitted during the study: 1.

Golimumab must have been discontinued within &gt;/= 10 weeks prior to baseline 8. Certrolizumab pegol must have been discontinued within &gt;/= 10 weeks prior to baseline History of inadequate clinical response (in the opinion of the treating physician) to NSAIDs and CS General Any autoimmune, rheumatic disease or overlap syndrome other than sJIA Not fully recovered from recent surgery or less than six weeks since surgery, at the time of screening visit; or planned surgery during the study (except for myringotomy surgery, which is permitted) General Safety Any significant concurrent medical or surgical condition which would jeopardize the participants safety or ability to complete the trial History of significant allergic or infusion reactions to prior biologic therapy or to any of the excipients listed in TCZ product labelling documents Inborn conditions characterized by a compromised immune system Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or other acquired forms of immune compromise Evidence of serious uncontrolled concomitant diseases including but not limited to the nervous system, renal, hepatic or endocrine systems Asthma for which the participant has required the use of oral or parenteral corticosteroids for &gt;/=2 weeks within 6 months prior to baseline visit Any active acute, subacute, chronic or recurrent bacterial, viral or systemic fungal infection History of atypical tuberculosis (TB) Active TB requiring treatment at any point prior to screening visit Positive TB test result at screen, unless treated with antituberculosis therapy for at least 4 weeks prior to receiving study medication and chest radiograph is negative for active tuberculosis within 6 months of screening visit consistent with local practice Any major episode of infection requiring hospitalization or treatment during screening or treatment with intravenous (IV) antibiotics completing within 4 weeks of the screening visit or oral antibiotics completing within 2 weeks of the screening visit History of reactivation or new onset of a systemic infection such as herpes zoster or Epstein Barr virus within 2 months of the screening visit History of hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection Chronic hepatitis viral or autoimmune Significant cardiac or pulmonary disease History or concurrent serious gastrointestinal disorders such as ulcer or inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis or other symptomatic lower gastrointestinal conditions, including ulcer and perforation History of or current cancer or lymphoma History of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) within 3 months prior to the screening visit Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus with elevated hemoglobin (Hgb) A1c as defined by agespecific standards Excluded Previous or Concomitant Therapy: Participation in another interventional clinical trial within the past thirty days or five serum halflives of the investigative medication, whichever is longer Previous treatment with TCZ Administration of intravenous immunoglobulin within 4 weeks prior to the baseline visit Previous treatment with any cell depleting therapies, including investigational agents Prior stem cell transplant at any time Live or attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the baseline visit, or intending to receive while on study medication or 8 weeks following the last dose of study medication</criteria>
