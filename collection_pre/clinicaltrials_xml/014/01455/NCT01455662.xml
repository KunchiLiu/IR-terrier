	<brief_title>Relationship Between Tissue Markes in Patients With Post Cardio Respiratory Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evaluation of the serum carbon dioxide gradient (GapCO2), central venous saturation (ScvO2) and the clearance of serum lactate (Clac) in predicting hospital mortality after cardiac arrest syndrome (post-PCR). Prospective study, unicenter - Intensive Care Unit - HNSC. Period: May/2010 to June/2011. Serial assessment of GapCO2 of ScvO2 Clac and the first 72 hours post-PCR. Excluded under 18, survival of less than 6HS, pregnant women, traumatized, post-operative hypothermia and liver disease. T-student test, 95% (p &lt;0.05).</detailed_description>
