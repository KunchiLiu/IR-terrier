	<brief_title>2-Site Safety Study of Besivance Versus Vigamox Prophylactically in Routine Cataract Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be assigned to receive either Besivance or Vigamox (1:1) to be administered as 1 drop in the study eye 4 times daily starting 3 days prior to cataract surgery and continuing for 7 days post-operatively. Sixty subjects (30 from Ophthalmology Consultants and 30 from Ophthalmology Associates) of any race and either sex, requiring cataract extraction with planned implantation of a posterior chamber intraocular lens.</detailed_description>
