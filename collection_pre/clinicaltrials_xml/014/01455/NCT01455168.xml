	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of a capsular tension ring (CTR) in preventing anterior capsule shrinkage after cataract surgery in exfoliation syndrome (XFS) with no zonular weakness. The eyes with XFS undergo phacoemulsification and aspiration (PEA) with an intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. All operations are performed by a single surgeon. No eyes with either ectopia lentis or phacodonesis are included. There are three groups; CTR is not used in group A, CTR is simply implanted in group B, and CTR is implanted and closed by tying both eyelets in group C. The areas of continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC) are calculated, and both the time-course change and the comparison among the 3 groups are tested.</brief_summary>
