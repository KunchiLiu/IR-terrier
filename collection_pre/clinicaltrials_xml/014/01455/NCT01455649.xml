	<brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Switching Calcineurin Inhibitor to Everolimus After Kidney Transplantation in Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patient who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be included in the study and randomized into two groups in the third month post transplant, they will be in use of tacrolimus, corticosteroids and Mycophenolate sodium. The group 1 will undergo a conversion from calcineurin inhibitor to Everolimus within 1 day (overnight), group 2 will be maintained with the initial immunosuppression. We will start Everolimus at 1 mg 2x/day and three days after the beginning we will adjust the dose by the serum levels, which will be kept in 6 to 10ng/dL. The doses of corticosteroids and Mycophenolate sodium will be retained. There will be performed renal biopsies at randomization and after 12 months. The glomerular filtration rate will be calculated monthly using the MDRD.</detailed_description>
