	<brief_summary>This is a phase 1, dose escalation study of Plerixafor in combination with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor , Daunorubicin and Cytarabine in adults patients with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study in Plerixafor and Granulocyte-colony Stimulating Factor Patients With Relapse Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Primary objective is to determine the maximal tolerated dose and Recommended Phase 2 Dose of plerixafor when used in combination with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, Daunorubicin and Cytarabine during induction therapy Then determine the tolerability of plerixafor administered in combination with G-CSF and cytarabine during consolidation therapy.</detailed_description>
