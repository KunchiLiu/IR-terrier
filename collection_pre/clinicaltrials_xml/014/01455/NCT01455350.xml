	<brief_summary>Chronic gynaecological pain is a major medical problem that affects 20-30% of women at different moments of their life. This largely neglected issue has a significant impact on the sexual and conjugal life of women suffering from it as well as on their psychological health. Furthermore, this kind of pain is not well understood, often misdiagnosed or even totally ignored. Also, treatment is limited and not extensively studied. This study aims at better understanding and treating gynaecological pain. The focus of the study will be provoked vestibulodynia, pain at the entry of the vagina. The efficacy of specialized pelvic floor physiotherapy will be compared to a topical cream (lidocaine) applied to the vulva. The treatment efficacy will be assessed in 234 women (aged from 18-45 years old) suffering from provoked vestibulodynia recruited in 4 hospitals (CHUS, Jewish General Hospital, Royal-Victoria Hospital, CHUM St-Luc).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of a Physiotherapy Treatment in Women Suffering From Provoked Vestibulodynia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a randomised controlled trial comparing the impact of multimodal physiotherapy treatments to topical lidocaine in women suffering from provoked vestibulodyina. The first treatment consists of 10 sixty minutes weekly physiotherapy treatments including relaxation techniques, stretching and pelvic floor muscle control exercises. The second treatment is a night time application of lidocaine to the vulva for 10 weeks. Physiotherapists will then evaluate women's pain and sexual function right after the treatment and 6 months later.</detailed_description>
