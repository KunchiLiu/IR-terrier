	<brief_summary>The hypothesis of this observational single-center clinical study was to explore the volumetric hemodynamic monitoring in the perioperative period in major and risky thoracic intervention. The investigators monitored the changes in the volumes of blood in the central vessels and heart chambers as well as a volume of fluid in pulmonary tissue (i. e. extravascular lung water).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal of this observational study is to investigate into changes in volumetric hemodynamic parameters obtained with a technique of transpulmonary indicator dilution after major thoracic intervention, including pneumonectomy and lobar resections. The important parameters of hemodynamics were monitored throughout the intervention and 48 hrs postoperatively, including extravascular lung water index, global end-diastolic volume index, etc.</detailed_description>
