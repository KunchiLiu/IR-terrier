	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to perform a prospective, randomized, controlled blinded study in critically patients to assess the necessity for measuring daily resting energy expenditure as a guide for nutritional support. Our hypothesis is that tight caloric control will reduce the rate of new infections. Study Design :Multi-center, randomized, single blinded, controlled study. Study Population: newly-admitted, adult mechanically ventilated ICU patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study objectives To evaluate the effect of tight caloric control in critical patients on: - The rate of acquired nosocomial infections (Ventilated associated pneumonia, Catheter related infections, Urinary tract infections) - Mortality rates, length of stay in the ICU and in hospital, length of ventilation and incidence of non-infectious complications. Primary endpoint: Rate of nosocomial infections (for definitions see appendage 1) acquired after 48 to 72 hours following admission. Secondary endpoints - Metabolic control: glucose concentration, insulin administration, rate of hypoglycemic events. - Success of tight caloric control: accumulative and maximum negative energy balance. - Organ function: SOFA score. - Rate of non-infectious complications: requirement for surgery or occurrence of pressure sores. - Length of ICU stay and of assisted ventilation (LOS and LOV) - ICU survival rate. - Patient status and disposition on day 28 or at hospital discharge. - 3 &amp; 6 months survival.</detailed_description>
