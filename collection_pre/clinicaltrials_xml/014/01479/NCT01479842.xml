	<brief_summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of BTK inhibitor PCI-32765 when given together with rituximab and bendamustine hydrochloride in treating patients with recurrent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). BTK inhibitor PCI-32765 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as bendamustine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving BTK inhibitor PCI-32765 together with rituximab and bendamustine hydrochloride may kill more cancer cells.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Identify the specific toxicities and a recommended phase 2 dose of PCI-32765 (BTK inhibitor PCI-32765) orally (PO) in combination with rituximab and bendamustine (bendamustine hydrochloride) (i.e., "combination therapy") in patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell NHL. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the activity of combined rituximab, bendamustine, and PCI-32765 in patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell NHL as measured by response rate and duration of response. II. Identify potential marker(s) predictive of response to the combination therapy. III. Correlate pharmacogenetic (PGx) findings with patient response and toxicity. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of BTK inhibitor PCI-32765. Patients receive BTK inhibitor PCI-32765 PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Patients also receive rituximab intravenously (IV) on day 1 and bendamustine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1-2. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may continue receiving BTK inhibitor PCI-32765 PO in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 4 months for up to 2 years.</detailed_description>
