	<brief_summary>This is an open-label non-randomized, pilot study to evaluate the effect of Interleukin-1 blockade on exercise capacity in patients with pulmonary hypertension. Subjects will undergo cardiopulmonary exercise testing at baseline, and after 4 weeks treatment with Anakinra (recombinant human Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist.</brief_summary>
