	<brief_title>Effect of Recombinant Human Granulocyte Colony- Stimulating Factor on CD11b in Septic Neonates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neonates are susceptible to septicemia secondary to quantitative and qualitative neutrophilic defects. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) stimulates myeloid progenitor cell proliferation and induces selective neutrophil functions.</detailed_description>
