	<criteria>1. Written informed consent/assent signed and dated by the subject and/or parent /legal guardian before conducting any study related procedure. 2. Male or female 12 years and older, as of the Screening Visit. Male or female 18 years and older, as of the Screening Visit, in countries where local regulations or the regulatory status of study medication permit enrollment of adults only. 3. General good health, and free of any concomitant conditions or treatment that could interfere with study conduct, influence the interpretation of study observations/results, or put the subject at increased risk during the study. 4. Asthma Diagnosis: Asthma as defined by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). 5. Severity of Disease: A best forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 40%85% of the predicted normal value during the Screening Visit. NHANES III predicted values will be used for subjects aged ≥12 years and adjustments to predicted values will be made for African American subjects. 6. Reversibility of Disease: Demonstrated a ≥15% reversibility of FEV1 within 30 minutes following 2 inhalations of albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol (if required, spacers are permitted for reversibility testing only) at the Screening Visit. If a subject fails to demonstrate an increase in FEV1 ≥15%, then the subject is not eligible for the study and will not be allowed to rescreen. 7. Current Asthma Therapy: Subjects must be on a shortacting β2agonist alone or a noncorticosteroid maintenance medication (with or without a shortacting β2agonist) for ≥ 3 months preceding the Screening Visit. Subjects must not have used an inhaled corticosteroid for at least 6 weeks preceding the Screening Visit. Exception: Based upon the investigator's judgment that there is no inherent harm in changing the subject's current ICS therapy and the subject provides consent, subjects on low dose ICS (100mcg Fp BID or equivalent) may be switched to a shortacting β2 agonist alone at a Prescreening Visit. The subject will be required to return to the clinic to complete the Screening Visit once the 2week washout period has been completed. 8. ShortActing β2Agonists: All subjects must be able to replace their current shortacting β2agonists with albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol at the Screening Visit for use as needed for the duration of the study. The use of spacer devices with the metered dose inhaler (MDI) will not be allowed during the study with exception of its use during reversibility testing at the Screening Visit. Nebulized albuterol/salbutamol will not be allowed at any time during the study. Subjects must be able to withhold all inhaled shortacting beta sympathomimetic bronchodilators for at least 6 hours prior to all study visits. 9. If female, is currently not pregnant, breast feeding, or attempting to become pregnant, has a negative serum pregnancy test, and is of 1. Nonchildbearing potential, defined as: Before menarche or &gt; or =1 year postmenopausal or Surgically sterile (tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy) or Congenital sterility or Diagnosed as infertile and not undergoing treatment to reverse infertility or is of 2. Childbearing potential, willing to commit to using a consistent and acceptable method of birth control as defined below for the duration of the study: Systemic contraception used for &gt; or = 1 month prior to screening, including birth control pills, transdermal patch (Ortho Evra®), vaginal ring (NuvaRing®), levonorgesterel (Norplant®), or injectable progesterone (DepoProvera®) or Double barrier methods (condoms, cervical cap, diaphragm, and vaginal contraceptive film with spermicide) or Intrauterine device (IUD) or is of 3. Childbearing potential and not sexually active, willing to commit to using a consistent and acceptable method of birth control as defined above for the duration of the study, in the event the subject becomes sexually active. 10. Capable of understanding the requirements, risks, and benefits of study participation, and, as judged by the investigator, capable of giving informed consent/assent and being compliant with all study requirements (visits, recordkeeping, etc). 1. History of lifethreatening asthma that is defined for this protocol as an asthma episode that required intubation and/or was associated with hypercapnea, respiratory arrest or hypoxic seizures. 2. Culturedocumented or suspected bacterial or viral infection of the upper or lower respiratory tract, sinus, or middle ear that is not resolved within 2 weeks prior to the Screening Visit. In addition, the subject must be excluded if such infection occurs between the Screening Visit and the Randomization Visit. 3. Any asthma exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids within 3 months of the Screening Visit. A subject must not have had any hospitalization for asthma within 6 months prior to the Screening Visit. Note: An exacerbation of asthma is defined as any worsening of asthma requiring any treatment other than rescue albuterol/salbutamol HFA MDI and/or the subject's regular noncorticosteroid maintenance treatment. This includes requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids and/or emergency room visit or hospitalization, a change in the subject's regular noncorticosteroid maintenance treatment, or the addition of other asthma medications. 4. Presence of glaucoma, cataracts, ocular herpes simplex, or malignancy other than basal cell carcinoma. 5. Historical or current evidence of a clinically significant disease including, but not limited to: cardiovascular (e.g., congestive heart failure, known aortic aneurysm, clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia or coronary heart disease), hepatic, renal, hematological, neuropsychological, endocrine (e.g., uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled thyroid disorder, Addison's disease, Cushing's syndrome), gastrointestinal (e.g., poorlycontrolled peptic ulcer, GERD), or pulmonary (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema, bronchiectasis with the need for treatment, cystic fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Significant is defined as any disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk through participation, or which could affect the efficacy or safety analysis if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study. 6. Have any of the following conditions that, in the judgment of the investigator, might cause participation in this study to be detrimental to the subject, including, but not limited to: Current malignancy excluding basal cell carcinoma; History of malignancy is acceptable only if the subject has been in remission for one year prior to the Screening Visit. (Remission is defined as no current evidence of malignancy and no treatment for the malignancy in the 12 months prior to the Screening Visit) Current or untreated tuberculosis; History of tuberculosis is acceptable only if a subject has received an approved prophylactic treatment regimen or an approved active treatment regimen and has had no evidence of active disease for a minimum of 2 years • Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic BP ≥160 or diastolic BP &gt;100) Stroke within 3 months prior to the Screening Visit Immunologic compromise 7.
