Formal acceptance of disponibility for all programmed clinical trial visits and other protocol requisites. Females of child bearing age must demonstrate a negative pregnancy test (performed on screening and subsequent follow up visits) and use a reliable birth control method including abstinence of sexual activity throughout the duration of the study and for at last 28 days after termination of the clinical trial.

Subjects administered with an experimental or noncommercial drug during the 4 weeks prior to the trial. Patients participating in other clinical studies. Patients that are not competent for completing required tasks (eg. alcohol or drug related problems or psychiatric disorders).
