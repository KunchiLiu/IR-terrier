	<brief_title>Proximal Interphalangeal Joint Arthroplasty Using a Graft From the Capitate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous anatomical studies have shown that the capitate had a widened distal base. The distal articulation was mainly with the base of the third metacarpal and partially with the base of the second metacarpal. The articulation was slightly flattened with a convex and concave dorsal articular surface. The contour stimulates our imagination and creativity to use a portion of the articular surface for PIP arthroplasty.</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Dislocations</mesh_term>
	<criteria>1. an articular defect at the proximal aspect of the PIP joint; 2. the defect larger than 5 mm × 5 mm in size based on intraoperative findings. 1. large defects involved double joint surfaces; 2. the size of the defect less than 5 mm × 5 mm; 3. multdigital articular defects that all required osteoarticular grafting; 4. associate with infection or other diseases that restrict to use the technique.</criteria>
