	<brief_summary>This study is a multicenter trial.The primary objective is to estimate short-term efficacy and acute toxicities of nedaplatin to the combination of docetaxel in neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by nedaplatin in concurrent chemoradiotherapy, compared to cisplatin to the combination of docetaxel in neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by cisplatin in concurrent chemoradiotherapy for patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the overall survival, the distant metastases free survival, and disease free survival of patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with these regimens.Furthermore,analyze the cost-effectiveness of the regimens.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Multicenter Trial Evaluating the Efficacy of Nedaplatin in Patients With Locoregionally Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with clinical stage T3-4N1/N2-3 (UICC 7th edition)are divided into two groups according to informed consent:intensity-modulated radiation therapy（IMRT）group and conventional fractionation radiotherapy(CRT)group. Then the patients in IMRT group/CRT group are randomly assigned to receive nedaplatin+docetaxel in neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus nedaplatin alone in concurrent chemoradiotherapy or cisplatin+docetaxel in neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus cisplatin alone in concurrent chemoradiotherapy.Evaluate the overall survival, the distant metastases free survival, and disease free survival of the patients treated with these regimens.Furthermore,analyze the cost-effectiveness of the regimens.</detailed_description>
