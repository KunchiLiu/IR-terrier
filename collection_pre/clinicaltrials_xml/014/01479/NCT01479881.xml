	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of steady-state concentrations of TMC435 (administered once a day) on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of the immunosuppressants cyclosporine and tacrolimus in healthy participants. Cyclosporine and tacrolimus are immunosuppressants used to prevent transplant rejection and may therefore potentially be coadministered with TMC435 in patients infected with hepatitis C virus that undergo liver transplantation. We will also explore the short-term safety and tolerability following coadministration of TMC435 at steady-state and (1) cyclosporine or (2) tacrolimus after single dosing in healthy participants. Steady-state is a term that means that the drug has been given long enough so that the plasma concentrations will remain the same with each subsequent dose. Pharmacokinetics (PK) means how the drug is absorbed into the bloodstream, distributed in the body and eliminated from the body.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study in Healthy Participants Investigating the Effect of TMC435 on the Pharmacokinetics of Immunosuppressants Cyclosporine and Tacrolimus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TMC435 is a protease inhibitor (PI) and is being investigated for treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, in combination with Peg-IFN (pegylated interferon) and RBV (ribavirin). This is a Phase I, open-label (both participant and investigator know the name of the medication given at a certain moment) trial in 28 healthy participants to investigate the effect of TMC435 at steady-state on the single dose pharmacokinetics of the immunosuppressants cyclosporine and tacrolimus. The trial population will consist of a total of 28 healthy participants, equally divided over 2 panels. In Panel 1, each participant will receive 2 treatments: a single 100-mg dose of cyclosporine on Day 1 and TMC435 150 mg once daily for 10 days on Days 1 to 10, coadministered with a single 100-mg dose of cyclosporine on Day 7. In Panel 2, each participant will receive 2 treatments: a single 2-mg dose of tacrolimus on Day 1 and TMC435 150 mg each day for 12 days on Days 1 to 12, coadministered with a single 2-mg dose of tacrolimus on Day 7. Safety and tolerability will be assessed during the study period and during follow up. Blood and urine safety samples, electrocardiogram (ECG) and vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate) will be taken at screening, Day1, Day 2 (only panel 1), Day 7(only panel 2), Day 8 (only panel 2) and at the follow-up visit about 5 to 7 days after last TMC435 intake.</detailed_description>
