	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of AL-4943A Ophthalmic Solution in Patients With Allergic Conjunctivitis Using the Conjunctival Allergen Challenge (CAC) Model</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consisted of 5 Visits. Eligible patients underwent allergy testing using the Conjunctival Allergen Challenge (CAC) model, which reproduces the signs and symptoms of Seasonal Allergic Conjunctivitis by replicating the natural disease process. Patients demonstrating a positive reaction to the CAC at Visit 1 (screening) and Visit 2 (confirmatory) were randomized to treatment at Visit 3 (Day 0). The test article was instilled at Visit 3, with treatment efficacy CAC performed at 24 hours duration of action. The test article was instilled again at Visit 4 (Day 14), with treatment efficacy CAC performed at 16 hours duration of action. The test article was instilled a final time at Visit 5 (Day 21), with treatment efficacy performed at onset of action.</detailed_description>
