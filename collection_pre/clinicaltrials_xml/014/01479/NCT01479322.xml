	<brief_summary>Context: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder characterized by childhood-onset obesity and endocrine dysfunction that leads to cardiovascular disability and early death within the first 3 decades of life. Objectives: To assess the significance of risk factors for future disabilities, carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) was measured and correlated with known atherosclerotic risk factors in 27 children with PWS and 24 age-, sex-, and body mass index (BMI)-adjusted controls.</brief_summary>
