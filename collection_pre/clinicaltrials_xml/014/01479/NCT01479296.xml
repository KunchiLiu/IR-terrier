	<brief_title>Evaluating the Immune Response to a rAd5 HIV Vaccine Administered in Three Different Ways in Healthy, HIV-Uninfected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The VRC rAd5 HIV vaccine contains four different components. In this study, researchers will examine how the immune system responds to the vaccine when the four components are administered in three different ways: 1. The vaccine dose containing all four components is given as a single injection in one arm, and placebo injections are given in the other arm and both legs. 2. The vaccine dose containing all four components is divided into fourths, and one-fourth of the full dose is given in each arm and leg. 3. The four vaccine components are separated, and a different component is given in each arm and leg. This study will enroll healthy, HIV-uninfected adults. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups. Group 1 will receive the entire dose of vaccine in their right arm and placebo vaccine in the other arm and both legs. Group 2 will receive all four different components of the vaccine, given separately as a different component per each arm and leg. Group 3 will receive the entire vaccine dose divided into fourths, with one fourth of the full dose given in each arm and leg. At a baseline study visit, participants will undergo a physical examination and a medical and medication history review. Female participants will also take a pregnancy test. Participants will complete questionnaires and receive counseling on HIV risk reduction and pregnancy prevention. All participants will then receive vaccine given as four injectionsâ€”one each in their right arm, left arm, right thigh, and left thigh (except for Group 1, placebo injections are given in left arm and both legs). After receiving the vaccine, participants will remain in the clinic for at least 30 minutes for observation and monitoring of side effects. For 7 days after the vaccination, participants will record any side effects in a symptom log; for the first 3 days after the vaccination, study staff will call participants to ensure they are completing the symptom log. Follow-up visits will occur at Months 1, 4, and 7. These visits will include the baseline study procedures and a blood collection. Participants will be contacted by study researchers once a year for 5 years for follow-up health monitoring. Blood collected during study visits will be saved for future testing.</detailed_description>

More information on this criterion can be found in the protocol. Body weight greater than or equal to 110 lb (greater than or equal to 50 kg) Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 12.5 g/dL for participants who were born female; greater than or equal to 13.5 g/dL for participants who were born male White blood cell count between 3300 to 12,000 cells/mm^3 Total lymphocyte count greater than or equal to 800 cells/mm^3 Remaining differential either within institutional normal range or with site physician approval Platelets between 125,000 to 550,000/mm^3 Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) less than 1.25 times the institutional upper limit of normal Ad5 neutralizing antibody titer less than 1:18 Negative HIV1 and 2 blood test: U.S. participants must have a negative Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved enzyme immunoassay (EIA). NonU.S. sites may use locally available assays that have been approved by HVTN Laboratory Operations. Negative hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) Negative antihepatitis C virus antibodies (antiHCV) or negative HCV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) if the antiHCV is positive Participants who were born female: negative serum or urine beta human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test performed prior to vaccination on the day of vaccination Participants who were born female must agree to consistently use effective contraception from at least 21 days prior to enrollment through the last required study visit for sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy; or not be of reproductive potential, such as having reached menopause (no menses for 1 year) or having undergone hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation; or be sexually abstinent. More information on this criterion can be found in the protocol. Participants who were born female must also agree not to seek pregnancy through alternative methods, such as artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization until after the last required study visit Participants who were born male must be fully circumcised (as documented at screening examination) Excessive daily alcohol use, frequent binge drinking, chronic marijuana abuse, or any other use of illicit drugs within the 12 months prior to study entry History of newly acquired syphilis, gonorrhea, nongonococcal urethritis, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2), chlamydia, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), trichomonas, mucopurulent cervicitis, epididymitis, proctitis, lymphogranuloma venereum, chancroid, or hepatitis B within the 12 months prior to study entry Untreated or incompletely treated syphilis infection HIV vaccine(s) received in a prior HIV vaccine trial. For potential participants who have received control/placebo in an HIV vaccine trial, the HVTN 085 Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT) will determine eligibility on a casebycase basis. NonHIV experimental vaccine(s) received within the 5 years prior to study entry in a previous vaccine trial. Exceptions may be made for vaccines that have subsequently undergone licensure by the FDA. For potential participants who have received control/placebo in an experimental vaccine trial, the HVTN 085 PSRT will determine eligibility on a casebycase basis.
