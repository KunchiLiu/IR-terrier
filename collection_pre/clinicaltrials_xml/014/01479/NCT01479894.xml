	<brief_summary>This is a retrospective genetic analysis of stored tumor tissue samples to evaluate the distribution of Recurrence Score® and gene groups of stage II colon cancer in African American (AA) and Caucasian individuals. Other covariant factors in the medical chart will be analyzed as well. Three institutions will contribute patients to this study with a total patient number goal of approximately 200 with approximately 100 being AA and approximately 100 being Caucasian. As enrollment in this study proceeds a Caucasian subject will be matched for every African American enrolled.</brief_summary>
