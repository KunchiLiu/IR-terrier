	<brief_title>Bipolar Depression and Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a placebo-controlled study of patients with bipolar I disorder (BPD) utilizing a well-known antidepressant, escitalopram (ESC), in combination with the anti-inflammatory agent, celecoxib (CBX). The investigators hypothesize that combination treatment will lead to a qualitatively and quantitatively augmented response and will result in greater numbers of remitters compared to ESC monotherapy.</detailed_description>
