	<brief_summary>First clinical studies indicate an effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation(rTMS) in the treatment of auditory hallucinations (AH). However, effect size, optimal stimulation site and parameters are unclear. With this randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial we test the efficacy and safety of bilateral continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a patterned form rTMS, against auditory hallucinations. The treatment will be applied add-on to individual antipsychotic and behavioral therapy. Patients will be treated for 6 weeks each weekday (30 sessions) with 40s of cTBS (halfway between T3/P3 and T4/P4). For weeks 1-3, half of the subjects will be randomized to a sham-stimulation (coil tilted 45Â°). During weeks 4-6, all subjects receive real cTBS.</brief_summary>
