	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate in a prospective study the efficacy of intravitreal autologous plasmin enzyme in macular edema and to analyze the fibrinolytic system in vitreous body.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Plasmin and Fibrinolytic System in Diabetic Retinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autologous plasmin enzyme has been used to liquefy the gel structure of the vitreous body and to decrease the adherence of the posterior vitreous cortex to the inner limiting membrane in clinical studies. The investigators performed intravitreal autologous plasmin enzyme for macular edema. in addition, the investigators collected vitreous body in macular edema and analyzed fibrinolytic system.</detailed_description>
