	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to compare the progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), time to treatment failure (TTF), duration of response (DoR), quality of life, safety and tolerability of tivozanib in combination with mFOLFOX6 and bevacizumab in combination with mFOLFOX6.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Combining mFOLFOX6 With Tivozanib or Bevacizumab in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer as First Line Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Imaging scans (computed tomography [CT]/magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) to assess disease progression were to be completed within 28 days prior to first study drug administration, approximately every 8 weeks for the first 18 months and then approximately every 12 weeks until the patient showed progressive disease (PD) per the investigator, withdrew consent, was lost to follow-up or died. Per the original protocol, all patients were to be contacted by the study site every 12 weeks for survival following the end-of-treatment visit until death or for no more than 3 years after the end-of-treatment visit. The interim futility analysis was conducted in December 2013, based on a pre-specified analysis cutoff date of 13 September 2013. The study was brought to a close as specified in the protocol due to the results of the interim futility analysis and only those participants who were deriving benefit (per the treating physician) from their current treatment remained on study until one of the discontinuation criteria was met. Given the early closure of the study, no updated or additional efficacy analyses were performed after the interim analysis. A biomarker analysis was conducted in January 2014, based on the data from the cutoff date of 13 September 2013. The safety analysis was updated with a new cutoff date of 28 February 2014.</detailed_description>
