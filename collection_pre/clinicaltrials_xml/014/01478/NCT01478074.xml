	<brief_summary>This is a single-center open-label phase I clinical trial of delivering haploidentical natural killer (NK) cells matured ex vivo with ALT-801 followed by intravenous infusions of ALT-801 in patients with relapsed/refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). The study will be conducted at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) and MDACC Children's Cancer Hospital in Houston, Texas.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ALT-801-activated Natural Killer Cells After FLAG Induction for Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is an effective treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). For patients transplanted in first remission or with low risk MDS, approximately 60% of patients have achieved long-term disease free survival. Patients with relapsed leukemia have a poorer outcome; the long-term disease free survival rate for relapsed AML is 5-10% without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). With HSCT, survival after relapse approaches 40%, but success depends greatly on whether patients are in remission at the time of transplant. Many relapsed patients have refractory chemoresistant disease and never attain remission to be eligible for potentially curative HSCT, or develop significant complicating comorbidities during the prolonged intensive reinduction of their disease. Thus, improved strategies for achieving remission in relapsed patients prior to transplantation are critical to improving the survival of these patients. Relapsed/refractory AML requires remission prior to allogeneic HSCT for optimal survival, but responds poorly to chemotherapy. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-haploidentical, NK-enriched peripheral blood cell infusions may augment induction chemotherapy in patients with poor prognosis AML, but there are significant toxicities related to the IL-2 infusions given for optimal NK cell activity. The purpose of this trial is to estimate the toxicity and feasibility of treating relapsed/refractory AML with FLAG chemotherapy followed by haploidentical donor-derived natural killer (NK) cells using ALT-801 for ex vivo and in vivo NK cell activation as an alternative to interleukin-2 (IL-2). ALT-801 is a genetically engineered fusion protein, that is, a single protein made by combining the DNA of two or more different genes. ALT-801 is a combination of IL-2 (an important protein for stimulating immune cells) and a binding portion that recognizes tumor cells. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of an infused allogeneic donor NK cell product and ALT-801 following a FLAG preparative regimen to treat relapsed/refractory acute myelogenous leukemia. The primary endpoint for toxicity is the absence of NK cell Product or ALT-801-related grade 2 toxicity, excluding grade 2 fever, rigor/chills, fatigue, vomiting/nausea, pruritus/itching, electrolyte imbalance, hypoalbuminemia or lymphopenia within 21 days of the ALT-801 or NK cell product infusion. The primary endpoint of feasibility is defined as being able to infuse NK-cells at the maximum tolerated cell dose or the highest dose level on day 0 and complete all 8 planned doses of ALT-801, with a safety that does not exceed toxicity limits, in greater than or equal to 7 of 10 subjects.</detailed_description>

Patients with relapsed AML, including those with CNS disease or previous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or primary refractory AML (primary AML that has failed remission to at least two cycles of induction therapy) 2. For patients of Cohorts 2 to 4, availability of a haploidentical family peripheral blood stem cell donor selected for best possible KIR reactivity 3. Patient is between 2 and 59 years of age, inclusive 4. Patient must have recovered from the treatmentrelated toxicities of prior cytotoxic agents received in the 4 weeks prior to beginning treatment on this protocol, with the exception of cytopenias resulting from persistent disease, and alopecia 5. Zubrod performance scale (Refer to Appendix C) ≤ 2 or Lansky (Refer to Appendix D) &gt; 60 6. Adequate renal function defined as: For adults serum creatinine &lt; 2 mg/dL For children serum creatinine &lt; 2 mg/dL or &lt; 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) for age (which ever is less) If abnormal creatinine level, 24h creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73m^2 7. Adequate liver function, defined as: Total bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dL and SGPT (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN for age (unless Gilbert's disease or abnormal liver function due to primary disease) 8. Pulmonary symptoms controlled by medication and pulse oximetry&gt; 92% room air 9. New York Heart Association classification &lt; III 10. Negative serum test to rule out pregnancy within 2 weeks prior to registration in females of childbearing potential (non childbearing potential defined as premenarchal, greater than one year postmenopausal, or surgically sterilized) 11. Sexually active males and females of childbearing potential must agree to use a form of contraception considered effective and medically acceptable by the Investigator 12. Negative serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Recipient 1. Investigational therapies in the 4 weeks prior to beginning treatment on this protocol 2. Congestive heart failure &lt; 6 months prior to screening 3. Unstable angina pectoris &lt; 6 months prior to screening 4. Myocardial infarction &lt; 6 months prior to screening Donor 1. Related to recipient (sibling, parent, offspring, offspring of a sibling) 2. HLAhaploidentical to recipient (need not be retested if already performed previously, provided copies of the original results are available) 3. Able and willing to undergo apheresis 4. Willing to donate blood for baseline chimerism assessment 5. Negative serum test to rule out pregnancy within two weeks prior to registration in females of childbearing potential (non childbearing potential defined as premenarchal, greater than one year postmenopausal, or surgically sterilized) 6.
