	<brief_summary>Primary objective: To compare the pharmacokinetic profile of Glymera (PB1023) Injection after a single dose administered by subcutaneous injection to subjects with normal renal function and impaired renal function. Secondary objectives: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Glymera (PB1023) Injection administered as a subcutaneous injection in adult subjects with normal renal function and impaired renal function.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Males and females age 18 79 years of age inclusive. BMI 19 40 kg/m2. Renally Impaired Subjects: In otherwise stable health except for Renal Disease. Healthy volunteers must have/be: eGFR as calculated by MDRD of ≥ 80 mL/min, and Matched to renally impaired subjects for age (± 15 years), weight (± 15 kg), and if possible BMI, race and gender. Subjects with renal impairment must have 2 separate eGFR that are within 20% of each other and clinically stable for a minimum of 6 months. No clinically relevant abnormalities in the results of the laboratory screening or admission evaluation other than those consistent with renal impairment or related disease/disorder in the appropriate subject group as determined by the Investigator. Currently taking or have taken a GLP 1 agent (e.g., Byetta®, Victoza®) within the past year. Subjects who have previously received PB1023. Known allergy or serious adverse effect to an approved or investigational GLP1 receptor analog/agonist. Serious Infection within 60 days of admission. Donation or loss of greater than 400 mL of blood 56 days prior to enrollment. Unstable cardiovascular disease defined as per protocol. Clinically significant hepatic dysfunction defined as per protocol. Female subjects who are pregnant, trying to become pregnant or lactating. Known history of or active alcohol or drug abuse within 12 months prior to Screening or positive alcohol and/or drug screen. Positive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) antibodies, Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) antibodies. Participating in any other study at time of screening other than observational studies or have received any other investigational drug or device within 30 days or 5 halflives prior to dosing or are taking part in a nondrug study which in the opinion of the Investigator would interfere with the outcome of the study.</criteria>
