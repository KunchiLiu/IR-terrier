	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to improve the outcome of elderly patients with CD20+ Aggressive B-Cell Lymphoma and to reduce the toxicity of standard used Immuno-Chemotherapy by using an optimised schedule of the monoclonal antibody Rituximab, substituting conventional by Liposomal Vincristine and by a PET-guided reduction of therapy in Combination with Vitamin D Substitution.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>OPTIMAL&gt;60 / DR. CHOP, Improvement of Therapy of Elderly Patients With CD20+ DLBCL Using Rituximab Optimized and Liposomal Vincristine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective of study: "OPTIMAL&gt;60 Less Favourable" Patients with less favourable prognosis: To test whether progression-free survival (PFS) can be improved by substituting conventional by liposomal vincristine; To test whether PFS can be improved by 12 optimised applications instead of 8 2-week applications of rituximab. "OPTIMAL&gt;60 Favourable": Patients with favourable pro-gnosis: Comparison of neurotoxicity of conventional and liposomal vincristine; Determination of PFS for the treatment strategy of reducing treatment in patients with negative FDG-PET after 4 x R-CHOP/CHLIP-14 (PET-4) and comparison with the corresponding patient population in RICOVER-60. Secondary objectives: "OPTIMAL&gt;60 Favourable" and "OPTIMAL&gt;60 Less Favourable": Comparison of the prognostic value of a pre-treatment FDG-PET (PET-0) with conventional CT/MRT. Investigation of the prognostic value of different FDG-PET derived imaging biomarkers for lymphoma load (SUV, MTV, TLG). Comparison of the FDG-PET-based individualised treatment strategy in OPTIMAL&gt;60 with the fixed (pre-defined) treatment strategy in RICOVER&gt;60. Estimation of the vincristine-related neurotoxicity ("OPTIMAL&gt;60 Less Favourable only, since vincristine related neurotoxicity is primary objective of the study in favourable patients) and other toxicities (all patients). Determination of the therapeutic efficacy of a Vitamin D substitution by comparing the first patients without Vitamin D substitution with patients with Vitamin D substitution.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age: 6180 years 2. All risk groups (IPI 15) 3. Diagnosis of aggressive CD20+ BNHL, based on an excisional biopsy of a lymph node or on an appropriate sample of a lymph node or of an extranodal involvement. It will be possible to treat the following entities in this study as defined by the new WHO classification of 200870: BNHL: Foll. lymphoma grade IIIb DLBCL, not otherwise specified (NOS) common morphologic variants: centroblastic immunoblastic anaplastic rare morphologic variants DLBCL subtypes/entities: Tcell/histiocyterich large Bcell lymphoma primary cutaneous DLBCL, leg type EBVpos. DLBCL of the elderly DLBCL associated with chronic inflammation primary mediastinal (thymic) LBCL intravascular large Bcelllymphoma ALKpositive large Bcelllymphoma plasmoblastic lymphoma primary effusion lymphoma transformed indolent lymphoma secondary or simultaneous high grade Bcelllymphoma Bcell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between DLBCL and Burkitt lymphoma Bcell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between DLCBL and Hodgkin lymphoma 4. Performance status ECOG 0 2 after prephase treatment. The performance status of each patient must be assessed before the initiation and after the end of prephase treatment which, as experience has shown, can result in a significant improvement of the patient's performance status. The pretreatment performance status which can range from ECOG 0 to ECOG 4 must be documented in the Staging CRF (see ISF); the performance status after the prephase treatment must be documented in the respective Prephase Treatment CRF (PT form: see ISF). A definition of the performance status is provided in Appendix 28.10. 5. Written informed consent of the patient 6. Contract of participation signed by the study centre and sponsor 1. Already initiated lymphoma therapy (except for the prephase treatment) 2. Serious accompanying disorder or impaired organ function (except when due to lymphoma involvement), in particular: heart: angina pectoris CCS &gt;2, cardiac failure e.g. NYHA &gt;2 and/or EF &lt;50% or FS&lt;25% in nuclear medicine examination/echocardiography lungs: if respiratory problems are suspected the patient is to be excluded if the resultant pulmonary function test shows FeV1&lt;50% or a diffusion capacity &lt;50% of the reference values kidneys: creatinine &gt;2 times the upper reference limit liver: bilirubin &gt;2 times the upper reference limit, aspartate transaminase (AST, SGOT) or alanine transaminase (ALT, SGPT) &gt;3 x institutional upper reference limit uncontrollable diabetes mellitus (prephase treatment with predniso[lo]ne!) 3. Platelets &lt;75 000/mm3, leukocytes &lt;2 500/mm3 (if not due to lymphoma) 4. Known hypersensitivity to the medications to be used 5. Known HIVpositivity 6. Patients with severe impairment of immune defense 7. Patients with constipation with imminent risk of ileus 8. Chronic active hepatitis 9. Poor patient compliance 10. Simultaneous participation in other treatment studies or in another clinical trial within the last 6 months 11. Prior chemo or radiotherapy, longterm use of corticosteroids or antineoplastic drugs for previous disorder 12. Other concomitant tumour disease and/or tumour disease in the past 5 years (except for localised skin tumors other than melanoma and carcinomas in situ of any other origin) 13. CNS involvement of lymphoma (intracerebral, meningeal, intraspinal intradural) or primary CNS lymphoma 14. Persistent neuropathy grade â‰¥2 (NCI CTCAE v4.03) (unless due to lymphoma involvement) 15. History of persistent active neurologic disorders grade &gt;2 including demyelinating form of CharcotMarieTooth syndrome, acquired demyelinating disorders, or other demyelinating condition 16. Pregnancy or breastfeeding women 17. Active serious infections not controlled by oral and/or intravenous antibiotics or antifungal medication 18. Any medical condition which in the opinion of the investigator places the subject at an unacceptably high risk for toxicities. 19. MALT lymphoma 20. Nonconformity to eligibility criteria 21. Persons not able to understand the impact, nature, risks and consequences of the trial (including language barrier) 22. Persons not agreeing to the transmission of their pseudonymous data 23. Persons depending on sponsor or investigator 24. Persons from highly protected groups. Pts. with CNS lymphoma should not be included in this study.</criteria>
