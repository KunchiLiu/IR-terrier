	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Canephron® N in the Management of Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections (uUTI)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>250 patients total 7-day treatment period with Canephron® N (2 tablets three times a day) and a follow-up period until Day 37. A total of three visits are planned on Day 0 (screening, start of study treatment), Day 7 (end of study treatment) and Day 37 (end of study visit). Additional visits can be performed anytime between Day 1 and Day 37 if deemed necessary by the investigator. In case the patients experience consistent or worsening of symptoms they may be offered antibiotic therapy at the discretion of the investigator at any time. In this case Canephron® N intake will be stopped. At least 50% of the patients, i.e. 125 subjects, should have received a 7-day treatment with Canephron® N. If less subjects are available recruitment of subjects will be continued until the required number of 125 subjects is reached. Due to withdrawal of study in Russia total study population was reduced to 125 patients.</detailed_description>

Main Any signs evoking complicated UTI, pyelonephritis and/or concomitant vulvovaginitis Any conditions that may lead to complicated infections (that is, renal diseases, urinary tract abnormalities or past urinary surgery, urine catheterization, etc).

Current signs or symptoms of severe, progressive or uncontrolled lifethreatening systemic disease i.e. renal, hepatic, haematological, gastrointestinal, endocrine, pulmonary, cardiac, neurological, or cerebral disease. Other acute infection (except UTI) requiring antibiotic treatment. Patients receiving treatment for presumed or proven urinary tract infection within 4 weeks prior to study entry. Antibiotic, immunosuppressive or immunostimulant (incl. vaccines) therapy within 4 weeks prior to study entry. Patients with known history of anatomical genitourinary (GU) anomalies or GU surgery within 6 months prior to study entry. Patients with known clinically significant abnormalities in screening physical examination, laboratory tests or vital signs. Peptic ulcers and hypersensitivity and/or idiosyncrasy to centaury herb, lovage root, rosemary leaves or one of the other ingredients of the investigational medicinal product.
