	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Long-term Safety of Repeated QUTENZA Administration for Treatment of Pain Caused by Nerve Damage in Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients will be divided into 3 groups of approximately equal size. In the first group, patients will receive a QUTENZA patch applied for 30 minutes to the feet; in the second group, patients will receive a QUTENZA patch applied for 60 minutes to the feet. In both these groups patients will also continue to receive their normal treatment (Standard of Care (SOC)) for their peripheral neuropathic pain (PNP) and may receive further QUTENZA patch applications in the same way during the study. The third group will not receive a QUTENZA patch but will continue to receive their normal treatment for their neuropathic pain (SOC). Subjects will be involved in the study for up to 15 months and will have to visit the clinic at least 9 times.</detailed_description>
