	<brief_summary>This trial is to determine if prostate target delineation obtained through an ultrasound based system is equivalent in accuracy to the MRI image fusion, and if alignment correction vectors obtained from ultrasound imaging are of equivalent accuracy to orthogonal X-ray imaging for daily prostate positioning.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Evaluation of Polymer Based Fiducials for Use in Imaging Patients Receiving Treatment for Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will also be assessing the following: 1. Whether polymer-based markers can be adequately visualized on daily stereoscopic imaging compared to gold seed markers. 2. Whether polymer-based markers are visible on ultrasound imaging. 3. To determine if the polymer-based marker produces fewer artifacts on treatment planning CT scans than gold markers.</detailed_description>
