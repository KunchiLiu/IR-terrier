	<brief_summary>The Study plan is a post-market prospective, multi-center, open-label registry. The vein graft failure rates for the currently commercialized C-Port devices will be compared to an a priori rate taken from the peer-reviewed literature.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi-center Assessment of Grafts in Coronaries: Long-term Evaluation of the C-Port Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To satisfy the requirements set forth in post-market surveillance orders issued by the US FDA to Cardica, Inc., the following outcomes will be evaluated: 1. Acute, midterm, and one-year graft failure rates for coronary revascularization using the C-Port® xA™ Distal Anastomosis System, C-Port® FlexA™ Distal Anastomosis System, and C-Port® XCHANGE™ Distal Anastomosis System when in general use in the United States compared to hand-sewn anastomoses. 2. Technical failure rates when attempting to complete an anastomosis using the C-Port xA, FlexA, and XCHANGE Distal Anastomosis Systems. 3. The technical success rate of hand-sewn anastomoses following technical failures of the C-Port devices and the hand-sewn graft patency rates and clinical sequelae at one year.</detailed_description>
