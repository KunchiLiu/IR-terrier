	<brief_title>To Evaluate the Effect of Mirabegron (YM178) on Blood Levels of Desipramine When They Are Taken Together</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label, one-sequence crossover design study to evaluate the drug-drug interaction between mirabegron and desipramine. The effect of mirabegron on the plasma concentration of desipramine will be evaluated after 13 day repeated administration. The recovery of CYP2D6 activity is also being explored by comparing the pharmacokinetic profiles of desipramine after a 2 week wash-out period.</detailed_description>
