	<brief_title>Conversion Study From Epoetin Alfa to Monthly Peginesatide Injection in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease on Dialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Monthly Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents (ESA) dosing, compared with the longstanding practice of dosing three times per week, represents a significant change in anemia treatment for dialysis patients. Because of the differences in the processes needed to support monthly dosing versus thrice weekly dosing, there is a need to prospectively identify and evaluate factors in the dialysis environment during center-level transition of patients from one ESA to another. AFX01-18 is a Phase 3b open-label, single-arm conversion study that was conducted at 5 hemodialysis sites in the United States, and enrolled Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients receiving outpatient, in-center hemodialysis. The study treatment period was approximately 12 months in duration. Participants received peginesatide injection for approximately six months.</detailed_description>
