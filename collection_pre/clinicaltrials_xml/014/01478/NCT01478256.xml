	<brief_title>Comparative Study in the Efficacy of Topical Besifloxocin With Erythromycin for the Management of Acute Blepharitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a pilot project involving thirty patients with a specific form of inflammtion of the lids called anterior blepharitis. The patients are graded for their signs a symptoms and then randomized to receive either topical Besifloxocin or Erythromycin in addition to standard lid hygiene measures. All patients have cultures of their eyelids performed prior to initiating therapy and are followed for four weeks. The antibiotics are used for two weeks following which repeat cultures of the lids are obtained. The patients are followed for one additional week to ensure that there is no recurrence of their symptoms once the antibiotics are discontinued. Only adult patients (age 18-100)and women who are not of child bearing potential are included in this study. Then patients have to have symptoms and signs of the disease, blepharitis. Patient who are on unstable antibiotic or steroid regimens and those who cannot discontinue contact lens use are not included in this study.</detailed_description>
