	<brief_summary>The proposed study will evaluate the safety of the rMenB+OMV NZ in an adult population potentially at risk for meningococcal disease (e.g. lab workers). In the second part of the study additional blood samples of high responding vaccinated subjects will be collected for the purpose of generating a control serum panel for the human serum bactericidal assay (hSBA) tests.</brief_summary>
