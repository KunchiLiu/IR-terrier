	<detailed_description>Adipose tissue is recognized as an important endocrine organ in human. Not only it has function of storing unlimited energy but also its secretory roles is subject to intense research in recent years. Acylation stimulating protein(ASP), Retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) and lipocalin-2 (LCN2) are circulating adipokines elevated in diabetes. C5L2 is a G-protein-coupled receptor. activation of C5L2 by ASP, has been shown. Fatty acids may influence the expression of adipokines. Epidemiological studies showed that omega-3 reduce the development of insulin resistance and diabetes. Because fatty acids are the main component of adipose tissue, it is essential interest to clarify the biological effects of omega-3 on the expression of relevant adipokines.</detailed_description>
