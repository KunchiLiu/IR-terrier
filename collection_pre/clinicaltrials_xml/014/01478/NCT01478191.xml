	<brief_summary>This is a retrospective analysis of a homogeneous cohort of patients with relapsed/refractory HL that received IGEV scheme as induction therapy to HDCT and AHSCT for reassess the most common prognostic factors and try to identify a prognostic score with clinical and therapeutic relevance by using 6 clinical tools: 1. B symptoms(yes/no) 2. relapse in previously irradiated areas(yes/no) 3. Ann Arbor Stage (III/IV vs I/II) 4. disease status at accrual (refractory vs relapsed) 5. Early relapse within 12 months of Complete Response (CR) versus late relapse after Complete Response (CR) lasting &gt; l2 months", 6. extranodal involvement (yes/no).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient with a history of classical HL relapsed/refractory which received IGEV regimen as induction therapy before high dose chemotherapy with AHSCT Age &gt;18 years Patients with relapsed/refractory disease after standard treatments (chemotherapy +/ radiotherapy) before IGEV induction regimen. (Relapsed = disease relapse after CR. Refractory = non CR with last chemotherapy line, or progression during last treatment, or disease progression within three months from previous treatment completion). Availability of clinical data, laboratory values and CT scan results of patients enrolled, performed from diagnosis to the last followup Patient scheduled to receive three or four IGEV cycles as pretransplantation induction regimen. First IGEV course started before December 31st 2007 Assessment of tumor response by Cheson 1999 criteria 11</criteria>
