	<brief_summary>This randomized pilot trial studies omega-3 fatty acid in preventing joint symptoms in patients with stage I-III breast cancer receiving anastrozole, exemestane, or letrozole. Omega-3 fatty acid supplement may lessen or prevent joint stiffness or pain in patients receiving hormone therapy for breast cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Omega-3 Fatty Acids in Preventing Joint Symptoms in Patients With Stage I-III Breast Cancer Receiving Anastrozole, Exemestane, or Letrozole</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the feasibility of evaluating joint symptoms in postmenopausal women with breast cancer randomized to n-3 PUFA (omega-3 fatty acid) vs. placebo supplementation using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) and endocrine subscale (FACT-ES), Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and Stanford's Health Assessment -Disability Index (HAS) during the first 6 months of adjuvant aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy. II. To preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of n-3 PUFA vs. placebo supplementation on AI induced joint symptoms. III. To explore blood and imaging based biomarkers (plasma and red blood cell [RBC] levels of n-3 PUFAs, inflammatory cytokines and receptors, and intra-articular tenosynovial inflammation by musculoskeletal magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] imaging) of AI-induced joint symptoms in women on AI therapy randomized to n-3 PUFAs vs. placebo supplementation. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive omega-3 fatty acid orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</detailed_description>
