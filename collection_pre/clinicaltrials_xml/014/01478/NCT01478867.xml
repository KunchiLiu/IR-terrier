	<brief_title>Detection of Immunotoxic Gluten Peptides in Feces</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Certain immunotoxic peptides from gluten are resistant to gastrointestinal digestion and can interact with celiac patient factors to trigger immunological response. Gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only effective treatment for celiac disease (CD) and its compliance should be monitored to avoid accumulative damage. However, practical methods to monitor diet compliance and to detect the origin of an outbreak of celiac clinical symptoms are not available. This study assesses the capacity to determine the gluten ingestion, and to monitor the GFD compliance in celiac patients by detection of gluten and gliadin 33-mer equivalent peptidic epitopes in human feces.</detailed_description>
