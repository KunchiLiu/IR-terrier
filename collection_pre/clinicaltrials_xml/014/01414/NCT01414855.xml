	<brief_summary>This open-label, multicenter study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of obinutuzumab [RO5072759 (GA101)] in combination with CHOP (Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, Prednisone) chemotherapy in patients with advanced diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Patients will receive 8 cycles of obinutuzumab (1000 mg intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle, during Cycle 1 obinutuzumab will also be infused on Days 8 and 15) in combination with CHOP chemotherapy on Day 1 of cycles 1 to 6. A substudy will investigate the drug-drug interaction of obinutuzumab with CHOP chemotherapy agents. For the substudy, an additional cohort of approximately 15 patients are planned to be enrolled at a subset of investigational sites.</brief_summary>
