	<brief_summary>Despite increasing availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV in high prevalence countries, the majority of people with HIV infection still initiate treatment at an advanced stage of disease. This leads to a high risk of death soon after HIV diagnosis. Prompt HIV diagnosis is, therefore, necessary for both individual and public health benefit and is being strongly promoted as international and national policy in Malawi. However timely HIV diagnosis may not in itself be sufficient to ensure ART initiation: this is reflected by the relatively high proportion of individuals who defer treatment-seeking for months or years following diagnosis of HIV. Here the researchers investigate the extent to which home assessment and initiation of ART adds to the effectiveness of a home-based HIV testing and counseling strategy, using entry to, adherence with, and retention in HIV care as the outcome of interest.</brief_summary>
