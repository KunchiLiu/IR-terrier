	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and efficacy of 4 monthly injections of iSONEP given alone or in combination with Lucentis, Avastin or Eylea in subjects with wet Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). iSONEP not only has an anti-permeability effect, but also has anti-angiogenic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic properties. The drug may therefore have the ability to achieve better visual outcomes than Lucentis, Avastin or Eylea, particularly in those subjects who do not demonstrate a robust response to Lucentis, Avastin or Eylea after several monthly injections. Further, the combination of Lucentis, Avastin or Eylea and iSONEP may be additive or synergistic. By inhibiting the multiple mechanisms that contribute to exudative-AMD-related vision loss, better visual outcomes may be possible than with Lucentis, Avastin or Eylea alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of iSONEP With &amp; Without Lucentis/Avastin/Eylea to Treat Wet AMD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study will be conducted in subjects who qualify as "sub-responders" to Lucentis, Avastin or Eylea meaning that each subject has (i) residual subretinal or intra-retinal fluid observed on Cirrus or Spectralis Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT), (ii) leakage on fluorescein angiogram (FA), and (iii) an average central subfield thickness of ≥250 μm. Additionally, each subject will have previously received a minimum of 3 intravitreous (IVT) injections of Lucentis, Avastin or Eylea within the 12-month period prior to screening. Screening must occur between 28 and 65 days from the subject's last Lucentis or Avastin treatment or between 42 and 79 days from the subject's last Eylea treatment. Subjects must be dosed within 14 days of screening, and as of the day of initial study treatment (Day 0), meet the following criteria: (i) Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of ≥25 and ≤73 letters (approximately 20/320 and 20/40 on the Snellen scale), (ii) residual subretinal or intra-retinal fluid observed on Cirrus or Spectralis SDOCT, and (iii) leakage on FA.</detailed_description>
