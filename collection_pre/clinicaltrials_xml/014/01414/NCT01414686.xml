	<brief_summary>More than half of individuals post-stroke have residual movement disabilities, including reduced mobility, balance, and increased risk of falling. There is a need for innovative, long-term and economically-feasible interventions for those with chronic stroke. Recently, a focus has been placed on the use of virtual reality and interactive gaming as a low cost and effective manner of treating movement disorders. Yet few studies have investigated interactive gaming platforms effect on balance following stroke. The proposed study is a randomized, single-blind, control group cross-over study for individuals with chronic stroke designed to examine an innovative therapeutic approach by investigating the effects of commercially-available gaming systems on balance, mobility and fear of falling in a sample of individuals with chronic motor deficits following stroke.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective: To determine if playing active video games results in improved balance and motor performance. Design: Randomized-matched, single-blind, control group cross-over study Setting: Laboratory Patients: Participants with chronic hemiparesis post-stroke were randomly assigned to a gaming group or normal activity control group. Interventions: Gaming systems provided an interactive interface of real-time movement of either themselves or an avatar on the screen. Participants played games 1 hour/day, 4 days/week, for 5 weeks, totaling 20 hours of game-play. The intervention was strictly game-play without physical therapy. All games were played in standing position and trainers supervised to protect against loss of balance. Measurements: Both groups were tested prior to and following the 5 weeks (post-test) and 3 months following the completion of the intervention/control. Outcome measures included: Fugl-Meyer Motor Exam, Single Leg Stance time, symmetrical weight bearing, Berg Balance Scale, Dynamic Gait Index, Timed Up and Go, Six Minute Walk, 3 Meter Walk, step length differential, and perception of recovery.</detailed_description>
