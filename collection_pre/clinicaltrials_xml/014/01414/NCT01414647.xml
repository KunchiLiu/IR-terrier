	<brief_summary>Dietary polyphenols might have beneficial effects on glucose and lipid metabolism based on the studies made in animals or cell cultures. The findings regarding the possible decrease of low-grade inflammation are existing also in humans. Low-grade inflammation has been suggested to be a mechanistic link between obesity and its consequences on cardiometabolic health. The aim of the present study is to examine the effect of diet rich in berries on glucose and lipid metabolism and inflammatory markers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Health Effect of Diet Rich in Nordic Berries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Berries are traditionally an important part of the Nordic diet. About 50 different berries are grown in the northern region, and about half of them are edible. Phenolic compounds are one of the most diverse group of secondary metabolites present in edible plants, and berries are especially rich in them. Flavonoids, phenolic acids, lignans and complex phenolic polymers (polymeric tannins) are typical for berries. Phenolic compounds are reported to have a variety of beneficial biological properties. They are potent antioxidants, and exhibit various other physiological activities including anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiallergic, anticarcinogenic and antihypertensive activities. Epidemiological studies indicate that diet rich in phenolic compound correlates with lower risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease. The aim of the present study is to examine the effect of diet rich in berries on glucose and lipid metabolism and inflammatory markers and gene expression profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in subjects with features of metabolic syndrome. Randomized, controlled clinical intervention including 4 wk run-in period, 8 wk dietary intervention and 4 wk recovery period was conducted.</detailed_description>
