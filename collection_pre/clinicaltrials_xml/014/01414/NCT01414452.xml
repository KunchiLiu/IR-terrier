	<brief_summary>There is experimental evidence that low levels of adiponectin are associated with more reperfusion injury. In addition experimental studies have demonstrated that endothelial progenitor cells may have a favorable effect on remodeling, mainly through stimulation of neo-revascularisation. Clinical data on these issues are lacking. This clinical project studies the role of adiponectin, endothelial progenitor cells and endothelial microparticles in the ischaemia-reperfusion process and the compensatory ventricular remodelling in a population of 250 infarction patients treated with primary PCI. If the role of these factors could be confirmed in this clinical setting, those factors might represent a new target for therapeutic interventions in AMI patients.</brief_summary>
