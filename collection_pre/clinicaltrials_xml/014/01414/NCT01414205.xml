	<brief_summary>This open-label, multicenter, randomized study will compare the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of obinutuzumab (RO5072759; GA101) 1000 mg versus 2000 mg in participants with previously untreated CLL. Participants will be randomized to receive a maximum of 8 cycles (28-day cycle) of obinutuzumab (1000 mg intravenous [IV] infusion, on Days 1, 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of each subsequent cycle up to 8 cycles or maximum of 8 cycles of obinutuzumab (2000 mg IV infusion, on Days 1, 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of each subsequent cycle up to 8 cycles.</brief_summary>
