	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to establish if the application of autologous conditioned plasma (ACP), also described as platelet rich plasma (PRP), to the site of supraspinatus tendon repair beginning within two weeks of surgery, can improve patient outcomes over the course of 12 months. These outcomes will be measured by post-surgical pain and function scores, shoulder strength and range of motion (ROM), and radiological parameters of tendon healing. Outcome measures will be compared to a control group of patients receiving placebo injections following surgery (saline plus local anaesthetic). This study is significant for being the first double blind randomised control trial, using two PRP injections to examine the efficacy of a PRP preparation following surgical repair of supraspinatus tendon. The objective is to prolong and enhance the tendon healing response initiated by surgery. The research hypothesis is that enhanced tendon healing following the PRP injections will lead to more rapid rehabilitation and lower rates of re-rupture of the repaired tendon compared to the control group.</brief_summary>
