	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare and contrast the effects of a prebiotic (Trametes Versicolor), a probiotic (Saccharomyces boulardii) and an antibiotic (amoxicillin) on the gut microbiota of healthy volunteers. It is expected that treatment will result in the rapid and reproducible alterations in fecal microbiota that will spontaneously reverse in the weeks after treatment is discontinued.</brief_summary>
