	<detailed_description>The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether a 12 week Pilates based core stability training programme is effective in improving balance, mobility and balance confidence in ambulant individuals with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The secondary aim is to determine the relative effectiveness of this 12 week Pilates based core stability training programme compared to a standardised physiotherapy exercise programme. Finally we intend to explore the underlying mechanisms of change associated with these exercise interventions by directly measuring changes in muscle thickness and activation in the deep abdominal core stabilising muscles of a sub-set of participants.</detailed_description>
