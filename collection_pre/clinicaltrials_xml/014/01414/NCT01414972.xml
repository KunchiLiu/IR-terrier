	<brief_title>The Effect of Vitamin A on Atherosclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atherosclerosis, the leading cause of death and disability in the world, is considered an inflammatory disease with a complex etiology. The immune system has a prominent role in the formation, development and destabilization of atherosclerotic plaques. A whole range of identified cytokines have been shown to play a part in atherogenesis, some with proatherogenic properties while others having antiatherogenic properties. With increasing evidence for the significant role of inflammation and the cytokines involved together with the Th1/Th2 imbalance in atherosclerosis and its progression to Coronary artery diseases (CADs), the control of cytokine production may become potential therapeutic targets and modulation of the Th1/Th2 balance may provide a new pharmacological tool to treat this disease. Vitamin A (VA) or VA-like analogs known as retinoids, are potent hormonal modifiers of type 1 or type 2 responses but a definitive description of their mechanism(s) of action is lacking. high level dietary vitamin A enhances Th2 cytokine production and IgA responses, and is likely to decrease Th1 cytokine production. Retinoic acid inhibits IL 12 production in activated macrophages, and RA pretreatment of macrophages reduces IFNγ production and increases IL4 production in antigen primed CD4 T cells. Supplemental treatment with vitamin A or retinoic acid (RA) decreases IFNγ and increases IL5, IL10, and IL4 production. Thus, vitamin A deficiency biases the immune response in a Th1 direction, whereas high level dietary vitamin A may bias the response in a Th2 direction.</detailed_description>
