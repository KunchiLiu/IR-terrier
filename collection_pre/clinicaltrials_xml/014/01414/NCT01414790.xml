	<brief_title>The Use of Human Acellular Dermal Matrix to Improve Infraauricular Depressed Deformities and Frey's Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Seventy patients who underwent total parotidectomy were selected for inclusion in the study. We analyzed 41 cases of total parotidectomy (control group) and 29 cases of simultaneous ADM implantation following total parotidectomy (ADM group) for infraauricular depressed deformities and the presence of gustatory flushing or sweating. The follow-up periods ranged from 6 months to 7 years. The Results showed facial contours and bilateral symmetry improved after surgery in the ADM group. In the control group, an infraauricular depressed deformity was evident in all 41 cases. Frey's syndrome was recorded in one patient (3.4%) from the ADM group and 14 patients (34.1%) from the control group. No cases of immune rejection, infection, hematoma, or salivary fistula were observed in either group.</detailed_description>
