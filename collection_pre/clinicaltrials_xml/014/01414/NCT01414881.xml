	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this Phase I exploratory study is to determine the effects of mipomersen on the hepatic production of apolipoprotein-B (apo B) in very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) compared to baseline levels. The study will consist of a Screening Period, a 1-week Run-in Period to establish a stable diet, an approximate 11-week Treatment Period with Placebo or Mipomersen, and a 25-week Post-Treatment Follow-up Period. The total duration of any given subject's participation will be approximately 40 weeks.</brief_summary>
