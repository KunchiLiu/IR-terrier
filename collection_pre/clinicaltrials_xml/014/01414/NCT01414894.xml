	<brief_summary>The purpose of our study is to determine how well Triple-H works and how safe it is. The investigators are hoping to determine the effects of starting the therapy early and to explore if hypervolemia and/or hypertension are beneficial, and what the optimal target ranges are.</brief_summary>

Treatment of aneurysm with clipping or coiling must be carried out prior to randomization and within 72 hours of bleeding 6. Signed consent by study participant or applicable legal representative within 72 hours after SAH 1. History of traumatic SAH 2. Nonaneurysmal SAH as indicated by no demonstrable aneurysm by cerebral angiography 3. Presence of an unsecured intracranial aneurysm(s) at risk of rupture that in the opinion of the Investigator would compromise the safety of the patient or the quality of the data 4. Delayed referral with clipping/coiling greater than 72 hours after the initial bleeding 5. Time of symptom onset cannot be reliably determined 6. Intracranial hypertension (ICP &gt;25 mm Hg) at the time of screening 7. History within the past six months and/or physical findings on admission of decompensated congestive heart failure (NYHA functional class III or IV, or objective class C or D) 8.
