	<brief_summary>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder that is estimated to affect 20% of the US population. IBS patients have significantly decreased quality of life and utilize large amounts of health care resources. IBS patients suffer from chronic abdominal pain associated with diarrhea, constipation, and/or bloating. Several recent studies have shown that diarrhea-predominant IBS (D-IBS) patients have increased intestinal permeability that may lead to chronic gastrointestinal symptoms. Previously, it has been well established that deficiencies in glutamine may lead to increased membrane permeability and supplementation with glutamine can restore intestinal membrane permeability. The investigators hypothesize that oral glutamine supplementation will improve the IBS Symptom Severity Scale and restore intestinal membrane permeability in diarrhea-predominant IBS patients. The investigators propose to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial studying glutamine compared to placebo for 8 weeks in 100 diarrhea-predominant IBS patients. This will lead to the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To determine if oral glutamine supplementation will improve the IBS Symptom Severity Scale in IBS patients. To accomplish this aim, the investigators will measure the change in the IBS Symptom Severity Scale following treatment with either oral glutamine supplementation or placebo. The primary outcome measure will be an improvement or clinically significant response to treatment of ≥50 from the baseline score on the IBS Symptom Severity Scale. Specific Aim 2: To determine if oral glutamine supplementation will restore intestinal permeability in IBS patients. To accomplish this aim, the investigators will measure the change in the intestinal permeability following treatment with either oral glutamine supplementation or placebo.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Abstract Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder that is estimated to affect 20% of the US population. IBS patients have significantly decreased quality of life and utilize large amounts of health care resources. IBS patients suffer from chronic abdominal pain associated with diarrhea, constipation, and/or bloating. Several mechanisms that may lead to IBS have been proposed including: alterations in receptors and neuropeptides, bacterial overgrowth and altered microbiota, altered intestinal transit, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and increased intestinal membrane permeability. Several recent studies have shown that diarrhea-predominant IBS (D-IBS) patients have increased intestinal permeability that may lead to chronic gastrointestinal symptoms. Our laboratory recently evaluated diarrhea-predominant IBS patients and reported that they have increased membrane permeability. The investigators now have obtained preliminary evidence that oral glutamine supplementation restores membrane permeability and improves chronic gastrointestinal symptoms in these IBS patients. Previously, it has been well established that deficiencies in glutamine may lead to increased membrane permeability and supplementation with glutamine can restore intestinal membrane permeability. There are no published studies to date to support the use of glutamine for Irritable Bowel Syndrome. However, given our preliminary data and the mechanisms of action of glutamine on the gastrointestinal tract, research testing whether oral glutamine is an effective therapy in Irritable Bowel Syndrome is definitely needed. Based on these new findings, the investigators hypothesize that oral glutamine supplementation will improve the IBS Symptom Severity Scale and restore intestinal membrane permeability in diarrhea-predominant IBS patients. The investigators propose to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial studying glutamine 10 g po tid compared to placebo 10 g po tid for 8 weeks in 100 diarrhea-predominant IBS patients. The IBS Symptom Severity Scale and intestinal membrane permeability will be measured at baseline, 2, 4, 6, and at 8 weeks. The results of this study will lead to the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To determine if oral glutamine supplementation will improve the IBS Symptom Severity Scale in IBS patients. To accomplish this aim, the investigators will measure the change in the IBS Symptom Severity Scale following treatment with either oral glutamine supplementation or placebo. The primary outcome measure will be an improvement of ≥50 from the baseline score on the IBS Symptom Severity Scale. This constitutes a clinically significant response to treatment. Hypothesis 1. IBS patients will have an improvement of ≥50 on the IBS Symptom Severity Scale following oral glutamine supplementation compared to placebo. Specific Aim 2: To determine if oral glutamine supplementation will restore intestinal membrane permeability in IBS patients. To accomplish this aim, the investigators will measure the change in the intestinal membrane permeability following treatment with either oral glutamine supplementation or placebo. Hypothesis 2a. Oral glutamine supplementation will restore intestinal membrane permeability in IBS patients compared to placebo. Hypothesis 2b. Improvement in the IBS Symptom Severity Scale is correlated with restoration of intestinal membrane permeability following oral glutamine compared to placebo. Layman Statement: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain associated with an alteration in bowel habits with diarrhea and/or constipation. IBS patients with diarrhea have been shown to have a "leaky gut" in which bacteria and toxins may penetrate the gut wall, termed increased membrane permeability. The current proposal will investigate oral glutamine supplementation as a treatment of symptoms and "leaky gut" in diarrhea-predominant IBS patients.</detailed_description>
