	<brief_title>Study of Effectiveness of Adding the Health Promotion and Rehabilitation for Treatment for Alcohol and Drug Abusers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Alcohol and drug abuse are followed by tremendous physical, psychological and social problems as well as early death. Heavy smoking, poor nutrition, physical inactivity and chronic diseases (co-morbidity) are often part of these problems and illnesses. There seems to be a large potential for a better outcome by including smoking cessation, physical training, diet and nutrition as well as co-morbidity in a multi-disciplinary setting - a potential not used yet. This Very Integrated Program (VIP) is inspired from the rehabilitation offered to patients with chronic diseases and surgical patients having a likewise unhealthy lifestyle and similar co-morbidity. Aim: to evaluate the effect of adding the VIP program to the usual alcohol and drug intervention on the outcome for alcohol and drug abusers compared to the usual intervention alone. The VIP project consists of 3 steps: 1. To map the health status and estimate the potential improvement for 400 alcohol and drug abusers 2. To pilot test the VIP program 3. To evaluate it compared to the daily routines for 260 alcohol and drug abusers with a poor health status in a randomised controlled trial. Main outcome: Change from abuser to non-abuser. Secondary outcomes are health status; quality of life, use of health services, time return to work (or similar activity level), harm reduction, and cost-effectiveness.</detailed_description>
