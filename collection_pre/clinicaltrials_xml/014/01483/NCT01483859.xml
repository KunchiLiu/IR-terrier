	<brief_summary>Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) using Fibroscan®(EchoSens, Paris, France) is a newly introduced noninvasive tool that generates an elastic wave using a vibrator applied to the thoracic wall at the level of the right lobe of the liver and measures the prolongation velocity of the wave, which is directly associated with liver stiffness (LS). Although recent advances in surgical techniques and perioperative management have made with established perioperative management have now made it possible to perform hepatectomies as a safe procedure with minimum mortality, the possibility of massive blood loss and resultant transfusion during hepatectomy still exist. The objective of this research was to identify the role of liver stiffness measurement for the prediction of intraoperative blood loss and postoperative recovery after elective right hepatectomy.</brief_summary>
