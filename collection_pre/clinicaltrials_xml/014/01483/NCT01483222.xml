	<brief_title>Comparison of Inelastic and Elastic Lumbosacral Orthoses on Low Back Pain Prevention in Hospital Nurses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low back pain occurs frequently and is one of the most costly health problems affecting industry and society. Prevention of low back pain is important both for the individual patient and from an economic perspective. Therefore, there are many measures available that claim to reduce low back pain and its recurrence. The most commonly used preventive strategies are fitness exercises, lumbar supports, education on back mechanics and lifting techniques, and ergonomic adjustments. However, their efficacy is still uncertain. The main objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of two different design characteristics of lumbar support for low back pain prevention in hospital nurses. Investigators hope that those two types of lumbar support will reduce the incidence of low back pain and sick leave days. In addition, Investigators hypothesize that there are some differences on outcome measures between those two types of lumbar support. Enrolled subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the following three groups. The first group will wear an inelastic lumbar support for 6 months. The second group will wear an elastic lumbar support for 6 months. The third group will receive no intervention. After the completion of 6-month intervention, a further 6 months fellow-up will be added.</detailed_description>
