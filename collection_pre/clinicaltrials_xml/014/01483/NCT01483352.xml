	<brief_summary>The Accu-Chek DiaPort system enables continuous intraperitoneal insulin infusion (CIPII): that is, infusion of insulin into the peritoneal cavity using an Accu-Chek insulin pump and an infusion set. The Accu-Chek DiaPort consists of a metal body with a catheter that is placed in the abdomen. The opening of the port is raised above the surface of the skin about 5 millimeters, while a flower-shaped plate is placed under the skin, providing stability for the port. The port has been designed for those diabetics who cannot benefit fully from subcutaneous insulin infusion. The primary objective of the study is to assess the suitability of Accu-Chek DiaPort to perform continuous intraperitoneal insulin delivery. The data collection focuses on the condition of tissue around the port after the implantation, possible peritoneal reactions to the port system, and the peritoneal delivery of insulin. Secondary objectives are the assessments of therapeutic performance and successful implementation of design requirements. In total 12 Patients will participate in this open, mono-centre, single-arm, interventional clinical trial. The study lasts 9 months (without run in period of 3 to 1 week) separated in two parts. Phase I last 12 weeks. Phase II last 6 month until the end of the study. During the study, seven visits are planned. The screening visit can take place up to 3 weeks before study start. At the implantation visit which can last up to 5 days the port will be implanted. After the implantation insulin therapy will be adjusted for CIPII and the patients will be trained for handling and daily care of the Accu-Chek DiaPort system. To check the functionality of the system, the first control visit will take place 2 weeks and the second control visit 6 weeks after the implantation. At the week 12 visit, the most important parameters will be collected for the phase I report. The following visits take place 6 and 9 months after the implantation.</brief_summary>
