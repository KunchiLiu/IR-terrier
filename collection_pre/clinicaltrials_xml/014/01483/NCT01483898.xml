	<brief_summary>This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ixmyelocel-T, a patient-specific expanded multicellular therapy, for the treatment of patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI). The study is a randomized, vehicle controlled (placebo)study in CLI patients who have no option for revascularization procedures. All patients randomized will undergo a small volume bone marrow aspiration in a 15-minute outpatient or in-office procedure. All patients will receive injections of either ixmyelocel-T or vehicle-control into their pre-identified index leg. Patients will be followed for 18 months.</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Ischemia</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Males and nonpregnant, nonlactating females Ages 35 to 90 years of age Diagnosis of CLI with tissue loss (corresponding to Rutherford Category 5; see Appendix B) having an ulcer size of at least 0.5 cm2, a smaller sized ulcer penetrating into the subcutaneous tissue, and/or gangrene (dry). In addition, the subject must have ONE of the following documented at screening: Ankle systolic pressure &lt; 70 mm Hg Toe systolic pressure &lt; 50 mm Hg TcPO2 &lt; 30 mm Hg (in a supine position) Subjects must have no reasonable standardofcare options for surgical or endovascular revascularization interventions Subjects must have the following: A narrative documenting the reasons why the site vascular specialist considers the subject "no option". A vascular specialist will be the principal investigator (PI) or subinvestigator and is defined as: vascular surgeon, interventional cardiologist, certified vascular medicine specialist, or interventional radiologist; AND Secondary confirmation by an independent Eligibility Review Committee (ERC; see Section 8.1) after review of appropriate documents including, but not limited to: imaging results, medical records, surgical history, site vascular specialist narrative documenting reasons for "no option," and/or lab reports. Major amputation in the index leg or death is not anticipated within 3 months of screening in the opinion of the vascular specialist (who must be the PI or subinvestigator) In the opinion of the investigator, the subject is controlled on medical therapy indicated for CLI (unless there is a documented contraindication or intolerance) Subject is current with all ageappropriate American Cancer Society (ACS) or similar (e.g., United States Preventative Service Task Force) screening guidelines Given medical history and concurrent medication, the subject is an acceptable candidate for bone marrow aspiration and intramuscular injection procedures in the opinion of the Investigator Subject is willing and able to comply with the scheduled visits, aspiration/injection procedure, wound care instructions treatment plan, and other study procedures for the duration of the study Provide a personallysigned and dated informed consent document indicating that the subject (or a legallyacceptable representative, if permitted by the site's Investigational Review Board [IRB]) has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study Patients presenting with any of the following will not be randomized: Diseasespecific: Failed open surgical revascularization (on index leg) within 4 weeks of screening Visit 1 Acute limbthreatening ischemia, trauma, known nonatherosclerotic vascular disease (e.g., temporal/giant cell arteritis, Takayasu's arteritis, Raynaud's occlusive disease, Buerger's disease), embolic disease, aortoiliac disease with &gt; 50% stenosis, or history of hypercoagulable states Advanced CLI (i.e., nonsalvageable) defined as Rutherford Category 6 Clinical evidence of invasive infection in index leg (e.g., cellulitis, osteomyelitis, wet gangrene) At screening, nonheel wound size of &gt; 20 cm2 (excluding toe gangrene); or wounds on the heel &gt; 10 cm2 on the index leg as measured by the Wound Core Lab (WCL) from photographs (and/or acetates) provided by the site Previous amputation at or above the talus in the index leg Medical History Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥ 10% at screening Diabetic subjects with uncontrolled or untreated proliferative retinopathy as determined by dilated eye exam (by qualified eye care professional as per American Diabetes Association guidelines) Blood clotting disorder not caused by medication (e.g., thrombophilia) Active nonbasal cell cutaneous malignancy requiring surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation in the past 12 months Current documented drug or alcohol abuse that would interfere with the subject's compliance with study procedures Known allergies to any equine, porcine, or bovine products Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 50 kg/m2 at screening Established chronic kidney disease (CKD) requiring dialysis (Stage 5); estimated creatinine clearance &lt; 15 mg/mL/min at screening Systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt; 200 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &gt; 120 mm Hg or papilledema noted via ophthalmoscope at screening physical exam Within 3 months prior to screening, a clinically significant history of cardiac disease Laboratory Parameters: Abnormal laboratory values (performed at central lab) at screening: Platelets &lt; 50,000 μL Aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV 1), HIV 2, or syphilis positive (rapid plasma reagin [RPR]) Active hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C virus (HCV); Exclusionary Procedures, Devices, or Medication Exposure to immunosuppressive therapy for oncologic or chronic nononcologic reasons in the prior 12 months or expected requirement over the course of the study (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation therapy, methotrexate) Concurrent participation in another clinical trial or receiving experimental medication within 30 days of screening or having previously been exposed to Aastrom's ixmyelocel T product [previously known as tissue repair cells (TRC), cardiac repair cells (CRC), vascular repair cells (VRC)] On the index leg, use of concomitant wound treatments not currently approved for ischemic woundhealing within 30 days prior to screening or plans to initiate new, nonstandardofcare treatments to the index leg during the study</criteria>
