	<brief_summary>IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder which is characterized by recurrent pain and/or discomfort, altered stool form, and abdominal distension. It has been established that food items such as beans, peas, lentils, peppers, and onions can increase gas production. What these have in common is that they all contain large amounts of complex carbohydrates. The enzymes in the small intestine are not able to fully digest these large molecules, which in turn are fermented by the colonic microflora. This fermentation is conducted through the production of short chain fatty acids and gases such as hydrogen and methane. Alpha-Galactosidase is an enzyme that has the ability to break down these indigestible carbohydrates to galactose and sucrose in the small intestine and to facilitate the absorption and minimize the gas production from bacteria in the colon. The aim of this study is to assess if the gastrointestinal symptoms, above all problems from gas and distension, is alleviated when the enzyme α-Galactosidase (present in Nogasin capsules) is ingested with food.</brief_summary>
