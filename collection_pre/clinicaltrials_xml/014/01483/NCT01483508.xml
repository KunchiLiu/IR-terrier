	<brief_title>Absorption and Metabolism of Dietary Cocoa Procyanidins in Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Flavanols and their oligomeric derivatives, the procyanidins, are plant-derived compounds normally present in the human diet. Accumulating data demonstrate a causal role for flavanols in mediating the cardiovascular benefits associated with the consumption of flavanol-/procyanidin-containing foods. Evidence for a direct, causal role for procyanidins in this context is far less profound. As this is often based on the poor absorption of procyanidins, it has been proposed that procyanidins may indirectly contribute to the systemic presence of bioactive compounds via derivatives generated from the breakdown or catabolism of procyanidins in the gastrointestinal tract. These postulated 'breakdown products' include: i) flavanols, putatively generated by acid hydrolysis in the stomach, and ii) series of phenolic compounds, including 5-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, that are produced from procyanidin catabolism by the gut microbiome. Verification or rejection of these suppositions could significantly impact the interpretation of epidemiological-/dietary intervention data, and the design of food-content data bases. To address this question, healthy volunteers will consume specially designed cocoa-based dairy drinks containing flavanols and procyanidins (dimers to decamers) either together or individually.</detailed_description>
