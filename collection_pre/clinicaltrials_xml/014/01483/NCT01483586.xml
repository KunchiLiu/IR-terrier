	<criteria>confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate undergone definitive treatment (surgery, surgery with radiation therapy, cryotherapy, radiation therapy or brachytherapy) for the primary prostate tumor with a rising PSA life expectancy greater than 6 months has Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0, 1, or 2 use of other dietary/herbal supplements (e.g. saw palmetto, selenium, etc.) has been stable for at least 2 months prior to screening and the patient agrees not to stop or change the dose while participating in the study. Adequate hepatic function with serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the upper institutional limits of normal, ALT and AST ≤ 2.5 times the upper institutional limits of normal Adequate renal function with serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 times the upper institutional limits of normal Adequate hematologic function (absolute neutrophil counts ≥ 1,500 mm3 and platelets ≥ 100,000 mm3) All electrolytes (including potassium, sodium, and serum or ionized calcium) must be within normal limits Patients with evidence of metastatic disease would be excluded, except for presence of positive lymph nodes from the surgical pathology. Similarly, patients with radiological evidence of lymph nodes &lt; 2 cm that lack pathological confirmation would be eligible Patients with a PSA doubling time of &lt;6months at screening would be excluded Patients meeting Phoenix criteria for biochemical failure (nadir + ≥2ng/mL increase in serum PSA) who wish additional conventional therapy Any concurrent malignancy other than adequately treated basal or squamous cell skin cancer or superficial bladder cancer Any psychiatric or other disorders such as dementia that would prohibit the patient from understanding or rendering informed consent or from fully complying with protocol treatment and followup Inability to swallow capsules Patients with a known history of gastrointestinal disease, surgery or malabsorption that could potentially impact the absorption of the study drug Patients requiring the use of a feeding tube Receipt of prior chemotherapy</criteria>
