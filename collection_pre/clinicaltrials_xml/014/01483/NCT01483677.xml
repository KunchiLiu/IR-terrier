	<brief_title>Comparison Study of the Nintendo Wii Versus Playstation2 in Enhancing Laparoscopic Skills</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Video game experience, whether past or current, have correlated with better laparoscopy skills. Those studies were conducted using traditional game controllers. The relatively new Nintendo Wii uses a novel set of mechanics which allows for more realistic representation of player generated movements. We aim to study if the unique mechanics of the Wii can improve laparoscopy skills better than a traditional video game (Playstation 2).</detailed_description>
