	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Must be male or female, 18 years of age or older, and of any ethnic or racial group Not resected primary tumor; must be clinically stable Colorectal cancer with unresectable metastatic disease to the liver (unresectable unilobar or bilobar disease) who have disease progression in the liver with oxaliplatin or irinotecan based first line chemotherapy Eligible to receive secondline standardofcare chemotherapy with either 1) an oxaliplatinbased chemotherapy regimen, or 2) an irinotecanbased chemotherapy regimen Baseline efficacy images with measurable target tumors in the liver according to RECIST 1.1 using standard imaging techniques taken within 28 days prior to randomization. Images must be taken after, or at the time of completion of first line chemotherapy Tumor replacement &lt;50% of total liver volume Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) of 01 through screening to first treatment First line chemotherapy regimen completed at least 14 days prior to initiation of 2nd line chemotherapy under the protocol Patient is willing to participate in the study and has signed the study informed consent Serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL Serum bilirubin up to 1.2 x upper limit of normal Albumin ≥ 3.0 g/dL Neutrophil count &gt;1200/cubic mm Exclusion Criteria History of hepatic encephalopathy Contraindications to angiography and selective visceral catheterization such as bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy that is not correctable by usual therapy of hemostatic agents History of severe peripheral allergy or intolerance to contrast agents, narcotics, sedatives or atropine that cannot be managed medically Presentation of pulmonary insufficiency or clinically evident chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Cirrhosis or portal hypertension Prior external beam radiation treatment to the liver Prior intraarterial liver directed therapy, including transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) or Y90 microsphere therapy Planned treatment with biological agents within 28 days prior to receiving TheraSphere (may resume after Y90 treatment or immediately if in control arm) Planned liver directed therapy or radiation therapy Intervention for, or compromise of, the Ampulla of Vater Clinically evident ascites (trace ascites on imaging is acceptable) Toxicities due to prior cancer therapy that have not resolved before the initiation of study treatment, if the Investigator determines that the continuing complication will compromise the safe treatment of the patient Significant lifethreatening extrahepatic disease, including patients who are on dialysis, have unresolved diarrhea, have serious unresolved infections including patients who are known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive or have acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) confirmed extrahepatic metastases. Limited indeterminate extrahepatic lesions in the lung and/or lymph nodes are permitted (up to 5 lesions in the lung, with each individual lesion &lt;1 cm; any number of lymph nodes with each individual nodes &lt;1.5 cm) Contraindications to the planned second line standardofcare chemotherapy regimen Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to randomization, and must not be breastfeeding and must agree to use contraceptive for duration of study. Participation in a clinical trial with an investigational therapy within 30 days prior to randomization Comorbid disease or condition that would place the patient at undue risk and preclude safe use of TheraSphere treatment, in the Investigator's judgment</criteria>
