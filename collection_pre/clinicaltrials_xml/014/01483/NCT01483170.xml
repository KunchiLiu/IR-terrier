	<brief_summary>This trial will study the tolerability and pharmacokinetic of fexinidazole using two different dosage regimen of repeated administrations. The drug is administered to human healthy volunteers of sub-saharan origin together with food, once a day during 10 days, with a loading dose during 4 days.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multiple Dose Study to Evaluate Security, Tolerance and Pharmacokinetic of Fexinidazole (Drug Candidate for Human African Trypanosomiasis) Administered With a Loading Dose and With Food</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives: Primary Objectives: To assess safety and tolerability of two different fexinidazole dosing regimen, for 10 days repeated administration under fed conditions in healthy male sub-Saharan volunteers. Secondary objectives: To validate the exposure to fexinidazole, M1 and M2 after different dosing regimens in fed conditions for 10 days in order to evaluate the more appropriate administration regimen for the pivotal phase II/III study. Methodology/Study Design: Two dose regimens consisting of repeated oral ascending dose (OAD) dosing in fed condition with two different ascending loading doses for 4 days followed by the same dose for 6 days will be evaluated. The study will be conducted in double-blind conditions for both the clinical and bioanalytical parts. For each dosing regimen, subjects will reside at the clinical unit from the evening of Day -2 to the afternoon of Day 17 including an 8 days safety follow up (168 h post last dose).</detailed_description>
