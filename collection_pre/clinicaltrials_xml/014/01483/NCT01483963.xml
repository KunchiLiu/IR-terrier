	<brief_title>AA4500 for the Treatment of Adhesive Capsulitis of the Shoulder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a Phase 2a, open-label, dose-ranging study of the safety and effectiveness of AA4500 for the treatment of adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder. To be eligible for treatment, a subject must have unilateral idiopathic adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder with restricted range of motion in the affected shoulder for at least 3 months but not more than 12 months. Subjects will be screened for study eligibility within 30 days before injection of study drug. Approximately 50 adult women and men are to be enrolled in this study. Following screening and determination of study eligibility, Assignment to Cohorts 1-4 is sequential. Subjects assigned to Cohorts 1 through 4 may receive up to 3 injections of AA4500 according to cohort assignment. Each injection will be separated by a minimum of 21 days. Subjects assigned to Cohort 5 will receive home shoulder exercises only, while subjects assigned to Cohorts 1-4 will receive AA4500 and home shoulder exercises. Subjects in Cohort 5 will be offered physical therapy sessions for a period of 2 months following completion of the study. Dosing will range from 0.29 mg to 0.58 mg with varying volumes.</detailed_description>

Have normal range of motion in the contralateral shoulder, as determined by the investigator 5. Have restricted active range of motion (AROM) in the affected shoulder defined as: a deficit of at least 60 degrees in total AROM in the affected shoulder as compared with the total AROM in the contralateral shoulder and a deficit of at least 30 degrees in AROM in at least one of the following planes as compared with the contralateral shoulder: Forward flexion Abduction External rotation with the elbow up to 90 degrees abduction Internal rotation with the elbow up to 90 degrees abduction 6. Voluntarily sign and date an informed consent agreement approved by the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC). The subject must also sign an authorization form to allow disclosure of his protected health information (PHI).

Has any of the following conditions, as determined by the investigator: Adhesive capsulitis as a result of traumatic injury Pain in the affected shoulder at rest that is greater than or equal to 4 on the 11point pain scale Active subacromial impingement in the affected shoulder Calcified tendonitis in the affected shoulder Glenohumeral joint arthritis in the affected shoulder Arthrosis of the affected shoulder Chondrolysis of the affected shoulder Subscapularis tendon rupture of the affected shoulder Other rotator cuff injuries of the affected shoulder Uncontrolled hypertension Uncontrolled diabetes Uncontrolled thyroid disease History of thrombosis or postthrombosis syndrome Physical impairment that would preclude performing the protocol defined exercises Active infection in area to be treated Clinically significant neurological disease Coagulation disorder, using anticoagulant (except for less than or equal to 150 mg aspirin) within 7 days prior to each injection day Known active hepatitis B or C (history of hepatitis A permitted) Other significant medical condition (eg, morbid obesity, cervical disc disease), which in the investigator's opinion would make the subject unsuitable for enrollment in the study 5. Is unwilling or unable to cooperate with the requirements of the study including completion of all scheduled study visits. 6. Has received oral or intravenous steroids for any reason within 3 weeks before the screening visit 7. Has received an investigational drug or treatment within 30 days before the first dose of study drug. 8. Has a known systemic allergy to collagenase or any other excipient of AA4500 or any other procedural medication. 9. Has, at any time, received collagenase for the treatment of adhesive capsulitis. 10. Is unable to undergo an xray or MRI (contraindication) evaluation of the affected shoulder. 11.
