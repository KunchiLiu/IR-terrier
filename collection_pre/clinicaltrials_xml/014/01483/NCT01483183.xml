	<brief_summary>The purpose of Part 1 of this study is to determine the maximally tolerated dose of OPC-108459 in patients with paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). The purpose of Part 2 of this study is to determine potential efficacy of dose(s) of OPC-108459 for the treatment of paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ascending Dose Study of OPC-108459 Intravenous Infusions in Patients With Paroxysmal and Persistent Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial will test the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of ascending doses of OPC-108459 in separate populations of paroxysmal and persistent AF subjects. The trial will consist of two parts. Each part will evaluate two populations of subjects presenting for cardioversion in a hospital setting. Cohorts of paroxysmal and persistent subjects may have their dose increased independently.</detailed_description>
