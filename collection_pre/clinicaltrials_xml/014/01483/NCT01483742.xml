	<brief_summary>This open-label, parallel cohort study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and antiviral activity of ritonavir-boosted danoprevir in combination with Pegasys (peginterferon alfa-2a) and ribavirin in treatment-naïve patients, and with RO5024048 added to the combination treatment in prior null responder patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 or 4 and compensated cirrhosis. All patients will receive danoprevir 100 mg orally twice daily (bid) , ritonavir 100 mg orally bid, Pegasys 180 mcg subcutaneously weekly and ribavirin 1000-1200 mg/kg/day orally. Prior non-responders will receive RO5024048 1000 mg orally bid additionally. Anticipated time on study treatment is 24 weeks.</brief_summary>
