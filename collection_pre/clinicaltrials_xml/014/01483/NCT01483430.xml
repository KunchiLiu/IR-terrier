	<brief_title>Effect of Ginseol Kg1 on Blood Pressure Lowering</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. At the end of an initial 2-week washout period, patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria are assigned to three groups, i.e. control group (placebo), low dose Ginseol Kg1 group (100mg), or high dose Ginseol Kg1 (300mg) group. They will intake the study drug for 8 weeks. 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) and pulse wave velocity are measured at the end of the washout period and after 8 weeks of active treatment. At each visit, seated SBP and DBP, heart rate, use of concomitant medication and spontaneously reported adverse events are recorded. Compliance with medication (determined by counting returned tablets) is evaluated at each visit.</detailed_description>
