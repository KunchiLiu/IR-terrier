	<brief_summary>The proposed study is designed to utilize a self-hypnosis DVD home-training program for parents to use with their children to teach self-hypnosis techniques for inducing relaxation and hypnotic analgesia. These relaxation techniques can be employed to manage anticipatory anxiety, distress, and pain during an invasive medical procedure, for example, voiding cystourethrography (VCUG). The study will examine the efficacy of this intervention for children undergoing VCUG procedures.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DVD-Based Training Program in Self-Hypnosis for Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pediatric care professionals and parents seek safe ways to make invasive medical procedures less stressful and traumatic for children. However, for unpleasant procedures that require child cooperation, this task becomes difficult. Home-training in self-hypnotic relaxation may provide an inexpensive, yet systematic method for improving the overall medical care of children undergoing invasive medical procedures. The proposed study is designed to utilize a self-hypnosis DVD home-training program for parents to use with their children to teach self-hypnosis techniques for inducing relaxation and hypnotic analgesia. The study will examine the efficacy of this intervention for children undergoing urethral catheterization for VCUG procedures. Parents will be instructed to watch the DVD and practice the self-hypnosis exercises every day for a week with their child prior to the upcoming procedure. Parents are encouraged to practice self-hypnosis during their child's VCUG procedure. Both parents and children will be asked to complete a series of questionnaires before and following the procedure.</detailed_description>
