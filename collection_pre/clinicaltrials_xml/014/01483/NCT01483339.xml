	<brief_summary>Cognitive behavior therapy is the most effective treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. However, the majority of treated patients remain symptomatic. The metacognitive therapy by Wells (1997) could achieve substantial gains in first pilot studies. The purpose of this study is to investigate this approach with a randomized controlled trial by comparing metacognitive therapy with exposure and response prevention for obsessive-compulsive disorder.</brief_summary>
