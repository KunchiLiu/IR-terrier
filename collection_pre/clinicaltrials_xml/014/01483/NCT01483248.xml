	<brief_summary>Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is currently the most effective method for end-stage liver diseases. However, the critical shortage of donor organs, high cost, and the problem of immune rejection limit its clinical application, and even some patients on the waiting list will never survive to receive a matched liver. Stem cell transplantation instead of conventional medical therapy or orthotopic liver transplantation will be a promising alternate approach to regenerate damaged hepatic mass. Adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are generally thought of as an autologous source of regenerative cells in previous studies.In this study, the safety and efficacy of menstrual blood-derived stem cells transplantation for patients with liver cirrhosis will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Human Menstrual Blood-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Patients With Liver Cirrhosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to show whether menstrual blood-derived stem cells can improve the disease conditions in patients with liver cirrhosis. One of two treatment arms will be assigned to the patients. One group will receive 2 weeks of conventional therapy plus MenSCs treatment; The other group will receive 2 weeks of conventional therapy plus placebo treatment. MenSCs will be cultured and collected in a GMP lab. Patients were strictly monitored after the cells injection via i.v.. Patients are followed up at intervals up to at least 2 years.Clinical parameters such as ascites volume,serum alanine aminotransferase,total bilirubin,prothrombin time,albumin,MELD score,and Child-Pugh score will be evaluated at each timepoint.</detailed_description>
