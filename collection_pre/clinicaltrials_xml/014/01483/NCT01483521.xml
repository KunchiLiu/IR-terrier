	<brief_title>Infant Psychiatry Home Visitation Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Home visitation program was developed in response to long wait lists for the Infant Psychiatry Program. This home visitation program intervention consists of the following components: Developmental guidance, empowerment of parents while respecting the parent-child attachment, and child centered interactional guidance. The home visitors ( a PhD student and a Masters level student) visit consenting families and gave the parents an opportunity to voice their concerns regarding their child's behaviors. They were instructed to co-construct a play that had to be child led. Home visitors facilitated this task. Parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist and Parenting Stress Index prior to and after the intervention. These home visitations occurred approximately once a month whilst the families were on the wait list for clinical assessment and treatment. Those families that were randomized in control group did not receive any intervention. Extended description of the protocol, including information not already contained in other fields.</detailed_description>
