	<brief_summary>This is a phase IIIb, interventional, multicenter, multinational, randomised, open-label, comparative trial which primary objective is to generate data on the ovarian stimulation profile obtained when Luveris® is started either on Day 1 or Day 6 in women in advanced reproductive age (36-42) undergoing Assisted Reproductive Technique (ART).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Ovarian Stimulation With GONAL-f® and Luveris® Starting on Day 1 Versus Day 6 in Women Undergoing Assisted Reproductive Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The subjects who complete the screening assessments and fulfil all the eligibility criteria will start down-regulation treatment on day 21-22 of the cycle. Down-regulation treatment must start within 2 months following the screening visit. The routine long luteal phase protocol for Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist treatment will be followed. Once down-regulation has been confirmed, a pregnancy test will be performed within 1 week prior to start of Recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (r-hFSH) treatment to rule out any pre-existing pregnancy. If the result is negative, the subject will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment arms of the trial: - GONAL-f® (Liquid Pen; 300 IU of per day) stimulation day 1-5 then followed by Luveris® (vial/powder, 150 IU per day) from stimulation Day 1 and until required r-hCG level is met. The dose can be adjusted from stimulation Day 6 (increased or decreased) based upon the subject's ovarian response and according to the center's standard practice. - GONAL-f® (Liquid Pen; 300 IU per day) stimulation Day 1-5 then add Luveris® (vial/powder, 150 IU per day) from stimulation Day 6 and until required recombinant Human chorionic gonadotrophin (r-hCG) level is met. The dose can be adjusted from stimulation Day 6 (increased or decreased) based upon the subject's ovarian response and according to the center's standard practice. Randomization across the two treatment arms will be kept balanced in a 1:1 ratio. Subjects will be provided with a subject diary (including r-hCG and Crinone® administration and safety information) to record daily dosing information for GONAL-f® and Luveris®. Follicular development will be monitored according to the center's standard practice by US and/or Oestradiol (E2) levels, until the protocol r-hCG requirement is met (i.e., at least 1 follicle greater or equal to 18 mm and 2 follicles greater or equal to 16 millimeter [mm]). After this, a single injection of 250 microgram (mcg) of r-hCG (Ovidrel®/Ovitrelle®), will be administered in order to induce final oocyte maturation. At a time of 34-38 hours after r-hCG administration, oocytes will be recovered vaginally under US monitoring. Oocytes will then be fertilized in vitro and embryos replaced 2-3 days after oocyte recovery. Ovum pick up (OPU), in vitro fertilization (IVF), Embryo Transfer (ET) and luteal support will be performed as per center's standard practice. In addition, Crinone® 8% (progesterone gel) will be administered once daily. A post-treatment safety visit will be performed for all subjects who received r-hCG (pregnant and non-pregnant) on post r-hCG Day 15-20. For subjects who have withdrawn from treatment (i.e. after starting Luveris® or GONAL f® but before r-hCG is given) this visit will take place 20-30 days after their first Luveris® or GONAL-f® treatment injection (excluding pregnancy testing).</detailed_description>
