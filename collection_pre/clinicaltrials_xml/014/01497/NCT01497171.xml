	<brief_title>The ELEGANT Trial: Elevate Transvaginal Mesh vs. Anterior Colporrhaphy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, double blinded, randomized controlled trial, comparing Elevate® System with Interpro® Lite™, Anterior and Apical Prolapse Repair System (American Medical Systems) and Anterior Colporrhaphy (anterior suture repair) in women with symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse, who have opted to have surgical repair. The goals of the study are to compare both efficacy and safety of the two procedures and to compare the surgical impact of mesh and suture repairs on vaginal function. The principal investigator is from Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Mayo Clinic will serve as the data gathering and coordination site for this multicenter trial.</detailed_description>
