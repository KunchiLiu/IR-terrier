	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated hypofractionated radiotherapy dose (MTD) to a solitary metastatic focus ('index lesion') when followed by ipilimumab, in metastatic melanoma patients without brain involvement The secondary objectives are to determine late toxicity, immune-related clinical responses and immune pharmacodynamic changes after hypofractionated radiotherapy followed by ipilimumab</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Patient &gt; 18 years old Histologically confirmed diagnosis of melanoma Previously treated or previously untreated metastatic melanoma by AJCC staging criteria Presence of an index lesion &gt; 1 cm amenable to hypofractionated radiotherapy and at least one other additional lesion that can be followed for response using RECIST criteria ECOG Performance status 0 or 1 Signed informed consent document Ability to tolerate stereotactic body radiation therapy (e.g. lie flat and hold position for treatment) Exclusion Criteria Prior systemic therapy within 14 days of study enrollment. Patients must be adequately recovered from prior systemic therapy side effects as deemed by the PI. Clinical contraindication to stereotactic body radiotherapy (e.g. active systemic sclerosis, active inflammatory bowel disease if bowel is within target field, etc) Presence or history of central nervous system metastasis (including brain) Longterm use of systemic corticosteroids Prior RT that precludes the delivery of hypofractionated radiotherapy</criteria>
