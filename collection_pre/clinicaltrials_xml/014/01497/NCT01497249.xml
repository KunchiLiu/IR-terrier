	<brief_title>Assessing Fermentability of a Dietary Fiber</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed as a randomized, 2-arm, treatment-controlled, within-subjects, 8-hour postprandial crossover study, utilizing a multiple sampling paradigm to evaluate fermentability and potential health opportunities for glucose control of a dietary fiber (FCHO) in healthy non-obese men and women. The study will include 2 - 8 h assessments following consumption of the FCHO drink or a placebo drink and will follow with a 7 day feeding period to assess tolerability.</detailed_description>
