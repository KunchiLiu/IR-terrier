	<brief_summary>This study was to assess the safety and efficacy of sofosbuvir (GS-7977; PSI-7977) in combination with ribavirin (RBV) administered for 12 weeks compared with pegylated interferon (PEG)/RBV administered for 24 weeks in treatment-naive patients with Hepatitis C (HCV) genotype 2 or 3. Efficacy was assessed by the rate of sustained viral response (SVR) 12 weeks after the discontinuation of therapy (SVR12). This was a non-inferiority study, and if non-inferiority was demonstrated, the study was then allowed to test for superiority.</brief_summary>
