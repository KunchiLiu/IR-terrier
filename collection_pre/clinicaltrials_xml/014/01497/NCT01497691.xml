	<brief_summary>Previous investigations and anecdotal experience have shown safety and utility of Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation/Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (NIPPV/BiPAP) for the treatment of asthma in children. If NIPPV/BiPAP can be shown to have a beneficial effect in children with respiratory insufficiency, emergency department and ICU stays may be shortened, and the need for more invasive and dangerous airway procedures may be decreased. This would result in a change in the standard of care for asthma treatment in emergency departments. The investigators hypothesis is that the use of this new NIPPV, in conjunction with current standard of care therapies, in acute moderate to severe asthma exacerbations will lead to a more rapid improvement in patient ventilation, faster resolution of respiratory distress, and overall improved secondary outcomes.</brief_summary>
