	<brief_summary>This study will be conducted in Hepatitis C positive patients to determine whether the pharmacodynamic effects of PSI-7977 or PSI-352938 are similar to HCV-infected patients with normal hepatic function, which may allow inclusion of patients with cirrhosis and varying degrees of hepatic dysfunction in future clinical studies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open-Label Hepatic Impairment Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is designed per the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance for patients with impaired hepatic function to assess the influence of hepatic impairment on the PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) of PSI-7977 and PSI-352938 This study will be conducted in Hepatitis C positive patients to ascertain whether the PD effects of PSI-7977 or PSI-352938 are similar to HCV-infected patients with normal hepatic function, which may allow inclusion of patients with cirrhosis and varying degrees of hepatic dysfunction in future clinical studies. Data from subjects who participated in the P2938-0212 study (PSI-352938 MAD) will be used as the control group. These subjects were documented non-cirrhotic subjects with normal hepatic function. Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Genotypes 1-6 will be enrolled in this study.</detailed_description>
