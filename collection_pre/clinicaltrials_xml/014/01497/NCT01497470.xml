	<brief_summary>The primary goal of this study is to determine if custirsen has an effect on the way the body distributes and gets rid of paclitaxel, the standard administered chemotherapy. The study will also evaluate if custirsen influences the way the body distributes and gets rid of carboplatin (another standard administered chemotherapy) and will measure custirsen blood levels in this cancer population. Finally, the study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of adding custirsen to the standard paclitaxel/carboplatin chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
