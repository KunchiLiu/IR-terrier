	<brief_summary>Pre-malignant lesions are difficult to treat. Even after surgical removal they tend to re-appear. Often the lesions are to large and are apparent on many sites, therefore surgical removal is not always possible. The photodynamic therapy uses a special substance, which is absorbed in cells, and thereafter activated by a defined light. The aim of this study is to compare the photodynamic therapy in potentially malignant lesions to a placebo. The investigators assume a significant better result in photodynamic therapy then treatment with a placebo.</brief_summary>
