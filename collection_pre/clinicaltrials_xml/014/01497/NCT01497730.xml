	<brief_summary>This post-marketing investigation will evaluate the functional knee performance of Subjects who have undergone primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Data from Subjects who receive one of four contemporary knee configurations from different manufacturers will be pooled to establish a contemporary dataset. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the functional performance as measured by the activities of daily living (ADL) sub-score of the Knee Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score (KOOS) patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaire of primary TKA at minimum one year post-operation. This will be carried out for all four implant configurations. The final endpoint is a 2-year evaluation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi-center, Non-comparative Study of Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) Functional Performance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study is designed as a prospective, single arm stratified, multi-center investigation. Approximately 20 study sites, worldwide, will enroll 840 patients (840 knees). Each study site is expected to enroll approximately 42 patients (42 knees). Cohort reallocation is permitted. There will be no control group. Eight hundred forty (840) Subjects will be stratified into 4 subgroups of 210: fixed bearing cruciate retaining (FB CR), fixed bearing posterior stabilized (FB PS), rotating platform cruciate retaining (RP CR), and rotating platform posterior stabilized (RP PS). Treatment assignment in this study is not randomized. Each site will only enroll patients in one of the four knee configuration sub-groups most commonly used as their standard of care.</detailed_description>
