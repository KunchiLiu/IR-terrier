	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of cabazitaxel by assessing objective tumor response rate (ORR) at the recommended dose (RD) when administered as a single agent every 3 weeks in patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma who have failed prior chemotherapy regimens Secondary Objectives: - To determine the RD of cabazitaxel when administered as a single agent every 3 weeks - To evaluate safety of cabazitaxel when administered as a single agent every 3 weeks - To estimate the overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) - To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of cabazitaxel in part 1</brief_summary>
