	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as hypoxia-activated prodrug TH-302, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving sorafenib tosylate together with hypoxia-activated prodrug TH-302 may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of giving sorafenib tosylate together with hypoxia-activated prodrug TH-302 and to see how well they work in treating patients with advanced kidney cancer or liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib Tosylate and Hypoxia-Activated Prodrug TH-302 in Treating Patients With Advanced Kidney Cancer or Liver Cancer That Cannot Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase II dosing (RP2D) for the combination of sorafenib tosylate and hypoxia-activated prodrug TH-302 (TH-302) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC; non-HCC) advanced solid tumors. (Phase I) - To evaluate the overall response rate (RR) determined based on modified RECIST criteria (Lencioni and Llovet 2010) in patients with advanced HCC receiving sorafenib tosylate with TH-302. (Phase II) Secondary - To characterize overall toxicity profile of sorafenib tosylate + TH-302 within patients with HCC and RCC (non-HCC) advanced solid tumors. (Phase I) - To characterize the responses of sorafenib tosylate + TH-302 within patients with HCC and RCC (non-HCC) advanced solid tumors. (Phase I) - To assess the adverse events (AEs) profile and safety profile of sorafenib tosylate in combination with TH-302 in patients with advanced HCC. (Phase II) - To estimate the overall response rate based on standard RECIST criteria in the study population. (Phase II) - To estimate the duration of response based on modified (standard) RECIST criteria in the study population. (Phase II) - To estimate the progression free survival (PFS) in the study population. (Phase II) - To estimate the overall survival (OS) in the study population. (Phase II) - To estimate the alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) response rate (defined as &gt; 20% decrease of AFP from baseline) in the study population. (Phase II) OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study. Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and hypoxia-activated prodrug TH-302 IV over 30 minutes on days 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Some patients undergo blood sample collection periodically during study for alpha-fetoprotein analysis. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Phase I Registration Inclusion Criteria Age ≥18 years Cytological or histological confirmed diagnosis of advanced hepatocellular or renal cell carcinoma. HCC patients should not be amenable to treatment with surgery or to orthotopic liver transplant. Patients must have measurable disease as defined in the protocol. RCC patients only: Tumor progression after receiving standard/approved chemotherapy and/or targeted agent, where there is no approved therapy or for tumors where sorafenib based therapy would be standard therapy. HCC patients only: First line (i.e., no prior systemic therapy) or second line (with prior first line sorafenib therapy only) advanced HCC. Child Pugh class A or B7 liver disease Prior chemoembolization, radioembolization, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), or other local ablative therapies are permissible if ≥6 weeks from procedure with evidence of progression or new metastatic disease, if applicable. ECOG Performance Status (PS) 0 or 1. The following laboratory values obtained ≤14 days prior to registration. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1200/mm3 Peripheral Platelet Count (PLT) ≥75,000/mm3 Hemoglobin (HgB) &gt;8.5 g/dL Bilirubin ≤3.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN) SGOT (AST) ≤2.5 x ULN, if subject has HCC or liver metastases ≤5 x UL SGPT (ALT) ≤2.5 x ULN, if subject has HCC or liver metastases ≤5 x ULN Creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN INR ≤1.5 x ULN.
