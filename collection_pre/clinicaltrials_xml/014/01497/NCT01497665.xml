	<criteria>Key 1. Adult patients (≥ 18 years) 2. Histologically or cytologicallydocumented NSCLC (EGFR mutation status must be known) 3. Brain metastases from NSCLC, which: have radiologicallyprogressed after WBRT or are present without prior WBRT 4. At least one radiologicallyconfirmed and measurable lesion (≥ 1.0 cm in the longest diameter) within14 days prior to the first dose of GRN1005 (Cycle 1, Day 1), as follows: an intracranial disease lesion (≥ 1.0 cm in the longest diameter) confirmed by GdMRI, or an extracranial disease lesion (≥ 1.0 cm in the longest diameter) confirmed by MRI or CT scan with contrast Prior stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is allowed; however, metastatic brain lesions previously treated with SRS are not allowed as target or as nontarget lesions. 5. Patients must be neurologically stable, defined as being on stable doses of corticosteroids and anticonvulsants (not EIAEDs, including phenytoin, phenobarbitol, carbamazepine, fosphenytoin, primidone, oxcarbazepine) for ≥ 5 days prior to obtaining the baseline GdMRI of the brain and ≥ 5 days prior to first dose of GRN1005 (Cycle 1, Day 1). 6. Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) ≥ 80% 7. Completed WBRT for intracranial lesions ≥ 28 days prior to first dose of GRN1005 (with the exception of local radiation therapy for palliation to extracranial sites, i.e., bone). All clinically significant toxicities must have resolved to ≤ NCI CTCAE v4.0 Grade 1.0. Key 1. NCI CTCAE v4.0 Grade ≥ 2 neuropathy 2. CNS disease requiring immediate neurosurgical intervention (e.g., resection, shunt placement, etc.) 3. Known intracranial hemorrhage 4. Known leptomeningeal disease</criteria>
