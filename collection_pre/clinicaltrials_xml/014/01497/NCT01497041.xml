	<brief_summary>1. Goals The primary goal of this phase II trial is to: evaluate the response rate of combination chemotherapy with docetaxel and oxaliplatin in patients with stage IIIB/IV non-adenocarcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as second-line treatment Secondary goals are to: evaluate the treatment-related toxicities of this combination, investigate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in this population 2. Design The proposed clinical trial is an open label, non-comparative, multicenter phase II trial according to the two stage testing design by Simon two-stage testing procedure</brief_summary>
