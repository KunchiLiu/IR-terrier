	<brief_title>MGCD290 and Fluconazole Versus Fluconazole Alone for the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Vulvovaginal Candidiasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MGCD290 is a novel antifungal agent targeting the Hos2 enzyme in fungi. MGCD290 was shown to potentiate and broaden the spectrum of activity of azole antifungal agents in vitro, especially fluconazole. MGCD290 taken together with fluconazole was observed to be safe in healthy volunteer studies. The current study is evaluating both the efficacy and safety of the combination treatment in subjects with moderate to severe vulvovaginal candidiasis.</detailed_description>
