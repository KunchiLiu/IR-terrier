	<brief_summary>Introduction: The purpose of the pivotal In Home study is to collect clinical data on the safety and efficacy of the Paradigm LGS System in the actual use environment and by the intended use population. ASPIRE is a multi-center, in home, randomized parallel adaptive study design with type 1 diabetes. The study will compare A1C and CGM based nocturnal hypoglycemic events in a treatment arm to a control arm. Arms are defined as: - Treatment Arm (LGS ON) using Paradigm® VEO™ Pump - Control Arm (NO LGS FEATURE ) using Paradigm® Revel™2.0 Pump The study's objectives are two-fold: 1. The first study objective is to demonstrate that home use of Low Glucose Suspend (LGS) is safe and is not associated with glycemic deterioration, as measured by change in A1C from baseline to end of study participation. 2. The second study objective is to demonstrate that home use of Low Glucose Suspend (LGS) is associated with reduction in nocturnal hypoglycemia when patients fail to respond. Primary Safety Endpoint: The change in A1C from randomization to the end of the treatment period will be used to demonstrate that the automatic insulin delivery suspension (LGS ON) does not result in an unacceptable worsening of glycemic control.</brief_summary>
