	<brief_summary>Although technology offers great potential for enhancing the health and well-being of older adults, robust studies are needed to quantify the value of technology and further the investigators understanding of barriers to technology access among older adults and of strategies that are effective in removing these barriers. This cross-site randomized field trial will evaluate a simple to use Personalized Reminder Information and Social Management System (PRISM) designed to support social connectivity, memory, skill building and resource access for older adults. The PRISM system (PRISM C condition) will be compared to an notebook information control condition (PRISM B condition). The target population is older adults who live at home alone and are at risk for isolation. The goal of the study is to gather systematic evidence about the value of technology for older adults and to identify factors that affect use and usability, acceptance and technology adoption. The investigators will also gather longitudinal data on the benefits of the system. Participants aged 65 - 85 years (100 per site) will be randomly assigned following baseline assessment to one of two conditions: PRISM C condition where participants receive the technology system or the PRISM B condition only control where participants receive a notebook that includes information similar to that provided in PRISM C (e.g., resource guide). The categories of information provided in the notebook is similar to the features provided on the system. Participants will include males and females who do not have a home computer and who have limited Internet experience. The intervention period is 12 months. A battery of measures that includes demographic information, attitudes towards technology (including computer self-efficacy and computer comfort), technology, computer and Internet experience, functional independence and well-being, emotional well-being social support/isolation, and quality of life will be administered at baseline, and 6 and 12 months post randomization. In addition, the investigators will assess cognitive abilities at baseline and twelve months. The investigators will also gather data regarding technology use and social interactions via a brief telephone interview at 18 months post randomization.</brief_summary>
