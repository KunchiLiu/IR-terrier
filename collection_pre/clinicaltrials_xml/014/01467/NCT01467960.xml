	<brief_summary>In Italy affected people are 200,000 and every year Parkinson new cases are 10,000. Aging is the principle risk factor of Parkinson with the possibility of its development doubling every five years after 65. Because of the increase of the social longevity and aging as the main risk factor, there are many repercussions on the health system (hospital stays and pharmaceutical costs) as on the social system (assistance- related problems). Parkinson's disease exerts an extremely negative impact on life's quality of the patient. In fact, because of Parkinson symptoms (tremor, dribble, etc), patient's social life will be reduced with the consequent development of the depression. Consequently, the early detection and treatment of Parkinson's is necessary. To achieve this goal, Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) in human serum as a marker of the oxidative stress-inflammation vicious cycle seems most promising candidate for diagnosis.</brief_summary>
