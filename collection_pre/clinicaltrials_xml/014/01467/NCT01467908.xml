	<brief_summary>It has already been demonstrated that mental imagining of the complex motor act, such as limb lifting, can evoke the activation of the involved motor centres even if it doesn't result in movement due to paresis. Aim of the study: using the navigated brain stimulation system create a new diagnostic model for the differential diagnostics between the vegetative state and the minimally conscious state. If the investigators could get from patient the efferent motor response after a verbal command, his level of conscious should not be defined less than the minimally conscious state.</brief_summary>
