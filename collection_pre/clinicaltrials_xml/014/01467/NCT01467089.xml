	<brief_title>The Assessment of Movement Disorders Utilizing Live Two-Way Video</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and tardive dyskinesia (TD) are one of the most frequent and troublesome adverse events when taking antipsychotic agents. The investigators aim in this study to determine if the investigators can conduct examinations for EPS and TD remotely using live two-way video. It is potentially beneficial for patients, especially those who are located far away from psychiatrists if they could be seen by trained clinicians and assessed for EPS and TD via two-way video in the future. Participants will be asked to have a medical assessment which consists of simple questions and some examination of their movements via two-way video and in person. The investigators will compare the results of video examinations with the results of live examinations.</detailed_description>
