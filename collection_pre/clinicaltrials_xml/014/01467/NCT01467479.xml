	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) co-infected subjects with telaprevir, pegylated interferon alfa-2a (Peg-IFN-alfa-2a), and ribavirin (RBV) to achieve undetectable hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) 12 weeks after the last planned dose of study drug.</brief_summary>
