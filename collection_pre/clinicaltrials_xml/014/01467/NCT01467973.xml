	<brief_summary>The Gulf Heart Association (GHA) sponsored Gulf acute heart failure registry (Gulf CARE)is a multinational , multicentre, prospective, observational, hospital-based registry of patients with acute heart failure(AHF) with 3 month and one year follow-up. Study Hypothesis: Due to variations in age at presentation, risk factors for heart failure particularly high prevalence of rheumatic heart disease in certain Gulf countries, variable medical practices and heart failure management setup in the Gulf region, AHF patients in the Gulf states are expected to have different presentation and receive different management than patients in European countries resulting in different outcome. It is also hypothesized that there is considerable gap between heart failure management guidelines and clinical practices in the Gulf region.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Gulf Heart Association (GHA) initiated Gulf acute heart failure registry (Gulf CARE)is designed to assess epidemiology, clinical data, management and outcomes of AHF in six Gulf countries and whether published, professional guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of heart failure are being applied appropriately in patients with heart failure. The registry will also provide a quantitative estimate as well as qualitative description of the hospital disease activity related to heart failure. The information gathered will identify management gaps in diagnosis and care of AHF patients that may be addressed by more effective implementation of current guidelines or development of AHF guidelines which may be appropriate to this region. Findings from this registry may help in knowing the current status of heart transplantation in the Middle-East countries as well as identify issues in establishing future heart transplant programme including selection of appropriate candidates and donors, requirements for pre- and post-transplant support.</detailed_description>
