	<criteria>• Is in reasonably good health as determined by the investigator based on a detailed medical history, full physical examination (PE), vital signs (VS) (including blood pressure and pulse rate measurement), 12lead ECG, and clinical laboratory tests. Subjects with mild, chronic, stable disease (e.g., controlled hypertension, controlled hypercholesterolemia, noninsulin dependent diabetes, osteoarthritis) may be enrolled if well controlled and not anticipated to interfere with the objectives of the study. Mild deviations from normal limits in PE, VS, ECG parameters, lab tests are acceptable if associated with the stable condition or are agerelated Has a condition, which in the opinion of the investigator, would confound or interfere with evaluation of safety and tolerability or PK or PD of the investigational drug, or prevent compliance with the protocol</criteria>
