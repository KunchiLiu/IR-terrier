	<brief_summary>This will be a single-center, two-cohort, three-period study in healthy adult subjects. Approximately 16 healthy subjects will be enrolled in Cohort 1 to provide data from 14 evaluable subjects. Approximately 12 healthy subjects will be enrolled in Cohort 2 to provide data from 10 evaluable subjects. Subjects will have a screening visit within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug, three treatment periods, and a follow-up visit 7-14 days after the last dose of study drug. There will be a washout period between Period 1 and Period 2 but no washout between Period 2 and Period 3. Day 1 of Period 3 will start the day after the last day in Period 2. The study will be conducted on an out-patient basis except for days where serial pharmacokinetic sampling and safety assessments are scheduled.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%). Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator feels that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. Male or female between 18 and 55 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea. Male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in the protocol. Body weight greater than or equal to 50 kg for males and 45 kg for females and BMI within the range 18.5 31.0 kg/m2 (inclusive). Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 months of screening Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones). A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen. A positive test for HIV antibody. History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study as defined in the protocol. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current study: 30 days, 5 halflives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer). Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation. Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period. Pregnant females as determined by positive urine hCG test at screening or prior to dosing. Lactating females. Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol. Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated. History of sensitivity to heparin or heparininduced thrombocytopenia. History or regular use of tobacco or nicotinecontaining products within 6 months prior to screening. Consumption of red wine, seville oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit juice and/or pummelos, exotic citrus fruits, grapefruit hybrids or fruit juices from 7 days prior to the first dose of study medication</criteria>
