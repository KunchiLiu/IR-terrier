	<brief_title>PillCam Colon Capsule Endoscopy for Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Symptomatic patients with confirmed ulcerative colitis (UC) were enrolled in this prospective single-center study. No sooner had patients gone through Pillcam colon capsule (PCC) endoscopy solution than they got conventional colonoscopy which is recognized as the "gold standard" examination technique. The extent of mucosal damage and inflammatory lesions during both modalities were recorded for comparison. In addition, the regimen of bowel preparation, completion rate, colonic cleanliness, compliance or adverse events were analyzed.</detailed_description>
