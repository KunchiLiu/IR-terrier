	<brief_summary>The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of glycemic control on clinical periodontal status, levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), reduced glutathione (GSH) and paraoxonase (PON) activity in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and blood samples of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with chronic periodontitis (CP).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Of Glycemic Control On Malondialdehyde, Glutathione Peroxidase, Glutathione And Paraoxonase</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are products of normal cellular metabolism and play beneficial role in physiological functions. Overproduction of ROS and/or deficiency of enzymatic or non-enzymatic antioxidants, termed as oxidative stress, is involved in many pathological conditions such as Diabetes mellitus (DM) and chronic periodontitis (CP). Several researches revealed that DM, with many determinants such as level of glycemic control, stands as a strong risk factor for periodontal diseases. On the other side, periodontal diseases induce an elevated chronic inflammatory state and exacerbated insulin resistance. In the present study, the investigators examined the effect of glycemic control level on clinical periodontal status, levels of MDA, GSH-Px, GSH and PON activity in gingival crevicular fluid and blood samples of CP patients with T2DM.</detailed_description>
