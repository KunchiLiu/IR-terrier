	<brief_summary>Atopic dermatitis is a frequent, chronic inflammatory disease influenced by local, immunological, genetic and environmental factors. Important symptoms of atopic dermatitis are dry skin, intense pruritus and impaired epidermal barrier function. Atopic dermatitis is associated with skin barrier dysfunction that facilitates an easier allergen penetration into the skin with an increased irritation and subsequent cutaneous inflammation. A lack of important stratum corneum intercellular lipids and an inadequate ratio between compounds enhance trans-epidermal water loss leading to xerosis. Skin hydration by emollient therapy usually twice daily improves dryness and subsequently pruritus during the treatment of atopic dermatitis and especially improves the barrier function. Emollients make part of basic therapy (grade 1) for treatment of atopic dermatitis (European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology Task Force 2009 Position Paper). Improvement of cutaneous barrier alteration, measured by skin hydration, is a key element for evaluation of emollient treatment efficacy. The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of the tested product (V0034CR01B) cream on xerosis in children with atopic dermatitis compared to the excipient formula during 28 days.</brief_summary>
