	<brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of Ramelteon Sublingual as Adjunctive Therapy for Maintenance Treatment of Bipolar I Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TAK-375SL (ramelteon sublingual formulation) is being developed by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited as an adjunctive treatment in the maintenance therapy of bipolar I disorder. Participants will be seen twice a month for the first two months and then once every month up to the end of the 9-month treatment period. Participants who complete the 9-month treatment period will have a follow-up visit approximately seven days after the last visit. A safety followup phone call will be made 30 days after completion of the 9-month treatment period. Based on the recommendation of the Independent Data Monitoring Committee which determined that the study data had met pre-determined criteria for futility, Takeda has made a decision to terminate the study. No safety concerns were identified by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee</detailed_description>
