	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to gather information regarding the use of Myfortic, Prograf, and corticosteroids in new liver transplant recipients. These three medicines help to prevent the body from rejecting the transplanted liver. The information the investigators are obtaining is data relating to the process of Myfortic absorption by the body, its distribution in the body, the breakdown of Myfortic in the body, and its elimination from the body. This absorption, distribution, breakdown, and elimination is called pharmacokinetics.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Myfortic, Prograf, and Corticosteroids in de Novo Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myfortic is approved for use in kidney transplant recipients, and has been prescribed by doctors for liver transplant recipients. No study has been reported to date evaluating the pharmacokinetics of Myfortic in new liver transplant recipients who also take Prograf and corticosteroids. During this six month study, a series of blood samples will be obtained after subjects take Myfortic, Prograf, and corticosteroids.</detailed_description>
