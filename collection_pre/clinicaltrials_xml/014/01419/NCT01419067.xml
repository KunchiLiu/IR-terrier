	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to determine the feasibility and safety of treating patients with a brain tumor known as craniopharyngioma with limited surgery and a 5mm clinical target volume margin in combination with proton therapy. Proton therapy will be indicated for patients with diagnosed craniopharyngioma who are not treated with radical surgery (gross-total resection). Irradiated patients will undergo a series of evaluations designed to evaluate the effects of proton therapy. Similar evaluations will be performed on patients treated with radical surgery. Proton therapy will include 30 treatment fractions administered 5 days per week. Weekly imaging will be a requirement to monitor for cyst expansion and target volume deformation.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial of Limited Surgery and Proton Therapy for Craniopharyngioma or Observation After Radical Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objectives of this study : To estimate the progression-free and overall survival distributions for children and young adults with craniopharyngioma treated with limited surgery and proton therapy using a 5mm clinical target volume margin while monitoring for excessive central nervous system necrosis. The Secondary Objectives of this study: - To estimate the cumulative incidence of cystic intervention and the event-free survival distribution for children and young adults with craniopharyngioma treated with limited surgery and proton therapy using a 5mm clinical target volume margin; and compare the distributions of progression-free, event-free and overall survival with the distributions for the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital cohort of 93 patients on which the design of this trial is based. - To estimate the distributions of progression-free survival and overall survival for children and young adults with craniopharyngioma treated only with primary surgical resection and to compare these distributions with the distributions observed for patients treated with limited surgery and proton therapy.</detailed_description>
