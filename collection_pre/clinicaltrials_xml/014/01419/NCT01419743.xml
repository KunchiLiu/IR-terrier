	<brief_summary>Historically, vitamin D has been considered to play a role solely in bone and calcium metabolism. Numerous studies have suggested a link between vitamin D deficiency and adverse health outcomes such as malignancy, cardiovascular disease, immune functioning, and glucose metabolism. In the obstetrics literature, vitamin D deficiency has been linked to preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and increased rate of cesarean section rate. Recent data from retrospective chart reviews have demonstrated a possible role of vitamin D in implantation and clinical pregnancy rates in patients undergoing in-vitro fertilization. Patients found to be deficient in vitamin D were found to have significantly lower clinical pregnancy rates when compared to patients who were replete in vitamin D levels. Currently, there are no prospective clinical trials investigating the effects of vitamin D supplementation on IVF outcomes such as clinical pregnancy rate and implantation rates. The investigators hypothesize that the vitamin D supplementation in patients found to be either deficient or insufficient in vitamin D will lead to improved pregnancy rates in infertility patients undergoing in-vitro fertilization.</brief_summary>
