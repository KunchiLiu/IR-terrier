	<brief_title>Pregabalin and Remifentanil - Analgesia and Ventilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain during cold pressor test (CPT) was scored at all dose levels of remifentanil on a visual analogue scale (VAS 0-100 mm). Ventilatory function was measured by spirometry registering respiratory frequency (breaths/min), minute volume (L/min) and expiratory end-tidal carbon dioxide tension (mmHg). Side effects such as nausea and sedation were registered.</detailed_description>
