	<brief_summary>This randomized, multicenter, 2-arm, open-label study (TH3RESA) will evaluate the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in comparison with treatment of the physician's choice in participants with metastatic or unresectable locally advanced/recurrent human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. Eligible participants will be randomized to receive either trastuzumab emtansine 3.6 mg/kg intravenously every 21 days or treatment of the physician's choice. Participants continue to receive study treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. This study is also known under Roche study protocol number BO25734.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Adult participants ≥ 18 years of age. Histologically or cytologically documented breast cancer. Metastatic or unresectable locally advanced/recurrent breast cancer. HER2positive disease by prospective laboratory confirmation. Disease progression on the last regimen received as defined by the investigator. Prior treatment with an trastuzumab, a taxane, and lapatinib. Disease progression after at least two regimens of HER2directed therapy in the metastatic or unresectable locally advanced/recurrent setting. Adequate organ function, as evidenced by laboratory results. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50% by echocardiogram or multi gated acquisition scan. Chemotherapy ≤ 21 days before first study treatment. Trastuzumab ≤ 21 days before first study treatment. Lapatinib ≤ 14 days before first study treatment. Prior enrollment in a trastuzumab emtansine containing study, regardless whether the patient received prior trastuzumab emtansine. Brain metastases that are untreated or symptomatic, or require any radiation, surgery or corticosteroid therapy to control symptoms within 1 month of randomization.</criteria>
