	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Everolimus (RAD001) in Children and Adults With Neurofibromatosis Type 2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Everolimus (RAD001) has been in clinical development since 1996 as an immunosuppressant in solid organ transplantation and has obtained marketing authorization (Certican®) for prophylaxis of rejection in renal and cardiac transplantation in a number of countries, including the majority of the European Union. Everolimus has been in development for patients with various malignancies since 2002. Everolimus 2.5mg, 5mg and 10mg tablets were approved under the trade name Afinitor® for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after failure of treatment with Sutent® (sunitinib) or Nexavar® (sorafenib) in the US, EU and several other countries and is undergoing registration in other regions worldwide. Afinitor® was also recently approved for the treatment of patients with subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associated with tuberous sclerosis (TS) who require therapeutic intervention but are not candidates for curative surgical resection. Everolimus is being investigated as an anticancer agent based on its potential to act: 1. Directly on the tumor cells by inhibiting tumor cell growth and proliferation; and 2. Indirectly by inhibiting angiogenesis leading to reduced tumor vascularity. For pediatric cancer patients, safety of RAD001 has been established in a phase 1 trial and the recommended phase II dose is 5 mg/m2 once daily. This existing pediatric data allows for inclusion of children in this phase 2 trial, which is an important consideration since some NF2 patients with the most aggressive clinical course present at school age. RAD001 was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of children and adults with subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA), a benign brain tumor associated with tuberous sclerosis (TS). Although surgical resection is effective at tumor reduction, serious complications may follow a radical resection, such as permanent deafness and facial nerve damage. Most importantly, the tumors often recur after surgery. Radiation therapy (RT) has been proposed as an alternative. However, its safety and efficacy in the NF2 population has not been established. A medical therapy option is desperately needed. This study is a single-center, 2-stage, phase II open-label study. All subjects will get RAD001 taken continuously until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary objective of this study is to look at the objective response rate to RAD001 in patients with NF2-related tumors including cranial nerve schwannomas, meningiomas and ependymomas. Participation will consist of screening/baseline visit(s), Day 1, Weeks 1, 2, and 4; and up to 12 cycles and will include standard of care procedures such as medical history, vital signs, physical examinations, ECGs, MRIs, audiograms, and laboratory tests. Novartis will provide the RAD001 free of charge to eligible study subjects. The primary efficacy response for study purposes will be a greater than or equal to 15% reduction in tumor volume in any of the target tumors (partial response). Complete disappearance of any of the target tumors will constitute a complete response (CR).</detailed_description>

Karnofsky/Lansky performance status (PS) 50100%. Note: Patients who are unable to walk because of paralysis, but who are up in a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the performance score. Adequate bone marrow function as shown by: ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L, Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L, Hb &gt; 9 g/dL Adequate liver function as shown by: 1. serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN 2. ALT and AST ≤ 2.5x ULN INR ≤ 1.5. (Anticoagulation is allowed if target INR ≤ 1.5 on a stable dose of warfarin or on a stable dose of LMW heparin for &gt;2 weeks at time of enrollment.) Adequate renal function: serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Fasting serum cholesterol ≤300 mg/dL OR ≤ 7.75 mmol/L AND fasting triglycerides ≤ 2.5 x ULN.
