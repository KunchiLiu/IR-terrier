	<brief_title>Quantifying Collateral Perfusion in Cerebrovascular Disease-Moyamoya Disease and Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the early hours following large vessel occlusion, the ultimate severity of the stroke is largely determined by the ability of collateral flow networks to supply blood to ischemic tissue via circuitous routes that bypass the proximal clot. Robust collateral flow can improve response to thrombolytic therapy and decrease the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Despite their central importance, collaterals during acute stroke are poorly understood, largely because assessment has required an invasive imaging test, cerebral angiography. This proposal assesses whether a noncontrast MRI perfusion technique, called arterial spin labeling (ASL), can yield important information about collateral flow.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Moyamoya Patient Men and nonpregnant women, at least 21 years of age. Outpatients seen at the Stanford Neurosurgery and Neurology Departments. Ability to comply with all studies. Inclusion of Moyamoya patients with Sulfa allergies. Patients diagnosed with or suspected to have Moyamoya disease. Stroke Patient Men and nonpregnant women, at least 21 years of age. Patients admitted to the inpatient Stanford Stroke Service for strokelike symptoms, less than 24 hours from last time seen normal. Ability to comply with all studies. Clinical Patient Acetazolamide MRI Men and nonpregnant women, at least 21 years of age. Patients admitted to the inpatient Stanford Stroke Service or Neurosurgical Service for symptoms compatible with cerebrovascular disease. Ability to comply with all studies. Normal Subject Ability to comply with the MRI study. Level of consciousness score of 2 or greater as defined by the NIH stroke scale. Symptoms likely related to psychoactive drugs or patients with symptoms related to an active inflammatory disease such as AIDS, meningitis, or cerebritis. Psychiatric or substance abuse disorder or dementia that interferes with evaluation or interpretation of the neurologic and mental assessment of these patients. Informed consent cannot be obtained either from the patient or legal representative. Severe coexisting or terminal systemic disease that limits life expectancy or that may interfere with the conduct of the study. Symptoms related to an alternative diagnosis such as seizures or migraine. Patients receiving any thrombolytic agent or receiving acute stroke investigational drug therapies during the 30day study.</criteria>
