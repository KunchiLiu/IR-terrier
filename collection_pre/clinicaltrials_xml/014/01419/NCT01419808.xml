	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether treatment of scaphoid non-unions with a vascularized bone grafts improves patient reported pain and disability compared to treatment with a non-vascularized bone graft. Secondary objectives are to examine if there is any difference in the overall rate and time to union, range of motion, grip strength, or complication rates between the two groups. In addition, this is the first prospective randomized study to directly compare the two techniques. This is also the first study to use standardized methods of assessing union (based on computerized tomography), standardized methods of collecting objective patient data, and utilizing validated patient questionnaires to assess pain and disability.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The primary inclusion criterion is any scaphoid waist or proximal pole nonunion in a patient receiving a recommendation for operative treatment. Nonunion is defined as &lt;10% bony union across the fracture site on sagittal computerized tomography (CT) after at least 16 weeks of appropriate nonoperative treatment or morphologic features on plain xray and CT (resorption and sclerosis at the fracture site, significant cyst formation) confirming nonunion. radiologic evidence of significant scaphoid nonunion advanced collapse (SNAC) wrist arthritis fragmentation of the proximal pole</criteria>
