	<brief_title>Promoting a Healthier Lifestyle Among Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group of breast cancer survivors will receive general information on how to adopt healthy lifestyle behaviors. The other group of breast cancer survivors will receive counseling on how to increase their level of physical activity. Participants will have three consultations with a health counselor. The first two consultations will take place in-person and the third consultation will take place via telephone. Participants will also be asked to complete questionnaires assessing their physical and mental well-being, their dietary habits, and their physical activity habits at four time-points: in-person during their first study visit, via mail or through an online survey 6 weeks later, in-person 12 weeks later, and via mail or through an online survey 24 weeks later. Additionally, during their first study visit and 12 weeks later, their level of aerobic fitness will be tested by having participants walk a long hallway for six minutes.</detailed_description>
