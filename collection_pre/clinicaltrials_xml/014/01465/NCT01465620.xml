	<detailed_description>Metabolic disorder such as diabetes mellitus, glucose intolerance and possibly metabolic syndrome can induce a peripheral neuropathy. The objectives of the present study are to investigate: 1. the effect of physical training and diet education on neuropathic symptoms and neurophysiological parameters 2. the best coaching modality of education. This will be a prospective single blind study (blinded evaluator). Patients will be randomly assigned in two groups. The first group will have a one-day therapeutic education program followed by a 5-minutes phone call every week for 3 months. The second group will have the same one-day therapeutic education program that will be followed by an unique one-hour phone call. During the one-day therapeutic education program and the phone calls, hygienic rules (ie physical activities) and dietetic regimen advices will be given to patients. Evaluation will be done at 3 months.</detailed_description>
