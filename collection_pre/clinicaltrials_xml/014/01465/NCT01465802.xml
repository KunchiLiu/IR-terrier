	<brief_summary>To assess the impact of prophylactic treatment on the incidence of adverse events in advanced NSCLC patients (post chemotherapy) treated with dacomitinib daily as a single agent. To assess the impact of an interrupted dacomitinib dosing schedule in Cycle 1 on the incidence of adverse events in first-line advanced NSCLC patients with an EGFR mutation (HER-1 mutation, HER-2 mutation or HER-2 amplification).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Advanced NonSmall Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). For Cohort I and Cohort II, advanced NSCLC patients must have received at least one prior regimen of systemic therapy which includes at least one standard chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC and who have failed (ie, progressed or intolerant due to toxicity which precludes further treatment) standard therapy for advanced or metastatic disease. To be considered intolerant to treatment, a patient must have received at least two cycles to be considered previously treated. For Cohort III, advanced NSCLC patients must not have received prior systemic treatment for their advanced disease and require a known EGFR (HER1) mutation, HER2 mutation or HER2 amplification. Cohort III patients could have received prior adjuvant chemotherapy for Stage IIII disease or combined modality chemotherapyradiation for Stage IIIA disease is allowed if treatment completed&gt;12 months prior to enrollment. All cohorts, patients must have evidence of disease; however, measurable disease is not required to enroll. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status 02 Estimated creatinine clearance â‰¥15 mL/min. Prior treatment with an EGFRtargeted or HERtargeted agent (all cohorts). Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, biological or investigational agents within 2 weeks of baseline disease assessments (all cohorts). Patients with known diffuse interstitial lung disease (all cohorts). Investigational therapy as only treatment for advanced NSCLC without administration of an approved chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC (for Cohort I and Cohort II)</criteria>
