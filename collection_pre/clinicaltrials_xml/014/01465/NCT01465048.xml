	<brief_summary>This is an open label, human pilot study to optimise controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) administered by Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ. Volunteers will be inoculated with PfSPZ Challenge. The route of administration and dose will vary in order to identify the optimal regimen that achieves the greatest infection rate in volunteers with Plasmodium falciparum. All volunteers recruited will be healthy adults aged between 18 and 45 years. Safety and infectivity data will be collected for each of the regimens.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimisation of Controlled Human Malaria Infection Using Sporozoites Administered by Needle and Syringe</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies involving CHMI are a powerful tool for investigating malaria vaccine and prophylactic drug efficacy.CHMI has now become established as a key tool to assess the efficacy of novel malaria vaccines and drugs. As CHMI trials are carried out in a controlled environment, they allow unprecedented detailed evaluation of parasite growth and immunological responses, providing essential information for vaccine and drug development. Out of three currently available methods of performing experimental human malaria infections (blood stage infection, mosquito bites and sporozoite infection), experimental injection directly by needle and syringe using aseptic, purified, cryopreserved sporozoites is, in principle, the most accurate and practical way of dosing sporozoites for challenge studies. Recently, Sanaria Inc have been able to overcome the technical issues associated with the production of aseptic, purified, cryopreserved Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites. As a result, an Investigational New Drug application (IND) was submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in February 2009, and a Phase 1 clinical trial with experimental challenge of volunteers was initiated in April 2009. Another trial sponsored by Sanaria to find the dose of aseptic, purified, cryopreserved sporozoites that should be used for experimental human malaria infections is currently ongoing with collaboration with the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center, The Netherlands. This trial will be the first time aseptic, purified, cryopreserved P. falciparum sporozoites have been administered intramuscularly to humans.</detailed_description>
