	<brief_summary>Immediately following tooth removal, a healing process begins that affects the eventual alveolar bone volume and architecture of the alveolar ridge. Satisfactory and timely healing are essential to obtain ideal functional reconstruction. Traumatic removal of a tooth, or a poor healing response, may lead to excessive bone loss delaying tooth replacement, requiring expensive and time-consuming reconstructive surgeries, or even the inability to be corrected. The Plasma Rich in Growth Factors (PRGF-Endoret) has shown its therapeutic potential effect to minimize the consequences of this aggression, promoting the regeneration of both hard and soft involved tissues.</brief_summary>
