	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Mirtazapine to Treat Interferon-related Depression During Antiviral Therapy for Hepatitis C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression is a common serious adverse event (30%-50%) during the interferon treatment for chronic hepatitis C. Adequate control of depressive symptoms might enable to adhere to antiviral therapy and lead to the favorable prognosis for patients with chronic hepatitis C. Mirtazapine is an effective antidepressant for depressive mood as well as insomnia and anxiety. Mirtazapine has also relatively lower drug-drug interactions, which are important for patients with hepatic dysfunction. In this study, the investigators are going to perform an 8-week, randomized, open label trial comparing anti-depressive efficacy between mirtazapine and supportive psychotherapy in depression induced by peginterferon alpha-2a and ribavirin treatment in Korean patients with chronic hepatitis C.</detailed_description>
