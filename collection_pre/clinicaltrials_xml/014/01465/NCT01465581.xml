	<brief_summary>The target population of this study is children with primary or secondary daytime urinary incontinence, who have failed to improve adequately despite compliance with at least 6 months of standard medical therapy. The study hypothesis is that patients who under go cutting the filum terminale - the string-like lower end of the spinal cord - will have improved bladder function at 6-month follow up. Bladder function and its effects on quality of life will be measured before surgery and at 6-month follow up.</brief_summary>
