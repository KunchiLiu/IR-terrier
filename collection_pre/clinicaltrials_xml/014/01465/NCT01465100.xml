	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to determine whether partial irradiation of the liver and liver cell transplantation can reduce the need for dietary and medical management or could possibly eliminate the need for a special diet and medications to treat this disease for patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) by normalizing phenylalanine levels in the body. Phenylalanine (Phe) is a substance needed in the body that can only be obtained from the foods people eat. People with PKU cannot get rid of Phe in their body. Large amounts of Phe can cause problems, such as deterioration of mental function. At the present time, liver cell transplants are experimental and have been done in only a limited number of human subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Liver Cell Transplant for Phenylketonuria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human phenylketonuria (PKU) results from phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency, and represents one of the most common and extensively studied single-gene Mendelian disorders in humans. Unfortunately, optimum clinical outcome demands lifelong dietary restriction through adherence to an unpalatable and expensive artificial diet. Challenges in maintaining traditional therapy lead to increasing phenylalanine (Phe) levels in patients as they approach adulthood with an incumbent severe burden of psychosocial and intellectual difficulties. The recent introduction of the new medication Sapropterin for treatment of PKU has improved Phe control and dietary tolerance in some patients, but at enormous cost to patients and insurers for the FDA designated orphan product. Thus, there is an unmet need for novel therapies to correct PKU. PAH is almost exclusively expressed in the liver in humans. The main objective of the current proposal is to determine the feasibility of hepatocyte transplantation to correct the biochemical (and ultimately, clinical) features of PKU.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Children (1417 years of age) 1. Previous diagnosis of classical PKU as determined by Phe &gt;20 mg/dl at diagnosis or a PAH mutation known to cause classical PKU 2. Patients have poor control on standard therapy (i.e. Kuvan or diet alone) as defined by two consecutive phe levels of &gt; 12 mg/dl in past 6 months. This is nearly 4 times the recommended level. 3. Baseline I.Q. &gt;70 as assessed by Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (2subtest IQ) 4. Cognitive or psychological impairment as defined by a score of one standard deviation below the mean in two of the four following assessments: Wechsler Intelligence Scale for ChildrenFourth AdditionCoding Subtest (for individuals up to 16 years, 11 months years of age) OR Wechsler Adult Intelligence TestFourth EditionCoding Subtest (for individuals 17 years of age) Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (parent version) DelisKaplan Executive Function System (DKEFS) Verbal Fluency BASCII (Behavior Assessment System for ChildrenSecond Addition) 5. Psychological assessment in the past year 6. Must have a complete evaluation including dietary records in PKU clinic. Thereafter, monthly Phe levels will be drawn (per clinical care management for PKU patients) and 3Day food records will be completed monthly until hepatocyte cells are available. Adults (18 years of age and older) 1. Previous diagnosis of classical PKU as determined by Phe &gt;20 mg/dl at diagnosis or a PAH mutation known to cause classical PKU 2. Patients have poor control on standard therapy (i.e. Kuvan or diet alone) as defined by two consecutive phe levels of &gt; 12 mg/dl in past 6 months. This is double the recommended level. 3. Psychological assessment in the past year 4. I.Q. &gt;70 as assessed by any standardized and validated IQ measure. 5. Must have dietary documentation and a routine clinical evlauation in PKU clinic one month prior to enrollment. Monthly Phe levels will be drawn (per clinical care management for PKU patients) and 3Day food records will be completed monthly until hepatocyte cells are available. I.Q. &lt;70 No biopterin synthestase defects Subject has active malignancy. Subject has allergy to immune suppression medications that are required post transplant procedure for the prevention of rejection. Subject has sepsis, pneumonia, other active infection or secondary lifethreatening organ dysfunction. Liver biopsies, not necessarily a consideration for organ transplantation, but a contraindication at this time to cell transplantation if significant fibrosis was identified, may be performed if there is clinical indication of liver disease. Significant liver fibrosis will be defined by the Ishak Staging, Stage 5: bridges with occasional nodules. Subject is pregnant or breastfeeding. Subject has positive HIV serostatus. Inability to comply with research procedures.</criteria>
