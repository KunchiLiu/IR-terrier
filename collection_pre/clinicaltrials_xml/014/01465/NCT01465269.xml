	<brief_title>Treatment of Social Competence After Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Impairments in social competence are among the most prevalent sequelae after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Without successful social skills a person is often isolated, in conflict with others, and denied access to social and vocational opportunities. The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a manualized group treatment program to improve and maintain social competence for individuals with TBI with identified social skill deficits. The Group Interactive Structured Treatment (GIST) - Social Competence program is a holistic, dual-disciplinary intervention targeting the pervasive interpersonal and communication problems that often interfere with participation at work, home, school and in the community after TBI. Aims and Hypotheses: Aim 1: Measure the effectiveness of the GIST intervention with multisite implementation. Hypothesis 1a: Those receiving the GIST will demonstrate significant improvement in social competence, compared to those receiving the alternative treatment, as measured by the Profile of Pragmatic Impairment in Communication (PPIC). Hypothesis 1b: Compared to the alternative intervention, those receiving the GIST will maintain improvement in social competence at 3 months post-intervention, as measured by the PPIC. Hypothesis 1c: Compared to the alternative intervention, those receiving the GIST will demonstrate improvement in additional aspects related to social competence at 3 months post-intervention, as measured by the LaTrobe Communication Questionnaire, the Goal Attainment Scale, the Brief Symptom Inventory-18, and the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Check List - Civilian version. Hypothesis 1d: Compared to the alternative intervention, those receiving the GIST will demonstrate improvement at 3 months post intervention in quality of life, as measured by the Satisfaction with Life Scale. Aim 2: Identify the potent ingredients associated with the GIST. Hypothesis 2a: FOr participants in the GIST intervention, higher group cohesion measured by the TFI: Cohesiveness Scale will be associated with improved social competence. Hypothesis 2b: Compared to the alternative intervention, those receiving the GIST will demonstrate stronger social self efficacy associated with improved social competence, as measured by the Scale of Perceived Self Efficacy. Study Design: This study uses a two-arm, multi-centered randomized controlled clinical trial design to compare the GIST treatment to an alternative treatment, in which participants are presented information from the GIST treatment program without the group process. A total of 192 military, veteran and civilian participants with mild to moderate TBI will be enrolled by six centers. Measures will be collected at baseline, post-treatment, and 3 months post-treatment. Videotapes of participants will be evaluated for social competence by blinded independent raters, and progress on individualized social skills goals will be assessed. Replicable training of group leaders will include a 2 Â½ day in-person workshop followed by feedback during a pilot of the intervention and alternative intervention. The fidelity of the intervention will be assessed by independent raters using a standardized instrument to ensure that the intervention is implemented consistently. Results of this study will be disseminated to relevant stakeholders via presentations and publications. By the end of this study, the field will have definitive evidence about the effectiveness of a group social competence intervention for people with TBI. Military Benefit: The proposed study has a high degree of relevance for returning OIF/OEF soldiers and veterans post-TBI due to the prevalence of social reintegration difficulties in this population. The GIST intervention has the potential to assist our soldiers and veterans in returning to full participation in their families, communities and productive activity.</detailed_description>
