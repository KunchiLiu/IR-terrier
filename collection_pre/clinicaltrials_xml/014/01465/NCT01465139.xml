	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate CDX-301 (rhuFlt3L) in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of seven cohorts of healthy volunteers are planned with doses of CDX-301 (rhuFlt3L) ranging between 1 and 75 μg/kg and dosing durations between 5 and 10 days. Volunteers will be admitted to an inpatient unit during the Treatment Period. Blood samples will be collected periodically to assess the effect of CDX-301. Volunteers will be followed for safety for 28 days following the last dose. Any volunteer who develops anti-CDX-301 antibodies will be followed monthly until the antibody response is below the limit of detection. In general, the total duration of the study will be between approximately 33-38 days.</detailed_description>
