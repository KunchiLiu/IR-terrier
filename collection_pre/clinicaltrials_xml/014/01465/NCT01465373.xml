	<brief_title>Vaginal Progesterone Versus Progesterone in Oil in Donor Egg Recipient In Vitro Fertilization Cycles Utilizing Vitrified Donor Eggs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical pregnancy rate of micronized progesterone (Endometrin, Ferring Pharmaceuticals) compared to progesterone in oil injections in in-vitro fertilization (IVF) donor egg recipients. The secondary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of freezing/vitrification of donor eggs. Effectiveness of vitrification will be evaluated by egg thaw/survival, fertilization, and implantation rates.</detailed_description>
