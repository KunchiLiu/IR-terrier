	<brief_title>Innate Immunity and the Allergic Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A specific subset of neutrophils (CD49d+) will be recruited to the nasal tissue of individuals with allergic disease, and that these cells will also be found in the peripheral blood of allergic subjects. Normal subjects (those without atopy) and those treated for atopic disease will lack the presence of these cells.</detailed_description>

Any prior history of immunodeficiency, cardiac, congenital, diabetes, renal, gastrointestinal, hematologic, or oncologic disease. 3. The use of any intranasal and inhaled corticosteroids within the last month. 4. Current therapy with any medication other than as needed overthecounter medications or asneeded (not scheduled) antihistamine use. 5. Current pregnancy. 6.
