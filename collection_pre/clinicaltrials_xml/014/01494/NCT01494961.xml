	<brief_summary>ANRS 12127 Prenahtest is an intervention trial conducted in four countries (Cameroon, Dominican Republic, Georgia and India), where pregnant women are randomized during prenatal care to receive either standard post-test HIV counseling, or an innovative intervention called couple-oriented post-test HIV counseling (COC). The aim of the COC intervention is to empower women to communicate with her male partner about HIV, and HIV testing in particular, and encourage him to return for HIV testing and/or couple HIV counseling (where both couple members are counseled together). Prenahtest is the first randomised trial testing a prenatal intervention to increase partner HIV testing.</brief_summary>
