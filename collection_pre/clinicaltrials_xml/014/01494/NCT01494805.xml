	<brief_summary>The study will involve approximately 40 subjects aged 55 or above who have exudative age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). Patients will be randomized to receive one of two doses of rAAV.sFlt-1 or assigned to the control group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy Study of rAAV.sFlt-1 in Patients With Exudative Age-Related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A new treatment for exudative age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) is being investigated. The purpose of this Phase I/II clinical research study is to examine the baseline safety and efficacy of an experimental study drug to treat a complication of the disease which leads to vision loss. The name of the study drug is rAAV.sFlt-1. This experimental study uses a non-pathogenic virus to express a therapeutic protein within the eye. The therapeutic diminishes the growth of abnormal blood vessels under the retina. The duration of effect is thought to be long-term (years) following a single administration. The clinical research study will look at the baseline safety and efficacy of a single injection of rAAV.sFlt-1 injected directly into the eye. Approximately forty (40) subjects will participate in Australia. The primary endpoint of the study is at one month, with extended follow up for 3 years.</detailed_description>
