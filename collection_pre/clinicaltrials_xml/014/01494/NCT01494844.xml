	<brief_summary>This research study will test the comfort of two noninvasive respiratory monitoring sensors (the connection to a monitor worn by a personâ€”not the monitor). The two sensors, Masimo Rainbow Acoustic Monitoring sensor and Oridion Smart Capnoline Plus H sensor, are cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and currently used in the clinical setting. People who enter into the study will wear the two interfaces, one after the other, for 20 minutes each (10 minutes with a small flow of air to the nostrils and 10 minutes without) and rate the comfort of each with a seven question survey. A total of 30 participants will be recruited.</brief_summary>
