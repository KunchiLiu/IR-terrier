	<brief_summary>1. Goals The primary goal of this phase II trial is to: evaluate the response rate of combination chemotherapy with Fluorouracil, Leucovorin, Oxaliplatin, and Irinotecan in patients with locally advanced or metastatic Biliary tract cancer as first-line chemotherapy Secondary goals are to: evaluate the treatment-related toxicities of this combination, investigate progression-free survival(PFS) and overall survival(OS) in this population 2. Design The proposed clinical trial is an open label, non-comparative, multicenter phase II trial according to the two stage testing design by Simon two-stage testing procedure</brief_summary>

Patients who received radiotherapy on target lesion within 6 months prior to study treatment 5. Patients with defect of central nervous system (CNS) or any psychiatric disorders and CNS metastases 6. Patients who received major surgery within 4 weeks of starting study treatment or was not recovered from any effects of major surgery 7. Pregnant or breastfeeding women and women of childbearing potential not employing adequate contraception 8. Other serious illness or medical conditions A.

Liver cirrhosis (≥ ChildPugh class B) C. History of significant neurologic or psychiatric disorders including dementia or seizures D. Active uncontrolled infection E. Other serious underlying medical conditions which could impair the ability of the patient to participate in the study 9. Concomitant administration of any other experimental drug under investigation, or concomitant chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or immunotherapy</criteria>
