	<brief_title>Clinical Study to Evaluate Tolerability and Safety of ARK-E021 Foam and to Monitor Clinical Effect in Acne Vulgaris Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase I/II prospective, multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, dose range finding clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of ARK-E021 foam for treatment of acne vulgaris. It is anticipated that the study will be conducted at the listed Medical Centers as well as out-patient clinics at the community. Approximately 144 male and female subjects with mild to moderate facial acne vulgaris will be enrolled in this study. Following satisfaction of the entry criteria and screening procedures, subjects will be randomized to either 5% or 10% topical foam (ARK-E021) or placebo foam. Subjects will apply the study medication once daily on the face at bedtime for 12 weeks followed by a post-treatment follow up visit 4 weeks after end of treatment. The first dose will be applied in the presence of the study investigator or his assignee. Subsequent applications will be made by the patient. Safety will be monitored throughout the study duration. Efficacy will be assessed by facial lesion counts and by the investigator global evaluation of acne severity at baseline and at weeks 3, 6, 9, 12 and 16.</detailed_description>
