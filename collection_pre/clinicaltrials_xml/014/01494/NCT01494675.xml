	<brief_summary>Recently, biomarkers like procalcitonin have been studied in order to help physicians to decrease the duration of the antibiotic therapy. The investigators objective was to assess whether the decrease in procalcitonin levels could be used to reduce the antibiotic therapy in critically ill patients with a proven infection without risking a worse outcome.</brief_summary>
