	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the effect of the repeated usage of two different contact lens care systems (one hydrogen peroxide-based cleaning and disinfecting system, and one polyaminopropyl biguanide (PHMB)-containing multipurpose system) with silicone hydrogel contact lenses worn on a daily wear basis for three months. The specific aspect of interest was the effect on the ocular tissue, in particular the eyelids and their associations with the contact lens surface wettability and surface contamination.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The subjects attended the enrollment visit having worn their habitual silicone hydrogel contact lenses for at least six hours on the day of the visit. The enrollment visit was scheduled so that the subjects' habitual lenses were at least 14 ± 3 days old for the subjects replacing their lenses bi-weekly and at least 30 ± 5 days old for those replacing their lenses monthly.</detailed_description>
