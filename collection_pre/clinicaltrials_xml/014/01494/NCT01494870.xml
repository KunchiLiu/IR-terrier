	<brief_title>Management of Acute Myocardial Infarction in the Presence of Left Bundle Branch Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current recommendations on the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) dictate urgent reperfusion therapy in the case of evolving myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation (STEMI). Optimal use of PCI (preferably) or thrombolysis in this situation requires a rapid and correct diagnosis. According to the ESC'2008 and ACC/AHA'2009 focused update guidelines patients admitted to the hospital within 12 hours after the onset of chest pain with new (or presumably new) left bundle-branch block (LBBB) should be treated like patients having STEMI (class I, level A). However, it is well-known that in patients with concomitant LBBB, the ECG manifestations of acute myocardial injury may be masked. ACS may occur in a patient with "true old" LBBB (when doctor has/has not an ability to compare the new ECG with the previous one) or (presumably) new LBBB. There is a high risk of non receiving appropriate therapy or of receiving inappropriate therapy (thrombolysis instead of LMWH/UFH/fondaparinux).</detailed_description>
