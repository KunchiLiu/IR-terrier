	<brief_summary>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study to determine the effect of ranolazine when added to glimepiride on glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who are inadequately controlled despite current treatment with stable sulfonylurea or metformin therapy in addition to diet and exercise.</brief_summary>
