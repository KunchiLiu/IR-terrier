	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effect between two preparations of somatropin (T and C) after a single administration of 5 mg in healthy subjects by altering serum somatropin pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC0-24h, AUC0-inf, Cmax, Tmax and T1 / 2) and pharmacodynamic (measurement of serum levels of IGF-1 presented by the concentration-time profile, AUC 0-24h and AUC0-inf.).</brief_summary>
