	<brief_summary>The OPTIFLOW ™ use is becoming more common in acute respiratory failure cases, but its place in relation to VNI (Bi-PAP mode) is not yet defined. OPTIFLOW ™ vs the VNI comparison of the use, in the immediate postoperative period, should lead to define the role of each technique and lead to a optimal rationalization of patients management with acute respiratory failure after surgery.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BIPAP Vision Versus OPTIFLOW System Comparison in Acute Respiratory Failure After Cardio Thoracic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Main objective: to determine, if the initiation of OPTIFLOW™ system immediate after cardio/ thoracic surgery with acute respiratory failure or immediate after post extubation in patients at risk, is not less than the start a VNI per BIPAP Vision ®system. In terms of reintubation rates, refusal to continue the technique, or switch to another technique proposed. Secondary objectives: - To assess changes in the sensation of dyspnea - To analyze the skin tolerance and the comfort in this population - To analyze the evolution of hemodynamic and respiratory parameters - To compare the number of bronchoscopy performed during the patient's stay in intensive care unit - Assess the number of postoperative pneumonia and antibiotic consumption - To determine whether the initiation of any treatment changes in the immediate postoperative length of stay in intensive care and comprehensive.</detailed_description>
