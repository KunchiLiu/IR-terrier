	<brief_summary>The objective of this pilot study is to determine if degenerative spinal disorders such as acute radiculopathy, myelopathy, stenosis, or disc and facet disease cause detectable alterations in Substance P levels in saliva, serum and cerebrospinal fluid. If this pilot study shows a correlation between Substance P levels and pain associated with degenerative spinal disorders, then a larger study will be initiated to determine the feasibility of using Substance P levels in the diagnosis and treatment of degenerative spinal disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>This Study is to Determine if Degenerative Spinal Pain and Disorders Cause the Levels of Substance P to Change in a Patients Saliva, Blood and/or Cerebrospinal Fluid.</brief_title>
