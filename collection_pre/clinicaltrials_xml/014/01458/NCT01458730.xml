	<detailed_description>The objective of the study is 1. To investigate the efficacy and safety of a high-dose methotrexate-based induction polychemotherapy regimen combined with Rituximab and intraspinal DepoCyte followed by temozolomide maintenance treatment in newly diagnosed primary central nervous system lymphoma 2. To assess the long term outcome concerning neurotoxicity</detailed_description>
