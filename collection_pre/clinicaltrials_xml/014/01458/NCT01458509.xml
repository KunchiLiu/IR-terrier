	<brief_summary>It can be difficult to obtain the perspective of patients who have had bowel surgery. This study is being done because the investigators are trying to find out whether patient-reported outcomes, (results reported to investigators by the patient), on a regular basis, will help the investigators provide better patient care and symptom management. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine if it is possible and if it is useful to their medical care for patients who have had bowel surgery to complete surveys about their symptoms on a regular basis. In this study the surveys are completed from home, by web or by telephone, every month for 6 months. The results of this study will guide the design of large research studies on cancer-related bowel function. The purpose of this study is to develop a bowel function questionnaire for patients with colorectal cancer. The questionnaire will be used in future clinical trials to assess bowel function.</brief_summary>
