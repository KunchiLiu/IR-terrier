	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Histologically or cytologically confirmed soft tissue sarcoma of high or intermediate grade Documented evidence of advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma, not amenable to surgery or radiotherapy Within 6 months from the radiographic evidence of disease progression by RECIST criteria in the last chemotherapy regimen for advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma Presence of measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 Subjects who received at least one standard chemotherapy for advanced soft tissue sarcoma (an anthracycline or an ifosfamide monotherapy, or a combination therapy) Subjects aged ≥ 20 years at the time of informed consent Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 or 1 Adequate organ function Voluntary agreement to provide written informed consent Exclusion Criteria A history of malignancies or recurrence within 5 years after the remission Significant cardiovascular impairment Any serious concomitant illness or infection requiring treatment. Hypersensitivity to either halichondrin B or halichondrin B chemical derivatives or both. Subjects who have previously participated in a study with eribulin (whether treated with eribulin or not). Any medical or other condition which, in the opinion of the principal investigator, will preclude participation in a clinical trial. Subjects who have received any anticancer therapy, including surgery, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, cytotoxic, hormonal, biological (including humanized antibodies) and targeted agents within 21 days, or any investigational agent within 30 days, prior to the first dose of study drug. Subjects who have not recovered from toxicities as a result of prior anticancer therapy to ≤ Grade 1, according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), except for peripheral neuropathy of Grade 2 and alopecia. Subjects with known cerebral metastases with clinical symptoms or requiring treatment. Preexisting peripheral neuropathy &gt; CTCAE Grade 2.
