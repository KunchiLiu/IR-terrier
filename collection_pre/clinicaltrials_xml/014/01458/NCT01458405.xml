	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1. History of MI (STEMI or NSTEMI) within the prior 12 months due to a coronary artery event and evidenced by at least two of the following: typical ischemic symptoms, serial STT changes (new ST elevation or new left bundle block) and/or elevated troponin or CKMB &gt;5 times the upper limit of normal. Also at least one of the following: development of pathological Q wave ECG changes, imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium, or new regional wall motion abnormalities. 2. History of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), with stent placement resulting in TIMI flow = 3, in the coronary artery supplying the infarcted, dysfunctional territory and through which the treatment will be infused. 3. At least one assessment of left ventricular ejection function (LVEF) ≤0.45 as determined by any one of the standard modalities (echocardiography, ventriculography, nuclear imaging, CT and/or MRI) prior to or during the screening period. For subjects that fulfill the criteria of Recent MI (i.e., within 90 days of MI) at time of screening visit: assessment must be postreperfusion after index MI and the most recent test prior to or during the screening period. For subjects that fulfill the criteria of Chronic MI (i.e., greater than 90 days from MI) at the time of screening visit: assessment must be at least 21 days postreperfusion after index MI and the most recent test prior to or during the screening period. Note: subjects may screen as a Recent MI but be randomized into the Chronic MI strata if the infusion date is &gt; 90 days postMI. 4. Left ventricular infarct size of ≥ 15% of left ventricular mass in the qualifying infarctrelated region to be infused as determined by centrally read screening MRI, with associated thinning and/or hypokinesis, akinesis, or dyskinesis, with no large aneurysmal area in the infarcted regions. 5. No further revascularization clinically indicated at the time the subject is assessed for participation in the clinical trial. 6. Ability to provide informed consent and followup with protocol procedures. 7. Age ≥ 18 years. Exclusion Criteria 1. Subjects with a history of coronary artery bypass surgery, and a patent graft (arterial or saphenous vein graft) attached to the coronary artery to be infused. 2. Diagnosed or suspected myocarditis. 3. History of cardiac tumor, or cardiac tumor demonstrated on screening MRI. 4. History of acute coronary syndrome in the 4 weeks prior to study infusion. 5. History of previous stem cell therapy. 6. History of radiation treatment to the central or left side of thorax. 7. Current or history (within the previous 5 years) of systematic autoimmune or connective tissue disease including, but not limited to, giant cell myocarditis, cardiac or systemic sarcoidosis, Dressler's syndrome, chronic recurrent or persistent pericarditis. 8. History of or current treatment with immunosuppressive , antiinflammatory, or other agents to treat manifestations of systemic immunologic reactions, including chronic systemic corticosteroids, biologic agents targeting the immune system, antitumor and antineoplastic drugs, antiVEGF, or chemotherapeutic agents within 3 months prior to enrollment. 9. Prior ICD and/or pacemaker placement where study imaging site has not been trained and certified specifically for this protocol to conduct cardiac MRI in subjects with ICD and/or pacemaker placement. a. Presence of a pacemaker and/or ICD generator with any of the following limitations/conditions are excluded: i. Manufactured before the year 2000, ii. Leads implanted &lt; 6 weeks prior to signing informed consent, iii. Nontransvenous epicardial, abandoned, or nofixation leads, iv. Subcutaneous ICDs, v. Leadless pacemakers, vi. Any other condition that, in the judgement of devicetrained staff, would deem an MRI contraindicated. b. Pacemaker dependence with an ICD (Note: pacemakerdependent candidates without an ICD are not excluded). c. A cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device implanted &lt; 3 months prior to signing informed consent. 10. Estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt; 30 mL/min. 11. Participation in an ongoing protocol studying an experimental drug or device, or participation in an interventional clinical trial within the last 30 days. 12. Diagnosis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. 13. Current alcohol or drug abuse. 14. Pregnant/nursing women and women of childbearing potential that do not agree to use at least two forms of active and highly reliable method(s) of contraception. Acceptable methods of contraception include contraceptive pills, depoprogesterone injections, a barrier contraceptive such as a condom with or without spermicide cream or gel, diaphragms or cervical cap with or without spermicide or gel, or an intrauterine device (IUD). 15. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. 16. Viral hepatitis. 17. Uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c&gt;9%). 18. Abnormal liver function (SGPT/ALT &gt; 3 times the upper reference range) and/or abnormal hematology (hematocrit &lt; 25%, WBC &lt; 3000 µl, platelets &lt; 100,000 µl) studies without a reversible, identifiable cause. 19. Sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia &gt; 30 beats, not associated with the acute phase of a previous MI (&gt; 48 hours after the MI onset) or a new acute ischemic episode. 20. Ventricular fibrillation not associated with a new acute ischemic episode. 21. New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV congestive heart failure. 22. Evidence of tumor on screening chest/abdominal/pelvic (body) CT scan. 23. Any prior transplant. 24. Known hypersensitivity to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). 25. Known hypersensitivity to bovine products. 26. Any malignancy within 5 years (except for insitu nonmelanoma skin cancer and insitu cervical cancer) of signing the ICF. 27. Any condition or other reason that, in the opinion of the Investigator or Medical Monitor, would render the subject unsuitable for the study.</criteria>
