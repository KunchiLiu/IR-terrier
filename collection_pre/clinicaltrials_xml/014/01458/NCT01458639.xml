	<brief_summary>Phase 3 within-subject trial of Technegas V/Q SPECT and Tc-99m macro-aggregated albumin (MAA) imaging compared to Xenon-133 V/Q planar and Tc-99m macroaggregate of albumin (MAA) imaging for the diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism (PE).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Compare Technegas Ventilation-Perfusion SPECT and Xenon Ventilation-Perfusion Planar Imaging for Pulmonary Embolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase 3 within-subject trial of Technegas Ventilation SPECT and Tc-99m MAA perfusion imaging compared to xenon (Xe-133) Ventilation Planar and Tc-99m MAA perfusion imaging for the diagnosis of PE. Diagnosis of PE provided by review of the subjects' documented clinical information after 30 days of follow-up. Primary assessments of efficacy will be based on an independent blind reads of the Technegas V/Q SPECT images by three different readers and the independent blind reads of Xe 133 V/Q planar images by three different readers.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects will be enrolled in Cohort 1 if they meet the following requirements: 1. Male or female, at least 18 years of age. 2. Suspected of having PE and be a candidate for Xe133 V/Q imaging. 3. Willing and able to provide informed consent. 4. Stable and able to undergo Xe133 planar imaging, Technegas SPECT imaging, and planar/SPECT perfusion imaging and complete followup procedures. 5. Willing and agree to complete study procedures, including followup safety assessments. 6. Using adequate birth control, if female and fertile. 7. If female, has a negative urine or serum pregnancy test. 8. Agrees to return for a 24hour and 30 day followup safety assessment. Subjects will be enrolled in Cohort 2 if they meet the above criteria AND subject is likely to have pulmonary embolism based on one or more of the following: 1. Wells Score of 7 or greater. Subjects with a Wells Score less than 7 may be enrolled in Cohort 2 if there is agreement between the investigator and the medical monitor that the subject is at high risk for PE. 2. An abnormal Ddimer test. 3. Positive Doppler ultrasound for DVT. 4. CTA is positive for PE within 24 hours of this imaging study. Subject 1. Has undergone imaging with Iodine131 (I131) within 30 days, Thallium201 (Tl201) or Indium111 (In111) within 10 days, Fluorine 18 (F18) within 24 hours, or any other radiopharmaceutical not otherwise specified within 72 hours of this imaging study. 2. Has previously undergone an imaging study with a Tc99m agent, within 48 hours of this imaging study. 3. Is a pregnant or lactating female. 4. Has received Technegas in the past. 5. Was previously enrolled in another investigational study or received an investigational drug within 30 days prior to dosing. 6. Is hemodynamically unstable. 7. Has received therapeutic dose of low molecular weight or unfractionated heparin within 24 hours prior to dosing or Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) within 4 hours prior to dosing or has received treatment for PE between the time of a positive CTA, if performed, and Technegas V/Q SPECT imaging.</criteria>
