	<brief_summary>Huntington disease is characterized by difficulties in movement and thinking. Psychological disturbances including irritability, aggression, loss of interest, depressed mood, obsessions and compulsions, also represent common symptoms of HD. These symptoms are distressing both for HD patients and their caregivers, contribute to the loss of ability to carry out activities of daily living, and present a major treatment challenge for physicians. The goal of this study is to determine the effect of memantine on movement, thinking and emotional difficulties in HD patients. Memantine is a medication originally approved for the treatment of aggression and agitation in patients with moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease (AD), which has also recently been shown to improve the behavioural and neuropathological symptoms in a mouse model of Huntington Disease (HD).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial of Memantine as Symptomatic Treatment for Early Huntington Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TRACK-HD was a multi-centre, multi-national, prospective, observational study of pre-manifest and early Huntington's disease (HD) with a control group of volunteers not carrying the HD mutation. The goal of the project was to contribute essential methodology that will form the basis for clinical trials in pre-manifest and early HD. TRACK-HD complemented existing observational studies (e.g., Predict-HD, PHAROS, COHORT), sharing some features, but also having areas of unique emphasis. The UBC site recruited 90 subjects including 30 control subjects, 30 asymptomatic pre-manifest HD gene carriers and 30 subjects with early symptoms of HD (stage 1 or 2). All subjects were assessed using the TRACK-HD battery at baseline, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years. Following the fourth visit (3 year assessment), the TRACK-HD study will be completed, and the 30 subjects with early symptoms of HD will be invited to enroll in the MITIGATE-HD Study. The MITIGATE-HD study is a single center Phase IIb,out-patient,randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of memantine treatment in subjects with Huntington disease (HD). The study will evaluate Memantine 10 mg two times daily (BID) administered orally (PO) for six months (24 weeks) compared with matching placebo BID. Safety and tolerability will be assessed by recording of adverse events and by monitoring of vital signs, physical examinations, and suicidality risk scores. The TRACK-HD assessment battery will be administered to all subjects after six months of study drug administration. The effects of memantine will be evaluated both against placebo as well as compared to the previous 3 years of observational data from the TRACK-HD Study.</detailed_description>
