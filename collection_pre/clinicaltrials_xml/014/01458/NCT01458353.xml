	<brief_summary>Despite performing colonic surgery with strict asepsia measures, minimizing the contact of the colon lumen with the peritoneum, some contamination is nearly impossible to avoid. In stapled anastomosis, the hole opened in the colon is minimum, just the necessary for introducing the parts of the mechanical devices. In handsewn anastomosis, the colonic lumen is more exposed to the peritoneum, despite the colonic occlusion with clamps meanwhile the suture is performed. Hypothesis: After stapled anastomoses, the peritoneal contamination should be lower than after handsewn ones.</brief_summary>
