	<brief_summary>This study will consist of a single session of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy with a full dose of MDMA for people who took part in a study of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in people with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) whose PTSD symptoms returned to higher levels at least a year after the first MDMA sessions. The single session will be performed by the same pair of therapists who performed the sessions in the first study. People will have a preparatory session, the MDMA-assisted session and three non-drug sessions afterward. Their PTSD symptoms and symptoms of depression will be measured at the start of this study and two and 12 months after the session.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Additional MDMA-assisted Psychotherapy for People Who Relapsed After MDMA-assisted Psychotherapy Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will investigate the effects of an additional 3,4-methylenedioxymethamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy session in up to three participants with PTSD who relapsed after their PTSD symptoms had significantly decreased during MAPS' initial U.S. Phase 2 trial testing the use of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in subjects with chronic, treatment-resistant posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD). This new protocol will consist of a single, full-dose open-label session of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, along with associated non-drug preparation and integrative psychotherapy sessions. MDMA is an investigational drug that was studied in a randomized, placebo-controlled study in 21 participants, and it included a final evaluation of symptoms at least one year after taking part in the study. While PTSD symptoms in most study subjects stayed at the same levels from when they completed the study, symptoms had returned in a few people. This open-label study is intended to see if an additional MDMA-assisted session conducted at least 14 months after the first sessions can help reduce PTSD symptoms. The MDMA-assisted psychotherapy session will be conducted by a male and female co-therapist team, one a psychiatrist and the other a psychiatric nurse. Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse and body temperature) and psychological distress will be measured throughout the experimental session. After the experimental session they will spend the night in the clinic with an attendant on duty, and complete a measure of alterations in consciousness, the States of Consciousness Questionnaire (SCQ) on the evening or day following the experimental session. Participants will meet with the investigators the next morning for an integrative psychotherapy session before leaving the clinic. During integrative psychotherapy sessions they will receive support in integrating their experiences and insights from the MDMA-assisted psychotherapy session. There will be daily phone contact with one of the investigators for 7 days after the experimental session. Symptoms of PTSD, depression and general function will be assessed two months after the experimental session. There will be a long-term follow up with repeated outcome measures 12 months after the experimental session</detailed_description>
