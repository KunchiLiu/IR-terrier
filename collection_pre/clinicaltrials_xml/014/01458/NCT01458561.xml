	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled investigation. Subjects in which bleeding from the exposed parenchymal surface is observed intraoperatively following the ligature of vessels visible with the unaided eye will be randomized to an adjunctive application of BioFoam or a standard topical hemostatic agent (Gelfoam with thrombin, in the form of Gelfoam Plus) to the entire exposed parenchymal surface. Following primary treatment of the exposed parenchymal surface as prescribed by the randomization scheme, treatment sites will be visually evaluated for the continued presence of bleeding. The overall objective of this investigation is to collect clinical data concerning the safety and effectiveness of BioFoam used as an adjunct to conservative measures of achieving hemostasis, such as manual pressure, cautery, and ligation, for intraoperative capillary, arteriolar, and venular bleeding (5 second stack of 5 gauze surface "Bleeding Score" = 1b or 2, score to be validated) on newly resected liver parenchyma in hemodynamically stable (American College of Surgeons' Advanced Trauma Life Support Class I Hemorrhage) and non-coagulopathic patients in the open treatment of exposed liver parenchyma versus a standard topical hemostatic agent, Gelfoam Plus. It is not intended for traumatic liver injury. The investigation will be conducted at a maximum of three investigational sites.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Preoperative Subject is undergoing an elective liver resection procedure that requires treatment of the exposed parenchymal surface due to the intraoperative presence of blood following ligature of vessels visible with the unaided eye; Subject has adequate hepatic function as indicated by a Model for EndStage Liver Disease (MELD) score of &lt;10 at ≤30 days and at ≤7 days prior to surgery; Subject has adequate hemostatic function identified as an international normalized ratio (INR), platelet count, and activated clotting time within the central laboratory's normal reference range; Subject or an authorized legal representative is willing and able to give prior written informed consent for investigation participation; and Subject is ≥ 18 years of age. Preoperative Subject with known or suspected sensitivity to products of bovine origin Subject with known or suspected sensitivity to glutaraldehyde Subject with active infection (either systemic or in the treatment region) or hepatic cysts due to parasitic disease and/or abscesses due to bacterial and/or amebic disease; Subject with abnormal calcium metabolism identified as values for ionized calcium and serum calcium corrected for serum albumin that are outside of the central laboratory's normal reference range; Subject with abnormal renal status identified as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, sodium, chloride, potassium, and/or bicarbonate values that are outside of the central laboratory's normal reference range; Subject with hyperparathyroidism identified as an intact parathyroid hormone level &gt;72 pg/mL, serum calcium &gt;10.6 mg/dL, and phosphate &lt;2.4 mg/dL, and, for secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism only, alkaline phosphatase &gt;147 U/L Subject with a pancreatic amylase and/or lipase value outside of the central laboratory's normal reference range; Subject with blunt and/or penetrating liver trauma; Subject diagnosed with any coagulation disorder; Subject whose lifeexpectancy is less than that required for the prescribed followup duration; Subject who has been treated with an investigational product and has not completed the entire followup period for that investigational product; Subject with any surgical implant that would interfere with necessary followup imaging; Subject who is pregnant (as confirmed by a urine pregnancy test), planning on becoming pregnant during the followup period, or actively breastfeeding; Subject who is undergoing concomitant procedures other than (1) cholecystectomy, (2) umbilical hernia repair, or (3) uncomplicated colon resection (i.e., no significant spillage); Subject who is immunocompromised; Subject with an American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) Score &gt;2 Subject with a MELD score of ≥10 at ≤30 days or at ≤7 days prior to surgery; Subject diagnosed with an autoimmune disease; and Subject in whom the surgeon intends to use adhesion prevention products. Subject who is returning to the operating room (OR) to address a complication associated with a liver resection, including but not limited to hematoma evacuation and biliary leak. Intraoperative Inclusion Criterion: Subject in whom bleeding (assignment of a "Bleeding Score" of 1 or 2) from the exposed parenchymal surface after ligature of vessels visible with the unaided eye and removal of any clamps used for hemostasis is observed Intraoperative Exclusion Criterion: Subject in whom any major intraoperative bleeding incidences during the resection procedure occurred (i.e., subject with assignment of an American College of Surgeons Advanced Trauma Life Support Hemorrhage Class of II, III, or IV Hemorrhage)</criteria>
