	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of ABT-450/r when given together with ABT-267 and with and without RBV in treatment-naïve participants with genotype 1, 2 or 3 chronic HCV infection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate Paritaprevir With Ritonavir (ABT-450/r) When Given Together With Ombitasvir and With and Without Ribavirin (RBV) in Treatment-Naïve Participants With Genotype 1, 2 or 3 Chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This was a 2 sequential arm, combination treatment study where each arm contained 3 cohorts: one each for HCV genotype 1, 2, and 3. The study consisted of 2 phases, a treatment phase and a post-treatment phase. The treatment phase was designed to explore the antiviral activity, safety and pharmacokinetics of ABT-450/r dosed in combination with ABT-267 with and without RBV for up to 12 weeks. The post-treatment phase was designed to monitor and evaluate Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) 12, SVR 24, and the evolution and persistence of viral resistance to ABT-267 and ABT-450 in HCV genotype 1-, 2-, and 3-infected participants who have been exposed to ABT-267 and ABT-450/r. Arms 1 and 2 were enrolled sequentially.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants who had a body mass index 18 to &lt; 35 kg/m^2. Females were either postmenopausal for at least 2 years, surgically sterile, or willing to use at least 2 effective forms of birth control. Males must have been surgically sterile or agreed to use at least 2 effective forms of birth control throughout the course of the study. Participants were in a condition of general good health, other than the HCV infection. Participants had a chronic HCV genotype 1, 2, or 3 infection for at least 6 months, a plasma HCV RNA &gt; 50,000 IU/mL, and FibroTest score &lt;= 0.72 and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet ratio index &lt;= 2, Fibroscan® result of &lt; 9.6 kilopascal (kPa), or absence of cirrhosis based on a liver biopsy. Positive drug screen Previous use of antiHCV agents History of cardiac disease History of uncontrolled diabetes or diabetes requiring insulin Abnormal laboratory results Females who were pregnant or planned to become pregnant within 6 months after their last dose of study drug/RBV or were breastfeeding; males whose partners were pregnant or would become pregnant within 6 months after their last dose of study drug/RBV Positive test result for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or antihuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody (Ab). Negative HIV status was to be confirmed at screening.</criteria>
