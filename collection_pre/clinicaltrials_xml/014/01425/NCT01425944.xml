	<brief_summary>This study has three aims that hope to expand the knowledge on the cause of Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS) and improve clinical care of Sturge-Weber Syndrome patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Innovative Approaches to Gauge Progression of Sturge-Weber Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is one of three projects of an NIH Rare Disease Clinical Research Consortium focused on brain blood vessel malformations in three different rare diseases. The focus of this project is on Sturge-Weber Syndrome. We plan to improve the future understanding and treatment of Sturge-Weber Syndrome by 1) establishing a national consortium database which will gather lager amounts of clinical data and serve indirectly as a registry to foster future clinical trials and determine the usefulness of urine vascular biomarkers to determine the vascular remodeling of the SWS birthmark and choroidal angioma, 2) study vascular remodeling with retrospective and prospective neuroimaging to determine the vascular remodeling of the deep draining intraparenchymal vessels as it relates to SWS neurologic status, and 3) relate the GNAQ mutation to altered phosphorylation of pathway proteins and angiogenesis factors in SWS tissue.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For Aim 1: For main sample: SturgeWeber syndrome Diagnosed brain Involvement For Control: Family member of participating SWS patient For OCT: SturgeWeber syndrome eye involvement For Aim 2: SturgeWeber syndrome Diagnosed Brain Involvement For Aim 3: SturgeWeber syndrome Diagnosed brain Involvement PortWine Stain in V1 and/or V2 areas of face. Not Diagnosed with SturgeWeber syndrome with brain Involvement (or eye involvement for OCT) For Aim 1: Family member must not have certain medical conditions. A list will be provided before consent is given. For Aim 3: Not Diagnosed with SturgeWeber syndrome with brain Involvement No PortWine Stain</criteria>
