	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the effect of ranolazine compared to placebo on the average weekly angina frequency in subjects with chronic stable angina and coronary artery disease (CAD) who have a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and whether ranolazine can reduce the frequency of angina (chest pain) attacks, compared to a placebo. Subjects will be asked to record their daily angina episodes in a diary at the end of each study day. Ranolazine is approved for the treatment of chronic angina, and is not approved for the treatment of T2DM.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Type 2 Diabetes Evaluation of Ranolazine in Subjects With Chronic Stable Angina</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants who meet the eligibility criteria at screening will enter a 4-to 6-week Qualifying Period. The allowed concomitant antianginal medication(s) must be maintained at a stable dose throughout the study. Participants will document the number of angina episodes, number of sublingual nitroglycerin doses taken, and a dyspnea score (on a scale from 1 to 5) on a daily basis in a diary. Participants eligible to stay in the study after the Qualifying Period will enter the 8-week double-blind dosing phase. Participants will have study visits at the end of Weeks 2 and 8. Participants will continue to document the number of angina episodes and number of sublingual nitroglycerin doses taken as well as a dyspnea score on a daily basis by the end of each day in their diary. In addition, participants will be called during Week 2 and at the end of Week 5 to encourage compliance. A safety follow-up phone call will be made 14 days after the last study visit or early discontinuation.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Written informed consent Males and females aged at least 18 years At least a 3month history of chronic stable angina triggered by physical effort and relieved by rest and/or sublingual nitroglycerin CAD documented by one or more of the following: 1. Angiographic evidence of â‰¥ 50% stenosis of one or more major coronary arteries 2. History of myocardial infarction (MI) documented by positive myocardial muscle creatine kinase (CKMB) enzymes, troponins, or electrocardiogram (ECG) changes 3. Cardiac imaging study or exercise test diagnostic for CAD Treatment with up to 2 antianginal therapies at a stable dose for at least 2 weeks prior to the Qualifying Period. Documented history of T2DM Willing to maintain stable tobacco usage habits throughout the study Willing to maintain stable activity levels throughout the study Females of childbearing potential must agree to utilize highly effective contraception methods from Screening throughout the duration of study treatment and for 14 days following the last dose of study drug.
