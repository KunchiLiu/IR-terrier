	<brief_summary>The primary goal of the Phase III TWiTCH trial is to compare 24 months of alternative therapy (hydroxyurea) to standard therapy (transfusions) for pediatric subjects with sickle cell anemia and abnormally high (≥200 cm/sec) Transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocities, who currently receive chronic transfusions to reduce the risk of primary stroke. For the alternative treatment regimen (hydroxyurea) to be declared non-inferior to the standard treatment regimen (transfusions), after adjusting for baseline differences, the hydroxyurea-treated group must have a mean TCD velocity similar to that observed with transfusion prophylaxis.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite the clear results of the STOP and the follow-up STOP II trials, the use of chronic erythrocyte transfusions for primary stroke prevention in children with Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) remains controversial for many practicing hematologists, as well as for patients and families. Transfusions have proven clinical efficacy in preventing first stroke in children with SCA and abnormal TCD velocities, but their indefinite use may still be difficult to justifY. The risk of transfusion acquired iron overload is now recognized as a serious consequence of chronic erythrocyte transfusions in children with SCA. After one to two years of monthly transfusions, virtually every patient will have excess hepatic iron deposition that warrants intervention with chelation therapy. The effectiveness of iron chelation has not yet been realized, despite the availability of the oral chelator deferasirox (Exjade®), due to its lack of palatability and increasing recognition of serious drug-related toxicities including renal and hepatic dysfunction. Simply put, indefinite erythrocyte transfusions cannot be viewed as adequate and acceptable long-term therapy for primary stroke prevention in SCA. There is an urgent need to develop an equivalent effective alternative therapy for the prevention of primary stroke in children with SCA, specifically one that better manages iron overload and improves quality of life.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Pediatric subjects with severe forms of sickle cell anemia (HbSS, HbSβ0 thalassemia,HbSOArab) 2. Age range of 4.015.99 years, inclusive, at the time of enrollment 3. Documented index (pretreatment) abnormally high TCD Velocity by Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. An abnormally high index TCD is defined as TCD V greater than or equal to 200 cm/sec, or abnormally high TCDi V greater than or equal to185cm/sec, or TCD maximum V greater than or equal to 250 cm/sec. 4. At least 12 months of chronic monthly erythrocyte transfusions since the index abnormal TCD examination 5. Adequate monthly erythrocyte transfusions with average HbS less than or equal to 45% (the upper limit of the established academic community standard) for the past 6 months before enrollment 6. Parent or guardian willing and able to provide informed consent with verbal or written assent from the child 7. Ability to comply with study related treatments, evaluations, and followup 1. Completed overt clinical stroke or TIA 2. Inability to obtain TCD velocities due to anatomical abnormalities such as a) Inadequate bone windows b) Previous revascularization procedures (e.g., EDAS) 3. Known severe vasculopathy or moyamoya disease on brain MRA 4. Inability to receive or tolerate chronic red blood cell (RBC) transfusion therapy, due to any of the following: a) Multiple RBC alloantibodies making crossmatching difficult or impossible b) RBC autoantibodies making crossmatching difficult or impossible c) Religious objection to transfusions that preclude their chronic use d) Noncompliance with transfusions over the past 6 months before enrollment (temporary exclusion) 5. Inability to take or tolerate daily oral hydroxyurea, including a) Known allergy to hydroxyurea therapy b) Positive serology to HIV infection c) Malignancy d) Current lactation e) Previous stem cell transplant or other myelosuppressive therapy 6. Clinical and laboratory evidence of hypersplenism (temporary exclusions): a) Palpable splenomegaly greater than 5cm below the left costal margin AND b) Transfusion requirement greater than 250 mL/kg over the previous 12 months 7. Abnormal laboratory values at initial evaluation (temporary exclusions): a) Pretransfusion hemoglobin concentration less than 8.0 gm/dL b) WBC count less than 3.0 x 10^9/L c) Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 1.5 x 10^9/L d) Platelet count less than 100 x 10^9/L e) Serum creatinine more than twice the upper limit for age OR greater than or equal to 1.0 mg/dL 8. Current participation in other therapeutic clinical trials 9. Current use of other therapeutic agents for sickle cell disease (e.g., arginine, decitabine, magnesium). Subjects must have been off hydroxyurea for at least 3 months prior to enrollment. 10. Any condition or chronic illness, such as a positive tuberculin (PPD) test, which in the opinion of the CI makes participation illadvised. 11. Inability or unwillingness to complete required screening and exit studies, including TCD ultrasonography, brain MRI/MRA, liver MRI and blood tests. 12. A sibling enrolled in TWiTCH 13. Pregnancy or unwillingness to use a medically acceptable form of contraception if sexually active (male OR female).</criteria>
