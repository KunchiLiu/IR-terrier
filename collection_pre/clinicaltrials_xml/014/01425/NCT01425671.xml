	<brief_summary>The principle aim of the project is to analyze brain electrical activity and genetic information that will help identify the nature and cause of the disease schizophrenia. This effort should lay the groundwork for future treatment in schizophrenic patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There are several studies and hypotheses to be tested. This project includes a cross-sectional study design measuring brain waves, clinical symptoms, cognitive and functional ability, and genetic information in schizophrenic patients and normal controls. Subjects are expected to do a brain wave recording (EEG/ERP), role-play test designed to measure functionality and cognitive ability, and clinical symptom assessments. Expected duration of subject participation will be approximately 8 hours (about 2 visits). Outcome measures includes biomarkers, clinical symptoms and function, and genetic information.</detailed_description>
