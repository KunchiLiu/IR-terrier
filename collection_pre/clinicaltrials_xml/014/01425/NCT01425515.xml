	<brief_summary>The investigators are conducting a single group intervention study to improve blood pressure control and reduce racial and literacy related disparities among people with hypertension. The intervention includes providing patients with home blood pressure monitors, administering phone-coaching to participants, and improving hypertension care at the participating practices from which patients are enrolled. The investigators will follow the patients for 2 years to determine if blood pressure control improves. In addition, the project will explore genetic factors associated with cardiovascular disease risk and treatment success.</brief_summary>
