Males and females, 18 to 65 years of age inclusive with a body mass index (BMI) of at least 18 kg/m2 but not exceeding 36 kg/m2 Diagnosed with chronic HCV at least 6 months prior to Visit 1 with medical documentation (e.g., prior PCR result, prior liver biopsy, prior genotyping, etc.), with a positive HCV viral load of at least 50,000 IU/mL at Visit 1 (screening) as measured by quantitative PCR Chronic genotype 2 or 3 HCV infection (per polymerase chain reaction [PCR] methodology) HCV treatmentnaïve where "treatmentnaïve" is defined as no prior treatment with IFN alfa 2a or 2b, Pegylated IFN alfa2a, Ribavirin, or any HCV directacting antiviral drugs Liver biopsy consistent with chronic HCV infection but with a classification of noncirrhotic (and without classification of 'transition to cirrhosis or borderline cirrhosis') as judged by a pathologist (defined as Knodell ≤ 3, Metavir ≤ 2, Ishak ≤ 4, or Batts &amp;Ludwig ≤ 2 ) within the last two years and before Visit 2 (biopsy can be done after Visit 1 and before Visit 2, within the screening period) Negative urine drug screen for drugs of abuse and methadone (via central labprovided dipstick at site) at screening (Visit 1) (note: subjects with a valid prescription for a drug which can be abused [e.g., benzodiazepine, opiates] can be enrolled on the judgment of the investigator) Females will have a negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (βHCG) pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine dipstick pregnancy test on Study Day 0 (visit 2) Agreement by both female subjects of childbearing potential and male subjects (who have not been surgically sterilized) to practice an acceptable method of birth control, which includes at least one barrier during the study and for at least 6 months after the cessation of treatment. Surgical sterilization of either the female or the male partner must have occurred at least 6 months prior to the first dose and females must be postmenopausal for 2 years to be considered of nonchildbearing potential. Acceptable contraceptive methods include one of the following: Oral and implantable hormonal contraceptives by the female partner for at least 3 months prior to the first dose of Study Drug with additional use of a barrier method, IUD in place for at least 6 months prior to first dose with additional use of barrier method. Acceptable barrier methods include either diaphragm with spermicide, and condom with spermicide.
