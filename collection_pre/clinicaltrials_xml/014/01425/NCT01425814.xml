	<criteria>1. Males and nonpregnant, nonlactating females aged 40 or older. 2. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of COPD, according to the GOLD guidelines and stable airway obstruction. 3. Patients with a postsalbutamol FEV1 equal to or greater than 30% of the predicted value and less than 80% of the predicted value 4. Postsalbutamol FEV1/FVC &lt; 70% at screening visit. 5. Predose FEV1 value of first treatment period within the range of 80120% of the FEV1 measured at screening prior to salbutamol inhalation. 6. Current, or excigarette smokers (former) with a smoking history of at least 10 packyears. 7. Patients whose COPD symptoms at the time of randomisation are stable compared to the Screening visit, according to the investigator's medical judgment. 1. History or current diagnosis of asthma. 2. A respiratory tract infection or COPD exacerbation in the six weeks prior to the screening visit. 3. Patients who have been hospitalised for an acute COPD exacerbation in the 3 months prior to screening visit. 4. Clinically significant respiratory conditions other than COPD condition. 5. Clinically significant cardiovascular conditions. 6. Patients unable to properly use a dry powder or pMDI inhaler device or unable to perform acceptable spirometry. 7. Clinically relevant abnormalities laboratory, ECG parameters or physical examination results at the screening evaluation that in the investigator's opinion, preclude study participation. 8. Patients who intend to use any concomitant medication not permitted by this protocol or who have not undergone the required washout period for a particular prohibited medication.</criteria>
