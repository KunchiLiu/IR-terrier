	<brief_summary>The goal of this is to improve durability of total joint replacements in patients, thereby improving clinical outcomes and implant performance. To reach this objective, our research program would like to assess the safety, efficacy, performance, and durability of FDA approved biomaterial and implant designs used in joint replacements.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective of the investigation will be to determine the mechanism of material failure and identify any design features that put the implant at risk for early failure. Normally all implants are discarded. The investigators will collect the implants indicated for removal and if there are impressive findings the investigators will perform research on the implants, otherwise the implants will be discarded. All patients will be followed prospectively after informed consent is signed. The implants that are chosen for research will be assessed for implant wear and failure at a lab appropriate for evaluating the particular concern.</detailed_description>
