	<brief_summary>Bevacizumab is an anti vascular endothelial growth factor(anti-VEGF) substance that is known to reduce neovascularization and fibrovascular proliferation in inflammatory conditions, including post-operative inflammation. It has shown efficacy in numerous ocular conditions(off-label), that includes Age related macular degeneration, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma and corneal neovascularization. It is being explored as an option for preventing recurrence of pterygium and as an adjunct to improving outcomes of trabeculectomy. There is a debate as to the mode and duration of bevacizumab administration for trabeculectomy. This study aims to compare a single subconjunctival dose of bevacizumab with topical therapy over one month in terms of outcomes of trabeculectomy surgery, non-progression of field loss and stable intraocular pressure(IOP) control.</brief_summary>
