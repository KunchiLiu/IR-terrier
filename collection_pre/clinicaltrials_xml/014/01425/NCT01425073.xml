	<brief_summary>Both antiretroviral therapy (ART) and prevention of opportunistic infections (OIs) have been associated with significantly decreased mortality in HIV-infected individuals. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ), also known as bactrim, is a common antibiotic and used as prophylaxis for OIs. For countries with high prevalence of HIV and limited health infrastructure, the WHO endorses universal TMP/SMZ for all HIV-infected individuals. Notably, these guidelines were created prior to the scale-up of ARTs. Following ART and subsequent immune recovery, TMP/SMZ may no longer be required. In the US and Europe, for example, TMP/SMZ is discontinued after patients show evidence of immune recovery. Therefore, we propose a prospective randomized trial among HIV infected individuals on ART with evidence of immune recovery (ART for &gt; 18mo and CD4 &gt;350 cells/mm3) to determine whether continued TMP/SMZ prophylaxis confers benefits in decreasing morbidity (malaria, pneumonia, diarrhea), mortality, CD4 count maintenance, ART treatment failure and malaria immune responses.</brief_summary>
