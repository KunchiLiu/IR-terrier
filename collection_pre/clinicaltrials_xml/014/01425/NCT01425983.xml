	<brief_summary>Psychosocial stress leads to altered neuroendocrine functions, such as serotonergic dysfunction, as well as alterations of the autonomic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity resulting in an imbalance between inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters. Clinical consequences include, inter alia, neurovegetative disorders, higher resting heart rate, hypertension, depressive symptoms, sleep disturbances, irregular body-weight changes, and insulin resistance. Poor dietary intake of the essential amino acid L-tryptophane as a precursor to 5-hydroxytryptamine (HT, serotonin) increases sensitivity to stress. It is therefore the investigators hypothesis that daily oral administration of an amino acid mixture (dosage 3.8 g/day) with micronutrients specifically designed to decrease neurovegetative disorders will target these neuroendocrine and metabolic alterations in adults with psychosocial stress. The principal endpoints will be a decrease in points in the psychological-neurological questionnaire (PNF).</brief_summary>
