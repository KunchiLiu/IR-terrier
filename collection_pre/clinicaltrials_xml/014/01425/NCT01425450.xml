	<brief_summary>The study aims to: - study the safety of the drug (HF1020) in healthy male adults - study how well the study drug (HF1020) is tolerated in healthy male adults - find the maximum dose that is tolerated in healthy male adults</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study of Four Doses of the Study Drug, HF1020 in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending dose study. Male subjects will be randomised to give a total of 32 evaluable subjects. Subjects will be sequentially enrolled into 4 cohorts of ascending dose. Subjects in Cohort 1 will be randomised to receive 0.5 milligrams (mg) HF1020 or placebo (ratio 3:1). When at least 8 subjects within the cohort have completed Day 2 procedures (i.e. Day 1 + 24 hours) and all ongoing subjects have completed the final Day 15 visit, a Safety Review Committee (SRC) will meet, review all safety data prior to dose escalation to the next cohort. Subjects in Cohort 2 will be randomised to receive 2.5 mg HF1020 or placebo. Subjects in Cohort 3 will be randomised to receive 10mg HF1020 or placebo. Subjects in Cohort 4 will be randomised to receive 25mg HF1020 or placebo.</detailed_description>
