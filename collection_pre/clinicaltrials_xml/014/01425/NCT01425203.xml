	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether Boceprevir (BOC, SCH 503034, MK-3034) in combination with Peginterferon Alfa 2-b (PEG) plus Ribavirin (RBV) [PEG+RBV=PR] is effective in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 1 among the Russian population. The primary hypothesis is that the percentage of participants achieving sustained virologic response in the BOC + PR group is superior to that in the Placebo (PBO) + PR group.</brief_summary>
