	<criteria>Persons between the ages of twentyone (21) and seventy (70). Best efforts shall be made to include as many patients as possible between the ages of thirtyfive (35) and sixty (60).

Pass the medical health history and comprehensive ophthalmic examination (which is determined by the investigator if the test subject has a normal ophthalmic examination and is in overall good health). Ophthalmic examination includes a clinical evaluation of the subject's eyes and a complete manifest refraction producing a best aided visual acuity of &lt;20/40. Subject has had the crystalline lens removed from the study eye or has had the crystalline lens removed and replaced with an intraocular lens (IOL) implant in the left eye. Subject has been clinically diagnosed with cataracts in the study eye. Subject has had a fluorescence angiogram within the last six months. Subject has undergone a treatment using photodynamic drugs within the last year. Subject has Type I or II diabetes or is not deemed healthy from Demographic and Health Questionnaire or the comprehensive eye exam. Subject was fit with contact lens within the last 30 days.
