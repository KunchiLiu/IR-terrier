	<detailed_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-arm parallel-group comparative study to confirm the superiority of TAU-284 over placebo after two weeks of administration of TAU-284 (10 mg/day or 20 mg/day) or placebo to pediatric patients with perennial allergic rhinitis, with "the change from baseline in total nasal symptom score (total score for the three major nasal symptoms [sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion])" as the primary endpoint; and to investigate the dose response, safety, and plasma concentrations of TAU-284.</detailed_description>
