	<brief_summary>An observational study will be performed in subjects aged 3-65 years old to describe the dynamic changes of cellular immunity after vaccination of hepatitis B vaccine, and to find out the expression levels of Th9 cells and IL9 in subjects with different response to the primary immunization (3 single -dose injunctions).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Expression of Th9 Cells and Poor/Non-responsiveness to Hepatitis B Vaccination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study selected 74 volunteers which had the hepatitis B vaccine (immunization programs 0,1,6) , anti-HBs≤10mIU as the research subjects, and choose 20 volunteers which anti-HBs≥1000mIU as the control group, revaccination the groups according to the normal immunization programs, then the blood samples would be collected at 7th day, separate the PBMC and detect the expression levels of Th9 cells and IL9 by FCM, trying to find out the effects of Th9 and IL9 of non/poor -responsiveness subjects to hepatitis B.</detailed_description>
