	<brief_summary>Increasing physical activity continues to be a challenge among many individuals, particularly those who are overweight. Recent data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) showed that individuals who reported engaging in a variety of activities were more likely to meet national physical activity recommendations compared to those who reported no variety. Incorporating a variety of activities into a physical activity program may be a way to increase physical increase physical activity levels. One method to increase variety in physical activities is to use active videogames. Videogames that use motion sensors allow a gamer to physically perform a variety of activities. Thus, the purpose ot this laboratory-based investigation is to conduct a study to examine the effect of engaging in a greater variety of active videogames on energy expenditure in 30 non-obese, regularly active adults.</brief_summary>
