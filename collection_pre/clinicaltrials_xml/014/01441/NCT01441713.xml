	<brief_summary>Patients with advanced prostate cancer usually receive some kind of pharmaceutical castration or undergo surgical castration. At the investigators department the pharmaceutical treatment is most often given with a 3 month interval. Over the last few years new drugs, which allow for lees frequent treatment, have been developed. The purpose of this study is to assess how the treatment affects patients and if our current patients would prefer to receive treatment at different intervals than they do at the present time. At the same time the investigators will assess how surgical treatment affects our patients. This will be assessed by patient questionnaires administered at our clinic.</brief_summary>
