	<brief_summary>CT-011 is an investigational monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are a type of drug that are known to target specific cells (in this case, cells in the immune system) The DC RCC Vaccine is agent that tries to help the immune system to recognize and fight against cancer cells. The purpose of this research study is to determine the safety of CT-011 alone, and in combination with the Dendritic Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (DC RCC) vaccine. The investigators are also trying to find out what effect the combination has on the disease, and on your immune system.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study is divided into 2 groups. The first 22 subjects will be in Group 1 and will receive CT-011 only. The next 22 subjects will be in Group 2 and will receive CT-011 and the DC RCC vaccine. Group 1: Subjects in this cohort are not required to have tumor resection (nephrectomy) to participate in this study. For subjects who are undergoing nephrectomy and for subjects undergoing resection for another metastasis, infusions of CT-011 will begin 21 to 35 days post-surgery. Subjects will receive 4 cycles of CT-011 therapy. Each cycle consists of a dose of CT-011 given on days 1, 14, and 28 intravenously. For subjects who are not undergoing nephrectomy for standard of care therapy, infusions of CT-011 will begin 21 to 28 days following registration on the study. Subjects will receive a total of four cycles of CT-011 therapy. Each cycle consists of a dose of CT-011 given on days 1, 14, and 28 intravenously. Group 2: Subjects in this cohort will have chosen to undergo a "debulking nephrectomy" (surgery to remove a tumor of the kidney, but not all of the cancer cells in your body) as a standard treatment for kidney cancer or have tumor lesions that are accessible (may be removed without major surgery) and are being removed to treat or diagnose their cancer. All subjects in this group will receive infusions of CT-011 21 to 35 days following tumor resection. Subjects will receive a total of 4 cycles of CT-011 therapy. Each cycle consists of a dose of CT-011 given on days 1, 14, and 28. In addition they will receive a vaccination of the DC RCC vaccine on day 8 of each cycle.</detailed_description>
