	<brief_summary>The purpose of this proof-of-concept study is to determine whether elagolix (ABT-620) is safe and effective in the treatment of pre-menopausal women, 20 to 49 years of age, with heavy uterine bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. The effect of elagolix (ABT-620) on uterine size, fibroid size, and bleeding associated with uterine fibroids will be assessed versus placebo, and in combination with add-back therapy.</brief_summary>
