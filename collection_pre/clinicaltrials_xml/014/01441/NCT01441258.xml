	<brief_summary>Harley and colleagues demonstrated that adding Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) skills-groups and therapist consultation to treatment as usual successfully reduced symptoms of depression. The present study will expand upon these findings. Second, DBT is not known for reducing suicidal ideation (SI), a major risk factor for suicide . The present study will tailor the aforementioned skills-groups to specifically target suicidal thoughts and behaviors through Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) strategies aimed at increasing problem-solving deficits, hopelessness, and negativistic thinking. Third, the present study will extend this DBT-based approach to a novel population. Fourth, the present study is the first DBT intervention to employ state-of-the-art multi-method measurement (including objective assessment) of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The investigators hypothesize that participants in the DBT skills (DBT-S) group will show improvements in level of suicidality as measured by decreased scores on the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation as compared with participants in the Wait List-Treatment as Usual (WL-TAU) group.</brief_summary>
