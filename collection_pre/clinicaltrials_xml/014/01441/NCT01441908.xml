	<brief_title>Longitudinal Study of Multi-Analyte Profile for Dyslipidemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over the past decade there has been a growing debate about the clinical value content of a single individual diagnostic indicator of disease onset, progression or therapeutic intervention. In particular there has been a discussion about the comparative value of a single biomarker versus a panel (3-6 different analytes) versus a multi-analyte profile (&gt;10 different analytes) of biomarkers to provide high content clinical information about a specific disease onset, progression, remediation or treatment efficacy. With the advent of personalized medicine, and recognition of the high degree of biological variability in human pathobiology, it is important to understand the comparative value of a single biomarker/diagnostic versus a panel versus a profile. In addition, the growth of Preventive Medicine has spurred the development of "Wellness" in individual patients, and the necessity for understanding and measuring the transition from a state of health (wellness) to ultimately a state of full blown disease onset. This complex process occurs via a multitude of biological pathways and networks and manifests at a biochemical and clinical systems level. In a previous study currently being analyzed, MaiHealth measured a Multi-Analyte Profile of approximately 800 patients consisting of 400 cardiovascular compromised individuals and 400 control patients. This preliminary study was a single time point only, in which 25 individual analytes were measured as well as 3 calculated ratios or values for the 800 individuals. The current study is a small cohort time course study over 6 months involving therapeutic intervention with an FDA-approved statin. The overall goal of the study is to determine the predictive capability of a single versus panel versus multi-analyte profile set of biomarkers in cardiovascular compromised patients with therapeutic intervention. The ultimate application of this research is information delivery and behavioral intervention.</detailed_description>
