	<brief_summary>To evaluate the combination of PF-04856884 (CVX-060) in combination with Axitinib (AG-013736) in patients that have received one prior systemic regimen for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) vs. axitinib alone.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PF-04856884 (CVX-060) In Combination With Axitinib In Patients With Previously Treated Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study was prematurely discontinued on 06Nov2012 due to tolerability findings in patients treated in Part I of the study that have prompted the Sponsor to re-evaluate the strategic development of the program. An unexpected frequency of arterial thrombotic events (ATEs) and venous thrombotic events (VTEs) were reported in patients treated in Part I.</detailed_description>
