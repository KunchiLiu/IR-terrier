	<brief_summary>Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a severe gastrointestinal disorder with high morbidity and mortality (20-40%), affecting predominantly premature neonates. NEC continues to present a diagnostic challenge to clinicians. The initial clinical manifestations of NEC are non-specific and indistinguishable from other gastrointestinal disorders and sepsis. The first goal of this study is to find and evaluate tests to diagnose NEC at an early stage. For the development of new diagnostic markers, the investigators require knowledge of pathophysiological processes that underlie NEC, which still remain unclear. Therefore, the second goal of this study is to elucidate the etiology of NEC. Furthermore, understanding of the pathophysiology of NEC can offer the possibility to develop new therapeutical treatments.</brief_summary>
