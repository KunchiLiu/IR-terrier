	<brief_title>Effect of Pistachio Intake on Insulin Resistance and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In free-living overweight or obese adult with impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance we will compare the effects of a pistachio-rich diet or a Mediterranean Diet on: - Fasting glucose levels, hemoglobin A1c, insulin, C peptide, HOMA IR, advanced glycation end products and soluble receptor of advanced glycation-end products. - Peripheral haemostatic parameters. - Plasma inflammatory markers. - Lymphocyte expression of toll-like receptors, C peptide, resistin and interleukin-6 in peripheral leukocytes. - Lymphocyte glucose transport and expression of glucose transporter 4 in peripheral blood leukocytes. - Platelet function including platelet number, mean platelet volume, platelet factor 4 levels and urinary 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2.</detailed_description>
