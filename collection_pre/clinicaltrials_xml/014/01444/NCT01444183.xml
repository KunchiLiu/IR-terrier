	<brief_summary>The study will examine whether a stress reduction intervention reduces the number of seizures in people with drug resistant epilepsy. In the proposed randomized controlled, double blind trial, the investigators will enroll subjects with frequent seizures, especially those who identify stress as a seizure precipitant. There is an observational phase (8-12 weeks) and a treatment phase (12 weeks). During the observational phase, subjects will be monitored multiple times daily via smart phone devices, in order to identify high risk days for seizures. In the treatment phase, subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two groups receiving different focused attention practices. These behavioral interventions will be administered daily with extra interventions applied on days of higher risk.</brief_summary>

Patientreported ability to selfpredict seizures 2. Patientreported awareness of trigger factors, including stress 3. Patientreported awareness of premonitory features Able to maintain accurate ediary independently Minimum 6th grade reading level as screened by WRAT administration Must be on a stable dose of antiepileptic drugs for at least 30 days prior to study entry May be on stable dose of SSRI, SNRI, or atypical antipsychotic for at least 6 months May be on a stable dose of benzodiazepines (if so, dose stable for at least 30 days prior to study entry) For inclusion in clinical trial phase, patient must be/have: A minimum of 4 seizures documented in the 8week baseline phase (or 6 seizures in the 12week extended baseline phase) At least 1 seizure per 4week period in two of the three 4week periods in the extended baseline phase Diaries satisfactorily completed during baseline phase Complied with study requirements during the baseline phase Nonmotor simple partial seizures only Concurrent VNS use History of suicide attempt within the past 2 years Current suicidality Not competent to sign consent Status epilepticus within the previous 6 months Began regularly using behavioral techniques for stress reduction within past 3 months Did not benefit from an adequate trial of a valid stress reduction technique Progressive neurologic condition that the investigator believes would affect seizure frequency Any history of substance abuse within the previous 2 years History of poor medication compliance as judged by the investigator Psychiatric illness that requires change in medication dose Any medical or psychiatric condition that would impair reliable participation in the trial Intermittent use of benzodiazepines (if used for sleep, will be determined case by case)</criteria>
