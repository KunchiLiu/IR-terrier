	<brief_summary>The safety of parenterally administrated investigational vaccine (commercial influenza vaccine formulated with adjuvant Matrix M) in healthy adults (age 18-50) and healthy elderly (age 65-75), will be investigated in the study. Moreover, the study aims to study parameters associated with improved protection against clinical disease in elderly. Such parameters include HI-titres, a balanced Th1/Th2 response as well as a functional cellular immune response. Vaccination will start in 22 healthy adults receiving the investigational vaccine. Vaccination of elderly will be initiated only after demonstration of safety in adults. 88 healthy elderly volunteers will be vaccinated, 44 will receive the seasonal influenza vaccine alone and 44 will receive the investigational vaccine. Vaccines will be administrated intramuscularly in the upper arm. One dose will be administered to each volunteer included in the study. Blood samples for basic immunological assessments of cellular and humoral immunity will be taken at day 0, 7, 28, 90 and 150. The investigational vaccine is equal to one standard human dose of a commercial seasonal influenza vaccine to which 50 µg of adjuvant Matrix M has been added.</brief_summary>
