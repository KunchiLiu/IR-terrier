	<brief_summary>Recent clinical trials demonstrated that virtual histology-intravascular ultrasound (VH-IVUS) is a useful test predicting clinical outcomes of the coronary artery disease (CAD). Thin cap fibroatheroma (VH-TCFA) was proposed a predictor of cardiovascular event by VH-IVUS combined with more than 70% plaque burden and less than 4mmÂ² minimal lumen area (MLA) by IVUS. Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is an established index of the physiological significance of a coronary stenosis. Recent large scale trials demonstrated FFR guided PCI showed favorable clinical outcomes. VH-IVUS represents anatomical severity, but FFR represents functional severity of CAD. Few studies reported relevance between two tests. Aim of this study was to investigate whether the geometry and composition of lesions were different under FFR criteria.</brief_summary>
