	<brief_title>The Effect of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy on Locally Advanced Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adenocarcinoma of the stomach ranks as the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer and as the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the world. Radical resection with free-margin gastrectomy and extended lymphadenectomy is the preferred surgical strategy in Japan and Asian centers. Unfortunately, only one-half of surgically treated patients with gastric cancer will achieve a complete resection without residual disease (R0) resection. Moreover, due to, the absence of routine screening programs for gastric cancer, the majority of the patients will be symptomatic at the time of diagnosis in our country. Additionally, recent treatment strategies were focused for downsizing or decreasing to loco-regional recurrence. In this reason, we hypothesize that preoperative chemotherapy may improve the R0 resection rate or disease free and/or overall survival rate.</detailed_description>
