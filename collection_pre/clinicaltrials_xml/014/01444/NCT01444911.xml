	<brief_summary>This is a randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the effect of the Vaginal Renewal™ Program (VRP), consisting of the use of a vibrating vaginal wand, manual massage and a water based lubricant, on sexual dysfunction, compared to the current standard care for women with no evidence of disease after treatment for gynecologic cancers. In the University of Wisconsin gynecologic oncology and radiation oncology clinics, patients are generally asked about sexual function. Those women who report sexual dysfunction will be given the option to enroll in the study. After enrollment, the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and other quality of life surveys will be administered at baseline. The participants will be randomized to either the control arm, composed of standard of care therapy for the physical components of sexual dysfunction, or the experimental arm (VRP). Throughout the study, the participants will undergo physical exams to assess the rate of improvement in their comfort with pelvic exams and changes in vaginal length. They will also be evaluated with the FSFI, Marinoff Scale for Dyspareunia, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) surveys at the end of the study to assess the magnitude of improvement in sexual function and quality of life.</brief_summary>
