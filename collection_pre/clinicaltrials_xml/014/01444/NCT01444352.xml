Observational Objective: - To evaluate the immunogenicity of an investigational Pneumococcal vaccine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of an Investigational Pneumococcal Vaccine at Three Dose Levels in Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An initial cohort of 10 participants will receive a single dose of investigational pneumococcal vaccine. After safety assessment of this cohort during a 24-hour in-unit observation period, additional cohorts will receive two injections of the study vaccine 30 days apart, at three dose levels, in ascending doses by cohort, pending safety review at each dose level. All participants will be monitored for safety for 30 days after each vaccination.</detailed_description>
