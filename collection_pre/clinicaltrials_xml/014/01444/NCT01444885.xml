	<brief_title>Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Pletaal (Cilostazol) in Subjects With Vasospastic Angina</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-controlled, Parallel group, Therapeutic exploratory Study. The subject who has at least an episode of chest pain weekly despite Amlodipine 5mg once a day (qd) taking during 2 weeks will have treatment of Pletaal (Cilostazol) or Placebo for 4 weeks. Pletaal (Cilostazol) is taken 100mg oral tablets two times a day (bid) during 2 weeks after dosing of Pletaal (Cilostazol) 50mg oral tablets bid during 2 weeks. Placebo of Pletaal (Cilostazol) is used as the control medication.</detailed_description>
