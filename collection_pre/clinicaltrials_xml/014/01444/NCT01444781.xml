	<brief_summary>This is a follow-up of the primary series vaccination schedule in Study A3L24 (NCT01177722). The objectives are: - To describe the antibody persistence to any antigen contained in the investigational DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T vaccine and Infanrix hexa™ prior to the booster dose - To describe the safety and immunogenicity of the booster dose of either DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T or Infanrix hexa™ vaccine. - To describe the immunogenicity of a booster dose of Prevenar™ given at 12 to 24 months.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Booster Effect of DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP~T Combined Vaccine or Infanrix Hexa™ and Prevenar™ in Healthy Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All participants who completed trial A3L24 (NCT01177722) will be recruited to participate in this trial. Those who received DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T combined vaccine will be randomized to receive either a booster dose of DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T or Infanrix hexa™ vaccine. Those who received Infanrix hexa™ will receive a booster dose of DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T combined vaccine. All participants will receive a booster dose of Prevenar™ concomitantly.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Aged 12 to 24 months on the day of inclusion. Informed consent form has been signed and dated by the parent(s) or other legally acceptable representative (and by an independent witness(es) if required by local regulations). Subject and parent/guardian are able to attend all scheduled visits and to comply with all trial procedures. Toddlers previously included in Study A3L24 who completed the threedose primary series vaccination of either DTaPIPVHep BPRP~T or Infanrix hexa™ at 2,4 and 6 months of age according to protocol (both concomitantly administered with Prevenar™ and Rotarix™). Participation in another clinical trial investigating a vaccine, drug, medical device, or medical procedure in the 4 weeks preceding the booster vaccinations. Planned participation in another clinical trial during the present trial period. Receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks preceding the booster vaccinations, except in case of pandemic influenza vaccination, which may be received at least two weeks before the study vaccines. Planned receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks following the trial vaccinations. Previous booster vaccination against pertussis, tetanus, diphtheria, poliomyelitis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, hepatitis B and pneumococcal infection(s) with either the trial vaccine or another vaccine. Receipt of blood or bloodderived products in the past 3 months, which might interfere with assessment of the immune response. Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency; or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy such as anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the preceding 3 months; or longterm systemic corticosteroid therapy (prednisone or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks within the past 3 months). Laboratoryconfirmed or clinical suspicion of personal or maternal seropositivity for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or hepatitis C, as reported by the parent/guardian. History of pertussis, tetanus, diphtheria, poliomyelitis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, hepatitis B and pneumococcal infection(s), confirmed either clinically, serologically, or microbiologically. At high risk for opportunistic infection during the trial. Known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components, or history of a lifethreatening reaction to the vaccine(s) used in the trial or to a vaccine containing any of the same substances. History of contraindication to receipt of pertussiscontaining vaccine. Laboratoryconfirmed or clinical suspicion of thrombocytopenia contraindicating Intramuscular vaccination. Bleeding disorder, or receipt of anticoagulants in the 3 weeks preceding inclusion, contraindicating intramuscular vaccination. History of seizures . Chronic illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, is at a stage where it might interfere with trial conduct or completion. Receipt of oral or injected antibiotic therapy within 72 hours prior to the first blood draw Febrile illness (temperature ≥ 38.0°C) or moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to investigator judgment) on the day of vaccination.</criteria>
