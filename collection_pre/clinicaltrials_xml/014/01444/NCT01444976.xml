	<brief_summary>There is no ideal sedation technique that can be used during Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE), and the data concerning the effects of available sedation techniques on Heart Rate Variability (HRV) are limited. In this study the investigators aimed at comparing the effects of sedation through hypnotherapy with medical sedation achieved by midazolam on HRV.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Sedation During Transesophageal Echocardiography on Heart Rate Variability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Seventy-six patients with an indication of TEE will be recruited, the age range will be 18-83 years. In Group Topical (T) there are 26 patients who had the procedure under topical pharyngeal anesthesia, in Group Midazolam (D) there are 25 patients who will receive midazolam and in Group H there are 27 patients receiving hypnosis. All patients will have an IV access; throughout the procedure heart rate, rhythm ECG, peripheric O2 saturation will be monitored with a non-invasive monitor, blood pressure measurements were taken every 3 minutes. Rhythm Holter recordings will be obtained from all patients and TEE will be performed.</detailed_description>
