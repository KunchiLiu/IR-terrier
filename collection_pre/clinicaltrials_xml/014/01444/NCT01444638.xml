	<brief_title>Evaluation of Ultrasound (US) Assistance for Anesthesia Trainees for Caesarean Section Spinal Placement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parturients receiving spinal anesthetic for elective Cesarean section will be randomized to have/not have pre-spinal ultrasound examination of their back, prior to spinal insertion by anesthesia trainees. The hypothesis is that ultrasound visualization of the patient spinal spaces will allow junior residents to correctly place the spinal needle with fewer attempts. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the primary outcome (number of attempts). i.e. the investigators hypothesize that the number of attempts is not affected by ultrasound assistance. The control group will undergo spinal anesthesia with manual palpation, the standard of care.</detailed_description>
