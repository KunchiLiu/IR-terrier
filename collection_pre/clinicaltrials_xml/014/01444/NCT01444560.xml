	<brief_summary>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are very small endogenous RNA molecules about 22-25 nucleotides in length, capable of post-transcriptional gene regulation. miRNAs bind to their target messenger RNAs (mRNAs), leading to cleavage or suppression of target mRNA translation based on the degree of complementarity. miRNAs have recently been shown to play pivotal roles in diverse developmental and cellular processes and linked to a variety of skin diseases and cancers. In the present study, the investigators examines the expression profiles of miRNA machinery components such as miRNA maturation and transport factors, microprocessor complex and RISC subunits in cutaneous melanoma, cutaneous melanoma metastases and benign melanocytic nevi.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients with cutaneous melanoma, cutaneous melanoma metastases and benign melanocytic nevi were included in the study. Punch biopsies were harvested from the center of the tumors. The miRNA machinery components were detected by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.</detailed_description>
