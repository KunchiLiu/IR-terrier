	<detailed_description>This study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial comparing the safety and effectiveness of supplementation with Trenev Trio®/Healthy Trinity® vs. placebo in otherwise healthy subjects with recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms. Subjects will be recruited and, following successful completion of a 2-week run-in period, will be randomized to Trenev Trio®/Healthy Trinity® or placebo and will consume their assigned study product daily for 10 weeks. The study endpoints of this trial include relief of overall gastrointestinal symptoms, acid indigestion, abdominal cramping, constipation, diarrhea, gas, and bloating as well as product safety over the 10-week supplementation period.</detailed_description>
