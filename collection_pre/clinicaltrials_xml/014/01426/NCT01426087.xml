	<brief_summary>The main complications of cirrhosis are ascites, esophageal varices and hepatic encephalopathy. About 30% to 70% patients with cirrhosis occur esophageal varices, and the most common complication is ascites. Somatostatin is used to treat esophageal for a long time, otherwise it could aslo prevent ascites. In the study, the investigators explore the effects of somatostatin on post-endoscopic portal hemodynamic in cirrhotic patients with esophageal gastric varices.</brief_summary>
