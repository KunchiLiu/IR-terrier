	<brief_summary>For patients with advanced heart failure, Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) has been a major improvement. The treatment improves symptoms and prolongs life in selected patients with heart failure. However, with the current selection criteria and methods for implanting the pacemaker, only 60-70% of the patients derive significant benefit from the treatment. New imaging techniques, including advanced ultrasound and computed tomography, in combination with new versatile multi-pole electrodes, have made an individually tailored therapy possible. Using these techniques in combination, the study will investigate the effect of individually based "optimal" placement of the pacemaker electrodes vs. standard care. The optimal LV electrode position is defined as pacing a viable segment with the latest mechanical delay, targeting a specific segment of the coronary sinus as visualised on cardiac CT. The hypothesis is that this will increase the number of positive responders from 65% to 85%.</brief_summary>
