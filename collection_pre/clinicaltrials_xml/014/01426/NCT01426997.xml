	<brief_summary>To facilitate the development of a personalized approach to the treatment of patients with major depression, this study is designed to elaborate the clinical and neurobiological phenotype of depressed patients with increased inflammation. The data obtained in this proposal will allow the investigators to test the hypothesis that depression and inflammation interact to elaborate a relatively discreet phenotype that warrants an individualized approach to diagnosis and treatment of patients with depression. Moreover, the identification of specific environmental risk factors for inflammation will foster the elaboration of preventative strategies for patients at risk.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>One hundred and thiry-five patients with major depression diagnosed based on DSM-IV TR criteria between the ages of 21 and 65 (males, females and minorities) will be recruited. Forty-five patients with high inflammation as defined by a CRP &gt;3 mg/L will be enrolled along with 45 depressed patients with medium inflammation (CRP=1-3mg/L) and 45 depressed patients with low inflammation (CRP&lt;1mg/L) will complete a 2 night inpatient stay in Emory University Hospital's research unit, the Atlanta Clinical and Translational Science Institute (ACTSI). Participants will undergo psychiatric and neurocognitive assessments, sleep studies and blood and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) sampling.</detailed_description>
