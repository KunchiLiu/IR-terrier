	<mesh_term>Deoxycholic Acid</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Submental fat graded by the investigator as 2, 3, or 4 using the ClinicianReported Submental Fat Rating Scale (CRSMFRS) and graded by the subject as 2, 3, or 4 using the PatientReported Submental Fat Rating Scale (PRSMFRS) as determined on visit 1 (within 28 days before the subject's first dosing session) Dissatisfaction with the submental area rated by the subject as 0, 1, or 2 using the Subject Selfrating Scale (SSRS) as determined on visit 1 (within 28 days before the subject's first dosing session) Males and nonpregnant, nonlactating females 18 years of age or greater, on the day of the subject's first dosing session (visit 2). Females of childbearing potential must have a negative human chorionic gonadotropin (serum) test result within 28 days before visit 2 and agree to practice adequate contraception, in the judgment of the investigator, during the course of the study A normal result on coagulation tests (prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT)) obtained within 28 days before subject's first dosing session History of stable body weight, in the judgment of the investigator, for at least 6 months before subject's first dosing session Expected to understand and comply with the visit schedule and all protocolspecified tests and procedures and agreement by the subject to refrain from making significant changes, in the judgment of the investigator, to his or her dietary or exercise habits during the course of the subject's participation Medically able to undergo the administration of study drug determined by clinical and laboratory tests obtained within 28 days before subject's first dosing session for which the investigator identifies no clinically significant abnormality Signed informed consent obtained before any studyspecific procedure is performed History of any intervention to treat submental fat (eg, liposuction, surgery, or lipolytic agents) History of trauma associated with the chin or neck areas, which in the judgment of the investigator may affect evaluation of safety or efficacy of treatment A grade of 4 on the Submental Skin Laxity Grading scale (SMSLG) or any other anatomical feature (eg, predominant subplatysmal fat, loose skin in the neck or chin area, prominent platysmal bands) for which reduction in submental fat may, in the judgment of the investigator, result in an aesthetically unacceptable outcome Evidence of any cause of enlargement in the submental area (eg, thyroid enlargement, cervical adenopathy) other than localized submental fat Body mass index of ≥ 40 kg/m² as determined on visit 1 (week 0) History or current symptoms of dysphagia Any medical condition that would interfere with assessment of safety or efficacy or compromise the subject's ability to undergo study procedures or give informed consent Treatment with radio frequency, laser procedures, chemical peels, or dermal fillers in the neck or chin area within 12 months before the first treatment session, or botulinum toxin injections in the neck or chin area within 6 months before the first treatment session History of sensitivity to any components of the study drug or to topical or local anesthetics (eg, lidocaine, benzocaine, novocaine) Previous treatment in this study or previous participation in a Kytherasponsored ATX101 study Treatment with an investigational device or agent within 30 days before the subject's first treatment session</criteria>
