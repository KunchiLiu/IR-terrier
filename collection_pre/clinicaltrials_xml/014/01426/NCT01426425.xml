	<brief_summary>ICY-AVNRT (Intracardiac CrYoablation for AtrioVentricular Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia) is a prospective multi-center, nonrandomized, single arm, controlled, unblinded, investigational clinical study. The purpose of this clinical study is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the Freezor® Xtra Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter for the cryoablation of the conducting tissues of the heart in the treatment of patients with atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) using an endocardial approach.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>PreElectrophysiology Study Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) compatible with atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), documented by ECG, TTM, Holter or event monitor PreElectrophysiology Study History of sustained (≥30 seconds) of ventricular tachycardia Atrial tachycardia or other arrhythmia that could be confused with AVNRT Reversible cause of SVT History of previous AVNRT ablation Therapy with amiodarone within last 90 days Unstable angina/myocardial infarction/open heart surgery in past 60 days New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classification III or IV currently or within the past 90 days Implantable cardiac rhythm device Atrioventricular block (first degree (PR interval ≥ 220ms), second degree, or third degree) or left bundle branch block Stroke or transient ischemic attack within the past 180 days Life expectancy less than 12 months Female known to be pregnant Unable/unwilling to give informed consent Unable/unwilling to comply with followup visits and study requirements Less than 18 years of age Active systemic infection Cryoglobulinemia Other conditions where the manipulation of the catheter would be unsafe (for example, intracardiac mural thrombus) Participating in a concurrent clinical study that may confound the results of this study PostElectrophysiology Study Subject must have one electrophysiology study documented inducible sustained (greater than or equal to 15 seconds) supraventricular tachycardia that is classified as AVNRT. PostElectrophysiology Study Presence of a second inducible arrhythmia that could be confused with AVNRT during followup or will likely result in ablation within the next 6 months Presence of inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation Presence of an accessory pathway Presence of abnormal conduction or refractoriness parameters of the atrioventricular conduction system. Indication for a pacemaker, defibrillator or cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)</criteria>
