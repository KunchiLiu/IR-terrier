	<brief_summary>This is a study in otherwise healthy Japanese and non-Japanese participants with elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Following single doses of LY3015014, the safety and tolerability of the drug, how the body handles the drug, and the drug's effect on the body will be evaluated. Participants will remain in the study for approximately up to 6 months.</brief_summary>

Participants taking these medications should be on chronic, stable doses. Certain medications, for example vitamin supplements, may be permitted at the discretion of the investigator and the sponsor. Participants on statins may be allowed to be on a stable dose of single hypertensive agent if agreed upon by sponsor and investigator Have received any vaccine(s) within 1 month of LY3015014 dosing, or intend to during the study Have received treatment with biologic agents (such as monoclonal antibodies) within 3 months or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to dosing Have a history of atopy, or significant allergies to humanized monoclonal antibodies, or clinically significant multiple or severe drug allergies, or intolerance to topical corticosteroids, or severe posttreatment hypersensitivity reactions (including, but not limited to, erythema multiforme major, linear immunoglobulin (Ig)A dermatosis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, or exfoliative dermatitis) Additional exclusion criteria for participants in the statininteraction cohort: Incidence of unexplained muscle pain, or incidence of frequent muscle cramp within the last 6 months</criteria>
