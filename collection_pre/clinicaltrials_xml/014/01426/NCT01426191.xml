	<brief_title>Study on Cefotaxime and Sulbactam Sodium for Injection (2:1) for Treatment of Respiratory and Urinary Tract Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cefotaxime is a third-generation cephalosporins.Cefotaxime sodium and sulbactam sodium for injection (2:1)plays a therapeutic role by the former inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis by irreversible competitive inhibition of β-lactamase.The antimicrobial effect of cefotaxime can be enhanced by the two combined.The compound specifically aims to the mechanism of bacterial resistance, extending the life of cefotaxime in the treatment-resistant pathogen infections.</detailed_description>
