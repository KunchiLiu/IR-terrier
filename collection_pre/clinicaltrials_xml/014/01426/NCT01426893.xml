	<brief_summary>The correct use of inhalation devices is an inclusion criterion for all studies comparing inhaled treatments. In real life, however, patients may make many errors with their usual inhalation device, which may negate the benefits observed in clinical trials. In real life, many errors seem to be made, but no wide-scale evaluation has been performed. The correct use of inhalation devices is essential to ensure the effectiveness of the treatment. It has been recently demonstrated that inhaler misuse is associated with decreased asthma control in asthmatics treated with an inhaled corticosteroid. The aim of our observational study was to evaluate the inhaler device usage in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</brief_summary>
