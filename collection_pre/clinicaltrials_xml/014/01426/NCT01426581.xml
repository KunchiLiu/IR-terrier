	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relative effectiveness of two different ways to teach subjects while hospitalized how to use respiratory inhalers and to follow-up after discharge home from the hospital to determine durability of the education. Teach-to-Goal (TTG) education employs instruction followed by patient "teach-back," then repeated cycles of learning and assessment until a skill is mastered. By contrast, Brief Intervention (BI) education only consists of providing the patient with verbal and written instruction. The investigators hypothesize that hospital-based TTG compared to BI increases a patient's ability to retain instructions on respiratory inhaler technique. The investigators will test this hypothesis separately for the MDI and Diskus® devices after discharge.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness of Interventions to Teach Respiratory Inhaler Technique (E-TRaIN)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Respiratory inhalers are often used incorrectly by patients with obstructive lung disorders (including patients hospitalized with exacerbations of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). As the mainstay of bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory therapy in patients with OLD, the implication of this difficulty with self-management is that patients are at risk for under-treatment and worse health outcomes. Several factors are thought to contribute to poor self-management skills, particularly inadequate patient education at healthcare encounters and inadequate patient health literacy. However, the most effective strategy to instruct patients about respiratory inhaler use in hospital settings is unclear, particularly in populations enriched with inadequate health literacy. Therefore, the overall goal of this study is to evaluate the relative effectiveness of two hospital-based educational interventions: Teach-To-Goal (TTG, iterative cycles of demonstration-based education and assessment) versus Brief Intervention (BI, one-time set of verbal instructions) on the durability of instructions provided in the hospital and its effect on clinical outcomes (e.g., respiratory events and/or death), post hospital discharge. The investigators also plan to evaluate whether the relative effectiveness of TTG vs. BI varies by level of health literacy. The objectives of this proposal are to conduct a study in adults hospitalized with asthma/COPD to 1) to evaluate the relative effectiveness of hospital-based TTG versus BI on patients' ability to retain instruction about the correct use of MDI and Diskus® devices after discharge home and 2) To determine the relative effectiveness of TTG compared to BI for patients with less-than-adequate health literacy compared to those with adequate health literacy. These data will inform the development of a larger, multi-center clinical trial.</detailed_description>
