	<brief_summary>Newborn babies with congenital heart disease often require surgery in the first month of life. The risks of brain damage from congenital heart disease and from the various corrective surgeries are high because of poor levels of oxygen reaching the brain. Topiramate is an anti-convulsant medication that protects brain cells from damage due to low amounts of oxygen in animal studies. The investigators hypothesize that giving topiramate to babies with congenital heart disease before and after surgery will decrease the amount of brain damage caused by the heart disease and/or the surgery to correct the heart disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preventing Brain Injury in Infants With Congenital Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infants with cyanotic congenital heart disease undergoing surgery in the neonatal period have a high rate of brain injury resulting in seizures, stroke, cerebral palsy, and neurodevelopmental delays. Neuroimaging abnormalities are found in 30% to 60% of cases and neurodevelopmental impairments occur in more than half of these children. The mechanisms of brain injury in these children are not fully understood. Experimental animal models have shown that the abundant release of glutamate in the brain during hypoxic-ischemic insult results in brain injury. Blocking glutamate receptors by administration of the anticonvulsant topiramate has been shown to prevent such injury in animal studies. This study is an open pilot trial of peri-operative topiramate administration to infants with cyanotic congenital heart disease to test the feasibility of this approach and generate preliminary data about markers of brain injury (serum S100B levels and urine metabolomics) and neurodevelopment at 18 months of age. If the approach is feasible and the preliminary data are encouraging a larger efficacy trial will be designed. Although topiramate has been used in neonates and infants to treat seizures and in a pilot study in term infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, this is the first study of its effects on markers of brain injury and neurologic outcomes in infants with cyanotic congenital heart disease.</detailed_description>
