	<brief_summary>Study participants with primary breast cancer will receive a standard chemotherapy with an anthracycline and a taxane as well as trastuzumab in case of HER2-positive tumors at doses and duration in concordance to current treatment guidelines. Patients will be receive and benefit in addition currently not in the neoadjuvant setting registered medication as lapatinib or bevacizumab of which significant increases of cure (pCR) rates have been reported in previous phase III studies. Patients randomized to carboplatin will receive in addition to the described backbone therapies a potentially active agent which suggested synergy of efficacy with chemotherapies as well as targeted agents. Patients might have the risk of an increase in toxicities due to the added agents and will have additional burden due to investigations required for study participation. However, due to the severity of the underlying disease and the high risk of relapse and death due to the stage of disease, this increase in toxicity and burden appears less relevant compared to the potential higher efficacy and finally cure rate by the incorporated treatments.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Addition of Carboplatin to Neoadjuvant Therapy for Triple-negative and HER2-positive Early Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anthracycline/taxane based combination chemotherapy of at least 18 weeks represents the standard of care in the neoadjuvant setting. In HER2-positive disease trastuzumab is given simultaneously to chemotherapy. Recent data from the Neo-Altto and Neosphere trials suggest that a dual blockage of the HER2 receptor with e.g. trastuzumab and lapatinib reach significantly higher pCR rates than trastuzumab alone and should therefore represent the treatment back-bone of new neoadjuvant trials. A preplanned subgroup analysis of the GeparQuinto study demonstrated that in TNBC the addition of bevacizumab resulted in a significant increase of pCR rates (HR 1.4). Having a better cardiac tolerability profile compared to conventional anthracyclines, the non-pegylated liposomal encapsulated doxorubicin (NPLD) Myocet® might provide the possibility to combine taxane, anthracycline, platinum salt as well with targeted agents as double HER2 blockage or bevacizumab.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1.Written informed consent for all study procedures according to local regulatory requirements prior to beginning specific protocol procedures. 2.Complete baseline documentation must be submitted via Medcodes® and approved by GBG Forschungs GmbH. 3.Unilateral or bilateral primary carcinoma of the breast, confirmed histologically by core biopsy. Fineneedle aspiration is not sufficient. Incisional biopsy is not allowed. In case of bilateral cancer, the investigator has to decide prospectively which side will be evaluated for the primary endpoint. 4.Tumor lesion in the breast with a palpable size of ≥ 2 cm or a sonographical size of ≥ 1 cm in maximum diameter. The lesion has to be measurable in two dimensions, preferably by sonography. In case of inflammatory disease, the extent of inflammation can be used as measurable lesion. 5.Patients should be in the following stages of disease: cT2 cT4ad or cT1c and cN+ or pNSLN+ 6.In patients with multifocal or multicentric breast cancer, the largest lesion should be measured. 7.Centrally confirmed ER/PR/HER2 and Ki67 status detected on core biopsy. ER/PR positive is defined as &gt;1% stained cells and HER2positive is defined as HercepTest IHC 3+ or FISH ratio ≥ 2.2. Formalinfixed, paraffinembedded (FFPE) breast tissue from core biopsy has therefore to be sent to the Dept. of Pathology at the Charité, Berlin prior to randomization. 8.Age ≥ 18 years. 9.Karnofsky Performance status index ≥ 80%. 10.Normal cardiac function must be confirmed by ECG and cardiac ultrasound (LVEF or shortening fraction) within 3 months prior to randomization. LVEF must be above 55%. 11.Laboratory requirements: Hematology Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 2.0 x 109 / L and Platelets ≥ 100 x 109 / L and Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL (≥ 6.2 mmol/L) Hepatic function Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5x UNL and ASAT (SGOT) and ALAT (SGPT) ≤ 1.5x UNL and Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5x UNL. Renal function Creatinine ≤ 175 µmol/L (2 mg/dL) &lt; 1.5x UNL Proteinuria: Urine dipstick for proteinuria &lt; 2+. Patients discovered to have ≥ 2+ proteinuria on dipstick urinalysis should undergo a 24hour urine collection and must demonstrate ≤ 1 g of protein in 24 hours. If creatinine is between 140 175 umol/L (1.62.0 mg/dL), the creatinine clearance (calculated or measured) should be ≥ 45 mL/min. 12.Negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) within 14 days prior to randomization for all women of childbearing potential. 13.Complete staging workup within 3 months prior to randomization. All patients must have bilateral mammography, breast ultrasound (≤ 21 days), breast MRI (optional), chest Xray (PA and lateral), abdominal ultrasound or CT scan or MRI, and bone scan done.
