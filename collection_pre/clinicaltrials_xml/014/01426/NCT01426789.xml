	<brief_summary>This study aims to confirm if patients with a specific biomarker might have a better response to secukinumab treatment. To meet this purpose, exploratory biomarker studies will be done. The goals of these exploratory studies are to (1) find biomarkers that will identify persons with rheumatoid arthritis who will have the best possible response to secukinumab and (2) to identify persons who will have fewer side effects in order to maximize their benefit from secukinumab.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis Patients must be either DMARD naive or have failed at least one DMARD agent (e.g. MTX, leflunamide or sulfasalazine) Patients are allowed up to 3 DMARDs at study entry (e.g. MTX, sulfasalazine or hydroxychloroquine) as long as their dose was stable for 4 weeks prior to initiating study treatment Disease activity at screening defined by ≥6 out of 28 tender joints and ≥6 out of 28 swollen joints and hsCRP &gt;10mg/L Patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis (functional status class IV according to the ACR 1991 revised criteria) Previous exposure to secukinumab or any other biologic, including TNF inhibitors. Use of high potency opioid analgesics Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women Use of any investigational drug other than RA therapy and/or devices at the time of randomization or within 30 days or 5 halflives of randomization, whichever is longer.
