	<brief_summary>This study is being done with people with HIV infection who have low levels of HDL-C. HDL-C is a type of "good" cholesterol. People with low HDL-C have a higher risk of heart disease and may have problems with how their blood vessels relax. The endothelium is the inner lining of all blood vessels, such as arteries and veins. When the endothelium is not working properly, the blood vessels have trouble expanding properly, which contributes to the development of heart and blood vessel disease. The main purpose of this study is to see if taking either extended-release niacin or fenofibrate for 24 weeks will help blood vessels work better by improving endothelial function and increasing HDL-C. Niacin and fenofibrate are medications that raise HDL-C. This study will also help determine how safe extended-release niacin and fenofibrate are. The analysis is an as-treated analysis of participants who completed study treatment and had a week 24 BART scan. Safety analyses include all participants</brief_summary>
