	<brief_summary>There is a lack of scientific evidence that homeopathy and reflexology is effective treatment of asthma. Systematic reviews have found that many clinical trials testing homeopathy and reflexology have major flaws, such as small number of participants, lack of control groups or inadequate allocation concealment. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of reflexology and individualised homeopathy as an adjuvant treatment in asthma. In order to address this issue, the investigators conducted an investigator-blinded, randomized, controlled parallel group study.</brief_summary>
