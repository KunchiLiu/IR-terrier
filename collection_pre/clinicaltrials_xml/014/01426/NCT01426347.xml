	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of vitamin D repletion on disease activity and disability in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The investigators hypothesize that rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with vitamin D deficiency have greater disease activity and disability, compared to RA patients with normal vitamin D levels. The investigators also hypothesize that vitamin D treatment in these deficient patients will result in a decrease in RA disease activity and disability.</brief_summary>
