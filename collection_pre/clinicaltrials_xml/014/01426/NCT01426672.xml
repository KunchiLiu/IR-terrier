	<brief_summary>PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to quantitatively assess the efficacy of monovision correction in the treatment of acquired small angle binocular diplopia in adult patients. METHOD: Twenty patients with symptomatic diplopia were enrolled in a prospective treatment trial. All had stable deviations of 10 prism diopters or less for over three months. Each received monovision spectacles and/ or contact lenses with distance correction in the dominant eye. Half received a +3.00 diopter (D) add and the others received +2.50 D. The validated and standardized Diplopia Questionnaire and Amblyopia and Strabismus Questionnaire (ASQE) were used to quantify the efficacy of monovision correction for diplopia by measuring the functional impact on vision-specific quality of life.</brief_summary>
