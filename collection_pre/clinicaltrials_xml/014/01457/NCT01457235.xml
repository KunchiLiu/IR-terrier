	<brief_summary>Cognitive remediation (CR) is a new psychological treatment, which aims to improve cognitive function and coping skills. Several studies have recently demonstrated that CR improves cognitive and occupational function in patients with schizophrenia and with depression (e.g. Wykes et al 2007, Elgamal et al 2007). However, it is unclear whether CR improves cognitive and socio-occupational function in individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) and, if so, what impact this might have on these people's abilities in terms of work, coping strategies, quality of life, and everyday safety. The aim of the present PhD study is to investigate if CR has beneficial effects on cognitive and socio-occupational function in patients with previous mania and depression who experience persistent cognitive difficulties. Such effects would suggest implementation of CR in future treatment of bipolar disorder in order to facilitate the patients' ability to cope with the responsibilities related to work and everyday life. The hypotheses of the present study are that CR (in comparison to standard treatment) will 1) improve verbal learning and recall; and 2) improve sustained attention, executive function and psychosocial function.</brief_summary>
