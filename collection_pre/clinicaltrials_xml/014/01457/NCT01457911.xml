	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - To evaluate the efficacy of fixed dose combination of glimepiride and metformin (AMARYL M 1/250mg) in comparison with glimepiride (AMARYL) alone in terms of glycemic control as reflected by HbA1c during a 20-week treatment period in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) inadequately controlled with metformin. Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate the percentage of patients reaching HbA1c &lt; 7% or HbA1c ≤ 6.5% of fixed dose combination of 1 mg glimepiride and 250 mg metformin (AMARYL M 1/250mg) in comparison with glimepiride (AMARYL) alone at week 20. - To evaluate the effect on Fasting Plasma Glucose of fixed dose combination of glimepiride and metformin (AMARYL M 1/250mg) in comparison with glimepiride (AMARYL) alone at week 20. - To assess the safety and tolerability of fixed dose combination of glimepiride and metformin (AMARYL M 1/250mg).</brief_summary>
