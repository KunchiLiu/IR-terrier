	<brief_summary>This study aims to study and implement active referral of heroin users from a syringe exchange programme to evidence-based treatment for heroin addiction. Patients are randomized to either a strength-based case management intervention or a control group, while both groups receive referral to medical investigation for inclusion in substitution treatment for heroin addiction. The hypothesis is that syringe exchange can be used for referral to effective treatment, and that a strength-based intervention can increase the number of patients who are successfully referred and enter treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Malmö Treatment Referral and Intervention Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients attending the syringe exchange programme of Malmö, Sweden, and who are using heroin as their primary drug of abuse and who live in the catchment area of Malmö Addiction Centre, will be addressed, and patients willing to participate will undergo a baseline interview and will be referred to medical examination for decision to start substitution treatment to treat heroin dependence. Half of patients will be randomized to a strength-based case management intervention, hypothesized to facilitate treatment entry, and half of patients will be randomized to a control condition involving only referral. The study will measure the number of patients who successfully accept referral and initiate substitution treatment for heroin dependence, comparing patients in intervention arm to patients in the control condition (RCT design). Also, as a secondary outcome measure, retention and treatment outcome (substance use and clinical characteristics) will be compared between the two groups. In addition, this study will enable a number of sub-analyses aiming to increase knowledge about heroin addicts' detailed substance use pattern and clinical characteristics. Patients will be followed with respect to retention, substance use and clinical picture for three years.</detailed_description>
