	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to characterize the safety and toxicity of DKN-01 by determining a maximum-tolerated dose and associated dose limiting toxicity. To evaluate the pharmacodynamic response in patients with cancer. To characterize the pharmacokinetic parameters of DKN-01 in cancer patients who are intolerant to standard/approved therapies.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of DKN-01 in Multiple Myeloma or Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part A of this trial consists of 4 treatment arms of DKN-01. It is a dose escalation study in patients with multiple myeloma or advanced solid tumors. Patients must be refractory or intolerant to all standard/approved therapy(ies). At each dose level, 3 subjects will be treated. If none of the 3 subjects develop a dose limiting toxicity after a minimum of 4 weeks of treatment, subsequent dose escalation will proceed according to the same schedule. Part B consists of dose confirmation in patients with NSCLC. Patients must be refractory or intolerant to all standard/approved therapy(ies). Approximately 15 patients may be enrolled in Part B.</detailed_description>
