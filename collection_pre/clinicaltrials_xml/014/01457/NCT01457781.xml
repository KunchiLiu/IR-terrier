	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 2, Placebo Controlled, Double-Blind, Randomized, Clinical Study to Determine Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of Pulsed, Inhaled Nitric Oxide (iNO) Versus Placebo as Add-on Therapy in Symptomatic Subjects with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inhaled Nitric Oxide/INOpulse DS for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study to determine if inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) given through a special delivery device (INOpulse® DS) is safe and efficacious in treating Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH). Medical literature and clinical experience suggests that iNO at pulsed doses of 0.013 to 0.1 mg/kg per hour for 1 month to 2+ years appears safe and suggests efficacy for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. There are two parts to this study. In Part 1 (week 0 to week 16), the objectives are to determine the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and exploratory objectives of two different doses of iNO delivered by a pulsed delivery device in symptomatic subjects with PAH who remain symptomatic due to PAH on approved PAH monotherapy or combination approved PAH therapy. In Part 2 (week 17 to end of study Part 2 [EOS Part 2]), the objective is to compile data on the long-term effects of iNO on safety, tolerability, clinical and hemodynamic measures.</detailed_description>

A confirmed diagnosis of Pulmonary Hypertension Group 1 (PAH) who have either idiopathic PAH (IPAH), heritable PAH, anorexigeninduced PAH, associated PAH (APAH) with connective tissue disease (CTD), APAH with repaired simple congenital systemic to pulmonary shunt (i.e., atrial septal defect [ASD], ventricular septal defect [VSD] and/or patent ductus arteriosus [PDA]; complete repair at least 1 year prior to Screening) or APAH with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 3. Confirmation of PAH diagnosis at the time of Baseline RHC according to the following definition: mPAP ≥ 25 mmHg at rest, with a concomitant mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (mPCWP), mean left atrial pressure (mLAP), or left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) ≤ 15 mmHg and a PVR ≥ 240 dynes.sec/cm5 4. 6MWD at least 100 meters and no greater than 450 meters 5. The subject is receiving at least one approved PAH therapy and is clinically symptomatic from PAH (e.g., onset or increased dyspnea on exertion, dizziness, nearsyncope, syncope, chest pain or peripheral edema) 6. Background PAH medication doses (including calcium channel blockade if being used to treat PAH) must be stable for at least 12 weeks prior to Screening 7. If on background conventional therapy (e.g., digoxin, diuretics, supplemental oxygen, anticoagulation), it must have been started at least 30 days prior to Screening and be on a stable dose for at least 30 days except for anticoagulation dose 8. If previously treated with an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA), phosphodiesterase5 (PDE5) inhibitor, prostacyclin or a prostacyclin analog and is no longer on said treatment at Screening (per inclusion criteria as above), subject must have been off said treatment for &gt; 90 days at Screening 9. If previously treated with a calcium channel blocker as treatment for PAH and is no longer on the calcium channel blocker treatment at Screening (per inclusion criteria as above), subject must have been off the calcium channel blocker treatment for &gt; 90 days at Screening 10. Age between 16 and 80 years (inclusive) 11. Male height ≤ 200 cm (6'7") or Female height ≤ 210 cm (6'11") 12. Subjects are willing and considered in the judgment of the Investigator able to use the INOpulse DS device continuously for up to 24 hours per day 13. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pretreatment serum pregnancy test and must be on a reliable method of contraception (including double protection if appropriate, e.g., for subjects concurrently treated with bosentan therapy) 1. Subjects with known HIV infection within the past 2 years who have a history of or show any clinical or laboratory evidence of any opportunistic pulmonary disease (e.g., tuberculosis, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, or other pneumonias) at the time of Screening 2. PAH associated with portal hypertension, untreated thyroid disorders, glycogen storage disease, Gaucher's disease, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, hemoglobinopathies, myeloproliferative disorders or splenectomy 3. Any subject with unrepaired congenital heart disease or repaired congenital heart disease other than the simple congenital to systemic shunts specified in the inclusion criteria, i.e., PAH associated with noncorrected simple congenital systemictopulmonary shunts, corrected simple congenital systemictopulmonary shunt with residual shunt post repair, or complex systemicto pulmonary shunts, corrected or noncorrected, or any other complex congenital heart disease, corrected or noncorrected 4. PAH associated with significant venous or capillary involvement (PCWP &gt; 15 mmHg), known pulmonary venoocclusive disease, or pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis 5. Any subject with WHO PH Groups 2, 3, 4 or 5 6.
