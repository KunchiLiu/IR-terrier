	<brief_title>Acupuncture to Treat Insulin Resistance in Women With and Without Polycystic Ovary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine and metabolic disorder in women. The main metabolic phenotype is hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, which are independent of body weight and worsen hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction. Pharmacological treatments are symptom oriented and usually effective but have metabolic and gastrointestinal side effects. Therefore, it is important to evaluate new nonpharmacological treatment strategies, as most women with PCOS require long-term treatment. Hypothesis and Aims Our central hypothesis is that acupuncture break the vicious circle of androgen excess and reverse insulin resistance and improve health related quality of life and affective symptoms in overweight and obese women with and without PCOS. The specific aim are designed to test the hypotheses that 1. Acupuncture (acute and chronic i.e. 5 weeks treatment, 3 times per week) improves insulin sensitivity in overweight and obese women with and without PCOS 2. Acupuncture (acute and chronic i.e. 5 weeks treatment, 3 times per week) regulate key signaling molecules and mitochondrial oxidation/biogenesis in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue in overweight and obese women with and without PCOS 3. Acupuncture (chronic i.e. 5 weeks treatment, 3 times per week) improve health related quality of life and symptoms of anxiety and depression in overweight and obese women with and without PCOS Time frame of the study is 5-6 weeks. No long term follow up.</detailed_description>
