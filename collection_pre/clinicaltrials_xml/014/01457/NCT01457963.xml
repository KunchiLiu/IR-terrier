	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of PE among consecutive ICU patients receiving MV who required thoracic computed tomography (CT) with contrast agent injection, regardless of whether PE was suspected clinically. The secondary objectives were to assess the association between PE and DVT, to identify risk factors for VTE, and to determine the outcome of VTE.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevalence of Pulmonary Embolism in ICU</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background: Pulmonary embolism (PE) produces nonspecific or minimal symptoms in mechanically ventilated (MV) patients, leading to underdiagnosis. We estimated the prevalence of PE and associations with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) among MV patients. Methods: Consecutive MV patients who required thoracic computed tomography (CT) in a single ICU. Compression ultrasound of the four limbs was performed within 48 hours of inclusion. Curative anticoagulation therapy was given immediately after PE diagnosis.</detailed_description>
