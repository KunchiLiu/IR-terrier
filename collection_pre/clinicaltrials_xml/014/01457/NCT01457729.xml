	<brief_summary>Patients with suspected OSA (obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome) are asked to use a standard bike ergometer which is additionally equipped with a system to gather training data and the ability to send daily training time to an internet server to which the physician has access. Training time of two groups is compared. Group one is not motivated while group two benefits from telephone feedback when training time declines. It is presumed that training time increases with better information and response to training behaviour.</brief_summary>
