	<brief_summary>The incidence of postoperative pneumonia after aortic surgery reaches 60%. In experimental lung model, endotracheal tube with taper-shaped cuff has been shown to decrease microaspiration. This effect has never been demonstrated in patients. The investigators hypothesize that use of endotracheal tube with taper-shaped cuff decreases the incidence of postoperative pneumonia in patients after aortic surgery.</brief_summary>
