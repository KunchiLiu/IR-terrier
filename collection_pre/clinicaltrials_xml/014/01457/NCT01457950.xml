	<criteria>Ambulatory Korean postmenopausal women with osteoporosis greater than 5 years postmenopausal aged 60 to 90 years old absolute bone mineral density value consistent with a Tscore less than 2.5 and greater than or equal to 4.0 at the either the lumbar spine or total hip, as measured by dual energy xray absorptiometry. Subjects with a Tscore less than 4.0 are at very high risk for fracture and will be excluded. previous or current metabolic bone disease, Paget's or Cushing's disease, or hyperprolactinemia current hypo or hyperparathyroidism or hypo or hyperthyroidism unless on stable thyroid replacement therapy and TSH level meets criteria rheumatoid arthritis cirrhosis of the liver or unstable liver disease or ALT or AST greater than or equal to 2.0 times the upper limit of normal, or alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin greater than or equal to 1.5 times the upper limit of normal medications used to treat osteoporosis, defined for type and duration of use, and including IV and oral bisphosphonates medications that affect bone metabolism including parathyroid hormone or derivatives; anabolic steroids or testosterone; glucocorticosteroids; systemic hormone replacement therapy; selective estrogen receptor modulators; tibolone, calcitonin, and calcitriol or vitamin D derivatives; other bone active drugs including anticonvulsives (but not benzodiazepines) and heparin; chronic systemic ketoconazole, androgens, ACTH, cinacalcet, aluminum, lithium, protease inhibitors, methotrexate, and gonadotropinreleasing hormone agonists malignancy within 5 years except certain resected types malabsorption syndrome or gastrointestinal disorders associated with malabsorption abnormal calcium level vitamin D deficiency any laboratory abnormality that will prevent the subject from completing the study or interfere with interpretation of study results severe renal impairment or on dialysis impaired immune system or subject is taking immunosuppressants oral or dental conditions including current or past history of osteomyelitis or osteonecrosis of the jaw; active dental or jaw condition with requires oral surgery; planned invasive dental procedure; unhealed dental or oral surgery any disorder that compromises the ability of the subject to give written informed consent or to comply with study procedures any physical or psychiatric disorder that will prevent the subject from completing the study or interferes with study results known to have tested positive for HIV less than two lumbar vertebrae evaluable for DXA measurements height, weight, or girth that may preclude accurate DXA measurements drug or alcohol abuse within 12 months that interferes with understanding or completing the study known sensitivity to mammalian cellderived drug products use of an investigational drug or device within 30 days of enrollment or currently receiving other investigational agent(s)</criteria>
