	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine why obese women have lower hormone levels and less fertility than women of normal body weight. The proposal will examine the reproductive system at the level of the brain and the ovary to define the changes that happen leading to lowered hormone production. Women will be studied throughout a menstrual cycle and given medications that will test how well their pituitary gland can make hormones that stimulate the ovary (luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)). They will also be given a medication to abolish estrogen production in the body and their response to this medication will be assessed. Finally, the ovary's ability to produce progesterone after ovulation will be examined. --Hypotheses: 1. Obese women have reduced pituitary sensitivity to exogenous gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), but normal clearance of exogenous LH. (comparative study of obese compared to normal weight women) 2. Obese women have abnormally increased sensitivity to estradiol negative feedback which will be reversed by an aromatase inhibitor. (comparative study of obese compared to normal weight women)</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>AIM 1: test the hypothesis that reduced pituitary sensitivity to GnRH-induced LH and FSH secretion causes the relative hypogonadotropic hypogonadism of obesity AIM 2: test the hypothesis that the hypothalamic-pituitary axis is abnormally sensitive to estradiol negative feedback in obesity</detailed_description>
