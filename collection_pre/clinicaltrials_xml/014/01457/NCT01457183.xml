	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation of Bedside Pulse Lavage Irrigation Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulse lavage irrigation is an effective method of cleaning both acute and chronic wounds. The major drawback to pulse irrigation is that it is extremely messy and can easily contaminate the patient's surroundings, putting other patients and the person operating the device at risk. In order to obtain the benefits of pulse lavage, we have created a device that will contain the water spray from the lavage and protect both the patient and their surroundings. This study evaluates how well the device contains the spray from pulse lavage and how well subjects with intact skin tolerate pulse lavage when awake.</detailed_description>
