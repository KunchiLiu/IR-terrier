	<brief_summary>Background. Acute renal failure after liver transplantation (LT) requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) adversely affects patient survival. However, there are few reports to assess the predictors for postoperative CRRT in liver transplant patients. The investigators undertook this study to identify perioperative factors that would predict patients at risk of CRRT. Patients and Methods. The investigators retrospectively reviewed the data of 148 liver transplant patients from January 2007 to November 2010 at Severance Hospital, Yonsei University HealthSystem, in Seoul, Korea. The number of patients treated with CRRT was 44 (18 patients from living and 26 from deceased donors) and those without CRRT was 104. Univariate and stepwise logistic multivariate analyses were performed.</brief_summary>
