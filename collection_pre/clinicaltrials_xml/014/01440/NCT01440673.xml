	<brief_summary>- Gynecological surgery is associated with a high incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting. - NK1 receptor antagonists such as aprepitant appear to be highly effective for treating acute and delayed emesis, and yet understanding of the efficacy of different doses of aprepitant is limited. - We performed a prospective, randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled study of 123 female adults scheduled for laparoscopic hysterectomy who received 80 mg aprepitant, 125 mg aprepitant, or a placebo.</brief_summary>
