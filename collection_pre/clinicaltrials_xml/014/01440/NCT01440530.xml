	<detailed_description>Objective: Technology shows promise to enhance standard care of diabetes with cost-effective, online lifestyle interventions. Compared to Primary Care (PC) Diabetes System of Care (control), the investigators hypothesized Technology Intervention for Diabetes Engagement &amp; Self-Care (TIDES) would significantly improve diabetes knowledge and self-care. Methods: Following Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, physician letters were sent to patients with type 2 diabetes, age &gt;18 years with HgA1c &gt;8% identified via Electronic Health Record (EHR) of an integrated US health system to invite participation in a 3-site, 24-week diabetes study. Of the 270 with &gt;1 week email/web use invited to the shared medical visit (SMV) orientation, 166 subjects provided written informed consent. Diabetes knowledge and self-care assessments, vital signs, HgA1c, fasting glucose and lipids were collected at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Following randomization to TIDES (N=117) or usual care (N=49), TIDES group was oriented to the multimedia online intervention including a dosed sequence of learning via email, video, slide shows, food solutions, expert questions and answers,and quizzes.</detailed_description>
