	<brief_summary>This study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of cobicistat-boosted darunavir plus two fully active nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors in HIV 1 infected, antiretroviral treatment-naive and treatment-experienced adults with no darunavir (DRV) resistance-associated mutations. After the Week 48 Visit, participants will be given the option to participate in an open-label rollover phase to receive cobicistat and attend visits every 12 weeks until it becomes commercially available, or until Gilead Sciences elects to terminate development of cobicistat.</brief_summary>
