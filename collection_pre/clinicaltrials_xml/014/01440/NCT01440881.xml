	<brief_summary>This project evaluates whether nesiritide, human recombinant brain natriuretic peptide, confers renal protection during cardiovascular surgery by attenuating the inflammatory response.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Nesiritide Provide Renal Protection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a randomized, prospective blinded pilot study comparing nesiritide to placebo in patients undergoing aortic arch, ascending aorta, aortic valve or mitral valve surgery with baseline GFR 30-90ml/min. Patients were randomized to either placebo or nesiritide (administered prophylactically starting in the operating room prior to incision at 0.01 mcg/kg /minute with no bolus and continued for 48 hours).</detailed_description>
