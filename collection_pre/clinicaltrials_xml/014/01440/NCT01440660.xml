	<criteria>1. Age over 18 yearsold. 2. Diabetes mellitus type 2 according to 1985 WHO criteria. 3. Nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (ETDRS level &lt;= 35) 4. Signs of NPDR progression based on existing clinical information: 1. Retinal thickness (RT) increase (increase in RT above normal range as measured by OCT, considering the macular thickness normative data) in the central subfield, the inner ring and/or the outer ring (leaking phenotype); OR 2. Neovascular disease activity as shown by microaneurysms (MA) turnover (MA formation rate &gt;= 2, i.e. number of new MA per year) computed from CFP using the RetmarkerDR software (ischemic phenotype). 5. Informed consent. 1. Cataract or other eye disease that may interfere with fundus examinations 2. Any eye surgery or treatment within a period of 6months. 3. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women. 4. Patients with chronic or severe kidney disease (glomerular filtration rate, GFR &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m2). 5. Patients with acute kidney injury. 6. Patients with known allergic or hypersensitivity reactions to gadolinium, versetamide or any of the inert ingredients. 7. Patients around the time of liver transplantation.. 8. Patients with implants containing metals.</criteria>
