	<brief_summary>Water immersion insertion and carbon dioxide (CO2)instead of room air insufflation as alternative colonoscopy techniques have been documented to decrease patient discomfort during and after the procedure. This prospective, randomized, single-center trial was designed to evaluate whether the combination of water immersion during insertion and CO2 insufflation during withdrawal (Water/CO2)for minimal sedation colonoscopy (2 mg of midazolam i.v.)is superior to the other colonoscopy methods (Water/Air, CO2/CO2, Air/Air).</brief_summary>
