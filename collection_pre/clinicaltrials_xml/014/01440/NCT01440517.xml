	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the results of 99mTc maraciclatide scintigraphy in diabetic subjects with HFPEF. A maximum of 20 subjects with Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and Heart Failure With Preserved Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (HFPEF) will be enrolled and imaged with 99mTc maraciclatide. In addition, a maximum of 10 subjects with DM and diastolic dysfunction but no diagnosis of heart failure (HF) will be enrolled and imaged with 99mTc-maraciclatide.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The subject is between 18 and 80 years of age. The subject was diagnosed with DM type 2 based upon accepted clinical criteria and currently takes at least one diabetes medication. For HF subjects: The subject was diagnosed with HF with preserved EF within the previous 1 year, at which time LVEF was determined to be â‰¥45%. For comparison subjects: The subject was determined to have diastolic dysfunction on EKG within the previous year and currently has no signs or symptoms of HF. The subject has been clinically stable for at least 7 days prior to the study imaging procedures (e.g., not experiencing continuing chest pain, hemodynamic instability, worsening HF symptoms, or clinically significant arrhythmia). The subject had an acute myocardial infarction within the past 30 days. The subject had a cardiac revascularization (e.g., percutaneous transluminal coronary angiography [PTCA], percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or coronary artery bypass graft [CABG]) within the past 30 days. The subject has severe renal dysfunction. The subject is claustrophobic or has a movement disorder that prevents him/her from lying still in a supine position for up to 20 minutes at a time. The subject has participated in a research study using ionizing radiation in the previous 12 months.</criteria>
