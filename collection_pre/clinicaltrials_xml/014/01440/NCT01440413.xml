	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, non-randomized study which aims to evaluate the response to a neoadjuvant chemotherapy according to the the antitumor immune response in localized breast cancer. 40 patients will be enrolled in the study. They will receive chemotherapy : 3 or 4 anthracycline cycles or 3 or 4 FEC-100 cycles followed by 3 or 4 taxane cycles. Trastuzumab will be added to taxane for HER2+/Neu+ patients. Then, patients will be operated and receive an adjuvant treatment which will both depend on the investigator's appreciation. Blood sample will be collected on the first day of the first chemotherapy cycle, on the first day of the third cycle, on surgery, 6 months after the surgery and in case of relapse. Tumor sample will be collected on diagnosis as much as possible and on surgery. Patients will be followed during 5 years.</brief_summary>
