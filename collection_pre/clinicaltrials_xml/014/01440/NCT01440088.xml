	<brief_title>A Trial of TH-302 in Combination With Doxorubicin Versus Doxorubicin Alone to Treat Patients With Locally Advanced Unresectable or Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TH-302 is designed to target the hypoxic regions of tumors which are generally located distant from tumor vessels. Doxorubicin has poor tissue penetration and targets the regions of tumors that are located in proximity to the tumor vessels. The presence of hypoxia in solid tumors is associated with a more malignant phenotype and resistance to chemotherapy. The hypoxia-activated prodrug, TH-302, is designed to selectively target the hypoxic microenvironment. Soft tissue sarcomas have evidence supporting the presence of hypoxia based on pO2 histography, F-MISO and gene expression profiling. There is an absence of therapeutic options for subjects with soft tissue sarcoma. Combining doxorubicin with TH-302 may enable the targeting of both the normoxic and hypoxic regions of soft tissue sarcoma.</detailed_description>

Recovered from reversible toxicities of prior therapy Measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 Life expectancy of at least 3 months Acceptable liver, renal, hematological and cardiac function All women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test and all subjects must agree to use effective means of contraception Prior systemic therapy for advanced or metastatic disease (neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgical resection and adjuvant therapy permitted). Palliative radiotherapy to nontarget lesions is allowed if completed at least two weeks prior to study entry Low grade tumors according to standard grading systems Prior therapy with ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide or other nitrogen mustards Prior therapy with an anthracycline or anthracenedione Prior mediastinal/cardiac radiotherapy Current use of drugs with known cardiotoxicity or known interactions with doxorubicin Anticancer treatment with radiation therapy, neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy, targeted therapies, immunotherapy, hormones or other antitumor therapies within 4 weeks prior to study entry (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C). Palliative radiotherapy to nontarget lesions is allowed, is completed at least two weeks prior to study entry. Significant cardiac dysfunction precluding treatment with doxorubicin Seizure disorders requiring anticonvulsant therapy unless seizurefree for the last year Known brain metastases (unless previously treated and well controlled for a period of ≥ 3 months) Previously treated malignancies, except for adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer, in situ cancer, or other cancer from which the subject has been diseasefree for at least 5 years Severe chronic obstructive or other pulmonary disease with hypoxemia or in the opinion of the investigator any physiological state likely to cause normal tissue hypoxia Major surgery, other than diagnostic surgery, within 4 weeks prior to Day 1, without complete recovery Active, uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, requiring systemic therapy Prior therapy with a hypoxic cytotoxin Subjects who participated in an investigational drug or device study within 28 days prior to study entry Known infection with HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C Subjects who have exhibited allergic reactions to a structural compound similar to TH302,doxorubicin or their excipients Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding Concomitant disease or condition that could interfere with the conduct of the study, or that would, in the opinion of the investigator, pose an unacceptable risk to the subject in this study Unwillingness or inability to comply with the study protocol for any reason</criteria>
