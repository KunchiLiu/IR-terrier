	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to asses the efficacy of a 4 week low-intensity resistance training program with concurrent application of partial blood flow restriction (PBFR) to the exercising limbs to improve quadriceps strength and size, leg muscle power, and mobility in women at risk for developing symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. The primary outcome will be change in isotonic double leg-press 1 repetition maximum (1RM) strength. The investigators will test the following hypotheses. In comparison with low-intensity resistance training without use of PBFR, a four-week low-intensity resistance-training program with PBFR will: Primary Hypothesis: Increase (a) double leg-press 1RM strength and (b) isokinetic knee extensor strength Secondary Hypotheses: 1. Increase quadriceps muscle volume assessed by MRI 2. Increase lower limb muscle power on (a) double leg-press at 40% 1RM and (b) a timed stair climb 3. Not adversely effect knee pain or quality of life assessed by the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaire</brief_summary>
