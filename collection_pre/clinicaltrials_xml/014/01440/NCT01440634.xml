	<brief_summary>Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) is a highly prevalent public health problem that results from progressive atherosclerosis of arteries in the lower extremities. PAD is also associated with major detrimental effects on quality of life and functional status, and is the most important cause of limb amputation. More importantly, PAD is a major manifestation of cardiovascular disease and a potent predictor of myocardial infarction, stroke and death. Despite its frequent occurrence, little is known about the natural history of PAD in Hispanics who represent 12.5% of the United States. Because access to health care is limited among Hispanics, CBPR is the ideal process to reach this target population. The goal of the proposed study is to evaluate community-based strategies of detection and treatment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in Hispanics. The proposed project consists of two phases: a cross-sectional phase (PAD detection), followed by a randomization phase.During the PAD detection study , the prevalence and severity of PAD in this population will be determined. Specific risk factors associated with PAD among the Hispanic participants will be identified. During the second phase patients will be enrolled in a randomized, non-blinded trial comparing a community-based risk factor modification and supervised exercise program versus usual care for PAD. These individuals will undergo a baseline evaluation similar to the one obtained during the first phase of the study, but will also include functional testing of the lower extremities.</brief_summary>

No prior amputations other than toe or partial foot amputations that do not impede walking. Patient has been informed of the nature, procedures and risks of the study, and has signed a consent form approved by the UT Southwestern Institutional Review Board. CrossSectional Phase Individuals with severe dementia. Individuals with inability to provide informed consent. Bilateral lower or upper extremities amputations. Pregnancy or lactation. Randomization Phase Nonambulatory Individuals with prior below or aboveknee amputations Individuals unable to give informed consent Individuals unwilling to perform the functional tests or quality of life assessments Individuals unable to perform exercise therapy, functional tests or quality of life assessments due to severe comorbidities Presence of concurrent illness with an anticipated life expectancy less than six months Individuals with planned operative interventions</criteria>
