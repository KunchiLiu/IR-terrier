	<brief_summary>Adipose-derived stem cells have properties of differentiation to various types of cells, immunomodulatory effects. adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) show also low immunogenicity. Anterogen has developed ANTG-ASC(Autologous ASC) which has shown good efficacy and safety in Phase I and II study on the patients with Crohn's fistula. However, Crohn's patients are sometimes not fat enough to extract fat tissue for culturing ASCs. Therefore the investigators have planned to study allogenic ASCs for safety and efficacy in patients with Crohn's fistula.</brief_summary>
