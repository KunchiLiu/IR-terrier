Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs within six months prior to study vaccine dose. A history of any demyelinating disease including Multiple Sclerosis and GuillainBarr√© syndrome. Presence of an active neurological disorder. History of chronic alcohol abuse and/or drug abuse as deemed by the investigator to render the potential subject unable/unlikely to provide accurate safety reports. Any significant disorder of coagulation that increases the risk of intramuscular injections or treatment with coumadin derivatives or heparin. Persons receiving prophylactic antiplatelet medications, e.g. lowdose aspirin, and without a clinically apparent bleeding tendency are eligible Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the administration of the study vaccine or planned during the study. Any known or suspected allergy to any constituent of FLUQQIV and/or a history of anaphylactic type reaction to consumption of eggs, and/or reactions to products containing mercury.
