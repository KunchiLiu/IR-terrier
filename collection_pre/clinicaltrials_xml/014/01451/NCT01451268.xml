	<brief_summary>The study's primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of Panobinostat when administered within 150 days after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and given in conjunction with standard immunosuppressive therapy after HSCT for patients with high-risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) or Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Secondary objectives are - To determine safety and tolerability of panobinostat - To determine overall and disease-free survival at 12 months after HSCT - To evaluate immunoregulatory properties of panobinostat - To evaluate patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQL) The hypothesis of this study is that panobinostat can be an effective drug in preventing relapse of MDS and AML patients with high-risk features after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC-HSCT) while at the same time reducing graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) with preservation of graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect.</brief_summary>
