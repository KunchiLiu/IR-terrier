	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of certolizumab pegol (CZP) with methotrexate (MTX) compared with MTX-alone in patients with early-stage rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who are naive to MTX and have with poor prognostic factors, using inhibition of radiographically confirmed joint damage progression over a one-year period as a primary endpoint. Following a year of treatment with CZP plus MTX treatment, CZP will be discontinued, and the subjects will be monitored for one more year (the follow-up period) to investigate the sustainability of efficacy of CZP during the MTX monotherapy for exploratory purposes.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects with RA as defined by the ACR/EULAR criteria (2010) who meet all of the following criteria: 1. Subjects who developed RA within one year after onset of RA. 2. Subjects who have never received MTX before (MTX naive) 3. Subjects whose disease activity is moderate or higher (DAS28(ESR) ≥ 3.2） 4. Subjects must satisfy at least two of the three criteria (AntiCCP antibody positive, Rheumatoid factor positive, Presence of Xray erosion） for poor prognostic factors. The antiCCP antibody positive is essential for every patient. Patients who have a diagnosis of any other type of inflammatory arthritis. Patients who have a secondary, noninflammatory type of arthritis. Patients who have used with MTX, reflunomide, or any other biologics prior to the start of study drug administration. Patients who have NYHA (New York Heart Association) Class III or IV congestive heart failure Patients who currently have, or who have a history of, tuberculosis. Patients who have a high risk of infection (with a current infectious disease, a chronic infectious disease, a history of serious infectious disease) Patients who currently have, or have a history of, malignant tumor Female patients who are breastfeeding or pregnant, who are of childbearing potential</criteria>
