	<brief_title>Human Skin Aging: Clinical Parameters and Gene Expression Profiling</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study includes answering a survey on prior sun exposures, donating two small pieces of skin (4mm each), one blood draw, complexion analysis, photographs, and non-invasive tests such as skin surface lipid analysis. Your blood and tissue will be sent for DNA analysis and gene expression profiling.</detailed_description>
