	<brief_title>Endoscopic Treatment Alone Versus Combined Propranolol and Endoscopic Treatment of Acute Variceal Hemorrhage in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Esophageal variceal bleeding is characteristic of high rebleeding rate and mortality. Thanks to the recent advance of treatment for variceal bleeding such as non-selective beta blocker (NSBB) added to endoscopic ligation further reduce rebleeding in cirrhotic patients, the rebleeding rate and mortality has a marked reduction. However, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a distinct group characteristic of very poor prognosis in patients with portal hypertension when compared to those of liver cirrhosis only. Therefore, the investigators design a study to randomize patients with HCC and acute variceal bleeding to endoscopic treatment alone and combination with endoscopic treatment and NSBB. This is the two years study.</detailed_description>
