	<criteria>Inclusion 1. Be considered in general good health based upon medical and surgical history, vital signs, pulse oximetry, physical exam, clinical lab tests, and electrocardiogram (ECG). 2. Be ≥18 years of age. 3. Female subjects are eligible if not pregnant, not lactating or not planning to become pregnant within the next 2 months; surgically sterile or at least 2 years postmenopausal, or practicing an acceptable form of birth control for the duration of the study. 4. Male subjects biologically capable of having children must agree to the use of a reliable method of birth control for the duration of the study. 5. Have a clinical diagnosis of one of the following: OA of the knee or hip for at least one year based on the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria Moderate to severe CLBP (i.e. pain that occurs in an area with boundaries between the lowest rib and the crease of the buttocks) that 1) must have been present for at least several hours a day for a minimum of 3 months, 2) is not due to a known malignancy, and 3) must be classified as nonneuropathic, neuropathic, or symptomatic for more than 6 months after LBP surgery based on the Quebec Task Force Classification of Spinal Disorders. 6. Have an average inclinic pain score of ≥3 on the 11point (010) numerical rating scale (NRS) as an average for the last 24 hours at screening visit. 7. Have a pain intensity score of ≥4 on NRS as an average for the last 24 hours at baseline visit. 8. Must, in the investigator's opinion, qualify for opioid therapy for their CLBP or OA. 9. Voluntarily provide written informed consent. Exclusion 1. Have any clinically significant condition or unstable intercurrent illness that would preclude study participation or interfere with the assessment of pain and other symptoms of CLBP or OA or would increase the risk of opioid related AEs. 2. Have an uncontrolled or poorly controlled major psychiatric condition, or have clinically significant anxiety or depression. 3. Have an active malignancy or history of malignancy within 2 years. 4. Have a history of seizures (except pediatric febrile seizures) or cognitive dysfunction. 5. Have clinically significant ECG abnormalities or have uncontrolled hypo or hypertension. 6. Had arthroscopic or open surgery on either knee or hip selected as the primary OA study joint within 6 months. 7. For CLBP, had a surgical procedure for back pain within 6 months. 8. For CLBP subjects, had a nerve or plexus block within 1 month or botulinum toxin injection in the lower back region within 3 months. For subjects with OA of the selected primary joint, had joint injection within 1 month prior to Screening Visit 1. 9. Had surgical implants of either the knee or hip selected as the primary OA joint. 10. Had gastric reduction surgery. 11. Have been taking opioids in equivalents to more than 20 mg OC or more than 40 mg MS orally per day, or have been taking opioid medications 4 times a week or more. 12. Unable to discontinue use of prohibited medications. 13. Have a known allergy or hypersensitivity to opioids, OC, APAP or ibuprofen. 14. Have abnormal clinical laboratory tests at screening. 15. Have a history of substance or alcohol abuse. 16. Have positive screening labs for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B and/or Hepatitis C. 17. Have a positive urine drug test for alcohol, illicit drugs, or controlled substances other than those prescribed medications. 18. Have previously participated in a clinical trial using COV795. 19. Received any investigational drugs or devices in the past 4 weeks. 20. History of spinal stenosis. 21. Other criteria as specified in the trial protocol.</criteria>
