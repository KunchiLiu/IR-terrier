	<brief_summary>Previous studies have shown that 5-10% of Hepatitis B Virus vaccine recipients produce none or to few antibodies after a standard immunization with 3 vaccines. These individuals are defined as non-responders. The investigators wish to investigate if mounting another kind of immune response, called the cellular immune (CMI) response, protects these non-responders. Aim/Hypothesis Primary aims: 1. To estimate the CMI response in serologic non-responders after receiving a standard course of HBV immunization Secondary aims: 2. To establish the prevalence of serological non-responders after a standard course of HBV vaccination. 3. To assess the safety of the vaccine. 4. Evaluate predictors of serologic non-response in young, healthy individuals receiving a standard course of HBV immunization 5. To compare the immunological profile before and after a standard HBV vaccination regimen on non-responders and responders 6. Establish a rapid test for measuring CMI after being HBV vaccinated. A total of 400 healthy volunteers receive a standard course of immunization with a combined hepatitis A and B vaccine (TwinrixÂ®) at 0, 1, and 6 months. Blood is drawn at 0 and 8 months from all participants. The blood will be analysed to see if there is antibodies or/and if there is mounted a cellular immune response by measuring on parameters called cytokines.</brief_summary>
