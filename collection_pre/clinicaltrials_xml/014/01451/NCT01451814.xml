	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to test a manualized adaptation of positive psychotherapy (PPT) for smoking cessation (PPT-S). The investigators will conduct a preliminary randomized clinical trial (N = 80) to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of PPT-S over 26 weeks of follow up in comparison to a standard smoking cessation treatment. Both treatments will be delivered in individual 6 sessions over 6 weeks, and will include provision of transdermal nicotine patch. The effect size estimates from this Stage 1b research will provide the foundation for a future application to conduct a large-scale, Stage II, randomized clinical trial.</brief_summary>
