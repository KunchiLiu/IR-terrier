	<brief_summary>Title: The effect of dance-therapy on the functional capacity, body image and quality of life of patients with advanced obesity Project duration: 33 months (August 2010 to June 2013) Clinical context: Obesity has reached epidemic proportions. The gait and balance problems in obese people and the associated decreased functional capacity and risk of falling highlight the need to evaluate the benefits of specific treatments on these problems. Attention should be paid not only to metabolic management but also to the physical rehabilitation required in cases of advanced obesity. Objectives: The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of dance-therapy on functional capacity (walking ability, postural control and physical activity level), body image and quality of life of patients with advanced obesity.</brief_summary>
