	<brief_title>Potential for Drug-drug Interactions Between Boceprevir and Etravirine in HIV/Hepatitis C Virus Negative Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To investigate the potential for drug interactions between boceprevir and etravirine, participants will receive each drug alone and the drugs in combination for 11-14 days. The pharmacokinetics of boceprevir and etravirine when given in combination vs. alone will be compared.</detailed_description>
