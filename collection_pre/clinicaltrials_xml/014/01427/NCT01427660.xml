	<brief_summary>Two of AHRQ 's consumer-focused guides, "Pills for Type 2 Diabetes" and "Premixed Insulin for Type 2 Diabetes" could be of great use to underserved ethnic and racial minority adults. The presentation of content and delivery mechanisms of these Guides, however, needs to be modified to increase their use and impact among these difficult-to-reach populations. To achieve this goal, a long-standing collaboration among African American and Latino community organizations, health care centers and systems, public health organizations, and academics (the REACH Detroit Partnership) is joining with leading experts in the development of personally and culturally tailored health decision aids (University of Michigan's Center for Health Communications Research [CHCR] and Center for Behavioral and Decision Sciences in Medicine [CBDSM]). The investigators will develop and evaluate a computer tailored online diabetes medication decision aid that will enable community health workers (CHWs) to provide personalized patient education materials to underserved diabetic African American and Latino adults in Detroit, Michigan.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>iDecide.Decido: Diabetes Medication Decision Support Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Specific Aims of this study are: Aim 1: To use the information in the two diabetes medications consumer CERSGs to build an interactive, computer tailored diabetes medication guide that will enable patients to assess their treatment goals, personal preferences, and side-effect concerns and generate a personally tailored assessment of their current diabetes treatments with, as appropriate, options for improving their diabetes care; Aim 2: To determine the extent to which this personally tailored diabetes medication guide compared with the print consumer guides reduces Latino and African American diabetes patients' decisional conflict, through improved knowledge of anti-hyperglycemic medications and satisfaction with information received. Aim 3: To examine the computer tailored program's effects on participants' changes in medications (medication intensification), self-reported medication adherence and beliefs and A1C levels between baseline and follow-up compared to participants receiving the print consumer guides.</detailed_description>
