	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate equivalence of calcium acetate oral solution and sevelamer carbonate in maintaining serum phosphorus levels This is a phase IV, multicenter, randomized, open-label, cross-over study to assess the equivalence of a liquid formulation of a calcium-based phosphate binder, COS, to sevelamer carbonate tablets, in hemodialysis dependent Chronic Kidney Disease subjects (CKD). The aim of the study is to maintain serum phosphorus level and establish equivalence between COS and sevelamer carbonate tablets.</brief_summary>
