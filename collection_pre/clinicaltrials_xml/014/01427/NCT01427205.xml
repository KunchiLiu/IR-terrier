	<brief_summary>The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the addition of OSI-906 to cetuximab can improve response. The safety of these drugs will also be studied. Objectives: Primary Objective(s): To assess progression-free survival (PFS) among patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treated with a combination of cetuximab plus OSI-906 and compare it with PFS among patients treated with cetuximab plus placebo. Secondary Objective(s): - To assess the safety and toxicity of these treatment regimens. - To assess the efficacy of these two treatment regimens in terms of overall survival, response rate, and disease control rate - To assess the efficacy of single agent OSI-906 following cetuximab treatment in terms of response rate and disease control rate in patients who cross-over from Arm B to receive single-agent OSI-906 - To explore blood-based and tissue biomarkers</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Cetuximab With or Without OSI-906 in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cetuximab is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by blocking proteins on the cancer cell, called the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). OSI-906 is designed to prevent or slow the growth of cancer cells. A placebo is not a drug. It looks like the study drug but is not designed to treat any disease or illness. It is designed to be compared with a study drug to learn if the study drug has any real effect. Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. - If you are in Group 1, you will receive cetuximab and OSI-906. - If you are in Group 2, you will receive cetuximab and a placebo. Neither you nor the study doctor will know if you are receiving OSI-906 or the placebo. However, if needed for your safety, the study doctor will be able to find out which group you are in. If the disease gets worse, the study doctor will find out which group you were in and you will be offered the chance to take OSI-906 alone if you were not already receiving it. Study Drug Administration: Each cycle is 21 days. On Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle, you will receive cetuximab by vein. The first dose of cetuximab will be given over about 120 minutes. If it is well tolerated, each additional infusion will be given over about 60 minutes. You will take OSI-906 or placebo by mouth 2 times every day about 12 hours apart (in the morning and evening). You should take OSI-906 or placebo with food and a glass (up to 6 ½ ounces) of water. If you forget to take a dose, you can take it any time up to 6 hours before the next dose. You must not take the missed dose with the next dose on that same day or with a dose the next day. If you vomit after taking the tablet(s), the dose should be replaced only if the tablet(s) can actually be seen and counted. You should store the study drug/placebo at room temperature below 77°F. In order to help decrease the risk of infusion reaction, you will receive Benadryl (diphenhydramine) by vein before the first dose of cetuximab. If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will receive diphenhydramine before every dose of cetuximab. On Day 1 of each cycle, you will need to return all unused OSI-906 or placebo and the empty bottles. Study Visits: At every visit, you will be asked if you have had any side effects and to list any drugs you may be taking. On Day 1 of each cycle (+/- 7 days): - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight. - Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. You should not eat or drink anything (fast) for 8 hours before this blood draw. - If the doctor thinks it is needed and you are able to become pregnant, you will have a blood (less than 1 teaspoon) or urine pregnancy test. On Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle, your vital signs will be measured before and after you receive cetuximab. Every 6 weeks (+/- 14 days): - You will have an ECG. - You will have a CT scan and/or MRI scan to check the status of the disease. Length of Study: You may continue to receive treatment as long as you are benefitting. You will be taken off study early if you experience any intolerable side effects, the disease get worse, the doctor thinks it is your best interest, or if you are unable to follow study directions. Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the end-of-treatment and follow-up visits. End-of-Treatment Visit: Within 30 days after the last dose of study drugs/placebo, you will have an end-of-treatment visit: - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight - You will be asked if you have had any side effects and to list any drugs you may be taking. - Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. - If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a CT scan or MRI scan to check the status of the disease. Long Term Follow-Up: About every 6 months from then on, you (or your family members or designees) will be asked about how you are doing and what treatments you may be receiving. This may be by phone, letter, email, or during clinic visits. This is an investigational study. OSI-906 is not FDA approved or commercially available. At this time, OSI-906 is only being used in research. Cetuximab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of colorectal and head/ neck cancer. The combination of OSI-906 and cetuximab is investigational. Up to 66 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx or hypopharynx. 2. Patients must be willing to have a biopsy of tumor tissue for biomarker analysis. 3. Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;/= 20 mm with conventional techniques or as &gt;/= 10 mm with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
