	<detailed_description>The study population will be divided into 2groups each containing 100 infertile couples candidate for ICSI. Group (A)active group: administration of 10% Intravenous calcium gluconate 10 ml in 200 mL of physiologic saline on the day of ovum pickup, day 1,day 2, and day 3 after ovum pickup. Intravenous infusion was performed within 30 minutes. Group (B): placebo group: administration of 200 mL of 0.9% saline on the day of ovum pickup, day 1,day 2, and day 3 after ovum pickup.
