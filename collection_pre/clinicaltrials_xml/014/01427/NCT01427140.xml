	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the metabolic consequences of a moderate weight gain and if the type of dietary fat (saturated versus polyunsaturated) can modify the effects in young healthy adults. Hypothesis: the type of dietary fat can modify the effects of weight gain.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metabolic Consequences of Moderate Weight Gain - Role of Dietary Fat Composition (LIPOGAIN)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific goals: - Investigate if dietary fat composition influences liver fat accumulation and metabolic risk factors in response to moderate weight gain - Investigate if polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) in the diet could counteract any unfavorable metabolic changes that are expected to accompany moderate weight gain - Investigate effects of weight gain and dietary fat composition on markers of vascular health</detailed_description>
