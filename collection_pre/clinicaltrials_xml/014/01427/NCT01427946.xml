	<brief_summary>Study IPI-504-15 is a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of retaspimycin HCl (IPI-504) plus everolimus in patients with KRAS mutant Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1b/2 Study of Retaspimycin HCl (IPI-504) in Combination With Everolimus in KRAS Mutant Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase Ib/2 study of retaspimycin HCl (IPI-504) in combination with everolimus. The Phase 1b portion is to test the safety and tolerability of retaspimycin HCl (IPI-504) in combination with everolimus and determine the highest dose of retaspimycin HCl (IPI-504) and everolimus that can safely be given in combination. The Phase 2 portion of this study will continue the evaluation of safety of retaspimycin HCl (IPI-504) in combination with everolimus and compare the effect of the study drugs on tumor response and life expectancy in patients with KRAS mutant NSCLC.</detailed_description>
