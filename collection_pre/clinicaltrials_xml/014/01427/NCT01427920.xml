	<brief_summary>This trial was conducted in Asia, Europe and South America. The aim of this trial was to confirm efficacy of subject driven titration (individually adjusted) of biphasic insulin aspart 30 (BIAsp 30) twice daily in terms of glycaemic control assessed by change in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for a minimum of 12 months prior to Visit 1 (screening) Currently treated with a basal insulin analogue for at least 3 months prior to Visit 1 (screening) Stable treatment (no change in dose or regimen) with a total daily dose of at least 1500 mg metformin or maximum tolerated dose (minimum 1000 mg) Â± additional OAD treatment. The metformin treatment must have been stable for at least 2 months prior to Visit 1 (screening) HbA1c higher or equal to 7.0% and below or equal to 10.0% (one retest within one week of screening visit was allowed. The last sample was to be conclusive) Body Mass Index (BMI) below or equal to 40.0 kg/m^2 Able and willing to eat at least 2 main meals each day during the trial Able and willing to adhere to the protocol including compliance with performance of self measured plasma glucose (SMPG), injection regimen and titrating themselves according to the protocol Experience in performing self measured plasma glucose (SMPG) Treatment with any thiazolidinedione (TZD) and glucagonlike peptide1 (GLP1) receptor agonists or pramlintide within the last 3 months prior to Visit 1 (screening) Impaired hepatic function defined as alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) above or equal to 2.5 times upper referenced limit (one retest within one week of screening visit was allowed. The last sample was to be conclusive) Impaired kidney function with serum creatinine above or equal to 133 micromol/L (1.5 mg/dL) for males and above or equal to 124 micromol/L (1.4 mg/dL) for females (one retest within one week of screening visit was allowed. The last sample was to be conclusive) Cardiac problems or uncontrolled treated/untreated severe hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure higher or equal to 180 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure higher or equal to 100 mmHg) Previous use of premixed insulin products (premixed insulin analogues or premixed human preparations) or bolus insulin. Previous use of premixed or bolus insulin products was allowed only in case of hospitalisation or a severe condition requiring intermittent use of premixed or bolus insulin products for less than 14 consecutive days, but not during the last 3 months prior to screening visit (Visit 1)</criteria>
