	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if T2-18C3, a true human monoclonal antibody that blocks inflammation, is safe to use in patients with type 2 diabetes. The study will also be looking at the ability of T2-18C3 to improve control of blood sugar levels in diabetics by blocking inflammation in the pancreas.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of an Anti-Inflammatory Therapeutic Antibody (MABp1) in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a phase I, open label study of the safety and pharmacokinetics of T2-18C3 in patients with T2D. Nine patients will receive four biweekly IV infusions of the study drug, T2-18C3, at a dose level of 1.25 mg/kg. These patients will be followed for a total of 90 days to examine safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy.</detailed_description>
