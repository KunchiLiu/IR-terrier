	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of premedication drugs Atropin, Fentanyl and Mivacurium and of endotracheal intubation on cerebral oxygenation and cardiac output in term and preterm newborn infants. Two different protocols of premedication are compared.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence of Premedication Protocols for Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation on Cerebral Oxygenation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Influence of the following procedures will be examined: - Application of Atropin - Application of Fentanyl - Application of Mivacurium - possible desaturation and / or bradycardia during intubation attempts - restoration of arterial oxygen saturation and / or heart rate after succesful intubation We aim to examine the change of the following parameters by the use of electrical cardiometry: - stroke volume - cardiac output We compare two different premedication protocols and we evaluate the impact of these protocol on the time needed for intubation and on intubation difficulties .</detailed_description>
