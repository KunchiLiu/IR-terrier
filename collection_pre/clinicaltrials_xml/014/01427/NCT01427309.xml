	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of Fluzone High-Dose compared to standard dose Fluzone for laboratory-confirmed or culture-confirmed influenza caused by influenza types/subtypes that are similar (for laboratory-confirmed) or antigenically similar (for culture-confirmed) to those contained in the respective annual vaccine formulations. Primary Objective: - To compare the clinical efficacy of Fluzone High-Dose to that of Fluzone in elderly adults, with respect to laboratory-confirmed influenza caused by any influenza viral types/subtypes, associated with the occurrence of a protocol-defined influenza-like-illnesses (ILI). Secondary Objectives: - To compare the clinical efficacy of Fluzone High-Dose to that of Fluzone in elderly adults, with respect to laboratory-confirmed influenza, caused by any influenza viral types/subtypes, associated with the occurrence of a protocol-defined ILI. - To compare the clinical efficacy of Fluzone High-Dose to that of Fluzone in elderly adults, with respect to culture-confirmed influenza, caused by any influenza viral types/subtypes, associated with the occurrence of a protocol-defined ILI. - To compare the clinical efficacy of Fluzone High-Dose to that of Fluzone in elderly adults, with respect to culture-confirmed influenza caused by viral types/subtypes antigenically similar to those contained in the respective annual vaccine formulations, associated with the occurrence of a modified Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-defined ILI. - To compare the clinical efficacy of Fluzone High-Dose to that of Fluzone in elderly adults, with respect to culture-confirmed influenza caused by any influenza viral types/subtypes, associated with the occurrence of a modified CDC-defined ILI. - To compare the clinical efficacy of Fluzone High-Dose to that of Fluzone in elderly adults, with respect to culture-confirmed influenza caused by viral types/subtypes antigenically similar to those contained in the respective annual vaccine formulations, associated with the occurrence of a respiratory illness. - To compare the clinical efficacy of Fluzone High-Dose to that of Fluzone in elderly adults, with respect to culture-confirmed influenza caused by any influenza viral types/subtypes, associated with the occurrence of a respiratory illness.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Fluzone® High-Dose Vaccine Compared With Fluzone® Vaccine In Elderly Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial will span 2 influenza seasons. Each study year, participants will be randomized to receive one dose of either Fluzone® High-Dose or Fluzone® vaccine prior to the start of the influenza season and will be followed until the end of each season. The duration of each participant's participation in the respective study year will be 6 to 8 months, depending on the time of enrollment.</detailed_description>

If this contraindication exists, vaccination will be deferred until the individual has been medically stable and/or afebrile (temperature ≤ 99.0 ºF [≤ 37.2ºC]) for at least 24 hours Signs and symptoms of an acute infectious respiratory illness. If this exists, vaccination will be deferred until the symptoms resolve.</criteria>
