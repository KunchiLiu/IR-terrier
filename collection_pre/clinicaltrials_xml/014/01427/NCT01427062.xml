	<brief_summary>Falling is a complex and most disabling feature for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous studies suggested that falls in patients with PD are related to postural instability characterized by deficits in anticipatory postural adjustment (APA) for postural orientation in walking and standing and inadequate postural response to perturbation. The present study developed an innovative balance treatment with focus of anticipatory and compensatory postural control and examined its effects on enhancing balance and gait performance and decreasing fall rate in people with PD.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects of an Innovative Balance Training Programme in Enhancing Postural Control and Reducing Falls in Patients With Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants: Forty-two eligible subjects with PD were randomly allocated into balance with focus of anticipatory and compensatory postural control (EXP) or control (CON) group with strength-focused training, with 26 subjects in each group. Methods: Subjects in the EXP group were trained the speed and amplitude of anticipatory postural adjustment during stepping and walking and postural response to perturbation during walking. Subjects In the CON group were trained to improve the strength of lower limb muscles. Treatment period in both groups lasted for 12 weeks, which consisted of 4-week laboratory-based training (phase 1), 4-week home-based exercise (phase 2) and final 4-week laboratory-based training (phase 3). Outcome measures included reaction time(RT), movement velocity (MV) and endpoint excursion (EPE) of limit-of-stability test, one-leg-stance (OLS) time, gait velocity, stride length (SL), cadence, and fall rate. All tests were conducted for 6 time intervals including baseline, after each training phase, at 3-month follow-up and at 12-month follow-up.</detailed_description>
