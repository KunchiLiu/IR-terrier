	<brief_summary>Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is the common and effective procedure for treatment of end-staged knee osteoarthritis. Postoperative alignment of TKA is one of the important factors which effects on survival of prosthesis. High percentage of misalignment has been reported in conventional technique with using the jig based instruments. Several methods and devices were established to solve this problem. Customized or patient matched instruments were the novel technology that made from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of lower limb. With using special software to calculate the alignment axis, it was thought that accurate alignment can be achieved by using this instruments. Therefore, the study aimed to compare the accuracy of MRI based patient matched instruments and jig based instruments in TKA.</brief_summary>
