	<brief_summary>The objectives of this study are 1) To evaluate the feasibility and acute side effects of proton therapy for chordomas and chondrosarcomas and 2) To evaluate clinical outcomes and long term side effects of proton beam radiation for treatment of chordomas and chondrosarcomas.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proton Radiation for Chordomas and Chondrosarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial will be conducted in two phases: a feasibility then a phase II trial. Once feasibility and safety are established in the first 12 pts. the phase II study will begin. Proton therapy at standard doses is not known to improve clinical outcome but will likely reduce fatigue and toxicity.</detailed_description>

Adequate bone marrow function: WBC ≥ 4000/mm3, platelets ≥ 100, 000mm3 Women of childbearing potential as long as she agrees to use a recognized method of birth control (e.g. oral contraceptive , IUD, condoms or other barrier methods etc.) Hysterectomy or menopause must be clinically documented. Tumors arising in the skull and spine. Prior or simultaneous malignancies within the past two years (other than cutaneous squamous or basal cell carcinoma, melanoma in situ or thyroid carcinoma) Patients with the following histologies are excluded: melanoma , other soft tissue or bony sarcomas, giant cell tumor aneurismal bone cyst or metastatic lesions from other histologies. Pregnant women. Actively being treated on any other therapeutic research study. Tumors arising outside of the CNS.</criteria>
