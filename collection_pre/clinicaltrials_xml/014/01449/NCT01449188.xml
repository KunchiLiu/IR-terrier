	<brief_summary>Ondansetron, also known as Zofran, is a marketed compound used for the prevention of nausea and vomiting. This study, called a thorough QT study, will characterize the effects of a single intravenous (IV) dose of ondansetron on cardiac repolarization as compared to placebo. Moxifloxacin, a commercially available antibiotic known to cause a mild QT prolongation, will be used as a positive control and will be given orally. The cardiac repolarization will be measured by taking consecutive ECGs on a recording device known as a Holter monitor and measuring the QT interval at specified times. In addition, blood samples will also be taken at specified times and will be used to measure the amount of study medication in the body.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>To Investigate the Effect of Intravenous Ondansetron on Cardiac Conduction as Compared to Placebo and Moxifloxacin in Healthy Adult Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ondansetron was first approved in 1991 for treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy and surgical procedures and as ondansetron was developed prior to current regulatory requirements, a formal, thorough QT study has not been performed for this compound. The purpose of this study is to further define the safety of ondansetron as some effects on QT interval prolongation have been observed for this and other members of the 5-HT3 inhibitor class of compounds. In the case of ondansetron, these effects have been rare and transient and noted primarily with IV administration, however, the extent to which ondansetron prolongs the QT interval has not been defined. This study will quantify the effects of a single dose of IV ondansetron administered over 15 minutes on cardiac conduction in a double-blind, cross-over study and compared to placebo and a positive control, oral moxifloxacin. Pre- and post-dose digital electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be obtained by continuous Holter monitoring (1000 Hz) for blinded over-read by a third party vendor. This double-blind study will randomize approximately 60 healthy adult male and female volunteers to one of 12 sequences each consisting of 4 study treatment periods in a crossover design with a 7-day washout between each treatment period. Subjects will receive placebo, moxifloxacin (single 400 mg tablet), ondansetron 8 mg, and ondansetron 32 mg based on the randomized sequence. Both ondansetron and the placebo for ondansetron will be administered intravenously over 15 minutes. Moxifloxacin, a drug known to cause mild QTc prolongation, is included as a positive control and will be dosed as open label. Serial blood samples will be obtained to determine ondansetron and, if needed, moxifloxacin pharmacokinetic parameters. Safety and tolerability will be assessed through physical exams, adverse events, concurrent medications, clinical laboratory tests and vital signs.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Healthy adult men and women, nonsmokers between 18 and 45 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent. Every effort will be made to enrol an approximately equal number of males and females. Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. Healthy as judged by a responsible physician, with no clinically significant abnormality identified on the medical or laboratory evaluation performed at Screening, including 12lead ECG. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for this age group may be included only with the approval of the GSK medical monitor. ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%). A female is eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is of: Nonchildbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant), including any female who either has had a hysterectomy or has had a bilateral oophorectomy (ovariectomy) or is postmenopausal defined as being amenorrhoeic for greater than or equal to 1 year with an appropriate clinical profile, e.g., age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms. Folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) must be greater than or equal to 40 mIU/mL to confirm the postmenopausal state. If a female is of childbearing potential, has a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening, and agrees to or has undergone one of the following: Complete abstinence from sexual intercourse from 2 weeks prior to administration of the study drug until completion of the followup procedures, or, bilateral tubal ligation, or have a vasectomized partner or use an intrauterine device with published data showing that expected failure rate is less than 1% per year (e.g., GynaeFix) from 2 weeks prior to administration of study drug until completion of the followup procedures, or, use doublebarrier method [condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) used with spermicidal foam/gel/cream/suppository]. Body Mass Index (BMI)* in the range of 19 30 kg/m2 (inclusive). *[BMI = weight [kg]/(height [m])2] Cardiac conduction abnormalities denoted by any of the following at screening: QTc interval &gt; 450 msec; PR interval &gt; 240 msec or less than or equal to 110 msec; evidence of second or thirddegree atrioventricular (AV) block; pathological Qwaves (defined as Qwave &gt; 40 msec or depth greater than 0.4 0.5 mV); evidence of ventricular preexcitation; electrocardiographic evidence of complete left bundle branch block, right bundle branch block (RBBB), incomplete LBBB; intraventricular conduction delay with QRS duration &gt; 120 msec; bradycardia as defined by sinus rate &lt; 50 bpm.
