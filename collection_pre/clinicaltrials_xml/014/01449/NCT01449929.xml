	<brief_summary>This study will be conducted in approximately 468 HIV-1 infected antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve subjects. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive dolutegravir (DTG) 50 mg once daily (approximately 234 subjects) or darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) 800 mg/100 mg once daily (approximately 234 subjects), each in combination with fixed-dose dual nucleoside reverse transriptase inhibitor (NRTI) therapy (either abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) or tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC). Subjects will be stratified by screening HIV-1 RNA and background NRTI selection. The primary analysis will take place after the last subject completes 48 weeks on therapy; an additional analysis will be conducted after the last subject completes Week 96 on study.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>ING114915 is a Phase IIIb randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicentre, parallel group, fully-powered non-inferiority study. The study will be conducted in approximately 468 HIV-1 infected ART-naïve subjects. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive DTG 50 mg once daily (approximately 234 subjects) or DRV/r 800 mg/100 mg once daily (approximately 234 subjects), each in combination with fixed-dose dual NRTI therapy (either ABC/3TC or TDF/FTC). The primary analysis will take place after the last subject completes 48 weeks on therapy; an additional analysis will be conducted after the last subject completes Week 96 on study. Subjects who fulfil eligibility requirements will be randomized 1:1 to receive DTG 50 mg once daily or DRV/r 800 mg/100 mg once daily. In order to achieve balance across the two treatment groups of the study, randomization will be stratified by: screening plasma HIV-1 RNA &gt;/ 100,000 copies/mL (c/mL) or &gt; 100,000 c/mL and background dual NRTI (ABC/3TC or TDF/FTC) The DTG and DRV/r doses will be administered in an open-label fashion throughout the study. Subjects randomized to receive DTG and who successfully complete 96 weeks of treatment will continue to have access to DTG until either it is locally approved and commercially available, the patient no longer derives clinical benefit, the patient meets a protocol-defined reason for discontinuation or until development of DTG is terminated. Subjects randomized to the DRV/r arm will receive DRV/r through their Week 96 visit, after which they will be discontinued from the study and will need to make alternative arrangements to access antiretroviral medication. All subjects will receive background dual-NRTI therapy through their Week 96 visit.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>HIV1 infected adults greater than or equal to 18 years of age. Females are eligible to enter and participate in the study if she is (1) nonchildbearing potential, (2) child bearing potential with negative pregnancy test at screening and Day 1 and agrees to use protocolspecified methods of birth control while on study. HIV1 infection with a screening plasma HIV1 RNA greater than or equal to 1000copies/mL Antiretroviralnaïve (less than or equal to 10 days of prior therapy with any antiretroviral agent following a diagnosis of HIV1 infection) Signed and dated written informed consent is obtained from the subject or the subject's legal representative prior to screening Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding Any evidence of an active Centers for Disease and Prevention Control (CDC) Category C disease [CDC, 1993], except cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma not requiring systemic therapy Subjects with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Class B or C) as determined by ChildPugh classification Anticipated need for Hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy during the study History or presence of allergy or intolerance to the study drugs or their components or drugs of their class History of malignancy within the past 5 years or ongoing malignancy other than cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma, basal cell carcinoma, or resected, noninvasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma; other localized malignancies require agreement between the investigator and the Study medical monitor for inclusion of the subject Treatment with an HIV1 immunotherapeutic vaccine within 90 days of Screening Treatment with any of the following agents within 28 days of Screening: radiation therapy; cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents; any immunomodulators Treatment with any agent, except recognized ART as allowed above, with documented activity against HIV1 in vitro within 28 days of first dose of investigational product Exposure to an experimental drug or experimental vaccine within either 28 days, 5 halflives of the test agent, or twice the duration of the biological effect of the test agent, whichever is longer, prior to the first dose of investigational product Any evidence of primary viral resistance based on the presence of any major resistanceassociated mutation [IASUSA, 2010] in the Screening result or, if known, any historical resistance test result Any verified Grade 4 laboratory abnormality. Any acute laboratory abnormality at Screening, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude the subject's participation in the study of an investigational compound is exclusionary Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal ALT greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal and bilirubin greater than or equal to 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (with greater than 35% direct bilirubin) Subject has creatinine clearance of less than 50 mL/min via CockroftGault method Recent history (less than or equal to 3 months) of any upper or lower gastrointestinal bleed, with the exception of anal or rectal bleeding</criteria>
