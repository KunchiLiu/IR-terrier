	<brief_summary>To test the efficacy of a 0.7 mg intravitreal dexamethasone implant (Ozurdex®) on macular function and recalcitrant macular edema associated with retinal vein occlusion following treatment with 2 or more prior intravitreal anti-VEGF drug injections.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of an Intravitreal DEX Implant in Retinal Vein Occlusion Following Treatment With Anti-VEGF Injections.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The efficacy of the DEX implant on macular edema for RVO is well established in multiple clinical trials. However, the duration and frequency of re-treatment have not been extensively explored. In addition, no prior studies have tested the efficacy of the DEX implant on retinal and macular function using diagnostic testing measurements such as multi-focal ERG, microperimetry and RAM testing. Since VA and OCT outcomes do not always correlate, these other assessments (mf-ERG, microperimetry, RAM testing) may be useful as early predictors of when or if patients should be retreated. This study will assess 2 groups (0.7mg PRN and 0.7mg Q16 weeks) and assess high resolution OCT, RAM testing, microperimetry, and Multi-focal ERG outcomes. For the PRN group retreated based on any fluid on OCT, we will investigate if microperimetry or multifocal ERG changes would have been an earlier predictor of fluid returning.</detailed_description>
