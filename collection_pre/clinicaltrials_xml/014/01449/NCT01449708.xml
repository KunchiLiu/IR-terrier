	<brief_summary>Morbidly obese patients are at high risk for Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV) after surgery and general anesthesia. The results of our observational study indicate that 42.7% of patients require medication to treat PONV in the first 24 hours after bariatric surgery despite our aggressive perioperative approach with triple prophylaxis. Common risk factors for PONV are the use of intraoperative narcotics and anesthetic gases. Preliminary results of multimodal postoperative analgesia in the first 24 hours lead to a reduction of narcotic consumption, desaturations and use of antiemetic medication. Our study hypothesis is that different types of anesthetics reduce PONV further. Patient would be randomly assigned to receive either our current intraoperative management or a narcotic free, total intravenous general anesthetic (TIVA). The investigators hope to improve patients' satisfaction by reducing PONV in the postoperative period.</brief_summary>
