	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is whether an inspiratory muscle training protocol would be associated with an improvement in of the diaphragm mobility, an increase in pulmonary function values , gain strength and endurance of respiratory muscles and improving quality of life.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Influence of Inspiratory Muscular Training (IMT) on Diaphragmatic Mobility in Morbidly Obese</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Few studies have investigated the effects of an inspiratory muscle training in obese patients on the diaphragmatic mobility and thickness. Obesity, especially morbid, triggers changes in the respiratory system, which can affect the work activities and daily life of individuals with this multifactorial syndrome. These functional changes in mechanical ventilation may be linked to weakness and poor respiratory muscle strength, so by promoting rehabilitation of these muscles can minimize the losses that come with obesity</detailed_description>
