	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of the Adductor-Canal-Blockade versus the femoral nerve block versus placebo on muscle strength in healthy volunteers. The investigators hypothesize that the Adductor-Canal-Blockade results in a lesser reduction of the quadriceps muscle strength compared to the femoral nerve block.</brief_summary>
