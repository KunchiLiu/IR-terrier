	<brief_summary>The purpose of Reduce IDentified UNcontrolled Asthma (RIDUNA) is to determine the benefit of real-time identification of uncontrolled asthma by electronic administrative records linked to real-time notification of uncontrolled status to patients and asthma specialists with recommended guideline directed intervention by physicians. The investigators hypothesize that real-time outreach following National guideline asthma care recommendations, after real-time identification of an uncontrolled asthma event in persistent asthmatics on inhaled corticosteroids will lead to better improvements in asthma control (impairment and risk) compared to standard asthma care outreach.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Co-primary Objectives: Determine the effectiveness of real-time identification administratively of uncontrolled asthma and real-time outreach administratively to optimize National asthma care guideline implementation compared to standard KP asthma outreach to improve asthma control (subsequent asthma impairment and risk, separately). Hypothesis 1: Real-time notification of uncontrolled asthma status to asthma specialists and patients compared to standard Kaiser Permanente (KP) asthma outreach will reduce subsequent asthma impairment and risk, separately. Hypothesis 2: Real-time notification of uncontrolled asthma status to asthma specialists and patients compared to standard KP asthma outreach will increase the proportion of patients who receive step-up care for impairment and risk. Hypothesis 3: The real-time notification of uncontrolled asthma status to asthma specialists and patients compared to standard KP asthma outreach will lead to increased step-up care that will reduce subsequent asthma impairment and risk. Hypothesis 4: Specific demographic characteristics (older age, female gender, non-Hispanic white ethnicity, higher census block education/income level) will be associated with a differential response in the intervention group. Study Objectives: 1. Determine whether real-time notification of uncontrolled asthma status to asthma specialists and patients compared to standard KP asthma outreach will reduce subsequent asthma impairment and risk, separately. 2: Determine whether real-time notification of uncontrolled asthma status to asthma specialists and patients compared to standard KP asthma outreach will increase the proportion of patients who receive step-up care for impairment and risk. 3: Determine whether the real-time notification of uncontrolled asthma status to asthma specialists and patients will lead to increased step-up care that will reduce subsequent asthma impairment and risk compared to standard KP asthma outreach. 4: Determine whether there exist specific demographic characteristics (older age, female gender, non-Hispanic white ethnicity, higher census block education/income level) that are associated with a greater differential efficacy in the intervention group. 5. Determine in an exploratory analysis the frequency, characteristics (demographic, asthma severity, prior health care utilization, etc) and clinical outcomes (impairment and risk) of patients placed on omalizumab step-up therapy.</detailed_description>
