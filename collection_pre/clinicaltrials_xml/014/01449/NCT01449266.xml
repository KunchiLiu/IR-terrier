	<brief_title>Safety and Dialysability of Dotarem® in Dialysed Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ten adult patients suffering from end stage renal failure and requiring hemodialysis treatment for 3 times were enrolled. Patients received a single dose of Dotarem® at 0.1 mmol/kg before being submitted to hemodialysis to assess the dialysability of Dotarem® . After injection of Dotarem®, 3 sessions of hemodialysis were performed as follows: The first hemodialysis session started between 1 to 2 h after the injection; The second hemodialysis session occurred 2 days (i.e., 48 ± 2 h) after the Dotarem® injection; The third hemodialysis session occurred 4 days (i.e., 96 ± 4 h) after the Dotarem® injection. The decrease in serum Dotarem® concentration was assessed after each hemodialysis session. Safety assessments included adverse events (AEs), vital signs, injection-site tolerance, and laboratory assessments.Two safety follow-up visits were performed: one 3 weeks (± 2 days) and one 3 months (± 4 days) after the Dotarem® injection.</detailed_description>
