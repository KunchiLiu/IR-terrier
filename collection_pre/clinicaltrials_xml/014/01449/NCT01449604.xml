	<brief_title>Stereotactic Radiation in Vestibular Schwannoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vestibular schwannomas (VSs) are slow-growing tumors of the myelin-forming cells that cover cranial nerve VIII.The treatment options for patients with VSs include active observation, surgical management, and radiotherapy. However, the optimal treatment choice remain controversial. Over the past 10 years, there has been rapid progress in the application of stereotactic radiotherapy to the treatment of VSs. The stereotactic radiotherapy program includes single fraction radiosurgery (SRS) and hypofraction stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT) are commonly used for VSs treatment. Since SRS and SRT techniques differ significantly enough to raise questions of therapeutic advantage and until now, there is no prospective, randomized study comparing the outcomes for patients treated using both radiotherapy techniques. We designed the first prospective randomized protocol to compare SRS and SRT for answer this question.</detailed_description>
