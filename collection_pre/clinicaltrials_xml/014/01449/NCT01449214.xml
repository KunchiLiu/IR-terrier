	<brief_summary>Thoracic epidural analgesia and anesthesia are effective in improving the quality of intraoperative and postoperative pain relief during thoracic and abdominal surgical procedures. Conventional epidural techniques have significant limitations. Due to the anatomic characteristics of the thoracic versus the lumbar intervertebral spaces, the insertion requires a more technically challenging paramedian approach. The safety and feasibility of bedside ultrasonography for the lumbar spine has already been established and it proves to be a valuable tool for neuraxial anesthesia in obstetric anesthesia</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasound-Guided Technique for Thoracic Epidural Insertion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>â€¢ The feasibility and the reliability of US imaging for the thoracic spine has been proven by comparing the findings of ultrasound scans to MRI measurements, which is the standard imaging technique for the depiction of the spine. Pre-puncture US assessment may contribute to the safety and efficacy of the thoracic epidural technique. The purpose of this study is to compare the ultrasound-guided thoracic epidural insertion technique with the conventional anatomic landmarking technique of contacting bone and walking-off the lamina</detailed_description>
