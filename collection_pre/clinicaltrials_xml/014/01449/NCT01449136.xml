	<brief_summary>Dental materials with antibacterial properties can prevent the harmful effects caused by oral cariogenic bacteria. This double-blind controlled clinical trial evaluated the performance of antibacterial cement for sealing infected dentin in atraumatic restorations of primary molars.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of Antibacterial Cement in Infected Dentin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study enrolled 45 children (45 teeth) between 5 and 8 years of age, of both genders, divided into two groups. In group A (GA; n=22), the cavities were lined with conventional glass ionomer cement (Vidrion F®) and in group B (GB; n=23), with antibacterial cement (Vidrion F® containing 1% each of metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, and cefaclor). Both groups were restored with Ketac Molar Easymix®. Molars with carious lesions on the inner half of dentin without clinical or radiographic pulp damage were selected. Patients were evaluated clinically (for pain, fistulas, or mobility) and radiographically (area of caries, periapical region, and furcation of teeth) after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.</detailed_description>
