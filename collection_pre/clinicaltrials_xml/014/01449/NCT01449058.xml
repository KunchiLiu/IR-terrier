	<brief_summary>This is a multi-center, open-label, dose-finding, phase Ib study to estimate the maximum tolerated dose(s) (MTD(s)) and/or recommended dose(s) for expansion (RDE(s)) for the orally administered combination of BYL719 and MEK162. This combination will be explored in adult patients with advanced CRC, esophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, NSCLC, ovarian cancer, or other advanced solid tumors and in adult patients with AML or high risk and very high risk MDS, with documented RAS or BRAF mutations. Dose escalation will be guided by a Bayesian logistic regression model with overdose control. At MTD or RDE, four expansion arms will be opened in order to further assess the safety and preliminary activity of the combination of BYL719 and MEK162 in specific patient populations.</brief_summary>
