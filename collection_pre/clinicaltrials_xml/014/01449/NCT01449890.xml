	<brief_title>Randomized Trial of Depression Follow-up Care by Email</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression belongs to the most prevalent mental disorders and often goes along with a high burden of disease. Although the efficacy and the effectiveness of psychological treatments for depressive disorders have been demonstrated, there remains the problem of maintaining the benefits achieved during the initial treatment phase. Therefore options of follow-up care have to be considered. Since access to psychotherapeutic treatments is limited and costly, internet-based interventions can offer a feasible opportunity for follow-up care in order to enhance the long-term effectiveness of psychotherapy.</detailed_description>
