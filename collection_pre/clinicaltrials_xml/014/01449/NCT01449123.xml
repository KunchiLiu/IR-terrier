	<brief_summary>The primary objective in this pilot study is to explore if asthma patients prescribed fixed dose combinations (budenosid/formoterol (Symbicort®), salmeterol/fluticasone (Seretide®), beclometasone/formoterol (Innovair®) are optimal treated regarding the mannitol challenge test and the following reversibility test. The primary endpoint is to identify asthma patients responding positive or negative to the mannitol challenge test and/or the reversibility test. The hypothesis is that not all patients are well treated.</brief_summary>
