	<brief_summary>Resveratrol can exhibit benefits against cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) although the cardioprotective role of resveratrol as part of the human diet is not yet clear. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a resveratrol-enriched grape extract (Stilvid) in 150 patients from both primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention. All the patients are gold-standard medicated (statins and others). A number of cardiovascular risk and safety markers will be evaluated after consuming 1 cap/day for 6 months and 2 caps/day for 6 additional months (total 12 months).</brief_summary>
