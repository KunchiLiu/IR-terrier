	<brief_summary>This study is the first to develop and test in a randomized experimental design the efficacy of an integrated 12-step facilitation intervention tailored for young people. In the first phase of the study, the investigators are developing and revising a preliminary manual for the two sessions individually-delivered Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET) component and subsequent 8 session group-delivered Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) component which will integrate Twelve-step Facilitation (TSF). Forty adolescents each will complete the preliminary integrated TSF protocol. In the second phase of the study, the investigators will compare integrated TSF (iTSF) to standard treatment (MET/CBT) in a randomized experimental design for adolescent substance use disorder with 60 adolescents. As a result, the investigators will examine potential mechanisms that may underlie the efficacy of iTSF in improving alcohol and other drug use outcomes. The investigators will test group differences on potential mechanisms of change (e.g., Alcoholics Anonymous/Narcotics Anonymous attendance and involvement) and whether these variables are associated with substance use outcomes.</brief_summary>
