	<brief_summary>Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cause of death and a major cause of hospital admissions for acute chest pain. In spite of improved treatments still many patients with CAD have daily attacks of severe chest pain and severely reduced life quality. The investigators have established a double-blind placebo-controlled trial in patients with CAD to test efficacy and safety of treatment with adipose derived stem cells to improve perfusion in the heart muscle and exercise capacity, and reduce the patient's symptoms.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In an open single centre pilot study we have evaluated the safety and efficacy of MSC treatment to improve heart muscle perfusion in patients with chronic CAD. Patients treated with MSCs had significant increased exercise capacity, reduction in angina, angina attacks and medication and in life quality at 6 months follow-up. For all the parameters there was a tendency towards improved outcome with increasing number of cells. The treatment with MSCs was safe. The investigators have now established a double-blind placebo-controlled trial in patients with CAD to test efficacy and safety of treatment with MSCs to improve perfusion in the heart muscle and exercise capacity, and reduce the patient's symptoms.</detailed_description>
