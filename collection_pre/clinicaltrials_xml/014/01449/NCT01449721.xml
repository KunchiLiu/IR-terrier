	<brief_title>Preemptive Resuscitation for Eradication of Septic Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sepsis is a challenging and elusive entity with a high mortality rate. As a syndrome, clinicians are challenged to distinguish individuals with systemic infection warranting further interventions from lower severity patients. Sepsis is now recognized as a time-sensitive emergency, as patients stand the best chance for survival when effective therapeutic interventions are delivered as early as possible. Recent data has shown that in-hospital disease progression from sepsis to septic shock is associated with a higher risk of morbidity and mortality than those with shock on initial presentation. Yet, even when identified and treated with early aggressive interventions, the development of septic shock is still associated with a mortality rate of 25-40%. Although the presence of sustained arterial hypotension or serum lactate elevation (&gt;4.0 mmol/L) are the currently recommended threshold to define the presence of overt shock and the need for aggressive resuscitation, the investigators have shown that, in patients with systemic infection, a moderate lactate elevation (2.0-3.9 mmol/L) is a common occurrence and an important warning sign for the increased risk of disease progression and death. Sepsis with an elevated lactate between 2.0-3.9, referred to as the "PRE-SHOCK" state, identifies this population of patients at-risk for poor outcome. Current guidelines for sepsis management do not recommend any specific resuscitation measures or therapies for this at-risk population. This study marks the first in a series of investigations addressing the PRE-SHOCK population to further define the adverse events within this cohort and to investigate novel interventions to improve outcomes. The investigators hypothesize that an early quantitative resuscitation strategy using a protocol-directed IV fluid resuscitation will result in a significant reduction in the development of worsening organ failure (including shock) and mortality compared to standard care.</detailed_description>
