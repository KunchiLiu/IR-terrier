	<brief_summary>Extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX, VIVITROL) is an FDA-approved medication with efficacy in treating alcohol dependence and prevention of relapse to opioid dependence. It has shown promise in reducing relapse to amphetamine use among amphetamine-dependent, yet currently amphetamine-abstinent heterosexuals. The investigators will expand upon this promising work to determine whether monthly intramuscular injections of naltrexone will reduce methamphetamine (meth) use among actively using, meth-dependent men who have sex with men (MSM) in this double-blind randomized controlled trial of extended-release naltrexone versus placebo. The investigators will focus on MSM because of the disproportionate and intertwining epidemics of meth use and HIV in this population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Extended-Release Naltrexone to Treat Methamphetamine Dependence in Men Who Have Sex With Men (MSM)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will enroll 100 sexually active, meth-dependent MSM who will be randomized 1:1 to receive monthly injections of extended-release naltrexone (n=50) or placebo (n=50) for 12 weeks at weeks 0, 4, and 8. Study participants will be seen weekly at our site at the HIV Prevention Section of the San Francisco Department of Public Health, where they will provide urine for drug testing and participate in substance use counseling. All participants will receive HIV risk-reduction counseling. Behavior will be assessed using standardized measures via audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI).</detailed_description>
