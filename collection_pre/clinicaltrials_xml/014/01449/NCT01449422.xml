	<brief_summary>The main objective of this trial is to demonstrate that a local care strategy using URGO 310 3082 dressing is not inferior to a reference therapeutic strategy using a hydrofibre dressing in the management of venous ulcers. This non-inferiority hypothesis will be judged on the planimetric relative regression of the wound surface area after six weeks of treatment.</brief_summary>
