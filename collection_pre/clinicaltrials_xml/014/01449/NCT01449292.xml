CT scan: Presence of any of the following radiologic abnormalities: 1. Pulmonary nodule on CT scan greater than 1.0 cm in diameter 2. Radiologic picture consistent with active pulmonary infection 3. Significant interstitial lung disease 4. Significant pleural disease 5. Giant bullous disease 7. Clinically significant asthma 8. Clinically significant bronchiectasis 9. Pulmonary hypertension 10. Allergy or sensitivity to medications required to safely perform AeriSeal System treatment under general anesthesia or conscious (moderate procedural) sedation 11. Participation in an investigational study of a drug, biologic, or device not currently approved for marketing 12. Body mass index &lt; 15 kg/m2 or &gt; 35 kg/m2 13. Female patient pregnant or breastfeeding or planning to be pregnant in the next year 14. Any abnormal screening laboratory test result 15. Significant comorbidity including any of the following: 1. HIV/AIDs 2. Active malignancy 3. Stroke or TIA within 12 months 4. Myocardial infarction within 12 months 5. Congestive heart failure within 12 months 16. Any condition that would interfere with the intent of the study or would make participation not in the best interest of the patient such as alcoholism, high risk for drug abuse or noncompliance in returning for followup visits</criteria>
