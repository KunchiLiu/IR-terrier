	<brief_summary>During thyroid surgery the laryngeal recurrent nerves (and for this reason the voice quality) are at risk. Therefore intra operative continuous neuromonitoring could help to prevent harm to these nerves. Electromyographic data (EMG values) are collected during surgery (1). In the postoperative follow-up period detailed voice analysis is performed (2): subjective auditive perceptive evaluation and videostroboscopy. Analysis and comparison of (1) and (2) will be performed in order to find out if we can find a predictive correlation between the EMG data (1) and the voice quality (2).</brief_summary>
