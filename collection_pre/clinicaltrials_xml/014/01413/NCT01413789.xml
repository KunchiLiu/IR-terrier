	<brief_summary>Study hypothesis: Is Alhydran gel-cream as efficient as silicone gel for skin occlusion and hydration? For this study 16 volunteers and ten patients with healed full thickness burns will be included. After a short period of acclimatization four test areas will be determined. For healthy volunteers the standard zones are located on the inner forearm, two on each forearm. For patients with healed burns the 4 test zones are located on either the healed donor site or the healed skin grafted area. In each test zone baseline measurements will be taken before application of the products.After application of the three silicone gels and the hydrating gel cream the trans epidermal water loss (TEWL) and the moisture content of the stratum corneum will be measured by using the TEWAmeter®TM300 and the Corneometer® CM825 (Courage &amp; Khazaka).</brief_summary>
