	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of POL6326 for Mobilization/Transplant of Sibling Donor in Patients With Hematologic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current protocols use G-CSF to mobilize hematopoietic progenitor cells from matched sibling donors. This process requires from four to six days of G-CSF injection and is associated with significant morbidity, most notably bone pain. POL6326 is associated with few side effects and collection of cells occurs on the same day as POL6326 administration. This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of this novel agent for hematopoietic progenitor cell mobilization and allogeneic transplantation based on the following hypotheses: 1. Donors mobilized with intravenous POL6326 will require fewer collections than have previously been seen for donors mobilized with subcutaneous plerixafor. 2. Healthy HLA-matched donors receiving one or two infusions of POL6326 will mobilize sufficient CD34+ cells (at least 2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg recipient weights) following leukapheresis to support a hematopoietic cell transplant. 3. IV POL6326 will result in more rapid kinetics and a higher maximum (peak) of human CD34+ stem cells mobilized from human normal allogeneic donors compared to previous donors who were mobilized with plerixafor. 4. The hematopoietic cells mobilized by IV POL6326 will be functional and will result in prompt and durable hematopoietic engraftment following transplantation into HLA-identical siblings with advanced hematological malignancies using various non-myeloablative and myeloablative conditioning regimens and regimens for routine GVHD prophylaxis.</detailed_description>

Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician immediately. Donor must demonstrate ability to be compliant with study regimen. Donor must be able to understand and willing to sign an IRB approved written informed consent document. Recipient Inclusion Criteria Recipient must have available the successful collection of a POL62326 mobilized product. Recipient must be 18 to 75 years of age inclusive. Recipient must have a 6/6 HLAmatched sibling willing to donate PBSC for transplant. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician immediately. Recipient must have one of the following diagnoses: Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in 1st or subsequent remission Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in 1st or subsequent remission Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) NonHodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) or Hodgkin's disease (HD) in 2nd or greater complete remission, partial remission Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) Multiple myeloma (MM) Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) Myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) Recipient must have adequate cardiac function with a left ventricular ejection fraction &gt; 40%.

Recipient must have adequate hepatic function as defined by a total bilirubin &lt;3x upper limit of normal or absence of hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis. Recipient must have adequate neurologic function as defined by NO evidence of a severe central or peripheral neurologic abnormality. Patients with a history of previous CNS tumor involvement are eligible provided they are without symptoms or signs and the CNS is now free of disease on lumbar puncture and CT scan of the brain.

Donor Exclusion Criteria Donor must not have an active infection at the time of study entry. Donor must not have active alcohol or substance abuse within 6 months of study entry. Donor must not be currently enrolled on another investigational agent study. Donor must not have any medical condition, which, in the opinion of the clinical investigator, would interfere with his/her evaluation. Donor must not have an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.
