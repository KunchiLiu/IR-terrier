	<brief_summary>Trichuris suis ova (TSO) is a probiotic treatment based on the hygiene hypothesis, that has proven safe and effective in autoimmune inflammatory bowel disease. Clinical trails indicate that helminth infections have an immunomodulatory effect in multiple sclerosis as well. Investigators hypothesize that TSOÂ® 2500 eggs given oral every 2 weeks for 12 months is - due to its immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory effect - in recurrent remittent multiple sclerosis and clinically isolated syndrome significantly more effective than an oral placebo treatment as assed by new T2 lesions in cerebral magnetic resonance imaging and clinical examination.</brief_summary>
