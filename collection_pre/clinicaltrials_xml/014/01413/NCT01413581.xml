	<brief_title>Comparison of rhBSSL With Placebo When Added to Infant Formula or Pasteurized Breast Milk During 4 Weeks of Treatment in Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that rhBSSL improves growth in preterm infants as compared with placebo. The infants should be born before week 32 of gestational age. The study drug, rhBSSL or placebo, will be administered during a 4 week treatment period by adding it to either infant formula or pasteurized breast milk. The study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of rhBSSL. Eligible patients will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1 (rhBSSL:placebo). The study consists of maximum 1 week screening period, a 4-week treatment period and a 2 year follow-up period.</detailed_description>

Preterm infant whose enteral feeding consists of only infant formula or only pasteurized breast milk at the time of inclusion, and who are expected to remain on only infant formula for 4 weeks, or only pasteurized breast milk for at least 2 weeks following treatment initiation. Preterm infant who is expected not to receive any fresh breast milk for 4 weeks following treatment initiation. Informed consent is obtained.
