	<brief_summary>Burned patients because of their increased oxidative stress have severely depleted vitamin E, which is a dietary antioxidant. Oxidative stress is responsible for much of the pathophysiology seen in burned patients, which leads to acute and chronic morbidity and mortality, in addition to a decrease in their quality of life. Oral vitamin E will be used to reverse the oxidative stress of burn injury and, in the process, decrease the secondary consequences of thermal trauma. This proposal will demonstrate the benefit of maintaining adequate vitamin E status.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vitamin E Supplementation in Burn Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We have previously demonstrated that thermal injury depletes plasma vitamin E in pediatric burn patients. However, plasma changes reflect short-term vitamin E changes, whereas adipose tissue alpha-tocopherol concentrations reflect long-term vitamin E status. We reported last year that burn injury depleted vitamin E stores in adipose tissue in children by nearly half within one month following injury. Our long-term goal is to improve the quality of life of burn patients by preventing pulmonary and hepatic dysfunction that may occur from vitamin E depletion. The objectives of this application are to a) attenuate alpha-tocopherol depletion in burned patients by vitamin E supplementation, b) prevent or reverse oxidative stress in these patients, and c) collect pilot data on the effect of vitamin E supplementation on lung and liver function. Our central hypothesis is that the administration of high doses of alpha-tocopherol will prevent or restore levels of vitamin E in adipose tissue and reverse the oxidative state in burned patients. The rationale of the proposed studies is that in severe cases of vitamin E depletion, oxidative stress, fatty liver and lung dysfunction have all been reported in our patients. We will administer vitamin E supplements (300-1200 IU RRR-alpha-tocopherol) to burn subjects (n= 20 per group, 6-70 years, â‰¥20% total body surface burns) for fifteen days. The subjects will be randomly assigned into two groups: an early treatment group who will receive vitamin E for days 1-15 of the study, and a delayed treatment group who will receive vitamin E for days 16-30 of the study. Both groups will be studied for a total of thirty days. We will test the following aims: Aim 1: determine the degree that supplemental Vitamin E will attenuate alpha-tocopherol depletion. Aim 2: determine if supplemental Vitamin E reduces markers of oxidative stress in burned patients. Aim 3: collect preliminary data to establish the relationship between oxidative stress and pulmonary pathophysiology and fatty liver after burn injury. We will measure plasma and adipose tissue alpha-tocopherol and urinary and plasma markers of oxidative stress, prior to supplementation and then weekly. The proposed research is innovative because the oxidative stress of burn injury causes a severe depletion of an essential nutrient, vitamin E. Supplementation of vitamin E is a novel concept that may mitigate the complications of burns, including lung injury, fatty liver and peripheral neuropathy.</detailed_description>
