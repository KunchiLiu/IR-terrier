	<brief_summary>This is a two part study. The objective of Part 1 is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of HT-2157 in healthy normal volunteers Part 2 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple (21-day) ascending-dose evaluation of the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of HT-2157 in patients with major depressive disorder</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics - Pharmacodynamic Study of HT-2157 in Healthy Subjects and in Patients With Major Depressive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a two part study. The objective of Part 1 is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of HT-2157 administered for 7-days in healthy normal volunteers Part 2 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending-dose evaluation of the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics of HT-2157 administered for 21-days in patients with major depressive disorder. The primary objective of Part 2 is to assess the CNS penetration of HT-2157 in cerebrospinal fluid. In addition, the potential activity of HT-2157 in this patient population may be assessed using exploratory biologic and pharmacodynamic markers of potential efficacy</detailed_description>
