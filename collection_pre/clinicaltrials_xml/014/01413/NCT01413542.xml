	<brief_summary>The investigators would like to find out if sitagliptin (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 or DPP4 inhibition), a drug to treat diabetes, affects blood vessel relaxation in healthy people receiving enalapril (angiotensin converting enzyme or ACE inhibition), a blood pressure medicine. Understanding how these drugs interact in healthy people will help us learn their potential effects in people who have diabetes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To test the hypothesis that DPPIV inhibition with sitagliptin potentiates the vasodilator response to substance P in the presence of ACE inhibition with enalaprilat and to BNP and GLP-1 even in the presence of ACE inhibition. The aim promises to provide important new data regarding the mechanism of action of DPPIV inhibitors and interactive effects of these two drug classes used in a growing population of diabetic patients.</detailed_description>
