	<brief_summary>The goal of this project is to develop a biomarker - the Connective Tissue Motion Measure (CTMM) -quantifying the functional behavior of perimuscular connective tissues.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Connective Tissue Motion Measure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The differential motion between specific connective tissue strata will be measured during tissue displacement (linear oscillation) initiated by a computer-controlled needle stimulus tool (NST). The CTMM will be suitable as an outcome measure for mechanistic and clinical studies of CAM interventions. The CTMM also will potentially serve as a clinical diagnostic and treatment-monitoring tool for manual therapists, acupuncturists, and CAM clinicians interested in assessing the functional status of a patient's connective tissue.</detailed_description>
