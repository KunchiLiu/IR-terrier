	<brief_title>Specimen Collection From Pregnant Women at Increased Risk for Fetal Aneuploidy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To collect specimens for the purpose of developing a prenatal aneuploidy test. The test will analyze circulating cell free fetal (ccff) nucleic acid from blood samples from pregnant women who have an increased risk indicator/s for fetal chromosomal aneuploidy and are undergoing invasive prenatal diagnosis by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and/or genetic amniocentesis. The results of the ccff aneuploidy test will be compared to the chromosomal analysis obtained via CVS or genetic amniocentesis.</detailed_description>
