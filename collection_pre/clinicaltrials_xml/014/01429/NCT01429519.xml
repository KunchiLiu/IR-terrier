	<brief_title>Efficacy of RPh201 Applied Topically for the Treatment of Hard to Heal Chronic Ulcerated Wounds</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study objectives are to evaluate safety and efficacy, of topical administration of RPh201 for treatment of patients with hard to heal wounds. This is to include: - Safety evaluation of RPh201 (botanical extract) formulated as an oil solution administered topically three times per week during an overall treatment period of up to 4 weeks in patients with hard to heal wounds. - Efficacy assessment of wound improvement following the use of RPh201 oil solution (botanical extract) administered topically three times per week during an overall treatment period of up to 4 weeks and at the follow-up visit at 3 months after end of treatment in patients with hard to heal wounds</detailed_description>
