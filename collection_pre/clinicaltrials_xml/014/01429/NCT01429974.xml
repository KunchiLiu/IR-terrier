	<brief_summary>Meconium constitutes the bowel contents of the fetus and is normally expelled only after birth. However, it may be secreted into the amniotic fluid of 20% of all fetuses. Meconium Stained Amniotic Fluid had been recognized from ancient times as an obstetric hazard which complicates delivery and is associated with increased newborn morbidity and mortality. At present there is no viable diagnostic test for Meconium prior to the onset of labor and the rupture of membranes. The system developed for the detection of Meconium, based on recognizing a characteristic fluoroscopic spectral pattern emitted by Meconium under light excitation at a specific wavelength. The diagnostic test being developed does not require penetration into the amniotic sac and is safe, painless and simple to perform.</brief_summary>
