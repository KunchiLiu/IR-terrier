	<brief_summary>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic skin disorder characterized by recurrent viral skin infections. A small subset of patients with AD suffer from disseminated viral infections, e.g., eczema herpeticum (ADEH+), after herpes simplex infection (HSV) or eczema vaccinatum (EV) after smallpox vaccination. Interferon gamma (IFNγ) plays a critical role in the innate and acquired immune responses by activating macrophages, enhancing natural killer cell activation, and promoting T cell differentiation, as well as regulating B cell isotype switching to immunoglobulin (Ig) G2a. Recent studies have demonstrated that IFNγ generation was significantly decreased after stimulation with HSV ex vivo. The purpose of this study is to determine if deficient IFNγ induction leads to susceptibility to HSV infection in ADEH+ patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interferon Responses in Eczema Herpeticum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators hypothesize that defective IFNγ responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from ADEH+ patients results from aberrant pattern recognition receptors (PRR) signaling in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) resulting in low level production of IL-12, an essential cytokine for IFNγ generation. This study will compare results from 40 ADEH+, 40 ADEH-, and 40 non-atopic participants. Study procedures will typically be completed in one visit; however, participants may be asked to return for additional unscheduled visit(s) occurring as frequently as every 3 months for the duration of the study to provide an additional blood sample for further characterization of immune mechanisms leading to reduced IFNγ responses in ADEH+.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participant Participants who meet all of the following criteria are eligible for enrollment: have a history of AD with or without a history of Eczema Herpeticum (EH) as diagnosed using the Atopic Dermatitis Research Network (ADRN) Standard Diagnostic Criteria OR are nonatopic as diagnosed using the ADRN Standard Diagnostic Criteria are willing to sign the informed consent form or whose parent or legal guardian is willing to sign the informed consent form (age appropriate) prior to initiation of any study procedure are willing to sign the assent form, if age appropriate. Participant Participants who meet any of the following criteria are not eligible for enrollment: have a history of any systemic illness (e.g., immunodeficiency disorders such as human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] or lupus erythematosus) other than the condition being studied have an active systemic malignancy, excluding uncomplicated nonmelanoma skin cancer have any skin disease other than AD that might compromise the stratum corneum barrier (e.g., bullous disease, psoriasis, cutaneous T cell lymphoma [also called Mycosis Fungoides or Sezary syndrome], dermatitis herpetiformis, HaileyHailey, or Darier's disease) have a first degree relative already enrolled in the study are determined not to be eligible in the opinion of the Investigator. Participants who meet any of the following criteria are not eligible for enrollment but may be reassessed: have active eczema herpeticum at the Enrollment Visit have taken systemic immunosuppressive drugs including cyclosporine or oral steroids within 30 days of the Enrollment Visit have a fever &gt;/= 38.5 ºC (101.3 ºF) at the Enrollment Visit.</criteria>
