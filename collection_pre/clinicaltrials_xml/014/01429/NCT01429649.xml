	<brief_summary>With the advent of CT screening for lung cancer, there is an increase in the detection of pulmonary lesions with focal pure ground-glass opacity (pGGO). The pure Ground-glass opacities can be caused by normal expiration, partial filling of air spaces, partial collapse of alveoli, interstitial thickening, inflammation, oedema, fibrosis, and lepidic proliferation of neoplasm. Precise details of the natural history of focal pure GGO are still largely unclear. A number of differential diagnoses are possible, including inflammatory disease, focal scar, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH), and adenocarcinoma in situ. Some of pGGOs remained stable over a considerable time. A long doubling time for pGGOs is already known. Therefore, the strategy of treatment for focal pure GGO lesions is still undecided. The major issue is whether or not the doctors should treat these patients at all or wait until the first sign of a solid lesion developes which may take many years. The purpose of this study is to determine if the ablation therapy is safe and effective for the pulmonary pGGO.</brief_summary>
