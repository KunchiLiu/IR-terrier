	<brief_summary>This two-part study will evaluate the effectiveness of etoricoxib in controlling pain in participants with osteoarthritis who are experiencing inadequate response to their current treatments. In Part 1, all participants will receive open-label etoricoxib 60 mg daily. Those participants who experience a clinically meaningful response to etoricoxib 60 mg daily within two weeks will be eligible to enter the double-blind withdrawal period (Part II). Responders entering Part 2 will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either etoricoxib 60 mg or placebo.</brief_summary>
