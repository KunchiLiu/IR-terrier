	<brief_summary>This multi-center study will evaluate the viral response in patients with chronic hepatitis C, genotype 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4 on standard anti-viral treatment with Pegasys (peginterferon alfa-2a) and Copegus (ribavirin). Patients will receive weekly subcutaneous Pegasys plus daily oral Copegus for 24 weeks (genotype 2 &amp; 3) or 48 weeks (genotype 1 &amp; 4). Patients identified as slow responders/non-rapid virological responders will be eligible for an additional 24 weeks of treatment.</brief_summary>
