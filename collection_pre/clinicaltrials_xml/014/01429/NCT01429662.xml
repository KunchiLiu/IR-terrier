	<brief_title>Modified Relaxation (MR) Technique for Treating Hypertension in Postmenopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Medical treatment of hypertension (HTN) in postmenopausal women is not very effective, as it requires co-operation and long-term commitment from the patients and their families. The medication itself may cause bothersome side effects and it can pose economic burden to the patients and the society. In contrast, lifestyle modifications, particularly relaxation technique, are less costly and relatively free of any side effects. Once the patients master the techniques, they can practice by themselves at home and at any time that is convenient to them. There is evidence from at least one RCT that the techniques are effective in reducing the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), even after a short practice of only two months. In this study, the investigators propose a randomized control trial to examine the effectiveness of modified relaxation (MR) technique to control HTN in Thai postmenopausal women against a control group who practice no MR. Such a study in Thai population has not been done before. In addition, the investigators will extend the period of observation up to 16 weeks, to assess longer-term patients' compliance, and the effects of MR on BP.</detailed_description>
