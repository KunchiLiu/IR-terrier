	<brief_title>Prognostic Relevance of High-sensitivity Troponin in Patients With Acute Decompensated Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients admitted for acute decompensated heart failure are included in the study. After gaining informed consent, concentrations of high-sensitivity troponin on admission and on discharge are assessed. 6 months after discharged, the incidence of clinical endpoint (mortality of all cause and of cardiovascular cause, hospitalization) is assessed by telephone contact to the patient and/or the physician. The aim of the study is to investigate the prognostic value of high-sensitivity troponin concentration for predicting death and re-hospitalization.</detailed_description>
