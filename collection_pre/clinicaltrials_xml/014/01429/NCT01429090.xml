	<brief_summary>The primary objective of the study is: •To describe extent and rate of absorption of methantheline after single oral dose administration of Vagantin® coated tablets (Test) in comparison to a methantheline bromide solution (Reference) The secondary objectives of the study are: - To determine elimination the half-life of methantheline bromide - To describe the effects of Test and Reference on salivation, accommodation, pupil response, blood pressure and heart rate - to assess frequency and intensity of adverse drug reactions</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioavailability of Vagantin® Coated Tablets Relative to an Oral Methantheline Bromide Solution</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The quarternary anticholinergic compound methantheline bromide (diethyl-methyl [2-(9 xanthenyl carbonyloxy) ethyl] ammonium bromide) is marketed to treat neurogenic bladder instability. In comparison with atropine, it influences the parasympathetic nervous transmission more by ganglionic rather than peripheral muscarinic receptor blockade. Clinical effects after single therapeutic doses of 50-100 mg last for about 6 hours which is longer than after atropine. The drug relaxes smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal and urogenital tract. Furthermore, it inhibits bronchial, salivary and sweat glands secretion, lowers the production of gastric juice and disturbs accommodation. There are no data available on the pharmacokinetic properties of methantheline in man. However, 25-50 mg intravenous methantheline seem to be equivalent to 50-100 mg p.o. with regard to the pharmacodynamic effects [Stille 1988]. Vagantin® is marketed as coated tablets containing 50 mg methantheline bromide. Because of the particular properties of methantheline (narrow therapeutic range, obviously erratic, incomplete and irregular absorption) and because of the national and international recommendations concerning the registration of drugs, Vagantin® must be evaluated with regard to its pharmacokinetic properties at least relative to a non-formulated form.</detailed_description>
