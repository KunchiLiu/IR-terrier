	<criteria>Hoehn and Yahr stage 2 or worse when off medications Average tremor and/or bradykinesia Unified Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score greater than 2 off meds Ldopa responsive with clearly defined "on" periods, UPDRS motor III average tremor and bradykinesia improves by 25% Stable on medical therapy for at least one month prior to study enrollment Clinical approval to undergo unilateral DBS surgery targeting the STN or GPi Available to participate for six months following DBS surgery "Parkinson's plus" syndromes, secondary, or atypical Parkinson's syndromes (e.g. progressive supranuclear palsy, striatonigral degeneration, multiple system atrophy, poststroke, posttraumatic, or postencephalitic Parkinson's. These patients have cardinal symptoms characteristic of PD but with additional symptoms indicating other organic brain dysfunction, such as gaze palsies, autonomic dysfunction, lack of response to Ldopa, these individuals tend not to improve with standard treatments for PD) previous Parkinson's Disease surgery medical contraindications to surgery or stimulation (e.g. uncontrolled hypertension, advanced coronary artery disease, other implanted stimulation or electronicallycontrolled devices including cardiac demand pacemaker, aneurysm clips, cochlear implants, or a spinal cord stimulator) (Note: for the subject who receives either a pacemaker and/or defibrillator after this study enrollment, he/she will be allowed to continue the study if the neurostimulator system can be adequately programmed to permit system compatibility) contraindication to magnetic resonance imaging (e.g. indwelling metal fragments or implants that might be affected by MRI) neuropsychological dysfunction (e.g. dementia) that would contraindicate surgery intracranial abnormalities that would contraindicate surgery (e.g. stroke, tumor, vascular abnormality affecting the target area)</criteria>
