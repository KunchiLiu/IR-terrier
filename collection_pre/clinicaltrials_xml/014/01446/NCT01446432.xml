	<brief_summary>A study to validate two newly developed questionnaires for Dupuytren's Disease. The objective is to develop a patient specific outcomes tool for Dupuytren's Disease. While there are standard and validated questionnaire instruments used to measure health related quality of life and function, they do not address patient specific issues. The investigators will also pilot a treatment/disease specific satisfaction questionnaire for Xiaflex use for Dupuytren's Disease.</brief_summary>
