	<brief_summary>Reduced quality of life, fatigue, and loss of physical function are common in patients getting chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The investigators completed a pilot study showing that exercise during active chemotherapy for AML is feasible, safe, and may improve symptoms and physical function. The investigators now propose to compare our hospital-based supervised exercise program to usual care to see if exercise can improve symptoms, physical function, and improve treatment tolerability.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Exercise Trial for Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) Patients Undergoing Induction Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a life-threatening malignant blood disorder. Curative treatment requires multiple cycles of intensive chemotherapy. The first cycle, induction, is the most intense and intended to achieve complete disease remission (CR). Induction therapy requires 4-6 weeks of inpatient admission and is associated with extended bed rest and multiple toxicities, leading to physical deconditioning. Regular exercise during induction may reduce declines in physical fitness, leading to improved quality of life (QOL), reduced fatigue, improved tolerance of chemotherapy, and potentially greater survival. Four prior studies of exercise in AML patients undergoing induction have suggested improvements in QOL, fatigue, physical function, and treatment tolerability. However, all 4 studies suffered from major limitations including small sample sizes, design limitations, generalizability concerns, and limited safety information. The investigators conducted a pilot non-randomized study in 35 AML patients and demonstrated feasibility, safety, and potential improvements in QOL, fatigue, and physical fitness outcomes. The investigators now propose a rigorous evaluation of the intervention in a phase II randomized controlled trial (RCT). Primary objectives include: (1) To determine the efficacy of a supervised mixed-modality exercise program during induction chemotherapy on QOL and fatigue; (2) To determine the efficacy on physical fitness. Our secondary objective is to determine the efficacy on AML treatment tolerability (hospital length of stay, development of sepsis, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, delays in consolidation chemotherapy).</detailed_description>
