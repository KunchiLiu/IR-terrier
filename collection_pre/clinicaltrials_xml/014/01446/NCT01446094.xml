	<brief_title>Diagnostic Study of Rapid Regadenoson Stress Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) to Detect Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a single center, open-label, pilot study in subjects scheduled for invasive coronary angiography for evaluation of coronary artery disease. The primary objective is to evaluate the profile of sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of a novel rapid regadenoson stress CMR protocol for detection of &gt;= 70 coronary artery stenosis on invasive coronary angiography. Additionally the objective will be to compare the time for performance of this novel rapid regadenoson stress CMR protocol in comparison to the standard stress CMR protocol.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Aged 18 years or older Scheduled for invasive coronary angiography Inability to give informed consent Possible pregnancy (confirmed by urine test) Women who are breastfeeding Severe claustrophobia Inability to lie flat for 2030 minutes (the anticipated amount of time to complete the MRI procedure) Individuals with cochlear implants Individuals with nonMRI compatible aneurysm clips Potential contraindications to regadenoson use due to: Severe lung disease (active wheezing) Severe bradycardia (heart rate &lt; 40 beats/min) Second or thirddegree atrioventricular heart block Sick sinus syndrome History of Long QT syndrome Severe hypotension (systolic BP &lt; 80 mm Hg) Decompensated heart failure Contraindication to administration of Gadolinium (Gd) based contrast agents (GBCA): Stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease (eGFR &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73 m2) Known allergy to GBCA Special Considerations: Although individuals who have an occupational history of welding, grinding, or other metal work will not be excluded from the study, they must undergo an orbital xray, to exclude any occult metal fragments, before they can participate in this study.</criteria>
