	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the incidence of wound breakdown or wound infection following skin closure with Insorb subcuticular absorbable staples versus metal staples after cesarean section through a retrospective chart analysis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use of Insorb Absorbable Vicryl Staples in Skin Closure for Cesarean Section</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Procedures: A list will be compiled of patients who underwent cesarean section at Memorial Hermann Hospital in the Texas Medical Center from January 1st 2010 through January 1st 2011. Only UT patients who had their skin closed with Insorb or metal staples will be included in this list. Patients' clinical charts will be reviewed for post-operative follow-up, and notes will be made of the wound assessment. Any complications such as infection, seroma, hematoma, and wound separation or delayed healing will be recorded. Additional notes will be made of any co-morbid conditions, including, but not limited to, &gt;30 BMI, chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, HIV, history of tobacco use. Once the data is gathered, it will be compared with published national averages to determine if there is an increased risk of wound separation or wound infection at our institution. In addition, rated of infection and wound breakdown following closure with either absorbable or metal staples will be compared by Fisher's exact test, to determine statistical significance. Course of Study: Data will be obtained from UT patients who underwent cesarean section from January 1st, 2010 through January 1st, 2011. Only patients who had skin closure with InSorb or metal staples will be included in analysis.</detailed_description>
