	<detailed_description>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a serious disorder that affects many Veterans who have had a traumatic experience. The VA offers several different types of treatment for PTSD. We are researching different ways to match a Veteran to a type of treatment. Participants in this study will will be randomly assigned to either a 40-minute session in which they will learn about PTSD treatments and select a preferred treatment or to a 40-minute assessment interview. Those participants assigned to the assessment interview will have the opportunity to work with their Trauma Recovery Program provider to determine a plan for their PTSD treatment.</detailed_description>
