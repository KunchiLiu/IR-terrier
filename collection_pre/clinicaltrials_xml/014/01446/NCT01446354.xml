	<brief_summary>Cardiac surgery including hypothermic cardiac arrest (HCA) commonly involves perioperative transfusion of allogeneic blood products which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In this retrospective analysis, the investigator aimed to evaluate the effect of a thromboelastometry-guided treatment algorithm promoting fibrinogen concentrate as first line hemostatic agent on the perioperative use of allogeneic blood products.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigators will analyze the data of patients undergoing elective and emergent surgical procedures involving the ascendent aorta and/or the aortic arch with the help of HCA from January 2009 to June 2011. The investigators will collect and document baseline characteristics, the use of thromboelastometry, thromboelastometric data, and perioperative laboratory data. In addition, the investigators will evaluate perioperative bleeding from mediastinal drainages, perioperative use of blood and hemostatic products, and the adverse events within the hospitalisation including re-exploration, renal impairment, myocardial infarction, severe brain injury, and death.</detailed_description>
