	<brief_summary>Asthma is a common problem among US adults and children. Unfortunately many people with asthma continue to suffer from asthma symptoms that could be control with better asthma care and more attention to details such as triggers, and adherence. To date the only tools available and recommended by groups such as the national asthma guideline group consider only asthma burden and do not include information on the most common factors that adversely affect asthma control. This study provides one half of the enrolled primary care offices with the Asthma APGAR which is a system of patient completed questions and a care flow sheet. The other half of the enrolled practices will continue to provide "usual" care without the support of the Asthma APGAR system. The research questions is whether or not asthma control and asthma related quality of life will be improved in people with asthma who are cared for in the intervention practices that use the Asthma APGAR system.</brief_summary>
