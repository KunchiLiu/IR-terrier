	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate potential metabolic effects of resveratrol in obese healthy men with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The investigators hypothesize that resveratrol will: - decrease hepatic very-low-density-lipoprotein-triglyceride (VLDL-TG) secretion - decrease liver fat content - increase insulin sensitivity The investigators will look at changes in: - lipid turnover (VLDL-TG kinetics, palmitate kinetics, indirect calorimetry) - liver fat content (MR liver spectroscopy) - insulin sensitivity (glucose kinetics during hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp) - body composition (DXA and MRI) - lipase activity and fat cell size (fat biopsy from abdominal and femoral adipose tissue)</brief_summary>
