	<brief_summary>The investigators aim to pilot test the efficacy of a yoga intervention designed specifically for individuals with ocular hypertension. The investigators would like to find out if a combination of breathing, postures and meditation may help to reduce intraocular pressure in the short term after each yoga session, and also long-term across an 8-week program. Subjects will participate in the yoga intervention sessions led by Dr. Pamela Jeter once a week at the investigators center, and will be asked to practice at home at least twice a week using a audio CD.</brief_summary>
