	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1, open-label, non-randomized, dose-finding, study of Vitamin E δ-Tocotrienol in subjects with resectable pancreatic tumors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vitamin E δ-Tocotrienol (VEDT) Single Dose in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitamin E tocotrienols have been shown to exhibit cancer-preventive activities in preclinical studies. Vitamin E tocotrienols are composed of α-, β-, δ-, and γ-tocotrienols. The investigators preclinical studies indicate that δ-tocotrienol possesses the most potent antitumor activity against pancreatic cancer. It is believed that this micronutrient may have a role in the prevention of pancreatic cancer in healthy participants who are at increased risk of developing the disease.</detailed_description>
