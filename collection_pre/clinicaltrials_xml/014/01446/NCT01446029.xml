	<brief_title>Telemonitoring to Improve Outcomes of Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health issue. Approximately, 11% of the US population has CKD with an increased prevalence among individuals great than 65years. Many individuals with CKD go unrecognized because they are typically asymptomatic. Individuals with CKD have been demonstrated to have a greater risk for mortality, hospitalization and development of end stage kidney disease. Also, individuals with CKD consume a significantly greater proportion of health care expenditures compared to other patients. This study aims to determine if the adoption of a chronic care model in conjunction with telemonitoring and case management can reduce risk of death, hospitalization, ER visits or admission to a skilled nursing facility in patients with CKD compared to usual care. This study will use a randomized controlled trial. Few interventions have been demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes in patients with CKD. If successful, this study will enable the VA to provide high quality care to patients with CKD while potentially reducing the cost of providing care.</detailed_description>
