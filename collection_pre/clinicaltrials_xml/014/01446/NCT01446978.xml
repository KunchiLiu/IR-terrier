	<brief_summary>Hepatitis A vaccine is the most frequently used traveler's vaccine, yet data on its ability to induce protective immunity in immunosuppressed travelers are scarce. The investigators assess the hepatitis A virus (HAV) antibody response in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) - inhibitors and/or methotrexate (Mtx). In a previous study, 2 doses were not considered effective and there is therefore need for a study with an additional dose</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Three Doses of Hepatitis A Vaccine in Patients With Immunomodulating Drugs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods: Parameters registered at baseline were: age, sex, duration of disease, medications, activity of disease (Visual Analogue Scale), Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index, Disease Activity Score, Acute phase reactant and total immunoglobulin G in plasma). Hepatitis A vaccine (Epaxal or Havrix) were given at 0 and 6 months. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) antibodies is measured before vaccination and at month 1, 6 (before dose 2), 7 and 12 with quantitative HAV IgG, using the HAVAb-IgG Architect System, and by the HAVAB 2.0 assay on the AxSYM machine from Abbott. The level of protective immunity to HAV is defined as HAV IgG &gt; 10mIU/mL.</detailed_description>
