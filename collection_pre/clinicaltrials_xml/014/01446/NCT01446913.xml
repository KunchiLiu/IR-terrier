	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to develop a novel study design to safely and ethically conduct a long-term randomized controlled trial among patients at high risk for both sleep apnea and cardiovascular events that will examine whether effective positive airway pressure(PAP) therapy reduces cardiovascular risk. Patients with transient ischemic attack(TIA) or stroke have a high prevalence of sleep apnea(60-80%), and they are at high risk of cardiovascular events(myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, recurrent stroke, and cardiovascular death)in the first year post event, despite current prevent strategies. Therefore, the treatment of sleep apnea may represent a novel therapeutic target to reduce cardiovascular outcomes in this high risk population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sleep Apnea in TIA/Stroke: Reducing Cardiovascular Risk With Positive Airway Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial among patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) and minor stroke, comparing strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea with usual care over 6-12 months at 2 sites (Yale University School of Medicine and Indiana University School of Medicine). Patients with TIA and minor stroke will be randomly assigned to either usual care or a diagnosis and treatment approach that includes ambulatory polysomnography and initiation of autotitrating CPAP for sleep apnea in a 1:2 (control:intervention) randomization scheme. Intervention patients with sleep apnea will receive either a standard CPAP treatment intervention or an enhanced protocol designed to increase long-term CPAP adherence. The primary outcomes will include: (a) the impact of CPAP on pathophysiologic markers in the following domains of cardiovascular risk: inflammation (CRP, Il-6), heightened sympathetic activity/parasympathetic withdrawal (plasma catecholamines and heart rate variability (HRV)), insulin resistance (HOMA-IR, HbA1C), endothelial injury (flow mediated vasodilation), and atherosclerosis (carotid intima-media thickness); and (b) long-term (6-12 month) CPAP adherence.</detailed_description>
