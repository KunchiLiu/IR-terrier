	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation of the APTIMA® HPV Assay Using the PANTHER™ System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The APTIMA HPV Assay is an in vitro nucleic acid amplification test for the qualitative detection of E6/E7 viral messenger RNA (mRNA) from 14 high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervical specimens. The high-risk HPV types detected by the assay include: 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and 68. The APTIMA HPV Assay does not discriminate between the 14 high-risk types. Cervical specimens collected in ThinPrep Pap Test vials containing PreservCyt® Solution with commercially available collection devices (broom-type device or cytobrush/spatula combination) may be tested with the APTIMA HPV Assay either pre- or post-Pap processing. The assay is used with the TIGRIS System and the PANTHER System. The objective is to establish that APTIMA HPV Assay performance on the PANTHER System is comparable to performance on the TIGRIS System.</detailed_description>
