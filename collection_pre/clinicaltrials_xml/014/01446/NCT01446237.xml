	<detailed_description>This open-label, multicenter, study is being conducted to obtain safety, efficacy, and satisfaction data on an Acne System (Benzoyl Peroxide 2.5%, Salicylic Acid 0.5%), which includes Foam Deep Cleanser (2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide) and Foam Advanced Acne Treatment (2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide) and Foam Rejuvenating Toner (0.5% Salicylic Acid), in the treatment of moderate to severe acne. Approximately 120 male or female subjects ages 12-35 years, inclusive, with moderate or severe acne as assessed by Investigator's Global Assessment (ISGA) and lesion counts are expected to be enrolled. Subjects will be instructed to use all 3 study products as part of a complete acne treatment system; no reference therapy or control group will be included. Subjects will be instructed to apply Foam Deep Cleanser (2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide) and Foam Advnced Acne Treatment (2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide) to the face each morning and Foam Deep Cleanser (2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide) and Foam Rejuvenating Toner (0.5% Salicylic Acid) each evening over an application period of 12 weeks.</detailed_description>
