	<brief_summary>Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) remains a life-threatening complication of arthroplasty. It remains controversial for anticoagulation strategies after total hip arthroplasty (THA). A randomized double-blind study was conducted to determine whether prophylactic anticoagulation was efficient reduce DVT after THA. subjects who underwent uncemented THA were assigned to prophylactic anticoagulation group or non- prophylactic anticoagulation group. Patients were followed up 3 months later after surgery. DVT was tested by contrast venography. Investigator also used logistic regression analysis with variable selection for obtaining the prediction model of DVT. DVT after THA was affected by personal (age) and clinical factors (mechanical compression, duration of surgery). THA with short duration of surgery did not require prophylactic anticoagulation.</brief_summary>
