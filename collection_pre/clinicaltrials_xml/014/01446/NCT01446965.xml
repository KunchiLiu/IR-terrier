	<brief_summary>This study explores the hypothesis that wearable defibrillators can impact mortality by reducing sudden death during the first three months after a heart attack in persons with high risk for life-threatening arrhythmias.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vest Prevention of Early Sudden Death Trial and VEST Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patients with ventricular dysfunction immediately following myocardial infarction, sudden death may be responsible for up to 50% of total mortality. Wearable defibrillators may reduce sudden death by providing immediate detection and treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. This study is design to demonstrate a reduction in sudden death measured at three months following myocardial infarction among patients who have ventricular dysfunction.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients identified in the hospital or within 7 days after discharge with a diagnosis of an acute MI (STEMI or NonSTEMI) LV ejection fraction ≤35% determined at the following time point: 1. If no PCI within the first 8 hours following the MI: ≥ 8 hours after MI 2. If acute PCI occurs within 8 hours of MI: ≥8 hours after PCI 3. If CABG is planned (before or within 7 days of discharge), wait to enroll and then use the most recent assessment at least 48 hours post CABG Age ≥ 18 years Existing ICD or indication for an ICD at the time of screening Existing unipolar pacemakers/leads Chronic renal failure requiring hemodialysis after hospital discharge Chest circumference too small or too large for LifeVest garment* Participants discharged to an institutional setting with an anticipated stay &gt; 7 days Pregnancy Inability to consent Any other condition or circumstance that in the judgment of the clinician makes the participant unsuitable for the study.</criteria>
