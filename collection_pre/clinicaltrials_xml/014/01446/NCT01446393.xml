	<brief_title>Functional and Structural Characterization of Arteriopathy in Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum (PXE)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of this study is to characterize the structural and functional characteristics of the peripheral arteries (lower and upper limbs) . a secondary objective will be to determine the arterial calcification using CT-scan as a useful tools for the diagnosis and the follow-up of this disease. Data will be collected from a cohort of patients PXE monitored in our Health and Research PXE center at the University Hospital of Angers. The structural and functional variables of the distal arteries (radial and tibialis arteries) will be studied using high-resolution echography. Scoring of the arterial calcium load will be determined by helicoidal CT-scan in the lower limb arteries. These variables will be compared to matched (gender and age) controls without PXE.</detailed_description>
