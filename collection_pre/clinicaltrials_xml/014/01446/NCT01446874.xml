	<brief_summary>Postoperative pneumonia is a major complication in patients undergoing thoracic surgery. It leads to considerable morbidity and contributes to perioperative morbidity. There is evidence in literature that supports the use of strategies for improved oral hygiene and specialized endotracheal tubes in preventing ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) in mechanically ventilated patients. This study aims at utilizing a combination of these interventions in the perioperative period in patients undergoing planned thoracic surgical procedures.</brief_summary>
