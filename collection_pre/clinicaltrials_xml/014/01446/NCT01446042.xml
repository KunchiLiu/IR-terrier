	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Intranasal TBS-1 Treatment of Male Hypogonadism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a 4 Period study consists of 16 visits with overnight clinic stays that span over year to help determine the efficacy of TBS-1 gel administered twice daily (b.i.d) and three times daily (t.i.d) In addition, this study will investigate the safety and tolerability of TBS-1 after 90, 180 and 360 days of treatment.</detailed_description>
