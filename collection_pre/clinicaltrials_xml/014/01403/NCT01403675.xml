	<brief_summary>Chemotherapy can cause permanent damage to a woman's ovaries. Women who are cancer survivors may find that they are not able to produce female hormones, and they may not be able to have a child. Scientists are trying to find ways to help cancer survivors regain their hormonal function and possibly get pregnant, if they desire. Scientists have developed a method where ovarian tissue is removed and frozen before chemotherapy; then it is thawed and put back into the woman's body after she is cancer-free. Putting a woman's previously-frozen tissue back into her body is called ovarian autotransplantation. Ovarian autotransplantation is a very new technique, and there have only been a small number of women who have had this procedure. So far, only five babies in the world have been born using this technique. The purpose of this study is to learn more about ovarian autotransplantation. Scientists hope to find better ways to use this method to help a woman's ovaries start working again after chemotherapy. If the ovaries start working again, it might be possible to have a baby.</brief_summary>
