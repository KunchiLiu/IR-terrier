	<brief_summary>Vascular surgery is considered a high-risk operation with an anticipated risk of major cardiovascular complications in excess of 5%. The occurrence of a cardiovascular complication after surgery carries a long-term higher mortality risk. The main objective of this investigation is to reduce the proportion of patients having major cardiovascular complications during surgery through a clinical protocol of remote preconditioning that is safe, effective and reproducible.</brief_summary>
