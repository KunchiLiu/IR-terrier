	<criteria>1. Age &gt;/= 18 years 2. De novo stenotic lesion(s) in the superficial femoral artery located at least 1cm distal to the femoral bifurcation and &gt; 3 cm above the knee joint 3. Lifestylelimiting claudication defined as symptomatic subjects with Rutherford Becker Category 23 4. Target lesion native reference vessel diameter 4.6 6.0 mm by online QVA; target lesion native reference vessel diameter less than 5.0 mm only if lesion residual stenosis is ≤ 25% 5. Lesion length: up to a maximum that can be covered by one 100mm scaffold 6. Target lesion &gt; 50% stenosis or total occlusion 7. Undisturbed flow to the foot via at least 2 patent infrapopliteal vessel on the treated side with one vessel free from &gt; 50% stenosis to the ankle joint 8. Patent common and external iliac; TASC A &amp; B lesions may be successfully treated (&lt;30% residual stenosis) at the time of the index procedure 9. The study patient or the study patient's legal representative has been informed of the nature of the study, agrees to its provisions and has provided written informed consent as approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) of the respective clinical site 10. The study patient agrees to comply with all required postprocedure followup visits 1. Previously implanted stent(s) or stent graft(s) in the target lesion 2. Previous endovascular treatment of the target lesion 3. Femoral access in the target limb within 30 days of study procedure 4. Target lesion residual stenosis &gt; 30% after predilatation with nominally sized balloon 5. Severely calcified lesions as determined by a balloon deformity during dilatation with a nominally sized balloon inflated at nominal pressure. 6. Acute embolic complication at the trifurcation following predilatation not resolved by aspiration 7. Target vessel contains acute thrombus 8. Aneurysm in target vessel 9. Critical limb ischemia defined as RutherfordBecker Category 46 10. Intolerance, or allergies which cannot be adequately premedicated, to the following: aspirin, clopidogrel or ticlopidine, heparin, any scaffold components, contrast agents 11. Life expectancy of less than 12 months 12. Pregnancy or breast feeding (negative pregnancy test within 7 days required in females of child bearing potential) 13. Nonatherosclerotic lesion (e.g. vasculitis or Berger's disease) 14. Renal insufficiency (serum creatinine level &gt; 220 µmol/L, or subject is on dialysis) 15. Immunocompromised 16. Active systemic infection or lower limb infection of any nature 17. WBC &lt; 3,000 cells/mm3 18. Myocardial infarction within the past 1 month 19. Stroke within 3 months 20. Uncontrolled AtrialFibrillation 21. Currently participating in an investigational drug or another device study. Note: Trials requiring extended followup for products that were investigational, but have since become commercially available, are not considered investigational trials</criteria>
