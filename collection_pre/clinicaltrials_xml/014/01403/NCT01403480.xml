	<brief_summary>Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) is the most common malignant growth in the world. Treatment is primarily surgical with the goal of excising the growth in its entirety. When pathology results show that this has not been achieved, a re-excision is routinely performed. This study examines retrospectively the percentage of re-excisions of BCC that actually proved to be positive (exhibited growth) among those re-excisions performed at Rambam Healthcare Campus and Zvulun Community Medical Center during the years 2008-10.</brief_summary>
