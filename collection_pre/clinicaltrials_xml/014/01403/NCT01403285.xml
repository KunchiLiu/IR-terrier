	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND: Active immunotherapy of cancer is based on the premise that the vaccine raises a cytotoxic immune response to tumor-associated antigens, thereby destroying malignant cells without harming normal cells. IMA950 is a therapeutic multi-peptide vaccine containing 11 tumor-associated peptides (TUMAPs) found in a majority of glioblastomas, and is designed to activate TUMAP-specific T cells. The use of 11 TUMAPs increases the likelihood of a multi-clonal, highly specific T-cell response against tumor cells leading to decreased likelihood of immune evasion of the tumor by down-regulation of target antigens. PURPOSE: The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of IMA950 when given with cyclophosphamide, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and imiquimod in patients with glioblastoma and to determine if IMA950 shows sufficient immunogenicity in these patients. ELIGIBILITY: Patients with histologically proven GBMs who have completed radiotherapy, and have stable disease following at least 4 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide.</brief_summary>
