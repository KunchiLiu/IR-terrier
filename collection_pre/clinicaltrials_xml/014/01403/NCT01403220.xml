	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacity of hemodiafiltration and hemofiltration for decreasing plasma urea at 12h among intensive care patients. Secondary objectives include comparing urea clearance, filter duration, and %down-time, between the two techniques.</brief_summary>
