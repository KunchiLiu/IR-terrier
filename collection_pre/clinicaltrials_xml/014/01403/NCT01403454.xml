	<brief_summary>This study involves Chronic Kidney Disease patients that must choose the type of dialysis therapy they ultimately wish to perform. These patients receive education regarding dialysis types from nurses and Nephrologists at a Kidney Function Program. The investigators have developed a web-based Interactive Health Communication Application that could provide more education and support to patients about their dialysis choices. The investigators will compare patients that will receive usual care dialysis education versus patients that will receive additional education through this web-based application. The investigators feel that this tool may increase the proportion of patients who start home dialysis, which offers advantages such as improvement in quality of life and deceased overall healthcare costs, over hospital hemodialysis.</brief_summary>
