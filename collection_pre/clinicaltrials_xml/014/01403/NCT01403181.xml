	<brief_title>Effect of Boceprevir on HCV-specific T Cell Responses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reconstitution of the antiviral T cell function may represent a component of the anti-viral effect of protease inhibitors. If T cell responsiveness is restored under therapy, potentiation of anti-viral T cell functions by exogenous T cell stimulation might be exploited to complement and to further improve response to available therapies. Monitoring the T cell function might also be useful to predict more accurately response to therapy. To address these issues, phenotype and function of HCV-specific T cells will be analyzed longitudinally before, during and after therapy in naïve genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C patients treated with peginterferon plus ribavirin or with peginterferon and ribavirin plus boceprevir. To analyze the global CD4 and CD8 reactivity against all structural and non-structural HCV proteins a wide panel of peptides corresponding to the whole HCV genome of genotype 1 will be employed. To further analyze CD8 reactivity, HLA-A2/peptide tetramers will be used in HLA-A2 positive patients to directly quantify ex vivo HCV-specific CD8 cells circulating in the peripheral blood.The T cell function will be analyzed as capacity of expansion in vitro, cytokine production and cytotoxicity.</detailed_description>
