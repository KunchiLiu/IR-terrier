	<brief_title>Evaluation of Non-ablative and Fractional Combination Treatment for Improvement in Skin's Appearance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Refirme ST and the Matrix RF applicators are both FDA approved devices indicated for improvement of skin appearance. The Matrix RF applicator has FDA clearance for ablation, resurfacing of the skin, and for wrinkles treatment, whereas the Refirme-ST applicator has FDA clearance for non-invasive wrinkles treatment. The combined treatment of Refirme ST and Matrix RF is intended to improve skin appearance both by enhancement of collagen production as the result of the Refirme ST primary heating of the treated area and by causing ablation and resurfacing of the skin with the Matrix RF. In the current clinical setting, each applicator is used in a separate session although there is no contra-indication preventing the usage of these applicators in the same treatment session. A combined treatment in one session is believed to be more efficient and will be more time effective for the patient and therefore will have a commercial benefit for the manufacturer.</detailed_description>
