	<brief_summary>This study will address the role of percutaneous renal intervention for a hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis in patients with heart failure exacerbations. Current guidelines suggest evaluation for renal artery stenosis in patients with pulmonary edema or heart failure that cannot be attributed to poor left ventricular function. While case series have suggested benefit to percutaneous intervention in patients with heart failure, no randomized study has addressed the potential benefit of renal stenting for heart failure patients. Two large randomized trial of renal stenting for hypertension or poor kidney function failed to show benefit in patients with intermediate renal artery lesions. No evaluation of the potential hemodynamic significance of the lesions was performed prior to randomization. The investigators will enroll patients with heart failure exacerbations not attributable to declining left ventricular function, valvular disease, acute coronary syndrome, or heart transplant rejection, who on non-invasive imaging appear to have renal artery stenosis. After routine invasive assessment, including renal angiography and pressure-wire assessment, patients with hemodynamically significant renal artery stenoses will be randomized to stent implantation or medical therapy. Patients will then be followed to determine whether stenting impacts cardiac mortality or hospitalization for heart failure.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Men and women age 18 or older referred for invasive evaluation of possible renal artery stenosis will be screened for enrollment. Patients must be inpatients admitted for heart failure exacerbation, or have been admitted to a hospital for heart failure exacerbation within the past 90 days. Heart failure is defined as physician documentation or report of any of the following clinical symptoms of heart failure described as dyspnea on exertion, dyspnea occurring in the supine position, fluid retention; or the description of rales, jugular venous distension, pulmonary edema on physical exam, or pulmonary edema on chest xray; without being clearly attributable to liver, kidney, or lung disease. Patients must have one of the following: 1. an ejection fraction of 50%; 2. an ejection fraction of 2550% in the setting of a systolic blood pressure of at least 160 mmHg; or 3. an ejection fraction of 2550% and a systolic blood pressure of at least 140 mmHg while being treated with at least 2 antihypertensive medications. Patients who meet these criteria and have a proven hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis (as described in the procedure section) will be included Patients with heart failure from structural heart disease (including greater than moderate dysfunction of the mitral or aortic valve), acute coronary syndrome, postpartum cardiomyopathy, or acute rejection of a transplanted heart will be excluded. Patients who are considered unlikely to survive to hospital discharge will be excluded. Patients with fibromuscular dysplasia, prior renal stenting, or anatomy unsuitable for renal stenting (i.e. prior vascular surgery making stent delivery impossible) will be excluded. Patients who are unable to take aspirin and clopidogrel will be excluded. Patients with a creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min or a history of renal transplantation will be excluded. Pregnant women will be excluded.</criteria>
