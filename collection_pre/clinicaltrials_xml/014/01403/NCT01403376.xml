	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: Assess the antibody response to influenza vaccine in patients with relapsing form of multiple sclerosis (RMS) treated with teriflunomide compared to a reference population. Secondary Objectives: - Assess the effect of teriflunomide on immunoglobulin levels; - Assess the safety of influenza vaccination in patients with RMS treated with teriflunomide. The reference population was defined as multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with a stable treatment with interferon-β-1. Antibody response was measured using hemagglutination inhibition assay (HIA) and the hemagglutinin antigens representing the stains of H3N2, H1N1, and B as present in the influenza vaccine used.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study to Investigate the Immune Response to Influenza Vaccine in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis on Teriflunomide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The maximum duration of the study period for a participant was approximatively 49 days broken down as follows: - Screening period of up to 21 days; - Influenza vaccination at Day 1; - Follow-up period of 28 days (±2 days). MS treatment (Teriflunomide or interferon-β-1) was to be continued during the course of the study.</detailed_description>
