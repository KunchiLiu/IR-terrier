	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to examine the bioavailability of cogniVida™ in 10 healthy male subjects after consumption of two different doses of cogniVida™ (50 mg and 100 mg) and to compare the plasma values with values obtained in subjects receiving rebaudioside A (303.68 mg). In addition, also safety and tolerability parameters 24 hours after ingestion of the study compounds will be determined. cogniVida™ is considered a dietary supplement, and therefore it is not an approved drug by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is regulated like a food. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not strictly regulate herbs and dietary supplements. The investigators do not claim that this supplement is meant to treat any ailment.</brief_summary>
