	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: - To evaluate the efficacy of SAR245409 as determined by the objective response rate (ORR) in patients with 1 of following relapsed or refractory lymphoma or leukemia subtypes: mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), or diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) Secondary Objectives: - To assess duration of response, progression free survival (PFS), and proportion of patients with PFS at 6 months (24 weeks) in patients with either MCL, FL, CLL/SLL or DLBCL treated with SAR245409 - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SAR245409 in patients with MCL, FL, CLL/SLL or DLBCL - To further characterize the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of SAR245409 in patients with MCL, FL, CLL/SLL or DLBCL</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of Investigational SAR245409 in Patients With Certain Lymphoma or Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is a 21 day screening period followed by 28 day cycles. Patients will continue to receive SAR245409 as long as there is clinical benefit or until a study withdrawal criterion is met. The last posttreatment visit will be 30 days after the last dose or until IMP-related toxicities have resolved or are deemed irreversible, whichever is later.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: Tissue from an archived or fresh tumor sample A peripheral blood buffy coat sample is required for CLL/SLL. Patient has mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/SLL or diffuse large B cell lymphoma Patient &gt; or = 18 years old Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &lt; or = 2. Patients with DLBCL will have ECOG &lt; or = 1 Adequate white blood cells and hemoglobin Good kidney and liver function Fasting glucose &lt; 160 mg/dL No other malignancy Use of adequate birth control Exclusion criteria: Treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy, biologic agents, investigational therapies within 4 weeks, or nitrosoureas or mitomycin C within 6 weeks of study enrollment Treatment with a smallmolecule kinase inhibitor within 2 weeks, or 5 half lives of the drug or its active metabolites (whichever is longer) of study enrollment Prior treatment with a PI3K, mTOR, or Akt inhibitor. Prior treatment of MCL with temsirolimus is permitted in patients enrolled from countries where it is licensed for this indication. Radiation therapy within 2 weeks of enrollment Autologous stem cell transplantation within 16 weeks of enrollment Prior allogeneic transplantation except for patients with R/R DLBCL who meet inclusion criteria Central nervous system (CNS) or leptomeningeal involvement. Patients with DLBCL may have active CNS or leptomeningeal involvement. Positive Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or Hepatitis C antibody (antiHCV) serology Primary CNS lymphoma Primary mediastinal Blymphoma The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.</criteria>
