	<criteria>Male and female patients aged 18 80 years, body weight ≤ 180 kg Dermatological diagnosis of psoriasis Initiated therapy with TNFαinhibitor agents (etanercept, adalimumab and infliximab)or fumaric acid ester (FAE) within the scope of routine patient care by treating physician Signed informed consent from patient Patients with evidence of any skin condition that would interfere with the evaluation of psoriasis Use of systemic antipsoriatic drugs such as steroids, retinoids, methotrexate, cyclosporine within 30 days of Visit 1 or used FAE or other any biologic agent such as etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab within 12 weeks prior to Visit 1 Patients who are considered potentially unreliable or where it is envisaged the patient may not consistently attend scheduled study visits Patients who are unable to complete a patient diary or complete questionnaires on paper Patients with any other condition or prior/current treatment, which in the opinion of the investigator renders the patient ineligible for the study schedule Pregnancy or breast feeding women Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant unless they use effective contraception during the study. Effective contraception is defined as either: use of established oral, injected or implanted hormonal</criteria>
