	<brief_summary>The Angel™ Catheter combines the functions of a vena cava filter and a multi-lumen central line catheter. The device is designed to be placed in the inferior vena cava via the femoral vein for the prevention of Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and for access to the central venous system. The primary endpoint is freedom from serious adverse events (SAE), defined as death, symptomatic pulmonary embolism or major bleeding .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Subject is 18 years and older 2. Be admitted to the hospital One of the following two criteria: 3. Patients with proven deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism ( PE), at high risk for pulmonary embolism and under consideration for insertion of a retrievable inferior vena cava (IVC) filter with at least one of the following criteria: Contraindications for anticoagulation Recurrent PE despite adequate anticoagulation Emergency treatment following massive pulmonary embolism 4. Patients at high risk for developing PE who require but have a temporary or absolute contraindication for prophylaxis with anticoagulation, including: Patients with multiple trauma and active or recent bleeding with contraindications to anticoagulation or that require a temporary stop of anticoagulation severe head injury with coma severe hemorrhagic stroke with coma head injury with a long bone fracture spinal cord injury with paraplegia or quadriplegia multiple (≥2) long bone fractures with pelvic fracture multiple (≥4) long bone fractures Critically ill patients in the Medical or Surgical Intensive Care Unit with high risk of PE that require but are contraindicated for anticoagulation prophylaxis and will benefit from a temporary filter and a central venous access catheter Patients who had recently undergone or are about to undergo a surgical procedure that requires temporary interruption of anticoagulation for Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) and will benefit from a temporary vena cava filter and central 1.
