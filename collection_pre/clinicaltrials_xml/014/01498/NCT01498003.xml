	<brief_summary>Periprocedural myonecrosis or infarction are associated with short, intermediate, and long term adverse outcomes. Previous study indicated 12.6% of patients suffered a peri-procedural CK-MB rise by overlapping use of drug-eluting stents for long coronary lesions. Here the investigators hypothesize that peri-procedural use of tirofiban could reduce the occurrence of periprocedural infarciton in elective patients with long coronary lesions treated by overlapping use of drug-eluting stents.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>According to the results of 12.6% occurrence of peri-procedural myocardial infarction after long stent implantation by previous report[International Journal of Cardiology 2009;134: 231-237], the investigator hypothesize the 50% reduction of peri-procedural MI by using tirofiban. Three hundred and sixty-nine patients in each group are needed to reach 80% of power with Î± 0.05.</detailed_description>
