	<brief_title>Phase II Study of Gefitinib Plus Nimotuzumab Versus Gefitinib in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), such as gefitinib, were shown to be effective in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, patients almost invariably develop resistance to TKIs and have disease progression. Nimotuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the EGFR. Combining nimotuzumab to gefitinib may not only potentiate cellular cytotoxicity, but may also assist in overcoming inherent or acquired resistance to gefitinib alone.</detailed_description>
