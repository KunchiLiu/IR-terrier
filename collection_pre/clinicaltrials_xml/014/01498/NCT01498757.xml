	<brief_summary>To explore biomarkers predictive of clinical response to Taxane/5-FU/platinum based chemotherapy in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. To identify negative predictive markers to 5-FU/platinum/Taxane. To elucidate signal transduction pathway attributable to 5-FU/platinum/Taxane resistance. To analyze correlation between the quantity of circulating tumor cells and circulating endothelial cell precursors and treatment response to Taxane/5-FU/platinum based chemotherapy.</brief_summary>
