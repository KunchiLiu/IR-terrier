	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures that find residual disease may help predict if the disease will come back in patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. PURPOSE: This research trial studies the comparison of laboratory test results for minimal residual disease in samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of Laboratory Test Results of Minimal-Residual Disease in Samples From Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To promote harmonization between Cooperative Group Reference Laboratories conducting minimal-residual disease (MRD) evaluation of acute myeloid leukemia by flow cytometry. OUTLINE: Archived bone marrow and blood samples, distributed to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, Southwest Oncology Group, and Cancer and Leukemia Group B laboratories, are analyzed for leukemia-associated immunophenotype (LAIP) assays and minimal residual disease studies by flow cytometry. Results are then provided to the National Cancer Institute for assessment and comparability of test results.</detailed_description>
