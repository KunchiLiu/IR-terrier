	<brief_summary>Intra-epidermal nerve fiber density can be assessed using skin biopsy. A decrease of this density is used to diagnose small fiber neuropathy, despite the absence of normative data in a selected normal population. To establish a normative set of data matched for age and sex is absolutely needed to evaluate the sensibility and specificity of this test.</brief_summary>
