	<brief_title>An Observational Drug Utilization Study of Asenapine in the United Kingdom (P08308)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The data source for this study will be the Clinical Practice Research Database (CPRD) in the UK. New users of asenapine during the period following the UK marketing launch of asenapine will be identified in the CPRD. Use in Bipolar Disorder and other indications, as well as baseline demographic and physical characteristics, including prior health status, comorbidities, concomitant medications and healthcare resource utilization, will be described for the asenapine cohort, for participants aged 18 or greater. Use of asenapine in the general practice setting among pediatric participants will be described. The primary comparison cohort will be aripiprazole. Participants in the aripiprazole cohort will be matched to participants treated with asenapine based on respective time after market entry. In addition, non-matched cohorts will be used to describe utilization of aripiprazole and other comparators.</detailed_description>
