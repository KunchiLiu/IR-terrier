	<detailed_description>The present study aims to examine the clinical and financial effects and the patients' perception and satisfaction of home telemedicine support system for diabetes management versus standard (usual) care. In the intervention group the patients will be provided with a blood glucose meter and a mobile phone and their data will be transferred via the mobile to the regional database and will be assessed by the allocated care team. Appropriate counseling on treatment and symptoms or problems related to diabetes will also be provided. Measurements of HbA1c will be taken to assess glycaemic control while the dietary and the exercise habits will be assessed by the use of questionnaires. In addition the patients' satisfaction from the use of the telemedicine service will be studied. A Cost-Effective Analysis and Cost Utility Analysis will be applied to evaluate the tele-health service compared with the usual care from the health and social perspective. The effect of the tele-health service in the organization structure of the outpatient hospital department will be evaluated with a qualitative study.</detailed_description>
