	<brief_summary>A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group multicentre study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol trifenatate (FF/VI) inhalation powder delivered once daily for 12 weeks in the treatment of asthma in adolescent and adult subjects of Asian ancestry currently treated with lowe to mid-strength inhaled corticosteroid or low-strength combination therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol Trifenatate in the Treatment of Asthma in Adolescent and Adult Subjects of Asian Ancestry.</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, multi-centre study. At Visit 1 (Screening Visit) subjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will enter a two week run-in period. Subjects will remain on their current ICS therapy throughout the run-in period. At the end of the run-in period (Visit 2) subjects meeting the Randomisation criteria will enter a 12 week treatment period and receive one of the two following treatments: 1) FF/VI (100/25mcg) administered once daily in the evening via a Novel Dry Powder Inhaler (NDPI) 2) Placebo administered once daily in the evening via a NDPI In addition, all subjects will be supplied with albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol to be used as required to treat asthma symptoms. Subjects who have not met the randomisation criteria at Visit 2 will be withdrawn from the study. Subjects meeting the randomisation criteria will be randomized to one of the two treatment groups and will attend the clinic for 3 on-treatment visits at Week 4 (Visit 3), Week 8 (Visit 4) and Week 12 (Visit 5). Subjects will receive treatment for 12 weeks. A Follow-up Visit or phone call (Visit 6) will take place 1 week after completing study medication. All clinic visits will take place in the morning. Subjects will participate in the study for a maximum of 15 weeks (Screening to Follow-up inclusive). A subject is regarded to have completed the study if they complete all phases of the study (Screening, treatment, Follow-up).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Informed Consent: All subjects must be able and willing to give written informed consent to take part in the study. 2. Type of Subject: Outpatients, of Asian ancestry, 12 years of age or older at Visit 1 (or ≥18 years of age or older if local regulations or the regulatory status of study medication permit enrolment of adults only), with a diagnosis of asthma as defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma [GINA, 2009] at least 12 weeks prior to Visit 1. 3. Gender: Male or Eligible Female, defined as nonchildbearing potential or childbearing potential using a protocol defined acceptable method of birth control consistently and correctly. Female subjects should not be enrolled if they are pregnant, lactating or plan to become pregnant during the time of study participation. A serum pregnancy test is required for females of childbearing potential at the initial Screening Visit (Visit 1) and Visit 5 or Early Withdrawal 4. Severity of Disease: A best FEV1 of 40%90% of the predicted normal value at the Visit 1, Screening visit. Predicted values will be based upon NHANES III using the adjustment for Asians [Hankinson, 2010]. 5. Reversibility of Disease: Demonstrated ≥12% and ≥200mL reversibility of FEV1 within 1040minutes following 24 inhalations of albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol (or one nebulised treatment with albuterol/salbutamol solution) at the Screening Visit. 6. Current AntiAsthma Therapy: All subjects must be using an ICS, with or without LABA, for at least 12 weeks prior to Visit 1, in accordance with the protocol defined acceptable dose ranges. 7. ShortActing Beta2Agonists: All subjects must be able to replace their current shortacting beta2agonists with albuterol/salbutamol inhaler at Visit 1 for use as needed for the duration of the study. Subjects must be able to withhold albuterol/salbutamol for at least 4 hours prior to study visits 1. History of Lifethreatening asthma: Defined for this protocol as an asthma episode that required intubation and/or was associated with hypercapnea, respiratory arrest or hypoxic seizures within the last 10 years. 2. Respiratory Infection: Culturedocumented or suspected bacterial or viral infection of the upper or lower respiratory tract, sinus or middle ear that is not resolved within 4 weeks of Visit 1 and led to a change in asthma management or, in the opinion of the Investigator, is expected to affect the subject's asthma status or the subject's ability to participate in the study. 3. Asthma Exacerbation: Any asthma exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids within 12 weeks of Visit 1 or that resulted in overnight hospitalization requiring additional treatment for asthma within 6 months prior to Visit 1. 4. Concurrent Respiratory Disease: A subject must not have current evidence of pneumonia, pneumothorax, atelectasis, pulmonary fibrotic disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or other respiratory abnormalities other than asthma. 5. Other Concurrent Diseases/Abnormalities: A subjects must not have any clinically significant, uncontrolled condition or disease state that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the patient at risk through study participation or would confound the interpretation of the efficacy results if the condition/disease exacerbated during the study. 6. Oropharyngeal Examination: A subject will not be eligible for the runin if he/she has clinical visual evidence of candidiasis at Visit 1. 7. Allergies: •Drug Allergy: Any adverse reaction including immediate or delayed hypersensitivity to any beta2agonist, sympathomimetic drug, or any intranasal, inhaled, or systemic corticosteroid therapy. Known or suspected sensitivity to the constituents of the new powder inhaler (i.e., lactose or magnesium stearate). •Milk Protein Allergy: History of severe milk protein allergy. 8. Concomitant Medications: Use of the protocol defined prohibited medications prior to Screening (Visit 1) or during the study, in accordance with the protocol. 9. Tobacco Use: Current smoker or subjects with a smoking history of 10 pack years (e.g., 20 cigarettes/day for 10 years). A subject may not have used inhaled tobacco products within the past 3 months (i.e., cigarettes, cigars, smokeless or pipe tobacco). 10. Affiliation with Investigator's Site: A subject will not be eligible for this study if he/she is an immediate family member of the participating Investigator, Sub Investigator, study coordinator, or employee of the participating Investigator. 11. Previous Participation: A subject may not have previously been Randomized to treatment in another Phase III fluticasone furoate/VI combination product study (i.e., HZA113714, HZA106827, HZA106829, HZA106837, HZA106839, HZA106851, HZA113091). 12. Compliance: A subject will not be eligible if he/she or his/her parent or legal guardian has any infirmity, disability, disease, or geographical location which seems likely (in the opinion of the Investigator) to impair compliance with any aspect of this study protocol, including visit schedule and completion of the daily diaries.</criteria>
