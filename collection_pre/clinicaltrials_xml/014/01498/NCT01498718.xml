	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 1b, randomized study in healthy younger (18-50 years) and older (51-70 years) adults to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a prime-boost vaccination regimen with an investigational plasmid DNA vaccine directed towards the 2011/12 influenza vaccine strains as a prime followed 36 weeks later by the 2012/13 influenza trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) as the booster injection, as compared to placebo prime followed by the 2012/13 seasonal TIV. The hypothesis is that the DNA vaccine will be safe for human administration and that the DNA vaccine prime-TIV boost schedule will elicit a better immune response than the seasonal TIV alone.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Vaccines are an effective way of preventing influenza infection and transmission in humans. Although licensed influenza vaccines are available, ways to improve influenza vaccines continue to be studied. Annually, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S FDA make recommendations on the composition of the seasonal influenza vaccine, with recommendations for the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and for the Southern Hemisphere (SH) considered at different times based on epidemiology data. The annually licensed influenza vaccines consist of 3 components: an Influenza A (H1N1) strain, an Influenza A (H3N2) strain, and an influenza B strain. The current U.S. FDA-licensed influenza vaccines depend upon labor-intensive methods that limit manufacturing capacity and which do not induce broad immune responses to various strains of influenza. The vaccine composition requires frequent adjustment for emerging influenza strains. The need for influenza vaccines that are more immunogenic and able to induce a more universal immune response against a broad spectrum of influenza strains is well recognized. Earlier laboratory and clinical studies together suggest that an investigational DNA vaccine encoding for the influenza hemagglutinin protein(HA DNA vaccine) administered as a prime, followed by a boost with a traditional inactivated influenza vaccine, may induce a stronger immune response against various influenza strains and with improved durability. The interval of time between the prime vaccination and the boost vaccination is important for the strength of the immune response. This clinical trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability and immune responses to the investigational HA DNA vaccine prime-TIV boost schedule compared to a placebo prime-TIV boost schedule when the time between the prime and boost is 36 weeks.</detailed_description>
