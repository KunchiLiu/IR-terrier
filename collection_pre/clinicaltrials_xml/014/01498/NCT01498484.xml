	<criteria>Pathologically documented EBV antigen positive lymphoproliferative disease, lymphoma or other EBVassociated malignancy. OR Evaluable disease as demonstrated by clinical and/or radiologic studies with current or prior elevated blood levels of EBV DNA exceeding 500 copies/ml by quantitative real time PCR. OR Persistent or recurrent elevations in levels of EBV DNA exceeding 500 copies/ml in patients previously treated for EBVLPD with chemotherapy and/or rituximab who do not yet have clinically or radiologically evaluable disease but are at high risk of disease recurrence. EBVspecific T cells are available for adoptive immune cell therapy from a consenting third party donor. The third party EBVCTLs to be administered will be selected on the basis of two criteria: 1) that they are matched for at least 2 HLA antigens and 2) that they are restricted by an allele shared with the EBV+ malignancy (if known), or with the donor in HSCT recipients, or patient in organ transplant or immunodeficient patients KPS or Lansky score ≥ 20. A life expectancy of at least 6 weeks. Adequate bone marrow, heart, lung, liver and kidney function at the time of treatment with EBVspecificT cells is initiated, including: 1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000/µL, with or without GCSF support 2. Platelets ≥ 20,000/µL 3. Creatinine ≤ 2.0mg/dl 4. ALT, AST &lt; 3.0x and total bilirubin &lt; 2.5x the institutional ULN 5. Stable blood pressure and circulation not requiring pressor support 6. Adequate cardiac function as demonstrated by EKG and/or echocardiographic evidence (may be performed within 30 days prior to treatment) However, abnormalities of specific organs will not be considered grounds for exclusion if they are the result of the EBV+ malignancy or its treatment (e.g. a renal allograft recipient with an EBV LPD may be on dialysis because the allograft was rejected when the immune suppression was stopped as a first approach to treatment of the EBV LPD). At the discretion of the investigator, patients with elevated but stable creatinine will not be precluded from treatment on study. There is no age restriction to eligibility for this protocol. It is expected that five types of patients afflicted with EBVassociated lymphomas, lymphoproliferative diseases or malignancies will be referred and will consent to participate in this trial. These are: 1. Patients developing EBV lymphomas or lymphoproliferative disorders following an allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor stem cell transplant (HSCT) (ie, marrow, PBSC, or umbilical cord blood). 2. Patients developing EBV lymphomas or lymphoproliferative disorders following an allogeneic organ transplant. 3. Patients with AIDS developing EBV lymphomas or lymphoproliferative diseases as a consequence of the profound acquired immunodeficiency induced by HIV. 4. Patients who develop EBV lymphomas or lymphoproliferative diseases or other EBVassociated malignancy as a consequence of profound immunodeficiencies associated with a congenital immune deficit or acquired as a sequela of antineoplastic or immunosuppressive therapy. 5. Patients who develop other EBVassociated malignancies without preexisting immune deficiency, including: EBV+ Hodgkin's and NonHodgkin's disease, EBV+ nasopharyngeal carcinoma, EBV+ hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, or EBV+ leiomyosarcoma. The following patients will be excluded from this study: Patients with active (grade 24) acute graft vs. host disease (GVHD), chronic GVHD or an overt autoimmune disease (e.g. hemolytic anemia) requiring high doses of glucocorticosteroid (&gt;0.5 mg/kg/day prednisone or its equivalent) as treatment Patients who are pregnant Patients with severe comorbidities, not related to their EBVassociated malignancy, that would be expected to preclude their survival for the 6 weeks required to assess response of T cell therapy Patients eligible for MSK protocol #16803 (EBVCTL201)</criteria>
