	<brief_title>Retreatment of Recurrent Dupuytren's Contractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Open-label, Phase 4 study in subjects who are currently participating in the long-term follow-up study (ie, AUX-CC-860) in the United States, Australia, or Europe and who have recurrence of contracture (ie, joint contracture increases by at least 20 degrees compared with the Day 30 value after the last injection in a Phase 3 Auxilium-sponsored study and a palpable cord present) in a joint that was effectively treated (ie, reduction in contracture to 5 degrees or less 30 days after the last injection) with AA4500 in a Phase 3 Auxilium-sponsored study. Subjects who experience recurrence of contracture in one or more effectively treated joints may be enrolled in this retreatment study after the investigator determines subject eligibility and after informed consent has been obtained. The investigator will treat the cord affecting the recurrent joint with up to three injections. Only one recurrent joint will be treated in this study.</detailed_description>
