	<brief_summary>This project aims to evaluate the physiological effects of Midodrine administration during orthostatic challenge in those with high level spinal cord injury. Midodrine has been shown to improve orthostatic symptoms in those with spinal cord injury but the physiological mechanisms influenced have not been identified. The investiagtors will examine key physiological components influencing orthostatic tolerance. The investiagtors will do this, by measuring the baroreflex, and brain blood flow autoregulation (the ability to maintain brain blood flow) before during and after the sit-up test. Two sit-up tests will occur; one before Midodrine administration, and one after administration of a 10mg dose of Midodrine.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>To be included in the study, participants must have sustained a traumatic spinal cord injury within the ages of 1849 years. Also, participants must have an injury level above the 6th thoracic vertebrae and be a nonsmoker for a minimum of one year. Any participants with a history of cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease or diabetes mellitus will not be eligible. Also, participants will not be eligible to take part in study if they experiences acute distress, or are taking medications known to influence cardiovascular function. Patient will be not eligible for the study if he/she has known adverse reaction to Midodrine.</criteria>
