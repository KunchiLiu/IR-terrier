	<brief_summary>In this study, the investigators would like to assess how intravesical BCG schedules after immunization of non muscle invasive bladder patients with the recMAGE-A3 protein, together with adjuvant AS15 (recMAGE-A3 + AS15 ASCI), may enhance innate and vaccine-specific T cell responses both systemically and locally in the bladder.</brief_summary>
