	<detailed_description>PGRx is an information system that intends to bridge the resource gap to assess the effect of a drug on the risk of adverse events that are infrequent and/or with a long delay of onset. It uses some characteristics of the ad hoc case-control or case-referent design, transposed on a prospective, on-going, population-based recruitment plan. This particular design is called here systematic case-referent design in contrast to the ad hoc case-control or case-referent methodology. The PGRx information system is based on the routine and targeted recruitment of cases of a series of pathologies, compared to population-based referents for the study of exposure to a wide variety of drugs. Drug exposure ascertainment is obtained from two different sources in the PGRx. system: A) A structured patient interview (telephone-administered questionnaire) B) The medical data form with the computerized medical prescriptions (interview guide)</detailed_description>
