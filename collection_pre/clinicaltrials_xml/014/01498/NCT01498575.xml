	<brief_summary>The long-term goal of this research is to increase safe driving among novice teen drivers by increasing the quantity, quality and diversity of driving practice while accompanied by an adult. In order to achieve the long term goal of the study, the investigators have developed a web-based intervention program known as Teen Driving Plan (TDP) intended to support high quality driving practice.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Evaluation of a Web-based Intervention Program for Parents and Teens to Promote Safe Driving</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Motor vehicle crashes remain the number one cause of death among teens in the United States. Teen drivers (ages 16 to 19) are four times more likely to be involved in fatal crashes than adult drivers (ages 25 to 69). Inexperience is a fundamental factor in the high crash rate for novice teens. Safe and skilled driving is a complex task that involves behaviors (e.g., skills and actions) that vary and become increasingly challenging with increasing speed, unsafe road conditions and other hazards of the driving environment. Because teens are at their lowest lifetime risk of crashing when accompanied by an adult, adult-supervised practice provides a safe way for teens to gain needed experience under a variety of driving conditions. Unfortunately, few teens receive sufficient quantity, quality and diversity of adult-supervised practice prior to licensure. The objective of the proposed research is to compare how the driving training process and the results of that training process differ between a group of young learning permit holders in families that have access to TDP (the intervention group) from the training process and the results of that process in an otherwise similar group of teens in families with no TDP access (the control group). The investigators hypothesize that teens given access to TDP will demonstrate greater competence and safety in a standardized on-road driving assessment than teens with no TDP access.</detailed_description>
