	<brief_summary>The SURPRISE study investigates atrial fibrillation(AFIB) in patients with a previous unexplained stroke. It uses long term monitoring of the heart of up to three years, searching for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation(PAF) otherwise undetected in this population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Finding Atrial Fibrillation in Patients With Unexplained Stroke Using Longterm Cardiac Monitoring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The SURPRISE study investigates the patients with cryptogenic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), monitoring them with a cardiac loop recorder for up to three years. it aims at estimating the amount of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation within our population of cryptogenic stroke patients. Standard workup for a stroke patient does offer cardiac evaluation, but monitoring is limited to the time admitted, often just a few days.</detailed_description>
