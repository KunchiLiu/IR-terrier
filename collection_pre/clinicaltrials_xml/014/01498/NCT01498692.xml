	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the PROMUS Element™ Everolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System for the treatment of patients with up to 2 de novo atherosclerotic coronary artery lesions. The lesions can be located in vessels that are smaller than average-sized.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The PLATINUM Clinical Trial to Assess the PROMUS Element Stent System for Treatment of De Novo Coronary Artery Lesions in Small Vessels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The wide-spread use of drug-eluting stents (DES) has evolved as standard of care in de novo lesions. The proposed study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of PROMUS Element for the treatment of de novo atherosclerotic lesions in native coronary arteries. The study design is consistent with the draft guidance for industry titled, "Coronary Drug-Eluting Stents - Nonclinical and Clinical Studies" (March 2008). During the trial, thienopyridines must be administered according to the 2007 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA)/Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) guidelines, which recommended that clopidogrel (75 mg daily) or ticlopidine (250 mg twice daily) be prescribed after stent implantation for at least 6 months in all patients, and for at least 12 months in patients who are not at high risk of bleeding. For sites in the United States, the use of prasugrel is not allowed as part of the PLATINUM Clinical Trial. For sites in other countries, prasugrel may be prescribed according to its approved dosing in countries in which it is available. For patients taking aspirin daily a loading dose is recommended; for patients who have not been taking aspirin daily, aspirin must be administered as a loading dose. Patients continue to take aspirin indefinitely to reduce the risk of thrombosis. This PLATINUM Small Vessel study is a sub-trial associated with the PLATINUM Workhorse Randomized Controlled Trial, which is registered under NCT00823212.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient must be at least 18 years of age Patient (or legal guardian) understands study requirements and treatment procedures and provides written informed consent before any studyspecific tests or procedures are performed For patients less than 20 years of age enrolled at a Japanese site, patient and patient's legal representative must provide written informed consent before any studyspecific tests or procedures are performed Patient is eligible for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) Patient has documented stable angina pectoris or documented silent ischemia; or unstable angina pectoris Patient is an acceptable candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) Patient has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt;=30% as measured within 30 days prior to enrollment Patient is willing to comply with all protocolrequired followup evaluations Angiographic Inclusion Criteria (visual estimate): Target lesion must be a de novo lesion located in a native coronary artery with a visually estimated reference vessel diameter ≥2.25 mm and &lt;2.5 mm. Target lesion length must measure ≤28 mm by visual estimate. Target lesion must be located in a major coronary artery or branch with visually estimated stenosis ≥50% and &lt;100% with Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow &gt;1. Patient has clinical symptoms and/or electrocardiogram (ECG) changes consistent with acute myocardial infarction (MI) Patient has had a known diagnosis of recent MI (ie, within 72 hours prior to index procedure) and has elevated enzymes at time of index procedure as follows. Patients are excluded if any of the following criteria are met at time of the index procedure. If creatine kinasemyoglobin band (CKMB) &gt;2× upper limit of normal (ULN), the patient is excluded regardless of CK Total. If CKMB is 12× ULN, the patient is excluded if the CK Total is &gt;2× ULN. If CK Total/CK MB are not used and Troponin is, patients are excluded if the following criterion is met at time of index procedure. Troponin &gt;1× ULN with at least one of the following. Patient has ischemic symptoms and ECG changes indicative of ongoing ischemia (eg, &gt;1 mm ST segment elevation or depression in consecutive leads or new left bundle branch block [LBBB]); Development of pathological Q waves in the ECG; or Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality. Note: For patients with unstable angina or patients who have had a recent MI, CK Total/CK MB (or Troponin if CK Total/CK MB are not used) must be documented prior to enrolling/randomizing the patient. Patient has received an organ transplant or is on a waiting list for an organ transplant Patient is receiving or scheduled to receive chemotherapy within 30 days before or after index procedure Patient is receiving oral or intravenous immunosuppressive therapy (ie, inhaled steroids are not excluded) or has known lifelimiting immunosuppressive or autoimmune disease (eg, human immunodeficiency virus, systemic lupus erythematosus, but not including diabetes mellitus) Patient is receiving chronic (&gt;=72 hours) anticoagulation therapy (eg, heparin, coumadin) for indications other than acute coronary syndrome Patient has platelet count &lt;100,000 cells/mm3 or &gt;700,000 cells/mm3 Patient has white blood cell (WBC) count &lt;3,000 cells/mm3 Patient has documented or suspected liver disease, including laboratory evidence of hepatitis Patient is on dialysis or has known renal insufficiency (ie, estimated creatinine clearance &lt;50 ml/min by the Cockcroft Gault formula, or [(140age)*lean body weight (in kg)]/[plasma creatinine (mg/dl)*72]) Patient has history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or will refuse blood transfusions Patient has had a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within past 6 months, or has any permanent neurologic defect that may cause noncompliance with the protocol Target vessel(s) or side branch has been treated with any type of PCI (eg, balloon angioplasty, stent, cutting balloon, atherectomy) within 12 months prior to index procedure Target vessel(s) has been treated within 10 mm proximal or distal to target lesion (by visual estimate) with any type of PCI (eg, balloon angioplasty, stent, cutting balloon, atherectomy) at any time prior to index procedure Nontarget vessel or side branch has been treated with any type of PCI (eg, balloon angioplasty, stent, cutting balloon, atherectomy) within 24 hours prior to index procedure Planned or actual target vessel(s) treatment with an unapproved device, directional or rotational coronary atherectomy, laser, cutting balloon, or transluminal extraction catheter immediately prior to stent placement Planned PCI or CABG after index procedure Patient previously treated at any time with coronary intravascular brachytherapy Patient has a known allergy to the study stent system or protocolrequired concomitant medications (eg, stainless steel, platinum, cobalt, chromium, nickel, tungsten, acrylic, fluoropolymers, everolimus, thienopyridines, aspirin, contrast) that cannot be adequately premedicated Patient has active peptic ulcer or active gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding Patient has one of the following.
