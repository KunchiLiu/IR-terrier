	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of telaprevir administered as 750 mg every 8 hours (q8h) in combination with pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN)-alfa-2a and ribavirin (RBV) in treatment-na誰ve and treatment-experienced Russian participants with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open-Label, Bridging Study of Telaprevir in Treatment-Na誰ve and Treatment-Experienced Russian Patients With Genotype 1 Chronic Hepatitis C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (all persons know the study drug assignment), multicenter study in treatment-na誰ve (participant did not receive any previous treatment for the treatment of hepatitis C) and treatment-experienced (participant did receive previous treatment for hepatitis C) Russian participants with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C. After a screening period of approximately 4 weeks, participants will be treated for 12 weeks with telaprevir 750 mg every 8 hours in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa-2a and RBV followed by 12 or 36 weeks of treatment with Peg-IFN-alfa-2a and RBV alone depending on their liver disease status, response to previous treatment and individual virologic response during treatment in this study. After the treatment period, there is a follow-up phase of at least 12 weeks.</detailed_description>
