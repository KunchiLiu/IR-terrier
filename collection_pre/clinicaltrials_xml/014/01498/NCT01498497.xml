	<brief_summary>This purpose of this study is the long-term follow-up of glucocorticosteroid-related adverse events and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) suppression in subjects after discontinuation of study drug received in the PR-021 study (Safety and Tolerability Study of Oral EUR-1100 to Treat Eosinophilic Esophagitis). The study will also provide the opportunity to better understand the natural course of eosinophilic esophagitis and define the treatment modalities of eosinophilic esophagitis with EUR-1100, such as the need for chronic maintenance or intermittent treatment. All subjects who complete PR-021 will be offered the opportunity to participate in this study. The duration of this follow-up study is six months, during which subjects will visit the clinic for safety evaluation and clinical symptom assessment at the screening, Week 8, Week 16, and Week 24 visits. Additional phone visits will occur at Week 4, Week 12, and Week 20.</brief_summary>
