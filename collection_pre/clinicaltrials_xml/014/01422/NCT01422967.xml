	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the major health problems and their prevalence has increased in recent decades. It has been shown that OA causes negative effects on sleep and that these changes in sleep see to be correlated with the function and physical performance of patients with OA. However, no study to date has demonstrated the effects of sleep changes in sensorimotor control and systemic inflammatory response in patients with OA. The objective of this study is to assess the influence of sleep changes in sensorimotor control (postural and neuromuscular control) and inflammatory markers (cytokines) in patients with knee OA grade I or II. Participate in this study, 60 male volunteers, aged between 40 and 65. These volunteers will be divided into four groups: Group 1 (n = 15): Osteoarthritis and good quality sleep, Group 2 (n = 15): Osteoarthritis and poor quality sleep, Group 3 (n = 15): Without good and Osteoarthritis quality of sleep, Group 4 (n = 15): Without Osteoarthritis and poor quality of sleep. All volunteers will perform a polysomnography to detect the presence or not of changes in sleep. Further testing on the isokinetic dynamometer to evaluate the acceleration time, maximum isometric torque and isokinetic concentric and eccentric maximum quadriceps muscle strength and a submaximal test to evaluate neuromuscular control. Also there will be a test on the force platform to assess the uni-and bipedal postural control, as well as respond to the WOMAC questionnaire that assesses the quality of life in patients with OA. Blood will be collected for analysis of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-10, TGF-beta). The significance level is 5% (p â‰¤ 0.05).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The experimental design of each volunteer (all groups) will be evaluated by a physician before beginning the study and posteriomente will perform a polysomnography. The day after polysomnography voluntary blood will be collected. A week after the volunteer will perform the balance test (force platform) and the test of strength (isokinetic).</detailed_description>
