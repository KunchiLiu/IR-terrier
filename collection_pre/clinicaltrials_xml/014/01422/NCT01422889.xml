	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compile real-world clinical outcomes data for the ION™ Paclitaxel-Eluting Platinum Chromium Coronary Stent System in routine clinical practice.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ION US Post-Approval Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ION™ stent is the third-generation Boston Scientific (BSC) paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent. It is designed for improved performance specific to deliverability and radio-opacity while maintaining a similar drug release profile of the TAXUS Express and TAXUS Liberté stents. Following PMA approval from the FDA for the ION™ Paclitaxel-Eluting Platinum Chromium Coronary Stent System the ION US Post-Approval study will compile real-world clinical outcomes data for the ION™ Paclitaxel-Eluting Platinum Chromium Coronary Stent System in routine clinical practice. Post-approval studies of drug-eluting stents (DES) provide an opportunity to observe and assess patient outcomes and technology performance in a real-world setting.</detailed_description>
