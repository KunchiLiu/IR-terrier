	<brief_summary>This study is a multi-site, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial to assess the safety and effectiveness of plasticity-based, adaptive, computerized-based cognitive remediation treatment versus a computer-based control. The investigators proposed that a computerized cognitive remediation program based upon the principles of brain plasticity may improve information processing and thus drive clinically significant improvements in cognitive and functional performance in individuals with schizophrenia.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The symptoms of schizophrenia fall into three main categories: positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and cognitive symptoms. Each category represents distinct functional challenges and impedes patient productivity and overall quality of life. Cognitive symptoms are pervasive and result in deficits in executive functioning (the ability to understand information and use it to make decisions), attention (the ability to identify, select, and focus on relevant sensory events), and working memory (the ability to hold information in memory and then guide actions from it). These symptoms impair patients' abilities to successfully perform everyday activities, including independent living, employment, and social relationships, and in addition can cause great emotional distress. Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia has now received substantial academic study, with over 24,000 research papers published in the field since 1990. This enormous body of work has shown that cognitive impairment is likely to be present in virtually all patients with schizophrenia, regardless of their severity of illness or treatment status. People with schizophrenia typically perform 1-2 standard deviations below the mean of age-matched controls (indicating substantial impairment) across the domains of speed of information processing, attention, working memory, verbal and visual learning, reasoning and social cognition. While cognitive impairment in schizophrenia was originally assumed to be secondary to positive or negative symptoms of the disorder, or related to the use of anti-psychotic medications, recent research has conclusively shown that neither of these past assumptions is true. For example, the landmark Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) trial involving 1,493 participants demonstrated that negative symptoms are only mildly correlated with cognitive function, and that positive symptoms are completely uncorrelated with cognitive function. Furthermore, research has shown that cognitive impairment is evident in people with schizophrenia before they are medicated, prior to diagnosis, and in first-degree relatives of people diagnosed with schizophrenia; indicating that medication is not the cause of cognitive impairment. In aggregate, these data have established the well-accepted current viewpoint that cognitive dysfunction is a core primary symptom and deficit in schizophrenia.</detailed_description>
