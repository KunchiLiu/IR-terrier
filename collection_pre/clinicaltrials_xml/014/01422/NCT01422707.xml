	<brief_title>Effect of Short Term Adrenal Suppression on Androgen Overproduction in Overweight Girls With Androgen Excess</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will test whether short-term suppression of adrenal function can ameliorate androgen (male hormone) overproduction in overweight girls with androgen excess. The investigators hypothesize that one month of oral hydrocortisone administration will improve androgen levels in girls with adrenal androgen overproduction. Specifically, this intervention will improve androgen levels after adrenal stimulation testing with adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH).</detailed_description>
