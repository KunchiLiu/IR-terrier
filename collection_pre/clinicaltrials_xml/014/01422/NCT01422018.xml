	<brief_summary>Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) on focal edema with hard exudates secondary to diabetic retinopathy. Design: Prospective interventional case series. Participants: Ten eyes of 10 consecutive patients showing focal edema with hard exudates secondary to diabetic retinopathy which are not eligible for focal laser photocoagulation due to central location (&lt; 500 µm from fovea).</brief_summary>
