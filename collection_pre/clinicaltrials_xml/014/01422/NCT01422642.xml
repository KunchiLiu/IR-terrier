	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if there are any clinical or ROM differences in total knee arthroplasty with standard NexGen LPS prosthesis and NexGen LPS-Flex prosthesis.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Do We Need High-Flexing Total Knee Arthroplasty to Improve the Survivorship and to Decrease the Incidence of Osteolysis?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We therefore hypothesized: (1) the survival of the NexGen LPS-Flex prosthesis is better than standard NexGen LPS prosthesis; (2) knee function and range of motion after clinical assessment will be better in the NexGen LPS-Flex group; and (3) the incidence of osteolysis will be lower in the NexGen LPS-Flex prosthesis than standard NexGTne LPS prosthesis.</detailed_description>
