	<brief_summary>The investigators demonstrated that cholestyramine is an effective binding agent in vitro for porphyrins. A few isolated case reports of treatment of individuals with a cutaneous porphyria suggest that cholestyramine and colestipol effectively remove porphyrins. Hypothesis: orally administered colestipol will effectively lower erythrocyte porphyrin concentrations in subjects with erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP).</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Four adults with proven EPP volunteered as subjects for this study. Initial phase (pre-Rx): CBC; liver chemistries including cholesterol; serum iron, TIBC and ferritin; erythrocyte and plasma protoporphyrin concentrations; and completion of questionnaire focused on cutaneous manifestations are completed at weeks 2 and 4. Treatment Phase 1: colestipol tablets, 1 gram in morning and 1 gram at bedtime for 3 months, with repetition of same tests at end of months 2 and 3. Treatment Phase 2: colestipol tablets, 2 grams in morning and 2 grams at bedtime for 3 months, with repetition of same tests at end of months 2 and 3. Post-Treatment - repetition of same tests at end of months 1, 2 and 3.</detailed_description>
