	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study of Telintra® in Deletion 5q Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study TLK199.2107 is a multicenter, single arm, open-label Phase 2 study of oral ezatiostat (Telintra®) in patients with lenalidomide (Revlimid®) refractory or resistant, red blood cell (RBC) transfusion-dependent, Low to Intermediate-1 IPSS risk, del5q Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). Independence from red blood cell transfusions, improvement in the levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, and the response of the bone marrow were evaluated. Patients received a starting dose of 2000 mg total daily dose in divided doses (1000 mg orally twice daily for three weeks (21 days) on therapy followed by a one-week (7 days) off therapy rest period in four-week (28 days) treatment cycles. Patients continued treatment until documentation of lack of MDS response, MDS progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal from the study.</detailed_description>
