	<brief_summary>ENCHANTED is an independent, investigator initiated, international collaborative, quasi-factorial randomised controlled trial involving a package of 2 linked comparative randomised treatment arms, which aims to address 4 key questions in patients eligible for thrombolysis in the acute phase of ischaemic stroke. (1) Does low-dose (0.6 mg/kg) intravenous (i.v.) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) provide equivalent benefits compared to standard-dose (0.9 mg/kg) rtPA? (2) Does intensive blood pressure (BP) lowering (130-140 mmHg systolic target) improve outcomes compared to the current guideline recommended level of BP control (180 mmHg systolic target)? (3) Does low-dose (0.6 mg/kg) intravenous (i.v.) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) reduce the risk of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (sICH)? (4) Does the addition of intensive BP lowering to thrombolysis with rtPA reduce the risk of any intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH)? The rtPA dose arm of the study addressing questions (1) and (3) concluded with a publication of the results in May 2016. The BP intensity arm of the study is ongoing.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study is an international, multicentre, prospective, fixed-time point (optional) randomisation for two arms ([A] 'dose of rtPA' and [B] 'level of BP control'), open, blinded endpoint (PROBE), controlled trial that will involve over 4700 patients (3310 for rtPA arm {recruitment completed in August 2015} and 2304 for BP arm with 939 overlap) with acute ischaemic stroke recruited from over 100+ Clinical Centres from Australia, Asia, Europe and South America.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult (age ≥18 years) A clinical diagnosis of acute ischaemic stroke confirmed by brain imaging Able to receive treatment within 4.5 hours after the definite time of onset of symptoms Have a systolic BP ≤185 mmHg Provide informed consent (or via an appropriate proxy, according to local requirements) Specific criteria for arm [A] of lowdose vs standarddose rtPA (Recruitment completed in August 2015.): Able to receive either lowdose or standarddose rtPA Specific criteria for arm [B] of intensive BP lowering vs guideline recommended BP control Patient will or has received thrombolysis treatment with rtPA, either randomised dose within the trial or physician decided dose rtPA outside of the trial Sustained elevated systolic BP level, defined as 2 readings ≥ 150 mmHg Able to commence intensive BP lowering treatment within 6 hours of stroke onset Able to receive either immediate intensive BP lowering or conservative BP management Unlikely to potentially benefit from the therapy (e.g. advanced dementia), or a very high likelihood of death within 24 hours of stroke onset. Other medical illness that interferes with outcome assessments and followup [known significant prestroke disability (mRS scores 25)]. Specific contraindications to rtPA (Actilyse) or any of the blood pressure agents to be used. Participation in another clinical trial involving evaluation of pharmacological agents. Need for following concomitant medication, including phosphodiesterase inhibitors and monoamine oxidase inhibitors.</criteria>
