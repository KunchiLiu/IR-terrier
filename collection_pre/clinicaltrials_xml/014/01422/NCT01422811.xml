	<brief_summary>1. Background: In recent years an increasing trend in excessive lengths of stay has been recorded at the Parma University Hospital, compared with regional mean values. Excessive lengths of stay have been demonstrated to constitute not just an economic problem, but also a clinical and public health issue. Since the measures taken at our institution so far have not proven effective, the investigators carried out a literature review, which mostly detected observational studies, restricted to the assessment of the impact of a single intervention. 2. Objectives: This project intends to evaluate the effectiveness of a multifaceted strategy aiming to empower clinicians on the issues associated with excessively long and avoidable hospital stays, and enable them to identify corrective measures (according to the principles of clinical governance). 3. Study design: cluster-randomized, parallel group, open-label, community trial 4. Methods: trained personnel will periodically record causes for excessive lengths of stay in all participating wards using an ad hoc data collection sheet. In the wards randomized to the experimental group, interventions aimed to clinician empowerment - provision of reminders and periodical audits - will be implemented. 5. Expected results: A reduction in the experimental vs. the control arm unnecessary lengths of stay is expected, although the introduced measures will also presumably lead to improvement in the wards where they are not implemented.</brief_summary>
