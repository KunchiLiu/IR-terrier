	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Eslicarbazepine Acetate as Adjunctive Therapy for Partial Seizures in Elderly Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multicenter study in approximately 100 elderly patients. The study will follow an open-label design and will consist of 8-week baseline period, followed by a 26-week treatment period and a 4-week follow-up period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Written informed consent form; 2. Of age 65 years or older; 3. A documented diagnosis of epilepsy for at least 12 months, 4. At least 2 partialonset seizures (including subtypes of simple partial, complex partial and/or partial seizures evolving to secondarily generalised) in the 4 weeks prior to screening; 5. Currently treated with 1 or 2 AEDs (any except oxcarbazepine) in a stable dosage regimen for at least 4 weeks prior to screening. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is to be considered as an AED (i.e., only one concomitant AED is allowed in patients with VNS); 6. Willing and able to comply with all trial requirements, in the judgment of the investigator; 7. At least 2 partialonset seizures (documented in the diary) per 4 weeks during the 8week baseline period; 8. Satisfactorily complied with the study requirements during the baseline period 1. Only simple partial seizures with no motor symptomatology (classified as A24) according to the International Classification of Epileptic Seizures); 2. Primarily generalised seizures; 3. Known progressive neurological disorders (progressive brain disease, epilepsy secondary to progressive central nervous system lesion) and progressive dementia; 4. Occurrence of seizures too close to count accurately; 5. History of status epileptic or cluster seizures 8i.e. 3 or more seizures within 30 minutes) within the 3 months prior to screening; 6. Seizures of nonepileptic origin; 7. Major psychiatric disorders; 8. History of suicide attempt; 9. Currently treated with oxcarbazepine; 10. Previous use of ESL or participation in a clinical study with ESL; 11. Known hypersensitivity to other carboxamide derivatives (e.g. oxcarbazepine, carbamazepine) or to any of the excipients; 12. Uncontrolled cardiac, renal, hepatic, endocrine, gastrointestinal, metabolic, haematological or oncology disorder, hypo or hyper thyroidism of any type; 13. Second or thirddegree atrioventricular blockade or any clinically significant abnormality in the 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) as determined by the investigator; 14. Relevant clinical laboratory abnormalities as determined by the investigator (e.g. plasma sodium &lt;130 mmol/L, alanine or aspartate aminotransferases &gt;2.0 times above the upper limit of the range, or white blood cell count &lt;3,000 cells/mm3; 15. Calculated creatinine values &lt; 30 mL/min at screening; 16. Any other condition or circumstance that, in the opinion of the investigator, may compromise the patient's ability to comply with the study protocol; 17. Received an investigational drug (or a medical device) within 3 months of screening or is currently participating in another trial of an investigational drug (or medical device) trial.</criteria>
