	<brief_summary>There are many different factors that cause acne. So combination treatment using different medications that can address these different factors is commonly used to treat acne. Fixed-dose combination clindamycin phosphate 1.2% and tretinoin 0.025% gel and benzoyl peroxide 6% foaming cloths are both used to treat acne. This study will evaluate the use of the medications when used together.</brief_summary>
