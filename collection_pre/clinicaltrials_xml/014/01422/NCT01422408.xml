	<brief_title>Fluocinonide Cream in Treating Symptoms of Vaginal Dryness and Painful Sexual Intercourse In Patients With Breast Cancer Undergoing Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the decrease in symptoms of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia with the use of fluocinonide 0.05% cream in breast cancer subjects and subjects at increased risk for breast cancer on endocrine therapy. Estimates of decrease will be obtained utilizing patient survey instruments. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the decrease in symptoms of vaginal itching and the total vaginal index score with the use of fluocinonide 0.05% cream in breast cancer subjects and subjects at increased risk for breast cancer on endocrine therapy. Estimates of decrease will be obtained utilizing patient survey instruments. II. To explore toxicities reported by subjects using fluocinonide 0.05% cream via vaginal application. III. To explore correlation between subject reported compliance, as well as compliance via measurement of the amount of fluocinonide 0.05% cream used, and response rates with the use of fluocinonide 0.05% cream. IV. To explore the correlations between patient characteristics and response rates with the use of fluocinonide 0.05% cream. OUTLINE: Patients apply topical fluocinonide cream twice daily (BID) in weeks 1-2 and once daily (QD) in weeks 3-4.</detailed_description>
