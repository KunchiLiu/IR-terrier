	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to develop and pilot test a smoking cessation counseling that focuses on the perceived risks of quitting smoking (e.g., weight gain, managing cravings and negative affect, loss of enjoyment). Aim 1: To develop the risk-based smoking cessation intervention. Aim 2: To examine whether manualized smoking cessation counseling about the perceived risks of quitting is feasible to administer and acceptable to adult women who want to quit smoking. Aim 3: To examine smoking cessation outcomes for women who receive the risk-based treatment in comparison to standard smoking counseling. It is expected that women who receive risk-based counseling will show better quit rates and a longer time to relapse than women who receive standard treatment.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose of this treatment development study is to design and pilot test a smoking cessation intervention in which counseling sessions are tailored to individual smokers' perceived risks of quitting. The feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of the novel treatment will be examined through a pilot study in which female smokers will be randomly assigned to receive either the tailored treatment or a standard treatment. It is expected that participants receiving the tailored treatment will show higher rates of smoking abstinence than participants receiving the standard smoking cessation treatment at the end of the 8-week treatment and at one month follow-up.</detailed_description>
