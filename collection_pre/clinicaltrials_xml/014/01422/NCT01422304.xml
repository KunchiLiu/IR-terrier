	<brief_summary>This study will assess the effect of reversal of neuromuscular blockade with sugammadex compared with reversal according to usual care (neostigmine or spontaneous reversal) on the incidence of post-surgical bleeding events and on coagulation parameters in participants undergoing hip fracture surgery or joint (hip/knee) replacement surgery with neuromuscular blockage induced by rocuronium or vecuronium.</brief_summary>
