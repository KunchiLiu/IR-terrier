	<brief_summary>At present, trabeculectomy is the most common performed and effective surgical method of filtration surgery for patients with medically uncontrolled glaucoma. The aim of this prospective observational case study is to determine changes of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness using spectral domain optical coherence tomography in patients with glaucoma after surgical reduction of intraocular pressure.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Changes of the Peripapillary Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer After Filtration Surgery in Glaucoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Baseline and postoperative measurement of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness will be performed using the following spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT): Cirrus™ HD-OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec) and Spectralis® Heidelberg-Engineering. The main outcome measures will be changes in overall and quadrant RNFL thickness with respect to reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP), correlation between RNFL thickness and alteration in visual field and predictive factors of postoperative IOP-reduction and changes of RNFL thickness.</detailed_description>
