	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to compare the immune response of two different injection methods (Intramuscular V.S. Subcutaneous) of the 2011-2012 seasonal Influenza (Flu) vaccine among patients with neuromuscular conditions who have significant muscle degeneration. This research study hypothesizes that the subcutaneous route of vaccine administration, as compared to the intramuscular route, may confer at least comparable, or possibly better, immunogenicity. At least 30 individuals followed by the CCHMC Neuromuscular Comprehensive Care Center will be recruited to participate in this study lasting approximately one to two months with two clinic visits and one follow-up telephone call. Immunogenicity will be assessed by comparing hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody titers obtained pre- and post-vaccination.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Nonambulatory; Quadriceps muscle strength of MRC (Medical Research Council Scale) grade 3 or below Any subject who is between 3 to 8 years of age must have received at least two doses of influenza vaccine last season or at least one dose tow or more years ago. Subject must not have a history of severe reactions following previous immunization with influenza vaccine. Subject must not have previously received a 20112012 influenza vaccine. Subject must not have a history of GuillainBarre syndrome. Subject must not have received a live viral vaccine (i.e., MMR, varicella) within 28 days prior to receipt of the study vaccine. Subject must not have any condition that the investigator believes would render vaccination unsafe or interfere with successful completion of the study.</criteria>
