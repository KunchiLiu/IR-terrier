	<brief_summary>This study will test 200 people to see if an experimental nasal spray has an effect on symptoms of the common cold if used when the symptoms start. At the first visit to the clinic, potential subjects will have tests to make sure they qualify to participate in the study. If they qualify, they will have an equal chance of receiving the experimental nasal spray or a sham nasal spray (one that does not have the experimental formula). At the first visit, subjects will receive their assigned nasal spray and use it once at the clinic. They will also receive a booklet called a diary. Subjects will take the rest of their treatments for day 1 at home, and for the next six days, they will use the nasal spray four times per day and record their symptoms in the diary, as instructed. Then subjects will come back to the clinic for a final visit.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study of an Experimental Nasal Spray in Subjects With Early Signs of the Common Cold</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an investigation in healthy subjects with early signs of common cold. Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Polymeric Nasal Spray or a matching placebo nasal spray. Subjects will be screened for eligibility and randomized to treatment at the Screening/ Randomization Visit (Day 1). Subjects will apply the first dose of the nasal spray at this visit under supervision. The other applications will take place at home on Day 1. On Days 2 through 7, subjects will use their assigned nasal spray as 2 sprays per nostril, 4 times per day. One Follow up Visit will be conducted within 3 days of the last application of nasal spray. Enrollment will continue until 200 subjects have completed the investigation (100 per treatment group). The subject and the investigative staff will be blinded to the assigned nasal spray. Efficacy will be measured, and recorded in the subject's diary, and safety will be assessed by reported AEs and ADEs.</detailed_description>
