	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Low-dose cytarabine works in a minority of elderly patients with an acute myeloid leukemia unfit for intensive induction therapy by killing of leukemia cells. Addition of BIBF1120 to low-dose cytarabine might enhance the killing of leukemia cells. PURPOSE: This phase I / II trial is studying how safe BIBF1120 can be combined with low-dose cytarabine (phase I) and how well the combination of low-dose cytarabine and BIBF1120 works in elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia unfit for intensive chemotherapy (phase II).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients with newly diagnosed AML (except APL) according to the FAB or WHO classification, including AML evolving from MDS or other hematological diseases and AML after previous cytotoxic therapy or radiation (secondary AML), with medical contraindications against or not willing to receive a standard induction and consolidation therapy. Bone marrow aspirate or biopsy must contain &gt; 20% blasts of all nucleated cells. In AML FAB M6 ≥ 30% of nonerythroid cells in the bone marrow must be leukemic blasts. In patients with 2030% blasts, the indication for a treatment with hypomethylating agents (5azacitidine or decitabine) should be considered prior to inclusion into the trial. Age ≥ 60 years Informed consent, personally signed and dated to participate in the study Male patients enrolled in this trial must use adequate barrier birth control measures during the course of treatment and for at least 3 months after the last administration of study therapy (lowdose cytarabine and/or BIBF 1120). Patients with 2030% bone marrow blasts which are qualifying for and consenting into a therapy with hypomethylating agents Patients who are eligible for and consenting into a standard chemotherapy Known central nervous system manifestation of AML Inadequate liver function (ALT and AST ≥ 2.5 x ULN) if not caused by leukemic infiltration Known chronically active hepatitis C infection or acute hepatitis Chronically impaired renal function (creatinin clearance &lt; 30 ml/min) Uncontrolled hypertension with a resting pressure systolic &gt; 160 mmHg or diastolic &gt; 95 mmHg despite adequate treatment severe trauma or surgery within 4 weeks of study entry severe, nonhealing wounds, ulcer or fracture Uncontrolled active infection Concurrent malignancies other than AML or other severe diseases which in the opinion of the investigator are likely to influence the endpoint assessment Hypersensitivity to cytarabine (not including drug fever or exanthema) Previous treatment of AML except hydroxyurea up to 24 hours before study medication Previous therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors or angiogenesis inhibitors Parallel participation in another clinical trial for the same indication. Eligibility of patients with investigational drug therapy outside of this trial during or within 4 weeks of study entry should be discussed with the study office prior to study entry Any severe concomitant condition, which makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the study or which could jeopardize compliance with the protocol</criteria>
