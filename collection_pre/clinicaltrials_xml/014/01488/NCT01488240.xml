	<brief_title>The Role of Pulsed Dye Laser Therapy in the Management of Burn Scars</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While the literature tends to support the use of laser therapy in the management of burn scars, there is a definite lack of appropriately powered, randomized controlled trials. Laser therapy can be quite expensive when compared to other treatment modalities for burn scars, and while promising, its true usefulness has yet to be conclusively demonstrated. For this reason, our research group is proposing the commencement of two randomized controlled trial pilot studies assessing the effects of pulsed dye laser (PDL) on burn scars. The objectives of this project will be to determine the effectiveness of pulsed dye laser therapy on burn scar vascularity, pliability, height and texture. It has been hypothesized that the PDL works on acute injury to decrease scar formation, and the fractional laser works on scar that is quiescent to promote remodelling. Therefore the investigators are proposing to study both acute injury and late burn scars. This project will compare the effects of each laser type, and will either help support or refute the assertion that laser therapy can be used to improve burn scars. Objectives: To determine the benefit of pulsed dye laser treatment in improving burn scar height, texture, vascularity and pliability in acute burn injury.</detailed_description>
