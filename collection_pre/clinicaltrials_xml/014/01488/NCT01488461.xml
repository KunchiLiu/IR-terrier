	<brief_summary>Congenital ataxias (CA) are rare, non progressive diseases, characterized by psychomotor retardation, hypotonia followed by ataxia. The presence of the "molar tooth" on MRI allowed to define Joubert syndrome, a peculiar form of CA. Apart from this group, CA are mostly associated with cerebellar atrophy or hypoplasia without molar tooth on MRI. CA are a clinically as well as genetically heterogeneous group of diseases. Early-onset ataxias are progressive but may be difficult to distinguish from CA in the first years of the disease. To date, few genes responsible for CA have been identified: ABC7 (X-linked CA associated with sideroblastic anemia), SLC9A6 (X-linked CA associated with severe mental retardation, autism and epilepsy), GPR56 (CA associated with polymicrogyria), ATCAY (pure CA in Cayman isolate); the involvement of the ATCAY and ABC7 genes has never been assessed in a large cohort of CA patients. Primary objective: To assess the frequency of mutations of the ATCAY and ABC7 genes in patients affected with non Joubert congenital or early-onset ataxia. Secondary objective: To identify new loci and/or genes responsible for CA To further describe the clinical phenotype of the CA and to assess the frequency of the various clinical types (pure CA/CA associated with spasticity/ syndromic CA, congenital/early-onset CA, sporadic/familial CA). To describe the clinical phenotype of CA related to mutations in one of analysed genes.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All patients will be examined by a geneticist or a neuropediatric. All clinical data will be collected. Strategy of the molecular study : 1. for all multiplex and consanguineous families a linkage analysis (loci ATCAY and ABC7 and others AC known genes) will be performed. 2. For all sporadic patients as well as linked multiplex and consanguineous families : sequencing of all coding exons of the gene ATCAY and others AC known genes. 3. For all sporadic male patients and linked families : sequencing of all coding exons of the gene ABC7. 4. For all patients with suggestive features : sequencing of all coding exons of the gene GPR56, VLDLR, NHE6 or other candidate gene. 5. In consanguineous families : linkage analysis using SNP-array and analysis of candidate genes present in the regions of extended homozygosity 6. linkage analysis in dominant families and analysis of candidate genes in the linked regions. 7. If a new AC locus is identified (using linkage or CGH array), this gene will be sequenced in all patients.</detailed_description>
