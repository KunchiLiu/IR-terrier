	<brief_title>Abdominal Wall Evaluation in Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low back pain patients have alterations in abdominal wall function, especially in the feed-forward activation of transversus muscle during limbs movements. However, there are no reports on the abdominal function in low back pain patients during physiological respiratory movement.</detailed_description>
