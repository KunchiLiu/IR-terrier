	<brief_summary>This is a prospective randomized clinical study to be performed in pediatric patients under the age of 2 years who are undergoing surgical procedures requiring endotracheal intubation. Time to endotracheal intubation will be compared between patients intubated using a GlideScope速 video laryngoscope, those intubated with a Storz DCI速 video laryngoscope, and those intubated by standard direct laryngoscopy. The study hypothesis is that the time to endotracheal intubation will be decreased in the Storz DCI速 video laryngoscope group when compared to the GlideScope速 video laryngoscope group and standard laryngoscopy.</brief_summary>
