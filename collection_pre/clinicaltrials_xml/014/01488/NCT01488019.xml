	<criteria>1. Able to understand the study requirements, provide written informed consent, and agree to abide by the study protocol and its restrictions 2. Male and female subjects at least 40 years of age with a medical diagnosis of COPD (i.e. persistent presence of dyspnea, cough or sputum production and a history of exposure to risk factors for the disease, such as tobacco smoke) 3. A current or prior history of at least 10 packyears of cigarette smoking and a baseline breathlessness severity grade of &gt;=2 (Modified Medical Research Council [MMRC] Dyspnea Scale Score) at randomization. 4. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative pregnancy test at the screening visit and agree to avoid becoming pregnant for the duration of study by using adequate contraception at study entry and throughout the trial. WOCBP will be advised to notify the Investigator of any change in their pregnancy status. WOCBP include: any female who has experienced menarche and is not postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea for at least 12 consecutive months), or has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation). Women who are using acceptable contraceptive medications or devices to prevent pregnancy or practicing abstinence or where partner is sterile (e.g., vasectomy) will be considered WOCBP. 5. Able to complete all aspects of the study through the end of the study, including all visits and tests, and selfadministration of study medications. 1. A medical diagnosis of asthma. Indication of a past history of asthma that is deemed inaccurate to a subject's current condition by the Investigator must be adequately addressed in the medical history. 2. Clinically significant abnormal chest xray (CXR) (within the past 12 months) diagnostic of active/significant disease other than COPD. 3. Evidence of any unstable or clinically significant hematopoietic, malignant, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, neurologic, psychiatric, autoimmune disorder, or condition or disease other than COPD that, in the opinion of the Investigator, could place the subject at increased risk of complications, interfere with study participation, or confound any of the study objectives. 4. Subjects who had radiation or chemotherapy within the previous 12 months. 5. An abnormal laboratory test at screening deemed clinically significant and exclusionary by the Investigator. 6. A history of hypersensitivity to study drugs or their components, including albuterol rescue.</criteria>
