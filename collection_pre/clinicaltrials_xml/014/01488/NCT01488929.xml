	<brief_summary>Negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia (CDS) are core features of schizophrenia. These negative symptoms and cognitive deficits have a devastating impact on the function, employment, and social interactions of patients with schizophrenia. Medications used to treat schizophrenia (e.g. atypical antipsychotics) do not improve negative symptoms or CDS. TC-5619 is being developed for use as an add-on therapy in combination with atypical antipsychotics to treat patients with negative symptoms and CDS.</brief_summary>
