	<criteria>1. Pathologically proven diagnosis of a malignant major salivary gland tumor of the following histologic subtypes: high grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma, salivary duct carcinoma or high grade adenocarcinoma; 2. Surgical resection with curative intent within 8 weeks prior to registration; 3. Pathologic stage T34 or N13 or T12, N0 with a close (≤1mm) or microscopically positive surgical margin (AJCC, 7th ed.; see Appendix IV); patients must be free of distant metastases based upon the following minimum diagnostic workup: 4. Zubrod Performance Status 01; 3.1.5 Age ≥ 18; 3.1.6 CBC/differential obtained within 4 weeks prior to registration, with adequate bone marrow function 3.1.7 Adequate renal and hepatic function within 4 weeks prior to registration 3.1.8 Negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to registration for women of childbearing potential; 3.1.9 Women of childbearing potential and male participants who are sexually active must practice adequate contraception during treatment and for 6 weeks following treatment. 3.1.10 Patients must be deemed able to comply with the treatment plan and followup schedule. 3.2.1 Patients with residual macroscopic disease after surgery; 3.2.2 Patients with salivary gland malignancies originating from the minor salivary glands; 3.2.3 Patients with histologies other than high grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma, high grade adenocarcinoma or salivary duct carcinoma; 3.2.4 Prior invasive malignancy (except nonmelanomatous skin cancer) unless disease free for a minimum of 3 years (for example, carcinoma in situ of the breast, oral cavity, or cervix are all permissible); 3.2.5 Prior systemic chemotherapy or radiation therapy for salivary gland malignancy; note that prior chemotherapy for a different cancer is allowable; 3.2.6 Prior radiotherapy to the region of the study cancer that would result in overlap of radiation therapy fields; 3.2.7 Severe, active comorbidity, defined as follows: 3.2.7.1 Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization within the last 6 months; 3.2.7.2 Transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months; 3.2.7.3 Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time of registration; 3.2.7.4 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness requiring hospitalization or precluding study therapy at the time of registration; 3.2.7.5 Hepatic insufficiency resulting in clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defects; Note, however, coagulation parameters are not required for entry into this protocol. 3.2.7.6 Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) 3.2.7.7 Preexisting ≥ grade 2 neuropathy; 3.2.7.8 Prior organ transplant. 3.2.8 Pregnancy or women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active and not willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception; this exclusion is necessary; 3.2.9 Significant preexisting hearing loss, as defined by the patient or treating physician.</criteria>
