	<brief_summary>A new GlideScope videolaryngoscope has been developed, which utilizes a track on the superior surface of the blade to guide the endotracheal tube, which is advanced in the track as opposed to "free-hand" along the inferior surface, where the camera is located. This new GlideScope can be used for double-lumen endotracheal tubes (DLT). The investigators hypothesize that this GlideScope will be easier to use than the Macintosh blade.</brief_summary>
