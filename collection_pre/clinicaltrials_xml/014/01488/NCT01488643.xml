	<brief_title>Observational Study on Obese Patients During General Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obese patients come for surgery every day. In this specific population the frequency of asthma is high. Problems from the respiratory system increase the morbidity, as they are a significant part of perioperative complications. The frequency and the severity of bronchospasm have not been studied. Any data concerning the bronchospasm will lead to better perioperative management. In this study the investigators study any sign of bronchospasm during surgery in obese patients.</detailed_description>
