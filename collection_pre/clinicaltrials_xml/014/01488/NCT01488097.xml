	<brief_summary>This is an extension study to the first clinical study of SBC-102 (sebelipase alfa) for the treatment of LAL Deficiency. It is an open label study in adult patients with liver dysfunction due to Lysosomal Acid Lipase (LAL) Deficiency. This study will assess the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of SBC-102. The targeted number for this study is 9 evaluable subjects.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cholesteryl Ester Storage Disease (CESD) is the late onset phenotype for Lysosomal Acid Lipase (LAL) Deficiency, a Lysosomal Storage Disorder, which also has an early onset phenotype known as Wolman Disease that primarily affects infants. CESD can present in childhood but often goes unrecognized until adulthood when the underlying pathology is advanced. Many of the signs and symptoms are common to patients with other liver conditions. CESD is an autosomal recessive genetic condition and is characterized by hepatomegaly, persistently abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) and type II hyperlipidemia. Splenomegaly and evidence of mild hypersplenism may affect some patients. Untreated, CESD may lead to fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver failure and death.</detailed_description>
