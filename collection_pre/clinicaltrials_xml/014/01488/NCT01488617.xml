	<brief_title>Mainz Outcome Predictor Studies: An Observational Clinical Trial Investigating Predictors for Postoperative Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Different factors contribute to the recovery process after surgical intervention. However, little is known about the predictive value of single factors. In addition to medical (physical) factors, depression, anxiety, somatization and avoiding coping styles are considered as relevant for the successful recovery process. These factors may be defined as "psychological distress" and could be used as predictors for perioperative complications and failed surgical treatment. Postoperative outcome is defined (1) as postoperative complications and organ dysfunction and (2) alteration of quality of life. Our sample includes adults undergoing extensive surgical interventions in trauma and orthopaedic surgery, urology, general surgery, and neurosurgery. The defined variables are measured using standardized and validated questionnaires prior to surgery and in follow-up visits.</detailed_description>
