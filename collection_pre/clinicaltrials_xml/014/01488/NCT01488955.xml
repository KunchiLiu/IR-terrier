	<brief_summary>In this study, patients with uncomplicated urinary infection are investigated. It is investigated if treatment of only symptoms of the uncomplicated urinary infection is as effective as treatment with antibiotics with respect to the outcome of the urinary infection. If this is the case, the use of antibiotics in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary infections might be reduced. Secondary aim of the study is the safety evaluation of both treatment strategies with respect to SAEs during treatment. Additionally, relapse frequency after 28 days is evaluated.</brief_summary>
