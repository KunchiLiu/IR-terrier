	<brief_summary>Systemic sclerosis is a rare disease with vascular involvement and systemic fibrosis. This disease is usually thought to spare central nervous system. However, neuropsychiatric manifestations like depression and cognitive functions impairment seem to be frequent. Pathophysiology of this neuropsychiatric manifestations is currently unknown. White matter hyperintensities have been reported suggested CNS vascular manifestations in systemic sclerosis. Whether this CNS vascular involvement plays a role in neuropsychiatric manifestations in systemic sclerosis is unknown. The primary objective of this prospective and multicentre study is to assess a link between neuropsychiatric manifestations and CNS involvement in systemic sclerosis. Secondary objectives are to assess the frequency of neuropsychiatric manifestations, to compare central nervous system abnormality between scleroderma patient and healthy subjects. Central nervous system involvement and neuropsychiatric manifestations will be systematically assessed through central nervous system imaging and questionnaires.</brief_summary>
