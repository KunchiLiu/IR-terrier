	<brief_summary>Recently, the HS has been used in head and neck surgery as an alternative to conventional hand-tied ligation for hemostasis, which is a time-consuming procedure. Limited data have been published on the evidence of its safety in ND, especially in radical ND. Researchers investigated the safety and efficacy of the Harmonic scalpel (HS) in neck dissection (ND), while using conventional hand-tied ligation to a minimum, in terms of operating time, blood loss, drainage and complications.</brief_summary>
