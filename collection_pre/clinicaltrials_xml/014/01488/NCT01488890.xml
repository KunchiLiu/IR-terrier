	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the administration of CYD dengue vaccine following a compressed schedule in different populations. Primary Objectives: - To describe the humoral immune response to each of the 4 parental dengue virus serotypes at baseline and 28 days after CYD dengue vaccine Dose 3 in defined study groups. - To describe the persistence of the humoral immune response to each of the 4 parental dengue virus serotypes 6 months after CYD dengue vaccine Dose 3 in defined study groups. Secondary Objective: - To describe the humoral immune response to each of the 4 parental dengue virus serotypes at baseline and 28 days after CYD dengue vaccine Dose 1 and Dose 2 in defined study groups, irrespective of whether or not Yellow fever (YF) vaccine has been previously administered. - To describe the YF humoral immune response at baseline and 1, 3, and 7 months after injection of the YF vaccine at Month 0 in Groups 3 and 4. - To describe the safety profile in terms of solicited injection site and systemic events, unsolicited adverse events and serious adverse events after each injection of CYD dengue vaccine and/or YF vaccine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immune Response to Different Schedules of a Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine Given With or Without Yellow Fever Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study participants will be randomized to receive CYD Dengue alone, or CYD Dengue and/or Yellow fever (YF) vaccine. Participants who already received YF vaccine prior to enrolment will be randomized to one of the groups receiving CYD Dengue alone. Flavivirus status will be determined at baseline (before the first dose) and the vaccine immunogenicity assessment will be at 28 days after each vaccination. Reactogenicity data will be collected in all subjects after each dose. Serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest will be collected throughout the study. The expected duration of participation in the trial will be 18 months or 7 months for participants receiving only YF vaccine.</detailed_description>

Subject is pregnant, or lactating, or of childbearing potential (to be considered of nonchildbearing potential, a female must be postmenopausal for at least 1 year, surgically sterile, or using an effective method of contraception or abstinence from at least 4 weeks prior to the first vaccination and until at least 4 weeks after the last vaccination) Participation in the 4 weeks preceding the first trial vaccination, or planned participation during the present trial period, in another clinical trial investigating a vaccine, drug, medical device, or medical procedure Receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks preceding the first trial vaccination or planned receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks following each trial vaccination For all subjects classified as YF, any previous vaccination against Flavivirus (FV) diseases (including Japanese Encephalitis, tickborne encephalitis, and YF) For subjects classified as YF+, previous vaccination against FV diseases except YF (including Japanese Encephalitis and tickborne encephalitis) For all subjects, any FV vaccination planned during the trial period outside the study protocol Receipt of immune globulins, blood or bloodderived products in the past 3 months Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency; or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy such as anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the preceding 6 months; or longterm systemic corticosteroid therapy (prednisone or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks within the past 3 months) Selfreported seropositivity for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or hepatitis C Selfreported history of FV infection (e.g., JE, Dengue, YF, West Nile), confirmed either clinically or serologically Known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components, or history of a lifethreatening reaction to the vaccine(s) used in the trial or to a vaccine containing any of the same substances, including dry natural latex Deprived of freedom by an administrative or court order, or in an emergency setting, or hospitalized involuntarily Current alcohol abuse or drug addiction Chronic illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, is at a stage where it might interfere with trial conduct or completion Identified as an employee of the Investigator or study center, with direct involvement in the proposed study or other studies under the direction of that Investigator or study center, as well as family members (i.e., immediate, husband, wife and their children, adopted or natural) of the employee or the Investigator Moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to investigator judgment) on the day of vaccination or febrile illness (temperature ≥ 38.0°C [≥ 100.4°F]). A prospective subject should not be included in the study until the condition has resolved or the febrile event has subsided Previous residence (&gt; 12 months) in, or travel in the last 30 days to FV endemic regions History of thymic pathology (thymoma), thymectomy, or myasthenia.</criteria>
