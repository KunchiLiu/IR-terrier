	<brief_summary>The primary objective of this investigation is to determine the relative percentage and rate of incorporation of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and total omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids after ingestion of 4 emulsified flavored triglyceride fish oil supplements versus an encapsulated triglyceride in defined plasma lipid pools. The primary endpoints to be evaluated include the fatty acid composition of plasma lipids before and after consumption of a single dose of emulsified triglyceride based fish oil and triglyceride of similar n-3 compositions in capsule form. The investigators will measure changes in plasma phospholipid, and chylomicron fatty acids.</brief_summary>
