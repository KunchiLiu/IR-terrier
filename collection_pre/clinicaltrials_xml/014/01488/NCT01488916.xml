	<brief_summary>Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an unfavorable metabolic profile in several observational studies. However, the influences of vitamin D concentrations on postprandial glucose in type 2 diabetes (DM) are less studied. The purposes of the study are to study the effects of vitamin D inadequacy on postprandial glucose excursion and metabolic responses in patients with type 2 DM. This is a cross-sectional study. About 150-180 patients will be screened for serum levels of 25(OH)D. A total of 45 eligible patients will be grouped into three groups by different vitamin D status: vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D insufficiency, and the controls. The patients will receive a mixed meal test for postprandial glucose excursion and metabolic responses. The investigators will use statistical methods to assess the differences in post-challenge glucose and metabolic response among the three groups of patients. The investigators hope the study can explore the relationship between vitamin D and glucose excursion in patients with type 2 DM.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an unfavorable metabolic profile in several observational studies. However, the influences of vitamin D concentrations on postprandial glucose in type 2 diabetes (DM) are less studied. The purposes of the study are to study the effects of vitamin D inadequacy on postprandial glucose excursion and metabolic responses in patients with type 2 DM. This is a cross-sectional study. About 150-180 patients will be screened for serum levels of 25(OH)D. A total of 45 eligible patients will be grouped into three groups by different vitamin D status: vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D insufficiency, and the controls. The patients will receive a mixed meal test for postprandial glucose excursion and metabolic responses. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be applied to compare the differences in clinical characteristics among the three groups. Univariate analyses of general linear models will be used to compare the differences in meal-derived metabolic indexes among the three groups, showing effects of confounding variables including age, sex, obesity, and DM-related clinical parameters. Repeated-measures ANOVA will be used to assess the differences in post-challenge glucose and metabolic response in the meal test, with or without adjustments of the above covariates. Pearson and partial correlation procedures will be used to test the correlations of 25(OH)D with clinical parameters including lipid profile, HbA1c, and meal-derived metabolic indexes. Multiple linear regression models will be used in an attempt to compare the degree to which 25(OH)D concentrations is associated with the meal-derived metabolic indexes in these patients. The investigators hope the study can explore the relationship between vitamin D and glucose excursion in patients with type 2 DM.</detailed_description>
