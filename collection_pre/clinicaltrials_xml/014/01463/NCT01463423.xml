	<brief_summary>A research study using a method of treating lung cancer with focused radiation called Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of individualizing the dose of radiation used to treat lung tumors with SABR based on tumor-specific factors.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Trial of Individualized Lung Tumor Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (iSABR)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy has emerged as an important and effective new treatment modality for lung tumors, but optimal dose regimens have not been fully established. Significant toxicity can be observed with the most commonly used dose regimens, implying that developing treatment regimens that optimize treatment based on tumor-specific factors could be of clinical benefit. This study will test a risk-adapted approach to SABR delivery aimed at maximizing tumor control while minimizing toxicity.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Limited primary or metastatic lung tumors with no evidence of uncontrolled extrathoracic metastases Up to 4 lesions may be included, with none larger than 5 cm if there are more than one, or up to 7 cm if there is a single tumor Both peripheral and central tumors are accepted for this trial. Age &gt; 18 years old Both men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial. Note: Patients may be enrolled more than once (e.g. for a new tumor) Evidence of uncontrolled extrathoracic metastases Contraindication to receiving radiotherapy. Contraindication to receiving radiotherapy Age &lt; 18 years old. Children are excluded because lung malignancies rarely occur in this age group. Furthermore, treatment requires a great deal of patient cooperation including the ability to lie still for several hours in an isolated room. Pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded; as well as women of childbearing potential who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method of birth control (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) to avoid pregnancy for the duration of the study. Male subjects must also agree to use effective contraception for the same period as above. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.</criteria>
