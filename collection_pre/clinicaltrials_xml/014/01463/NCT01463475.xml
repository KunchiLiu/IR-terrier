	<brief_summary>The objective of this protocol is to use established standard criteria and methods for the collection of hMSC (human mesenchymal stromal cells) from healthy bone marrow donors. The hMSC collected from the donors will use to develop well-defined and reproducible cell banks. Standard manufacturing procedures and quality control testing methods will be used to characterize and evaluate the final cell product. After the cell banks are created, these cell products will be used in future translational or clinical research.</brief_summary>
