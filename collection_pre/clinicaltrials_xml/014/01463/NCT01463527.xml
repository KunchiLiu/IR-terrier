	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesize that the addition of capnography during moderate sedation will improve recognition of hypoventilation and apnea. This will lead to an increased frequency of staff interventions such as verbal or physical stimulation for these events in order to improve ventilation which will in turn lead to a reduction in the frequency of oxygen desaturations. If capnography proves to be effective in creating earlier detection and intervention for hypoventilation and apnea during moderate sedation provided by non-anesthesiologists, this device can be used in a variety of clinical settings to enhance patient safety.</brief_summary>
