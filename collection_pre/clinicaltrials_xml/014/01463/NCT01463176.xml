	<brief_summary>Many young children undergo medical procedures that are painful and distressing. Negative experiences during medical procedures can have serious long-term effects, including fear and avoidance of medical procedures during adulthood. Distraction interventions can help prevent children from forming negative memories of medical procedures. Live music therapy has been shown to alleviate pediatric distress during both invasive and non-invasive procedures. The objective of this study is to examine the effects of music therapy on the child's distress behaviors and time to calm, as well as the length of the procedure and use of restraint, and parents' and healthcare staffs' behaviors during the procedure, for young children undergoing immunizations and influenza vaccinations. It is hypothesized that children receiving music therapy will show fewer distress behaviors, calm more quickly, and have shorter procedures with fewer instances of restraint compared to children who receive standard care. In addition, it is predicted that adults (parents and staff) will show fewer distress-promoting behaviors during, before, and after the procedures.</brief_summary>
