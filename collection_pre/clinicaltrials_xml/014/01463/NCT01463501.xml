	<brief_summary>This is a prospective Randomized Phase â…¡ Trial Comparing Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy (Paclitaxel and carboplatin) Followed by Surgery to Surgery Followed by Postoperative Chemoradiotherapy (Paclitaxel and carboplatin) for Esophageal Cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Versus Adjuvant Therapy in Treating Resectable Thoracic Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient Population: Thoracic esophageal cancer able to tolerate tri-modality therapy; Clinical stage T3-4, N0-1, M0 Scheme: Patients are randomized to 2 arms: Arm A: Paclitaxel/carboplatin and concurrent radiation (50.4Gy/28f) followed by surgery, consolidate paclitaxel/carboplatin 2 cycles. Arm B: Surgery followed by paclitaxel/carboplatin and concurrent radiation (50.4Gy/28f), consolidate paclitaxel/carboplatin 2 cycles.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically documented squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the thoracic esophagus (&gt; 20cm from the incisors) or gastroesophageal junction are included. No distant metastases (M0). Patients will be stratified by stage (clinical N0 versus clinical N1). Patients with tumours within 3 cm distal spread into gastric cardia as detected by esophagogastroscopy. Resectable mediastinal nodes are eligible. No prior chemotherapy for this malignancy. No prior radiotherapy that would overlap the field(s) treated in this study. Patients with other malignancies are eligible only if &gt; 5 years without evidence of disease or completely resected or treated nonmelanoma skin cancer. Age &gt; 18 years and able to tolerate trimodality therapy at the discretion of the treating thoracic surgeon, medical and radiation oncologists. Tumours must be resectable after assessment by the thoracic surgeon. Cancers of the cervical esophagus (&lt; 20 cm are excluded). Tumours that have &gt; 3 cm of spread into cardia of the stomach are considered gastric cancers and are ineligible. Patients with biopsy (by endoscopic ultrasound, laparoscopy, or laparotomy ) proven metastatic supraclavicular nodes are ineligible. Patients with biopsy proven metastatic celiac nodes are ineligible.</criteria>
