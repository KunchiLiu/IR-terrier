	<brief_summary>Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a significant risk factor of cardiovascular disease. The purposes of this study are going to investigate the effects of Graptopetalum paraguayense E. Walther on the oxidative stress, antioxidant enzyme activity and inflammation in subjects with metabolic syndromerelation. The investigators will recruit MS patients(n=50)and the inclusion criteria of MS are according to the Bureau of Health Promotion, Department of Health in Taiwan (2007). The MS subjects are randomly assigned to placebo(n=25) and Graptopetalum paraguayense E. Walther supplements(n=25)groups. Hopefully, the results of this study could provide the information of Graptopetalum paraguayense E. Walther supplements to what has been know in MS subjects.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The inclusion criteria of MS in adult are according to the Bureau of Health Promotion, Department of Health in Taiwan (2007), if subjects had 3 of the following 5 characteristics: (1) abdominal obesity (waist circumference &gt;= 90 cm in men and &gt;= 80 cm in women), (2) impaired fasting glucose ( &gt;= 5.6 mmol/L), (3) hypertriglyceridemia ( &gt;= 1.7 mmol/L), (4) low HDLC (&lt; 1.0 mmol/L in men and &lt; 1.3 mmol/L in women), and (5) increased blood pressure (SBP &gt;= 130 mmHg and DBP &gt;= 85 mmHg). Subjects using antidiabetic or antihypertensive or lipidlowering medications were considered to have elevated fasting blood glucose or elevated blood pressures or dyslipidemia, respectively. Subjects with liver, renal diseases, undergoing statin therapy, pregnancy women, and taking antioxidant vitamins supplements were excluded.</criteria>
