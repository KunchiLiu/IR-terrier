	<brief_summary>This is an observational, exploratory study designed to collect (record) and analyze normal and abnormal sound data from the human bladder during surgery using a novel sensor-based catheter system (Electronic Catheter Stethoscope) and to develop algorithms to detect changes of baseline bladder and ureteral function. The Electronic Catheter Stethoscope device will measure acoustic and pressure data within the bladder. The measurements will be used to detect any leakage from the bladder and/or changes in baseline ureteral flow by correlation of sound data with surgical data reported by the surgeon. These data will be used to develop algorithms to detect changes of baseline bladder and ureteral function. The algorithms will be tested in future clinical trials.</brief_summary>
