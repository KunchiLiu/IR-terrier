	<brief_summary>For patients who are unable to receive surgery or having local advanced esophageal cancer stages, concurrent chemoradiotherapy is recommended. But radiotherapy is the main strategy for older patients because of their chemoradiotherapy intolerance. The whole world focused on targeted therapy which has strong specialties and mild toxicities. So combined targeted therapy and radiotherapy may be a novel strategy for older patients with esophageal cancer. Nimotuzumab is a EGFR monoclonal antibody. This clinical trial is to study the effect and safety of Nimotuzumab in combined with radiotherapy for older patients with esophageal cancer. All patients receive intensity modulated radiotherapy with conventional fraction. Nimotuzumab with 200mg is given weekly for all patients during radiotherapy.</brief_summary>
