	<brief_summary>The overall objective of the project is to develop and assess the feasibility of a brief, practice-friendly approach to psychotherapy for children, entitled Behavioral and Affective Skills in Coping (BASIC) and designed for use as a first step toward evidence-based practice by practitioners in clinical service settings.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Behavioral and Affective Skills in Coping (BASIC) Open Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators seek to develop a treatment protocol that integrates five core intervention principles that are common to evidence-based treatments for youth depression, anxiety, and disruptive behavior problems. The protocol will be designed for implementation in everyday community practice settings by practitioners. Because many empirically supported treatments for youth disorders address only one area of impairment, they may not be an ideal fit to community clinics, where (a) most practitioners treat an array of disorders rather than specializing in just one, (b) most referred youths present with multiple disorders, and (c) priority problems and treatment needs may shift for many youths during an episode of care. Moreover, because many evidence-based treatments have been developed in research settings, they may not be designed in ways that are ideal for front-line therapists in community settings. The investigators hope to reduce the difficulty of transporting treatments into community practice by incorporating the perspectives of community practitioners in the development and design of the protocol. By incorporating the feedback of expert treatment developers, the investigators hope to ensure that BASIC is not only appealing to users but also consistent with what has been learned through treatment research over the years. Finally, the trial will provide preliminary evidence on whether this brief "first course" in evidence-based treatment is beneficial for youths with depression, anxiety, and disruptive behavior problemsâ€”three clusters that account for a large percentage of youth referrals.</detailed_description>
