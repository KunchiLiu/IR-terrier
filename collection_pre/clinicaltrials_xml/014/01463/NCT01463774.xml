	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Bioequivalence of 2 Fixed Dose Combination Tablets of Canagliflozin and Metformin Immediate Release (IR) With Respect to the Individual Components of Canagliflozin and Metformin IR Tablets in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open-label (identity of study drug will be known to volunteer and study staff), single-center study to evaluate the bioequivalence of canagliflozin and metformin when administered orally (by mouth) as individual components (ie, separate tablets of canagliflozin and metformin) (Treatment A) and when administered as a fixed dose combination tablet (ie, canagliflozin and metformin in the same tablet) (Treatment B). Healthy volunteers participating in the study will be randomly (by chance) assigned to receive Treatment A followed by Treatment B or Treatment B followed by Treatment A with a period of approximately 15 days between treatments.</detailed_description>
