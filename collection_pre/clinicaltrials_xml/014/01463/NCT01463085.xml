	<criteria>Subject is a female or male, 2069 years of age, inclusive. Subject has a BMI of 18.5 to 39.9 kg/m2, inclusive. Subject has resting blood pressure measurements meeting the criteria for prehypertension (SBP = 120 to 139 mm Hg and/or DBP = 80 to 89 mm Hg) or stage 1 hypertension (SBP = 140 to 159 mm Hg or DBP = 90 to 99 mm Hg) Subject reports history of consuming, on average, ≤2 servings/d of dairy foods as part of their normal diet Subject is willing to consume ≤1 serving/d of dairy foods (other than the study products provided) during each treatment phase. Subject is willing to maintain a stable body weight and habitual diet and physical activity patterns throughout the trial, with the exception of specific study instructions related to study product intake, alcohol intake, and physical activity. Subject has known coronary heart disease (CHD) or a CHD risk equivalent Subject has a history of any major trauma or major surgical event Subject has digital deformities that would prevent EndoPAT measurements. Subject has used medications known to alter body weight Subject has used medications or dietary supplements that, in the opinion of the Investigator, have strong potential to influence blood pressure or endothelial function Subject has extreme dietary habits (e.g., Atkins diet, very high protein/low carbohydrate).</criteria>
