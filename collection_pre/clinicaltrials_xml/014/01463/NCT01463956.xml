	<brief_summary>Evaluation of efficacy of triple therapy with pegylated interferon, ribavirin, and boceprevir in patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C, who are treatment-naive, have relapsed, or are non-responders with cirrhosis and awaiting liver transplantation, with a MELD score less than or equal to 18</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Evaluation of sustained virological response defined as the proportion of patients with undetectable hepatitis C virus RNA 24 weeks after discontinuation of therapy and/or after liver transplantation in patients with genotype 1, who are treatment-naive, have relapsed, or are non-responders with cirrhosis and awaiting liver transplantation, with a MELD score less than or equal to 18</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult 18 years and older Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus proven with positive PCR for more than 6 months Viral genotype 1 Cirrhosis while awaiting liver transplantation MELD score &lt; or equal to 18 With or without hepatocellular carcinoma Naive to antiviral C treatment Failure on a previous treatment. Failure is defined as the persistence of detectable HCV RNA. The previous HCV failure treatment profile must be able to be documented according to the following terminology: Relapsing patient: HCV RNA undetectable at the end of treatment, becoming detectable again after the discontinuation of treatment Breakthrough: increase of viremia of 1 log or more during the treatment Nonresponding patient with partial response: HCV RNA detectable at W24 without ever having been undetectable and with a decrease in HCV RNA â‰¥ 2 log at W12 Nonresponding patient with nul response: decrease in HCV RNA &lt; 2 log at W12 No need for prior treatment washout Negative pregnancy test in women of childbearing age Double method of contraception in men and women of childbearing age during the entire duration of treatment and the 6 months following its discontinuation Free, informed, and written consent (signed on the day of preenrollment at the latest and before all exams required by the study) Person enrolled in or a beneficiary of a social security/Universal Health Insurance Coverage Inclusion approved by the Decision Support Committee Previous HCV treatment with boceprevir or telaprevir Alcohol consumption &gt; 40 g/day Toxicomania constituting a barrier for starting therapy according to the opinion of the investigator. Patients included in a methadone or buprenorphine replacement program may be enrolled MELD &gt; 18 Non controlled sepsis Platelets &lt; 50,000/mm3 Neutrophil granulocyte levels &lt; 1000/mm3 Creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/min (MDRD) Hb &lt; 10 g/dL Uncontrolled psychiatric problems Contraindications to boceprevir Contraindication to interferon or ribavirin Subject with major complications of cirrhosis HIV coinfection HBV coinfection (unless this is treated effectively with analogues, as proven by undetectable viremia for at least 12 months) Other infectious disease underway Neoplastic disease other than hepatocellular carcinoma during the previous year, or neoplastic disease for which the prognosis is less than 3 years Treatment with immunosuppressors (including corticosteroids), antivirals other than those for the study, except aciclovir Consumption of St. John's wort Associated treatments including a molecule or substance that could interfere with the pharmacokinetic characteristics of boceprevir History of a lactose allergy Person participating in another study including an exclusion period that is still underway during preenrollment Socalled vulnerable populations (minors, people under guardianship or protection, or a private individual under protection from making legal or administrative decisions) Pregnancy, breastfeeding</criteria>
