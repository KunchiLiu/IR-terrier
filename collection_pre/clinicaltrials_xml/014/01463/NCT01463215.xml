	<brief_title>Clinical Trial of Ambroxol in Patients With Type I Gaucher Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an Open-Label, Dose Escalation with 2 Dose Levels, Proof-of-Concept Clinical Trial of Ambroxol for the Treatment of Patients with Type I Gaucher Disease. This study is a randomized clinical trial involving 20 evaluable patients affected with Type 1 Gaucher disease who are responsive to Ambroxol in vitro. There are 2 treatment groups, involving 2 dose levels of Ambroxol (187.5 and 225 mg/day), given once daily PO for 2 months in both groups. The 187.5-mg/day dose level will be tested first. If there are no significant adverse events, defined as &gt;Grade 3 toxicity according to the latest version of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC), the 225-mg/day dose level will be tested.</detailed_description>
