	<brief_summary>Study Objective The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of bradycardia pacing with respect to patient symptoms in patients with bifascicular block and syncope of unexplained origin.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevention of Syncope by Cardiac Pacing in Patients With Bifascicular Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary endpoint First occurrence of a composite of Syncope of any origin OR Presyncopal episode with documented cardioinhibitory origin OR Atrioventricular block of any degree; all associated with patient symptoms Design: - Randomized, prospective, single blinded, two parallel arms - Treatment group : DDD60 - programmed in DDD mode / 60 lower limit - Control Group: DDI30 - programmed in DDI mode / 30 lower limit - Randomization type: block randomization: Block size: 4, allocation ratio 1:1 Sample: 100 patients Population - Patients with bifascicular block with at least one syncopal episode within the last 6 months preceding enrollment. - Patients should be negative to a series of pre-enrollment screening in order to exclude: - Brady-tachy syndrome, vasovagal syncope or carotid sinus syndrome, atrial fibrillation, inducible AV block - Ejection fraction &gt;=40% - Mean nocturnal heart rate &gt;=35 bpm</detailed_description>
