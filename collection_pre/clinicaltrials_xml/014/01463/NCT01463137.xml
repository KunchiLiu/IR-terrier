	<brief_title>Attention Bias Modification Training in Social Phobia/Social Anxiety Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous studies have shown that individuals with social phobia have attention biases, often focusing on aversive stimuli or avoiding aversive stimuli. Computerized training programs have been developed to implicitly direct the users attention towards a neutral, non-threatening stimuli. In this study, such a program will be compared with a program that implicitly directs the users' attention towards threatening cues. Pre/post-measurements will be compared in a sample of individuals that meet diagnostic criteria of Social Anxiety Disorder. Participants will be randomized to one of three groups, receiving one of the two variants of the attention bias modification program or a control training program.</detailed_description>
