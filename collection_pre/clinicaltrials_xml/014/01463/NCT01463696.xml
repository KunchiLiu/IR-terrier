	<brief_summary>This study is being done to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of MK-8242 and its active metabolite (M16) in participants with advanced solid tumors. In Part 1 of the study, the study drug dose will be escalated to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). In Part 2 of the study, the MTD will be confirmed and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) established; the effect of MK-8242 on liposarcoma and other tumor types will also be evaluated.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants are considered to have completed the study after Cycle 12. Amendment 4 (14 April 2015) was done to allow participants on active treatment at the time the study was closed to enrollment to continue study treatment beyond Cycle 12 if deriving clinical benefit, at the Investigator's discretion.</detailed_description>
