	<brief_title>Beta-Tricalcium Phosphate Bone Graft in Treating Patients Undergoing Surgery For Metastatic Spine Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if Chronos (beta-tricalcium phosphate bone graft) will form a posterolateral fusion mass in patients undergoing fusion surgery for spine cancer within 12 months. II. To evaluate quality of life following the use of ChronOS as measured by (a) pain (or lack of pain) associated with pseudoarthrosis and (b) the need for additional treatment for instability as a result of hardware failure. OUTLINE: Patients undergo placement of beta-tricalcium phosphate bone graft strips posterolaterally during surgery. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month and then every 3 months for 1 year.</detailed_description>
