	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to provide evidence for the feasibility and initial effectiveness of a manualized, telephone-based (telehealth) approach to the delivery of cognitive interventions (SMARTease) targeted to improve cognitive performance in daily activities after stroke.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SMARTease Trial: Evaluating Stroke Help Distance Interventions to Improve Cognitive Performance Post-Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An initial brief screening interview will be completed with the potential participant by telephone to determine whether or not the individual meets the criteria for the study. In an initial onsite visit, informed consent will be obtained from both the stroke survivor and their study partner and baseline evaluations will be completed with the stroke survivor, including a baseline cognitive assessment and setting goals to work on during the study period. Then the introductory section of the study Handbook (Making the Most of Your Memory) which includes procedural information on the Stroke Help Program will be reviewed with the stroke survivor and study partner. A study Handbook and a large button speaker phone will be provided to the stroke survivor/partner pair to ensure that both members of the participant-caregiver team can listen to the rehabilitation coach without having to be concerned with holding a handset (an action that may be difficult for some stroke survivors). Telephone contact by the rehabilitation coach will be organized and the 16-week Stroke Help Cognitive Strategy Training Intervention will proceed. In general the topics or strategies to be discussed will be used to achieve one or more of the following rehabilitation strategies: 1) Understanding cognitive deficits that may result from stroke; 2). Reinforcing, strengthening or re-establishing previously learned patterns of behavior; 3) Establishing new patterns of compensatory mechanisms; 4) Enabling persons to adapt to their cognitive disability. Following the 16-week Cognitive Strategy Training Intervention participants will have an on-site visit to provide qualitative and quantitative data related to the feasibility and efficacy of the program.</detailed_description>
