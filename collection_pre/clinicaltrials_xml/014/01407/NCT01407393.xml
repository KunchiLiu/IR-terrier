	<brief_summary>Glucosanol™, the medical device to be investigated contains a proprietary plant extract that is a natural inhibitor of alpha-amylase and can reduce starch digestion. The rationale for this study is to confirm that Glucosanol™ ingestion will reduce body weight. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design has been chosen to assess the efficacy and safety of Glucosanol™ in subjects who are overweight and mildly obese.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Glucosanol in Reducing Body Weight in Overweight and Obese Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preparations that reduce absorption of calories from dietary carbohydrates could be decisively meaningful for the regulation of bodyweight or obesity. Hence, Glucosanol™ may be used as a tool for the treatment of obesity and weight management through reduced carbohydrate absorption. The rationale for this study is to confirm that Glucosanol™ ingestion will reduce body weight. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design has been chosen to assess the efficacy and safety of Glucosanol™ in subjects who are overweight and mildly obese. The specific hypotheses to be accepted or rejected by statistical data from the clinical investigation are beneficial effects of the device on weight loss (kg) and body fat content.</detailed_description>
