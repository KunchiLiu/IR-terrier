	<brief_summary>Unexplained male infertility is increasing, and, nowadays, the investigators only can propose palliative treatment, as In VITRO Fertilization (IVF). The folate metabolism is a key for the maintenance of genome integrity. A dysfunction in this pathway can be responsible of spermatogenesis defects, and further, of infertility. Few assays have shown that folate treatment can improve sperm parameters and fertility, till 30% in some of theses studies. The purpose of the investigators study is to demonstrate the impact of folates treatment on improvement of sperm parameters and on the rate of success of in VITRO fertilization procedures.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact of Folates in the Care of the Male Infertility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The folate impact in the treatment of male infertility will be reviewed by this large multicentric randomized controlled double-blind study comparing 2 parallel groups of 184 patients. In each group: folic acid 15mg/day versus placebo, orally for at least 3 months (duration of a cycle of spermatogenesis). This assay will evaluate the effectiveness of treatment with folic acid compared to its placebo in infertile men with the outcome of IVF+/-ICSI techniques (pregnancy rate). It will also assess the impact of folate therapy on sperm parameters, and further, the impact on abnormal sperm DNA methylation profiles.</detailed_description>
