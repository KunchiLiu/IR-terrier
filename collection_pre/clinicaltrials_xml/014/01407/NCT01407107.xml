	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Trial of Nitroglycerin, 5-flourouracil and Rad Therapy for Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is an open label, non-randomized, multi-cohort, dose escalation trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, feasibility and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of topical nitroglycerin in addition to 5-flourouracil and radiation therapy for neo-adjuvant treatment of, T3-T4 or clinically node positive, operable rectal cancer. Patients that would otherwise be eligible for concurrent neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with continuous infusion 5-FU, for locally advanced operable rectal cancer, will be assigned to 4 sequential cohorts of 4 different dose levels of nitro glycerin patches (0.2; 0.4; 0.6 and 0.8mg/hr). Each cohort will consist of 3 patients. All patients will receive radiation therapy, 45-50 Gy in 25-28 fractions to the pelvis along with continuous infusion 5-FU 225mg/M2 for the duration of the radiation therapy. The radiation therapy will be planned and delivered as per institutional standard of care for the Dallas VAMC radiation oncology department.</detailed_description>
