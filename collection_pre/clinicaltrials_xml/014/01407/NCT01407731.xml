	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Studying protein expression in samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors find better ways to treat neuroblastoma. PURPOSE: This laboratory studying is looking at protein expression in tumor tissue samples from patients with neuroblastoma.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: - To determine whether intersectin (ITSN1) proteins are present at elevated levels in primary human tumor samples. OUTLINE: Archived tumor tissue samples are analyzed for intersectin (ITSN1) expression by western blot assays with enhanced chemiluminescence and exposed to X-ray film. The films are scanned, and levels of ITSN1 signal are quantified by densitometry.</detailed_description>
