	<brief_summary>The aim of this operational research is to compare the cost-effectiveness of two methods for capacity building of existing TBAs/CVs to improve rates of delayed cord clamping, early skin to skin contact and infant-led initiation of breastfeeding, to reduce prelacteal feeding and increase early exclusive breastfeeding in research areas of rural Bangladesh.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing Cost and Effectiveness of Training and Supervision of Front Line Workers on Early Breastfeeding Practices</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Suboptimal early infant feeding practices are the norm in Bangladesh, and contribute to its poor infant health and nutrition. However, the modern health services are unable to help because approximately 85% of births take place at home. The Government has begun the huge process of training the informal community traditional birth attendants (TBAs) who, along with community volunteers (CVs), deliver the majority of babies, especially in the rural areas. The proposed operations research will take place in one of the poorest rural districts. It will compare the cost effectiveness of practical training of these relatively uneducated community members, with or without supportive supervision in improving early infant feeding practices, using a cluster-randomized study design. The practices to be measured before and after on probability samples include: 1) delayed cord clamping, 2) early skin to skin contact and 3) newborn-led initiation of breastfeeding within one hour of birth, 4) avoidance of the traditional prelacteal feeds, and 5) exclusive breastfeeding, at least for the early months. Costs will be carefully monitored so as to compare the cost per behavior improved per infant.</detailed_description>
