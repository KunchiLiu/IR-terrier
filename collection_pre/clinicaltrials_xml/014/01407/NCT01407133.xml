	<brief_summary>The objective of the investigators study is to assess conventional repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in patients with chronic severe tinnitus. A randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled procedure, with four increasing levels of magnetic "pseudo-dose" has been designed, in order to characterize the effectiveness of rTMS while controlling its safety and tolerability. By combining various rTMS protocols with a twelve-month follow-up, and using an effect modeling, the study aims at: (i) specify the effective values of rTMS parameters, with an adequate tolerance; (ii) determine the expected benefit and the persistence of effect; (iii) assess the practical feasibility of this kind of therapeutic management.</brief_summary>
