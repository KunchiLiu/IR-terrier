	<brief_summary>Insulin allergy (IA) is still observed even with recombinant human insulin and insulin analogs. Obviously, the usual attitude facing an allergy, i. e. exclusion of the allergen, poses problems in face of IA because insulin is often vital for the patient. IA is thus a complex situation in which a rigorous diagnostic procedure to identify the exact allergen is necessary to propose a therapeutic answer; the purpose of the study is 1/ to validate a diagnostic algorithm for patients presenting with possible allergy. 2/ to investigate immunogenetic profiles of patient with insulin allergy 3/ cellular mechanisms of IA.</brief_summary>
