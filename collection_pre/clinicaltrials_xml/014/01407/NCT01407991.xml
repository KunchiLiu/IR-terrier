	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare two methods of nasogastric/oral gastric (NG/OG) tube placement for efficacy and safety in the placement of NG/OG tube in infants less than 6 months of age. One method is based on the infant's length determined by measurement using a length board and plotted on a graph derived from a formula to determine the depth for tube insertion (graph method) and the other method is based on current standard of care, measuring from the nose to the ear and then the ear to mid abdomen (NEM) and mark the tube to know how far to insert the tube. Outcome comparison will be xray verification of placement.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nasogastric/Oral Gastric Tube Placement in Infants: Comparing 2 Measurement Methods</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preterm infants often require nutritional intake through a nasogastric or oral gastric tube to meet their high energy requirement and avoid aspiration of nutrition due to their immature suck/swallow reflex. When providing nutrition via an NG or OG tube, there are two basic safety issues; accurate placement, determined by the end of the tube reaching the mid abdominal area, and verification methods to assure placement is optimal. Based on a review of relevant literature, a potentially more accurate method of tube placement is available than the method used in current practice. We hypothesize the graph method will result in a more accurate and less variable placement of the NG tube into the mid-stomach of preterm infants than the current standard using the NEM method.</detailed_description>
