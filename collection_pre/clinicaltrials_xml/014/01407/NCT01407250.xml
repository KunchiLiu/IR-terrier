	<brief_title>PhysioGlove Versus Clinic Electrocardiogram Comparison</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The correct performance of a 12 lead electrocardiogram depends on the correct placement of the electrocardiogram electrodes in internationally agreed upon anatomic locations on the patient's limbs and chest. This process requires specific training and diligence on the part of the electrocardiogram performer. The literature points towards a progressive quality degradation of the electrocardiogram performance probably due to the delegation of it's performance to lesser trained individuals. This study is attempting to ascertain the quality of the electrocardiogram recordings performed in non-specialized out patient clinics. For this purpose we will compare outpatient electrocardiograms of patients referred to a cardiological consultation with electrocardiogram's acquired using a conventional electrocardiogram cable as well as the PhysioGlove-ES by the well training cardiology clinic personnel.</detailed_description>
