	<brief_summary>In a prospective randomized controlled trial, the investigators aim to assess whether external lumbar drainage (ELD) of CSF is safe and reduces delayed cerebral ischemia and its sequelae in patients with an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is a frequent complication after an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Its pathophysiological mechanism remains unclear but a role for cerebral vasospasm and the presence of blood in the arachnoid space is likely. A wash out of blood and blood breakdown products in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could reduce the incidence of vasospasm and DCI. We aim to assess whether external lumbar drainage (ELD) of CSF is safe and reduces secondary ischemia and its sequelae.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) with aneurysmal pattern graded as a Fisher grade III or higher on cerebral CTscan. CSF drainage by external lumbar catheter can start within 96 hours after the initial SAH the drainage can start prior to the treatment of the ruptured aneurysm informed consent is signed by the patient or his representative spontaneous SAH with aneurysmal pattern graded as a Fisher grade I or II on CT and perimesencephalic hemorrhages traumatic SAH symptomatic hydrocephalus on admission necessitating drainage (EVD or ELD) the presence of a large intraventricular bloodclot in the third or fourth ventricle on CT the presence of a mass lesion with significant cerebral midline shift all patients whose neurological condition is too poor to allow clinical recognition of signs and symptoms of cerebral vasospasm. This includes all patients with a Hunt and Hess Grade V who failed to improve after initial resuscitation no informed consent mycotic aneurysms</criteria>
