	<brief_summary>While antiretroviral drugs have shown great promise in reducing HIV replication and thus in reducing HIV/AIDS associated morbi-mortality and HIV transmission, the cost is substantial and side effects are a potentially limiting factor. Development of an effective safe-affordable vaccine is likely to be the best way to stop further virus spread. The study aims to determine safety and immunogenicity of the DNA-vaccine at a dose of 600µg and 1200µg delivered id in combination with MVA-CMDR boost im.</brief_summary>
