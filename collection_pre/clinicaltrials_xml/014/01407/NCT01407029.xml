	<brief_title>R3® Acetabular System in Patients With Degenerative Hip Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design was selected to assess the safety and effectiveness profile of the R3 Acetabular System in patients with degenerative joint disease requiring primary total hip replacement. A non¬-randomized, consecutive series of up to 158 patients will be enrolled, and a maximum of 8 sites will participate in the study. Each site is allowed to enroll up to 22 patients. When 158 patients are enrolled from all sites, enrollment will be stopped, regardless of the number contributed from each site. The clinical data from this study will be compared with a historical control. The study will include follow up through 5 years.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient is of legal age to consent and skeletally mature. Patient requires primary total hip arthroplasty due to noninflammatory degenerative joint disease (e.g. osteoarthritis, traumatic arthritis, avascular necrosis, and dysplasia/DDH) Patient has met an acceptable preoperative medical clearance and is free from or treated for cardiac, pulmonary, hematological, etc., conditions that would pose excessive operative risk. The patient will be available for followup throughout the duration of the study. Patient has active infection or sepsis (treated or untreated) Patient has any vascular insufficiency, muscular atrophy, or neuromuscular disease severe enough to compromise implant stability or postoperative recovery. Patient is pregnant or plans to become pregnant during the course of the study Patient has inadequate bone stock to support the device (e.g. severe osteopenia, family history of severe osteoporosis or osteopenia) Patient has inflammatory joint disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis) Patient has known moderate to severe renal insufficiency. Patient has a known or suspected metal sensitivity. Patient is immunosuppressed or receiving high doses of corticosteroids.
