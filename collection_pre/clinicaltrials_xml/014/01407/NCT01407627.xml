	<brief_summary>Fructose is an ingredient that is added to many of our foods. It is a cheaper, sweeter additive that can be found in everything from soda pop to yogurt to granola bars. In the last few years a significant number of studies have been published linking consumption of fructose with obesity, hypertension and more recently, kidney and cardiovascular disease. Animal studies show a strong link between excessive ingestion of fructose and the development of kidney and cardiovascular disease mediated by the renin angiotensin system, a hormonal system whose activation is detrimental to both the kidney and the heart. There has been very little research done on the potentially pathophysiological relationship between a high fructose diet and kidney and cardiovascular disease in humans. The investigators hypothesize that ingestion of fructose will result in upregulation of the renin angiotensin system in healthy humans.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of Fructose Ingestion and the Renin Angiotensin System in Healthy Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY AIM: To examine whether the physiologic and molecular responses to Angiotensin II (AngII) challenge differ in response to fructose intake as assessed by two independent means: 1. The renal and mean arterial pressure (MAP) response to an AngII challenge. 2. Reactive changes in circulating levels of renin and aldosterone with graded AngII challenge. PRIMARY HYPOTHESES: Ingestion of fructose in healthy subjects will result in: 1. A decrease in renal and systemic sensitivity to infused AngII. 2. A decrease in the reactive changes in renin and aldosterone with graded AngII challenge.</detailed_description>
