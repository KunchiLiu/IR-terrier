	<brief_title>Optimizing Expectations in Cardiac Surgery Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) is an extremely invasive medical intervention.It is postulated that even under these conditions, treatment outcome is substantially determined by non-specific effects, e.g. patient's expectation. Targeting patients' expectations at an early stage might have potential to optimize outcomes after cardiac surgery. The purpose of this research project is to optimize patients' outcome expectations before undergoing cardiac surgery through a brief psycho-educational program. Using a randomized controlled design, 180 patients who are scheduled to undergo elective CABG are randomly assigned either to standard medical information alone, or to an additional expectation manipulation intervention (EMI) during the two weeks before surgery, or to an attention-control group ("supportive therapy"). The main goal is to enhance positive expectations (surgery 'non-specific effects') about favorable outcome through EMI, about coping abilities to deal with adverse events, and to reduce negative expectations and misconceptions. Assessment takes place before and after EMI, 10 days after surgery and 6 months later; same assessment points are used for the 2 control conditions. Primary outcome is disability, which has been shown to be strongly determined by patient's expectation in previous studies. Moreover, psychological and biological predictors and mediators of treatment success are analyzed. A positive result for this expectation intervention would have major implications for clinical practice. In order to optimize treatment outcome, it is not only necessary to improve the treatment-specific procedures (e.g., cardiac surgery) but also to address non-specific factors such as patients' expectations.</detailed_description>
