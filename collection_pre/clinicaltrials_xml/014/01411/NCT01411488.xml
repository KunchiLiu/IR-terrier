	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to determine the prevalence of anal erosions within a 14 day period among adult ICU patients at Cleveland Clinic Main Campus who receive one of two fecal management systems (FMS). Null Hypothesis: There is no difference in the rates of anal erosion between the twp fecal management systems in a 14 day period. Alternative Hypothesis: One fecal management system is no worse than the second fecal management system in the development of anal erosion.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Study Between Two Fecal Management Systems</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PURPOSE: To compare the incidence of anal erosion between 2 indwelling fecal management systems. Anal erosion was defi ned as localized mucous membrane tissue impairments of the anal canal caused by corrosive fecal enzymes and/or indwelling devices. DESIGN: Randomized comparative effectiveness clinical trial comparing 2 commercially available indwelling fecal management systems. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: The target population was adults cared for on medical, surgical, and neurological intensive care units (ICUs) and non-ICU units with an order for indwelling fecal management system placement. The research setting was a 1200-bed quaternary-care medical center in the Midwestern United States. Seventy-nine patients participated in the study; 41 received system A and 38 received system B. Subjects' mean age was 64 ± 13.6 years (mean ± SD), and 52% were female.</detailed_description>
