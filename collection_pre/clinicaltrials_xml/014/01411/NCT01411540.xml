	<brief_title>Effects of a Wholegrain Diet on Body Composition and Energy Balance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators hypothesis is that a diet high in whole-grains reduces abdominal fat. These findings might have clinical and public health significance for reducing obesity and related co-morbidities like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Using a double-blind cross-over design, energy expenditure, body composition and metabolic health will be assessed. Three day inpatient study visits to the Cleveland Clinic Clinical Research Unit (CRU) will be implemented for metabolic control and testing. Total daily energy expenditure will be measured using the doubly labeled water (DLW) method. Body fat and glucose/protein metabolism will be assessed by imaging and isotope techniques, respectively. Blood, urine, and stool samples will also be collected for cardiometabolic and digestive health outcomes. After baseline testing, subjects will begin an 8 week dietary intervention, where all food and non-water beverages will be supplied by the study center. Dietary compliance will be assessed by weigh back measurements two times a week. To assess time course effects of diets differing in the amount of fiber on body composition and metabolic health, subjects will provide plasma and urine samples 2, 4, and 8 weeks after initial testing. Imaging and isotope analysis will be performed baseline and at week 8. All post testing will be conducted after week 8 following similar pre-testing control conditions. Subjects will then undergo an 8-10 week washout period where they will be instructed to return to their normal diet (except for any supplements). After the washout period, subjects will start the second arm of the intervention and consume the alternate diet (i.e. refined or whole grain diet). All energy expenditure, body composition and metabolic testing procedures will be repeated during the alternative arm of the study as described above.</detailed_description>
