	<brief_summary>This is an Intervention Development Study (IDS) to quantify the physical demands (using biomechanical investigation) of a 2-phase (beginning &amp; intermediate), 32-week yoga program designed for community-dwelling older adults. Additionally, the IDS will explore the adherence and adverse events of participation in the program. Data from the IDS will be used to develop evidenced-based yoga programs, which the investigators postulate will be associated with fewer musculoskeletal side effects compared to non-evidence based yoga programs. The investigators also postulate that evidenced-based tailoring of yoga for seniors will enhance adherence and efficacy. The programs developed during this IDS will be tested in an expanded, Phase II, Randomized Controlled Trial.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Yoga Empowers Seniors Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Yoga is currently being recommended to restore and preserve strength, flexibility, balance, &amp; physical capacity in older adults; however, our clinical trial experiences suggest that without proper evidenced-based prescription, Yoga participation can be ineffective or even injurious for seniors. To address this lack of evidence-based knowledge, the proposed IDS will: 1) quantify the physical demands of a 32-wk Yoga program designed for independent ambulatory seniors; 2) characterize the relations between these demands and participant physical characteristics; 3) examine the adherence, efficacy, &amp; safety of the program; and 4) characterize the relations among reported adverse events, baseline participant characteristics, and Yoga physical demands.</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Community dwelling men and women volunteers, aged 65 years or older. Safety exclusions: the following safety exclusions are adopted in order to decrease potential *cardiovascular musculoskeletal neurological risks to the participants: active angina uncontrolled hypertension (SBP greater than 160 or DBP greater than 90) high resting pulse or respiratory rate (HR &gt;90 or RR&gt;24 after 5 minutes seated) unstable asthma or exacerbated COPD cervical spine instability or other significant neck injury rheumatoid arthritis unstable ankle, knee, hip, shoulder, elbow, or wrist joints hemiparesis or paraparesis movement disorders (e.g. Parkinson's disease), peripheral neuropathies, stroke with residual deficits, severe vision or hearing problems walker or wheelchair use insufficient hearing to permit safety in a yoga group setting not able to attend inperson classes has not had checkup by regular provider within 12 months (if not taking any prescription medications) or in the past 6 months (if any regular medicines taken); cannot pass specific movement safety tests (tests described in section on screening visits, below) Feasibility/adherence exclusions: 1. unable to understand their commitment to the project, (laboratory visits &amp; regular program participation) 2. cognitive limitations significant enough to preclude informed consent or to raise concerns about participation safety</criteria>
