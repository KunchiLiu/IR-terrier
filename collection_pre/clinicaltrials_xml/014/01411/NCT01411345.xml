	<brief_summary>1. The investigators hypothesize that increasing radiation dose to the functional MRI-defined lesion in the prostate bed will result in an improved initial complete response (reduction in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to &lt; 0.1 ng/mL), which is related to long-term outcome biochemically. 2. Biomarker expression levels differ in the DCE-MRI enhancing and non-enhancing tumor regions. 3. 10-15% of men undergoing RT have free circulating DNA (fcDNA) or tumor cells (CTC) that are related to an adverse treatment outcome. 4. Prostate cancer-related anxiety will be reduced in the MRI targeted SRT arm, because the patients will be aware that the dominant tumor will be targeted with higher radiation dose.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>A. Prostate cancer patients with a PSA after prostatectomy of at least 0.1 ng/mL and up to 4.0 ng/mL within 3 months prior to enrollment. B. Patients with or without palpable abnormalities on digital rectal exam (DRE) are eligible. C. Minimum of 3 months since prostatectomy to allow for return of urinary continence and healing. D. MRI detectable lesion in prostate bed. DCEMRI enhancing lesion in the prostate bed should be at least 0.4 cc and a maximum of 6 cc and was obtained ≤ 3 months prior to enrollment. E. No evidence of metastatic (regional or distant) disease on the pelvic MRI. F. Negative bone scan if deemed necessary by treating physician obtained ≤ 4 months prior to enrollment. G. No previous pelvic radiotherapy. H. Serum total testosterone is within 40% of normal assay limits, taken within 34 months prior to enrollment. Patient who have been started on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) prior to signing consent are not required to have serum testosterone with the range outlined; but, should have a serum testosterone level recorded prior to enrollment. I. No concurrent, active malignancy, other than nonmetastatic skin cancer or early stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia (welldifferentiated small cell lymphocytic lymphoma). If a prior malignancy is in remission for ≥ 5 years then the patient is eligible. J. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. K. Zubrod performance status &lt; 2. L. Patients must agree to fill out quality of life/psychosocial questionnaires. M. Age ≥ 35 and ≤ 85 years. A. Prior androgen deprivation therapy is not permitted if it was within 6 months previous to signing consent form. (NOTE: Therapy given as part of the planned course of radiation is allowed).</criteria>
