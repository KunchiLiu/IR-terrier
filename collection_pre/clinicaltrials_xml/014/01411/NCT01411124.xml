	<brief_title>Study to Assess the Effect of Gabapentin Enacarbil on Simulated Driving in Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>proportional systemic gabapentin exposure over a wide dose range. This is a double-blind, placebo-and active-controlled 3-period crossover study designed to assess the effect of GEn 600 mg on simulated driving performance. Subjects will receive each of 3 treatments in a randomized order: GEn 600 mg, placebo and placebo/diphenhydramine 50 mg. Each treatment period will consist of 6 days, with subjects being dosed at approximately 5 pm on each dosing day. The placebo /diphenhydramine treatment will consist of placebo on Days 1-4 and 6 and 50 mg diphenhydramine on Day 5. Placebo will be administered on Day 6 in all treatment periods to ensure washout of drug prior to the start of the next treatment period. Simulated driving performance will be assessed at baseline (prior to randomization) and on Day 5 in the evening (7-9 pm) and on Day 6 between7-9 am and between 11am-1pm for each treatment period.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Healthy as determined by a responsible physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and ECG. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age, at the time of signing the informed consent. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of Nonchildbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation at least 6 months previously or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/mL and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/mL (&lt;140 pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods in Section 8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 24 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method.Childbearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1 for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until the followup visit is completed.

One drink is equivalent to (12 g alcohol) = 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 12 ounces (360 mL) of beer or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of 80 proof distilled spirits. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current study: 30 days, 5 halflives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer). Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first dosing day. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 halflives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety History of sensitivity to gabapentin, DPH or components thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period Pregnant females as determined by positive serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) test at screening or prior to dosing Lactating females Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol The subject has a screening heart rate &lt;50 or &gt;100 bpm or a systolic blood pressure &gt;140 or &lt;100 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure &gt;90 or &lt;60 mmHg in the semisupine position after at least 3 minutes of rest.
