	<brief_summary>Development of glucocorticoid (GC)-induced adrenal insufficiency is a serious adverse effect of GC treatment. It is today not possible to predict this adverse effect. The project aims at investigating a possible individual aspect, which may render subjects more or less sensitive to glucocorticoids, and thereby influence development of GC induced adrenal insufficiency. The hypothesis is that subjects with one or another of the polymorphisms in the GC receptor gene will either have increased or diminished GC sensitivity. This may be responsible for differences in development of GC induced adrenal insufficiency.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Difference in GC-induced Adrenal Insufficiency in RA Related to Polymorphisms in the Glucocorticoid Receptor Gene</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Blood is sampled from 200 pts with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), fulfilling the inclusion criteria and their GR haplotypes will be determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 2 x 25 patients with the interesting GR polymorphisms, and these will be included for a Synacthen test of their adrenal function. Information from the results of the study will be able to assist clinicians to identify patients at risk and thus individualize GC therapy in a tailored fashion. Results of the study will be important for all patient groups worldwide on GC therapy.</detailed_description>
