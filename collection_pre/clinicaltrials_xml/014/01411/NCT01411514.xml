	<brief_summary>The management of MS-patients requires treatment with immune-modifying or immune-suppressive agents to prevent new relapses and progression of disability. Several studies have evaluated the effect of steroid treatment on clinical recovery after an acute relapse. An important unanswered clinical question is, whether or not an oral tapering dose of corticosteroids offers any additional advantage over intravenous methylprednisolone alone in improving neurologic recovery as well as safety and tolerability after a relapse. This study aims to compare the efficacy, tolerability and safety of tapering doses of oral prednisone and placebo after short-term high-dose i.v. methylprednisolone on the recovery from an acute relapse in patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RR-MS) and primary (PP-MS) or secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SP-MS) with superimposed relapses. Patients will be treated during 25 days with de-escaling doses of prednisone or placebo. The primary analysis will test whether placebo is equivalent to oral prednisone taper on the recovery status as measured by EDSS change from baseline to 3 months after baseline.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oral Prednisone Taper Versus Placebo for the Treatment of Acute Relapses in Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose of this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, prospective, parallel group, single centre study is to evaluate the effect of tapering oral doses of prednisone or placebo taken during 25 days following short-term high-dose i.v. methylprednisolone on the outcome of a relapse in patients with CIS; RR-MS, PP-MS or SP-MS with superimposed relapses. The primary objective is to assess and compare the recovery status in both patient groups 3 months after baseline by means of Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Secondary objectives are the assessments of clinical parameters at the end of oral treatment, 6, 9 months after baseline, of MRI markers, of mental and cognitive status, quality of life and fatigue at the end of oral treatment, 3 and 6 months after baseline in both patient groups. After standard treatment of an acute clinical relapse with high dose, short term i.v. methyprednisolone patients will be randomised to one of the two treatment arms. Patients allocated to prednisone will be treated with tapering oral doses during 25 days. The initial dose of 60 mg will be reduced twice by 20 mg, than by 10 and 5 mg. Each dose regimen will be taken during 5Â±2 days. Patients randomised to placebo will receive placebo treatment during 25 days.</detailed_description>
