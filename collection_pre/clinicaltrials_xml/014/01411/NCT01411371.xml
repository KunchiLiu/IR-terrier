	<brief_summary>Heart failure and atrial fibrillation (AF) often coexist, and each increases the morbidity and mortality associated with the other. The investigators hypothesized that restoration of normal sinus rhythm by catheter ablation is superior to medical treatment of AF in heart failure. This study randomizes patients with heart failure and persistent AF to medical treatment of AF or catheter ablation to restore sinus rhythm.</brief_summary>
