	<brief_summary>The aim of the study is to assess whether the second CYD dengue vaccination could be administered concomitantly with the booster vaccination of a pediatric combination vaccine (Pentaxim™) during the same day and visit but in 2 different sites of administration. Primary Objective: - To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the antibody response against all antigens (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio and Hib) in participants receiving one booster dose of Pentaxim™ vaccine administered concomitantly with the second dose of CYD dengue vaccine compared to subjects receiving one booster dose of Pentaxim™ vaccine administered concomitantly with placebo. Secondary Objectives: - To describe the safety of Pentaxim™ vaccine administered concomitantly with the second dose of CYD dengue vaccine, or administered concomitantly with placebo. - To describe the safety of the CYD dengue vaccine in all subjects after each dose. - To describe the antibody response to each dengue virus serotype (post-Dose 2 and post-Dose 3) after the second dose of CYD dengue vaccine administered concomitantly with Pentaxim vaccine or administered alone. - To describe the antibody response to each dengue virus serotype post-Dose 2 and post-Dose 3 in all subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of a Booster Injection of Pentaxim™ Vaccine Administered With Dengue Vaccine in Healthy Toddlers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants will require 8 or 9 clinic visits and will receive a total of 7 injections. The dengue post-vaccinal viremia will be assessed at Visit 2 from a subset of toddlers. The dengue immunogenicity will be assessed 28 days after CYD dengue dose 2 and dose 3 from a subset of toddlers. All participants will be followed-up for safety after each vaccine dose and for 6 months after the last dengue vaccination.</detailed_description>

Planned participation in another clinical trial during the present trial period. Planned receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks following any trial vaccination. Previous vaccination against flavivirus diseases, measles, mumps, rubella, previous booster vaccination against pneumococcal diseases, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae b (Hib) and/or polio. Receipt of blood or bloodderived products in the past 3 months which might interfere with assessment of the immune response. Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency; or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy such as anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the preceding 6 months; or longterm systemic corticosteroid therapy (prednisone or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks within the past 3 months). Personal seropositivity for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis C as reported by the parent(s)/legally acceptable representative. History of pertussis and/or Hib infection as reported by the parent(s)/legally acceptable representative. Known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components, or history of a lifethreatening reaction to the vaccines used in the trial or to a vaccine containing any of the same substances . History of contraindication to the receipt of vaccines containing components of Pentaxim vaccine (diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, pertussis toxoid, filamentous hemagglutinin, polyribosylribitol phosphate [PRP] and polio) or of Trimovax (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine and of Prevenar (pneumococcal) vaccine. Thrombocytopenia, as reported by the parent(s)/legally acceptable representative. Bleeding disorder, or receipt of anticoagulants in the 3 weeks preceding inclusion, contraindicating intramuscular vaccination.</criteria>
