	<brief_summary>Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor (CNTF) has been demonstrated in multiple preclinical models to enhance survival and regeneration of retinal ganglion cells, the retinal neurons injured in diseases like ischemic optic neuropathy/optic nerve stroke. We hypothesize that CNTF delivery to the human eye will provide neuroprotection (prevent loss of vision) and neuroenhancement (improve vision indices) in ischemic optic neuropathy. Patients in the trial will receive an NT-501 CNTF implant (made by Neurotech) into one eye, and will be carefully followed to evaluate safety and efficacy.</brief_summary>
