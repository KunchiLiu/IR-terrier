	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out how doses of IPX066 required to help people with Parkinson's disease compare to those required for carbidopa-levodopa sustained-release tablets (also known as SinemetÂ® CR).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carbidopa-Levodopa Extended-Release (CD-LD ER) Alone or in Combination With Carbidopa-Levodopa Immediate Release (IR) to IPX066 Followed by Extension Safety Study of IPX066 in Subjects With Advanced Parkinson's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part 1 - This study is a multicenter open-label study. Subjects will be converted from their current treatment to IPX066 over a 6-week period. Up to 40 subjects will be enrolled in the study. Subjects will be entered into one of two cohorts. Approximately 24 subjects will enroll in Cohort 1 (non- Objective Parkinson's Disease Measurement (OPDM) subjects) and up-to 16 subjects at selected sites will enroll in Cohort 2 (OPDM/PK subjects). Along with the OPDM measurements, PK blood samples may also be collected from these subjects. Part 2 - Following the successful completion of Part 1 of the study, eligible subjects may participate in Part 2, a 6-month open-label extension study.</detailed_description>
