	<brief_summary>The study aims to assess 1) the electrical activity of the diaphragm in mechanically ventilated patients during weaning from mechanical ventilation. 2) Whether the electrical activity of the diaphragm may predict the weaning outcome</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Electrical Activity of the Diaphragm During the Weaning Period</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Optimization of the time to liberate the patient from mechanical ventilation should be balanced between the risks associated with failed extubation and those related to prolonged mechanical ventilation. Weaning failure is associated with major complications. Even when weaning protocols and clinical predictors have been used to improve the weaning outcome, there is still a significant proportion of patients who fail to breath spontaneously with significant risks of pneumonia, prolonged mechanical ventilation and increased morbidity and mortality rate. Electrical activity of the diaphragm, a mirror of the respiratory drive and now available on an ICU ventilator may help to predict in a more accurate way the weaning outcome. The patients will be ventilated in NAVA with the titration method (1). As soon as patients passed successfully a daily screening EAdi will be measured during a spontaneous breathing trial.</detailed_description>
