	<detailed_description>Additionally, the investigators will assess the feasibility and efficacy of a novel medication monitoring and reminder system (MedSignalsÂ®) in the form of an electronic pillbox with monitoring and reminding functions that is available in a Spanish-language version. Our hypotheses are grounded in a conceptual model proposing that the CBT-AD intervention will improve problem-solving ability and decrease depressive symptomatology, which will directly improve biomedical outcomes of HIV-1 RNA viral load and CD4 as well as indirectly improve biomedical outcomes through increased motivation, improved memory, and better medication adherence. Evaluating and implementing generalizable and sustainable mental health and adherence interventions such as the ones proposed are urgently needed in the region to improve HIV treatment outcomes and thwart the development and transmission of drug resistant virus.</detailed_description>
