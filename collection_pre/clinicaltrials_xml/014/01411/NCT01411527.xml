Blood sample: For measurement of hormone levels (FSH, LH, estradiol, SHBG, testosterone, DHEAS, androstenedione, inhibin A, inhibin B, Insl3, kisspeptin, ghrelin, leptin, IGF-1, IGFBP3, TSH, T4, Free T4, T3, HbA1C, calcium-ion, PTH, phosphate, 25-OH-vitamine D, AMH), endocrine disrupters (PCBÂ´s, dioxines, parabens, phthalates), isolation of DNA and RNA to evaluate relevant polymorphisms. Questionaire: regarding information of previous growth and health.</detailed_description>
