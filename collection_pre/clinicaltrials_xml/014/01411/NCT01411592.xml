	<brief_summary>The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of all-ceramic RBFDP with a cantilevered single-retainer design made from zirconia ceramic. To evaluate the impact of the adhesive system used an established resin cement with an integrated adhesive monomer (Panavia 21 TC) and a resin cement with a separate primer (Multilink Automix with Metal/Zirconia Primer) were compared within the study on a randomized basis. The aim of the present randomized study was to evaluate wether the difference in bond strength of Panavia and Multilink Automix with Metal/Zirconia Primer to densely sintered zirconia ceramic (IPS e.max ZirCAD, Ivoclar Vivadent) has any impact on the clinical outcome of all-ceramic RBFDP with a cantilevered single-retainer design.</brief_summary>
