	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate intracervical lidocaine gel as a means to decrease pain associated with intrauterine device (IUD) insertion. They will be randomized to either placebo (inert water based lubricating gel) or 2% lidocaine gel to be placed intracervically via angio-catheter just before IUD insertion. Anticipated pain scores will be assessed using a visual analog scale prior to insertion. Using the same pain scale, patients will again be asked at the end of the procedure to rate their pain.</brief_summary>
