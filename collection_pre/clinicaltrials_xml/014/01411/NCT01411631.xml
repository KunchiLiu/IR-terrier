	<brief_summary>There is some evidence that polyphenols can affect cognitive function. Therefore, consumption of polyphenols has the potential to prevent cognitive impairment or even enhance cognitive performance. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of polyphenol consumption served in the form of Concord Grape Juice (CGJ) on cognitive performance and driving performance in Mums. The study design will be a repeated measures, double-blind, randomised, placebo controlled, crossover study. There will be 2 conditions; CGJ and a placebo drink. 20 participants will undergo two 12 week dietary interventions which will entail daily consumption of a 12oz serving of CGJ or placebo in a counterbalanced manner. There will be a 4 week washout period between conditions. At baseline, 6, and 12 weeks of each 12-week treatment arm cognitive performance and driving performance will be assessed (using the driving simulator at the Institute for Transport Studies). CGJ is a common ingredient in commercially available products. Mums will be defined as mothers of pre-teen children (aged under 13 years) who are aged 40-50. This population generally have hectic and stressful lifestyles and therefore there is potential for this population to receive cognitive benefit from polyphenol consumption.</brief_summary>
