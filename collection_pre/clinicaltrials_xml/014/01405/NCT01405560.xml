	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of vaniprevir (300 mg twice daily) given in combination with pegylated interferon alfa-2b (peg-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) in Japanese participants with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype (GT) 1 who have not responded to previous treatment. The primary efficacy objective is to estimate efficacy of vaniprevir, peg-IFN and RBV for 24 weeks as assessed by the percentage of participants achieving undetectable Hepatitis C Virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) 24 weeks after completion of all study therapy (Sustained Viral Response 24 [SVR24]).</brief_summary>
