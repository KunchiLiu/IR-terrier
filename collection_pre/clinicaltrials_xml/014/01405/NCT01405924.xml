	<brief_summary>This study will assess the efficacy of a single dose of intravenous (IV) fosaprepitant (MK-0517, EMEND® IV) as salvage therapy when added to a 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3 antagonist (5-HT3 RA) and dexamethasone for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced vomiting (CIV) in participants who experienced CIV in the first cycle of moderately emetic chemotherapy (MEC). The primary hypothesis is that there will be no vomiting and no retching in at least 20% of participants during the second cycle of MEC in participants who previously experienced vomiting during the first cycle of MEC.</brief_summary>
