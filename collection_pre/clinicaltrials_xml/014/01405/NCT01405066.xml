	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to quantify variation in radiation dose levels across CT technologists, and determine the effectiveness of combining radiation dose audit reports and an educational seminar as a means to reduce the variation and level of patient exposure to radiation. The investigators expect the radiation dose audit reports and educational seminar will lead to reduced radiation exposure to patients by making technologists more aware of the risks of radiation exposure from CT exams and identifying technologists with higher radiation exams compared with their peers. The investigators expect the degree to which a technologist is concerned and aware about radiation exposure and cancer risk will be associated with adherence to radiation reduction protocols and the subsequent level of radiation their patients are exposed to when receiving a CT examination.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Dose Audit Reports to Reduce Radiation Exposure From CT Exams</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use of advanced diagnostic imaging has increased dramatically over the past decade, not only contributing to rising medical costs but also exposure to ionizing radiation, of which CT imaging plays a prominent role because it requires a relatively high dose of radiation to produce an image when compared to conventional X-rays. The growth in the use of CT imaging along with all other advanced medical imaging has been well documented, and taken as a whole the use of these services has grown quicker than all other services provided by physicians. Research has also shown great variability in the amount of radiation exposure to individual patients, even when patient and other characteristics are controlled for. Given the increase in the use of CT imaging and the variability in radiation exposure between similar imaging exams, it is important to study ways of standardizing and reducing radiation levels from CT imaging. Little is understood about the role of CT technologists' attitudes and how they may influence patient radiation exposure, therefore, this project also give us the opportunity to survey the technologists and determine if there is a relationship between technologist attitudes and awareness and the radiation exposure of patients.</detailed_description>
