	<brief_summary>Infant and young child feeding (IYCF) is a key determinant of under-nutrition and overweight in young children. In Mexico, breastfeeding extends well into the second half of infancy, but animal-source foods, cereals, and legumes are not regularly provided to the child by 9 mo. This study evaluates whether knowledge and practices about dietary diversity and food consistency can be improved using a two-component intervention strategy in semi-urban communities in Mexico. The two components will deliver appropriate complementary feeding messages using: (a) nurses during the 1st National Vaccination Week (NVW); and (b) radio messages and interviews. The intervention is evaluated using a cluster randomized design in small semi-urban communities in two states in Mexico with pre- and post-test questionnaires designed to assess changes in feeding behaviors.</brief_summary>
