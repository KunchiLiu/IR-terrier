	<brief_summary>The rationale for this research study is to evaluate the effect on clinical outcomes of weight bearing as tolerated after forage surgery for the treatment of osteochondral defects of the ankle, thus potentially eliminating the need for a period of immobilisation or non-weight bearing after surgery. The investigators hypothesize that their will be no difference in functional outcomes between weight bearing as tolerated as compared to non-weight bearing for six weeks after forage surgery for OCD of the ankle.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of the Effect of Weight Bearing Status on Patient Outcomes After Surgery for Osteochondral Defects of the Ankle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis for advantage of the investigational post-operative therapy is based on: Equivalent clinical outcomes to non-weight bearing; Similar radiographic findings on CT at follow-up visit between the two groups; reduced morbidity and disability to subjects through elimination of a period of non-weight bearing; reduction of cost to patients by eliminating need for adjuvant walking and mobility aids (crutches, taxis) and time off work.</detailed_description>
