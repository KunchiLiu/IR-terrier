	<criteria>Key Inclusion: 1. Clinical diagnosis of LGS at screening, which might include the presence of a slow background electroencephalogram (EEG) rhythm, slow spikeswaves pattern (less than 3 Hz), the presence of polyspikes; care should be taken not to include benign myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, subjects with a diagnosis of atypical benign partial epilepsy (pseudoLennox syndrome), or continuous spikewaves of slow sleep (CSWS). 2. On a fixed dose of one to three concomitant regionally approved antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for a minimum of 8 weeks prior to randomization with an inadequate response to treatment. 3. Consistent seizure documentation (i.e., no uncertainty of the presence of seizures) and AED treatment documentation during the 8 week prerandomization period. Key Exclusion: 1. Familial short QT syndrome 2. Prior treatment with rufinamide</criteria>
