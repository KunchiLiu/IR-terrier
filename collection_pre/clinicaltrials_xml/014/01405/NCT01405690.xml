	<brief_summary>Computer tomography coronary angiogram (CTCA) has emerged as a noninvasive alternative to assessing coronary artery luminal disease. Although the use of noninvasive CTCA for the detection of coronary artery disease is on the rise, the current technology of the 64-row multidetector computer tomography (MDCT) is subjected to multiple patient artifacts that can affect image quality.To eliminate these patient related artifacts a more advanced 320-row MDCT was recently developed. The investigators therefore propose that the newly developed 320-MDCT can provide an accurate noninvasive assessment of the severity of coronary artery luminal stenosis as an alternative to an invasive coronary angiogram.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role Of Noninvasive 320-Row Multidetector Computer Tomography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study consisting of a prospective non-randomized observational trial where a team of surgeon, anesthesiologist, and evaluator are blinded to CTCA results. We hypothesize that the preoperative use of noninvasive computer tomography, with the 320-row MDCT, to visualize the degree of coronary artery stenosis can lead to improved clinical prediction of perioperative cardiac complications. The 320-row MDCT is based on the 64-row technology with the significant addition of a larger detector capable of scanning the heart within 1 sec or a cardiac cycle, thereby, eliminating patient-related artifacts and may produce higher image quality.13, 14 The scanning time of 5 seconds with the 320-row MDCT is significantly reduced compared to 8-10 seconds for the 64-row MDCT</detailed_description>
