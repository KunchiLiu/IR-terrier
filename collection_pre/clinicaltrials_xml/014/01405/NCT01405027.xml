	<brief_title>Impact of Physician Directed Education on Patient Compliance With Hepatitis C Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The new treatment paradigm for HCV in the era of protease inhibitors will add a level of complexity that was previously not seen with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. In addition to new concepts such as utilization of a lead-in period, compliance with a TID dosing regimen of a third agent, development of resistance, and futility rules and decision points have yet to be assessed in a real life practice setting. The OPTIMAL trial is designed to evaluate the impact of an education program for community sites participating in a CLDF study treating chronic HCV genotype 1 patients. Group A will be comprised of approximately 30 CLDF designated Hepatology Centers of Educational Expertise (HCEE) and Group B will be comprised of approximately 60 community sites. Group A will also deliver the educational program regarding the use of HCV protease inhibitors, and the overall treatment of HCV to approximately two (2) community sites in it's geographic region. Group B will be comprised of community sites that have no previous clinical trial experience with boceprevir or an HCV protease inhibitor. For the purpose of this study, each community site in Group B will be assigned to an HCEE.</detailed_description>
