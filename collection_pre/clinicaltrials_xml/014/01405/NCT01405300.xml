	<brief_summary>Pilot study data have demonstrated that peanuts ameliorate the postprandial glucose and insulin response when incorporated into an acute high fat/high glucose meal. However, it is unclear whether acute consumption of peanuts can also influence vascular function. This study will therefore evaluate the effects of acute peanut consumption on vascular function, glycemic control, and plasma lipids. The hypothesis is that that addition of peanuts to a high fat/high glucose meal will reduce the production of triglycerides, glucose, and improve endothelial function as measured by flow-mediated dilation (FMD).</brief_summary>
