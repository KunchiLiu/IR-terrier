	<brief_summary>It is a prospective, non-randomized, monocentric study. The purpose of the study is to assess the predictive value of VE-cadherin on the objective tumor response. Biological factors will be correlated to clinical outcome measures. 100 patients treated with bevacizumab for a metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma will be enrolled. Patients will be followed every 10 weeks until progression in spite of bevacizumab or until they stop bevacizumab because of toxicity. Bevacizumab will be administered according to investigators appreciation. Blood samples will be collected at enrollment, at second bevacizumab's administration and every 10 weeks until progression, or until patients stop bevacizumab because of toxicity or until one year at most in case that patients still receive bevacizumab.</brief_summary>
