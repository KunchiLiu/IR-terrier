	<brief_summary>It is well known the efficacy of 5% 5-fluoruracil for multiple and superficial actinic keratosis (AKs)treatment. Recently its additional benefit for advanced and severe photoaging while treating Aks was reported. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of the two modalities of 5% 5-FU use for forearms photoaging.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>5fluorouracil for Advanced Photoaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use of 5% 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) cream, twice a day, during 3 weeks represents a classic treatment for multiple and superficial AKs. The main adverse event is the severe skin irritation leading to interruption of the treatment in some cases. In the last decade a superficial pulse-peeling using it as agent in sequential applications was described. This modality of treatment has been demonstrated efficacy and better tolerability. The improvement of the overall aspect of photodamaged skin is observed while treating multiple AKs. There are no comparative study between the two types of 5% 5-FU use. So that is the purpose of our clinical trial.</detailed_description>
