	<brief_summary>Activating somatic mutations of the tyrosine kinase domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been characterized in a subset of patients with advanced NSCLC.The EGFR mutation rate was 30% in Chinese Non-small Cell Lung Cancer(NSCLC). Patients harboring these mutations in their tumors show excellent response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). This randomized phase III trial is studying gefitinib to see how well it works compared to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in treating patients who have undergone surgery for stage II-IIIA(N1-N2) NSCLC with EGFR activating mutation in Asian population.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gefitinib Versus Vinorelbine/Platinum as Adjuvant Treatment in Stage II-IIIA(N1-N2) NSCLC With EGFR Mutation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy is recommended for routine use in patients with stages IIA, IIB, and IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after complete resection. Cisplatin and vinorelbine combination is the standard of care in adjuvant setting. The BR. 19 trial reported adjuvant gefitinib after complete resection of early stage NSCLC(stage IB 49%, II 38%, III 13%) did not confer disease free survival(DFS) or overall survival(OS) advantage in overall population. While the median gefitinib treatment time is only 4.8 months. There are only 76 patients with EGFR mutations included in this analysis. The study closed prematurely in 2005. Activating somatic mutations of the tyrosine kinase domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been characterized in a subset of patients with advanced NSCLC.The EGFR mutation rate was 30% in Chinese NSCLC. Patients harboring these mutations in their tumors show excellent response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). This randomized phase III trial is studying gefitinib to see how well it works compared to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in treating patients who have undergone surgery for stage II-IIIA(N1-N2) NSCLC with EGFR activating mutation in Asian population.</detailed_description>

Adequate renal function: Serum creatinine ≤ 1.25 x ULN, or ≥ 60 ml/min. Female subjects should not be pregnant or breastfeeding. Known severe hypersensitivity to gefitinib or any of the excipients of this product. Known severe hypersensitivity to premedications required for treatment with cisplatin / vinorelbine doublet chemotherapy. Inability to comply with protocol or study procedures. A serious concomitant systemic disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the patient's ability to complete the study. A serious cardiac condition, such as myocardial infarction within 6 months, angina, or heart disease. Interstitial pneumonia. Patients with prior exposure to agents directed at the HER axis (e.g. erlotinib, gefitinib, cetuximab, trastuzumab). Patients with prior chemotherapy or therapy with systemic antitumour therapy (e.g. monoclonal antibody therapy). Patients with prior radiotherapy History of another malignancy in the last 5 years with the exception of the following:Other malignancies cured by surgery alone and having a continuous diseasefree interval of 5 years are permitted. Cured basal cell carcinoma of the skin and cured in situ carcinoma of the uterine cervix are permitted. Any unstable systemic disease (including active infection, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within the previous year, serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication, hepatic, renal, or metabolic disease). Eye inflammation or eye infection not fully treated or conditions predisposing the subject to this. Evidence of any other disease, neurological or metabolic dysfunction, physical examination or laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicated the use of an investigational drug or puts the subject at high risk for treatmentrelated complications. Patient who has active serious infection (e.g. pyrexia of or 38.0℃ over) Patients who harbouring exon 20 T790M mutation.</criteria>
