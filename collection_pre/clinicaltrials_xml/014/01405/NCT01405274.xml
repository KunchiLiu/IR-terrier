	<brief_summary>This study will investigate whether adding a physiotherapy intervention to standard Emergency Department care will lead to improved recovery following an ankle sprain in the pediatric and adolescent population as well as to a decrease recurrence of injuries during the year following the initial ankle sprain. Children will be allocated to standard care or to the added intervention group. The study hypothesis is that recovery will be better while recurrence of injury will be less in those receiving the added physiotherapy intervention.</brief_summary>
