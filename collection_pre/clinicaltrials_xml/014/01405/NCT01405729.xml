	<brief_title>Medial Patellofemoral Ligament Reconstruction: A Review of Technique, Accuracy, and Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) has been shown to be an effective treatment for recurrent patellar instability, There has been some concern in the literature about the accuracy of femoral tunnel placement and the effect that it might have on patient outcomes. The investigators evaluated the accuracy of MPFL placement using an intraopetative fluoroscopy technique and to assess subsequent patient outcomes. All patients undergoing MPFL reconstruction using an intraoperative fluoroscopically guided technique between 2005 and 2010 were identified. A retrospective review of their charts and radiographs were performed and the subjects were brought back for a follow up exam, radiographic series, and Kujala questionaire.</detailed_description>
