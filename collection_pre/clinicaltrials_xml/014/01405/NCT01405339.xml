	<brief_summary>Budesonide, a steroid subtype, has been used as an adjunctive treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis as a topical nasal steroid spray. The current standard of care at St. Paul's Sinus Centre is to administer budesonide via the Mucosal Atomization Device (MAD). It is believed that the MAD is a better device than the standard nasal lavage because its fine mist enhances absorption and improves bioavailability. No studies have been done to determine if enhanced absorption and improved bioavailability of budesonide via MAD could potentially affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, resulting in the suppression of our own body's production of natural steroids.</brief_summary>
