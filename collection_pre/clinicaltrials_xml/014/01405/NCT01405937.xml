	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of vaniprevir given in combination with pegylated interferon alfa-2b (PegIntron®/peg-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) Genotype I (GT 1) participants who relapsed after previous therapy with interferon-based therapy. The primary efficacy hypothesis is that the percentage of participants achieving sustained virologic response 24 weeks after completion of all study therapy (SVR24) in at least one of the vaniprevir 300 mg twice daily treatment regimens is greater than 20% (historical data of standard of care treatment).</brief_summary>
