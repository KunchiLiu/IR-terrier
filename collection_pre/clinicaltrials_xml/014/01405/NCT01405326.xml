	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to assess whether a 6-month treatment with adalimumab added on the treatment with conventional antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) will decrease the number of days on sick leave compared to placebo. In addition, the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of the intervention compared to the conventional treatment is evaluated, and the patients who benefit most are characterized.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>REstore Working Ability in RheumatoiD Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In spite of the improved medical treatment, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is still causing both significant morbidity and marked loss of work productivity. Short periods of work inability, i.e., sick leaves represent a significant part of the socioeconomic burden of RA. The study is a randomized, controlled double blind multi-center study. 160 patients of 25 to 55 years of age with recent-onset (≤2 years from diagnosis) RA who have been treated with a combination of conventional antirheumatic drugs but have an inadequate response to treatment and are at the risk of losing their ability to work, are enrolled. The patients should be biologic-naïve. Their RA should be active, but not so active that the conventional criteria for biologic therapy would be fulfilled. The subjects are randomized at 1:1 ratio to receive either adalimumab (40 mg every two weeks) or placebo for 6 months added on their concurrent antirheumatic therapy. The RA-related sickness absence and clinical response will be evaluated.</detailed_description>
