	<brief_summary>Overview: This open label, randomized, multi-centre study will enroll and treat 24 patients with refractory AAV. Aims: To determine the clinical response and severe adverse event rates associated with alemtuzumab therapy among patients with relapsing or refractory ANCA associated vasculitis (AAV). Hypothesis: Treatment with alemtuzumab induces sustained remission in AAV and will reduce immunosuppressive and steroid exposure.</brief_summary>
