	<brief_summary>Current planning for studies involving patients with recurrent, persistent, or metastasized cervical cancer must take into consideration that up to 75% of all patients are assumed to have already been treated with cisplatin in conjunction with radiation therapy. It seems questionable to continue to treat patients with cisplatin when cancer has recurred. Thus, it is important to seek alternative active combinations. The studies GOG 169 and 179 demonstrated that a combination of paclitaxel and cisplatin was superior to a cisplatin monotherapy with respect to therapeutic response and progression-free survival, as was a combination of topotecan and cisplatin with respect to therapeutic response, progression-free survival, and total survival. To achieve further improvement in total survival and to answer questions regarding the value of using a platinum-free combination, we propose that a study should be conducted to compare the efficacy of a platinum-free combination of paclitaxel and topotecan to a combination of cisplatin and topotecan.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study on Paclitaxel Plus Topotecan in Comparison With Topotecan Plus Cisplatin in Recurrent or Persistent Cervical Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design: This will be a prospective, randomized, multicenter, non-blinded phase III A study. Dosages: Arm A Paclitaxel 70 mg/m2/d i.v. on Days 1, 8, and 15 in combination with Topotecan 1.75 mg/m2/d i.v. on Days 1, 8, and 15, q 28 d Arm B Topotecan 0.75 mg/m2/d i.v. on Days 1- 3 in combination with Cisplatin 50 mg/m2 i.v. on Day 1, q 21 d Duration of Therapy: Each patient will participate in the study until a maximum of six cycles have been completed, or until there is evidence of disease progression, or until toxicity prevents further therapy. Patients with continued response or stable disease may continue to participate in the study for an additional 3 cycles beyond the original 6 cycles with consent of the Study Director, but this must be documented in the CRF.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have a histologically confirmed recurrent, persistent, or metastasized squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, or adenocarcinoma of the cervix, for which a curative treatment by operation and/or radiation therapy is not possible. Patients must have been previously treated with cisplatin in the context of radiochemotherapy. All patients must present with measurable disease. Measurable disease is defined as a minimum of one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest dimension to be recorded). Each lesion must measure ≥ 20 mm when measured by conventional techniques, including palpation, xray, CT, and MRI, or ≥ 10 mm when measured by spiral CT. Patients must have at least one "target lesion" that can be used to evaluate response according to RECIST criteria during this study. When a biopsy is performed, it should be performed on this lesion. A lesion outside of the irradiated area should ideally be selected as the "target lesion" on patients who have tumors both inside and outside a previously irradiated area. A previously irradiated lesion may only be considered as a "target lesion" if, after the radiation therapy had been completed, this lesion objectively led to a diagnosis of recurrence, or progress specific to this lesion was observed. Patients must display the following: Sufficient hematologic function: absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1. 500/μl; granulocytes &gt; 3,000/μl; thrombocytes ≥ 100,000/μl. Sufficient renal function: serum creatinine ≤ 1.2 mg/dl. In patients with a serum A prospective, randomized phase III study to compare the effects of Paclitaxel and Topotecan to those of Cisplatin and Topotecan for treatment of patients with recurrent or persistent cervical cancer Page 24 Study Protocol Version 1.1 dated 09/25/2006 creatinine of &gt; 1.2 mg/dl, the results of a 24hour creatinine clearance must yield a level &gt; 50 cm3/min for eligibility. Sufficient liver function: bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal, GOT, alkaline phosphatase ≤ 3 times the institutional upper limit of normal. Patients must display an ECOG performance status of 02 (Karnofsky &gt; 60%). Patients must have recovered from the aftereffects of any surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. A minimum of six weeks must have passed since the last administration of chemotherapy, and at least three weeks must have passed since the last treatment with radiation alone. Patients must have signed an official consent document which also authorizes the release of personal health information. Patients unable to give their consent independently may not participate in the study. Patients must fulfill all the requirements defined in Section 8.1, including completion of a baseline quality of life questionnaire, prior to their inclusion in the study. Patients must be free of clinically significant infection. Patients must be 18 years of age or older. Patients with bilateral hydronephrosis which cannot be alleviated by ureteral stents or percutaneous drainage. Patients with a serum creatinine &gt; 1.2 mg/dl but &lt; 1.5 mg/dl and a 24hour creatinine clearance result of &lt; 50 cm3/min. Patients with a serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dl.

Patients who are pregnant or lactating. Patients with craniospinal metastases. Patients with a concomitant malignant disease, with the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancer. Patients with a previous invasive malignant disease (other than nonmelanoma skin cancer) showing evidence of this disease within the last 5 years, or for whom the therapy to be administered during this study is contraindicated due to previous treatment received for this malignant disease. Patients who are participating in another clinical study at the same time or who will have done so up to 30 days before the planned end of this study.</criteria>
