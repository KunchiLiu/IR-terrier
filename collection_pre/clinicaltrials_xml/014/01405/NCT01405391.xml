	<detailed_description>Phase I Study of PM01183 in Non-Colorectal (non-CRC) Cancer Patients to determine the recommended dose (RD) of PM01183, to characterize the safety profile, compliance and feasibility of the schedule, to optimize and individualize PM01183 dosing in non-CRC patients according to individual tolerance, to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the schedule, to obtain preliminary information on the clinical antitumor activity and to perform an exploratory pharmacogenomics (PGx) analysis.</detailed_description>
