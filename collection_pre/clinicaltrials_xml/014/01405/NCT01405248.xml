	<brief_title>Butylphthalide for Preventing Restenosis After Intracranial and Extracranial Artery Stenting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ischemic stroke is a significant cause of death, most of the patients is caused by atherosclerosis,current treatments include internal medicine medications, interventional treatment and so on,among them, the interventional therapy can make narrow blood vessels blood recovery fastly,and for its small trauma,Gradually accepted by psychiatrist, But stents are easy to narrow has been plagued by everybody ,At present, prevent restenosis stent is mainly of antiplatelet therapy,But,prevention effect is not obvious often easy to appear harmful response,how to effectively reduce postoperative restenosis, become the majority concern of patients and doctors .Clinical trials showed that, butylbenzene can promote the function of ischemic stroke recovery patients. Animal pharmacodynamics study suggests that this product can block the ischemic stroke of brain damage caused by DuoGe pathological link, with strong against ischemic and brain protection, especially can obviously increase in small brains ischemia ATP and phosphoric acid creatine level, decrease local cerebral ischemia in rats, reduce infarct size, cerebral edema improved energy metabolism and brain ischemia of microcirculation and blood flow in the brain, restrain the nerve cell apoptosis, and has the cerebral thrombosis and anti-platelet aggregation function. Research shows that, butylbenzene phthalocyanine influence through arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism, selective inhibition and their metabolites from DuoZhong mediated pathophysiological events, can remove microvascular spasms. Inhibit platelet aggregation, restrain TXA2 synthesis, scavenging free radicals, thereby through many ways, many link blocking caused by cerebral ischemia the pathophysiology of development process. These mechanisms may make butylbenzene in preventing phthalocyanine intracranial carotid stenting noted restenosis and related ischemia of events play an important role.</detailed_description>
