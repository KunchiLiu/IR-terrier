	<brief_summary>This is a prospective, level II evidence comparison between two cohorts. This study is designed to compare the percutaneous versus open approach for plate fixation of diaphyseal clavicle fractures. This study includes questionnaires and measurements that will collect data on incision-related numbness, union rates, overall outcomes, complication rates of the two methods, infection rates, and overall satisfaction. The surgical procedure, all radiographs and follow-up visits to a minimum of one year are the principle investigators (PI's) standard of care for this injury. Measurements and questionnaires are related to the study.</brief_summary>
