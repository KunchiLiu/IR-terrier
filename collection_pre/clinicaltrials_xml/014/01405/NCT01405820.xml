	<brief_title>Exploratory Study of the Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of Multiple Regimens of Natalizumab in Adult Participants With Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (MS)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a a dose and frequency (but not route of administration) blinded, prospective, randomized, dose-ranging study in patients with RRMS who have received natalizumab for at least 12 months according to the local prescribing guidelines.

In the 12 months prior to commencing natalizumab, subject must have experienced a minimal level of disease activity as defined by 2 or more documented clinical relapses OR 1 relapse and documented MRI activity, defined by the presence of at least 1 Gd enhancing lesion on MRI, unrelated to the relapse.
