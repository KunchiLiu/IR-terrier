	<brief_summary>This study is to determine the safety and Pharmacokinetics (PK) and Pharmacodynamics (PD) of INH-08189 dosed once a day (QD), two times a day (BID) or adjunctively with Ribavirin and a study of the food effect in Chronically-infected Genotype 1 Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Treatment-naïve subjects.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study of INX-08189, Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic With Ribavirin and Food Effect Study, in Chronically-infected Genotype 1 Hepatitis C Virus, Treatment-naïve Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives: To evaluate in chronically-infected, non-cirrhotic, genotype 1 treatment naïve-subjects dosed with Study Drug for 7 consecutive days Safety - The safety of each of the 4 dosing cohorts of INX-08189 (200 mg daily (QD), 100 mg twice a day (BID), 100 mg QD with low-fat meal, and 100 mg QD with adjunctive ribavirin). Pharmacokinetic - To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of oral doses of INX-08189 (200 mg QD, 100 mg BID, 100 mg QD with low-fat meal, and 100 mg QD with adjunctive ribavirin) and the PK profile of the metabolite (INX-08032). Pharmacodynamic - To evaluate the relationship between the kinetics of the reduction from baseline in serum HCV RNA and PK parameters of INX-08189 and the metabolite INX-08032 Efficacy - To measure the kinetics of viral load reduction in plasma HCV RNA by each of the 4 dosing cohorts of INX-08189 (200 mg QD, 100 mg BID, 100 mg QD with low-fat meal, and 100 mg QD with adjunctive ribavirin).</detailed_description>
