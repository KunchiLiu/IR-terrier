	<brief_summary>Intrauterine contraception is a very effective, long term, reversible form of birth control, and is increasingly used in young, nulliparous patients. However, there is potential for pain with insertion of an Intrauterine Device (IUD) - particularly in patients without a previous history of vaginal delivery. The potential pain associated with insertion is often a significant barrier for patients when choosing and IUD for contraception. Several methods of pain control have been studied, but none have been shown to reduce pain at time of insertion. Our research question is to determine if 2% topical lidocaine gel, instilled into the cervical canal, will reduce maximum pain at time of insertion of a popular IUD (Mirena Intrauterine System) in young, nulliparous patients. This will be studied in a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial.</brief_summary>
