	<criteria>Patients with migraine with or without aura who are otherwise healthy as determined by medical history, physical examination, clinical laboratory evaluations and 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG), will be eligible Men or women [women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) or Women of non childbearing potential (WONCBP)] ages 1855 years inclusive, with a body mass index (BMI) of 18.0 to 32.0 kg/m2 with not more than 8 migraines a month Patient has at least 1 year history of migraines (with or without aura) including the following: 1.

Migraine attacks, on average, lasts about 472 hours if untreated in the 3 months prior to screening visit 28 moderate or severe migraine attacks per month in the 3 months prior to screening visit. The migraine, for which the patient receives treatment during the study, must have at least one of the associated symptoms: nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, or migraine with aura Female patient is pregnant/breastfeeding (or is a female expecting to conceive during study period) Patient has history or evidence of stroke/transient ischemic attacks, heart disease, coronary artery vasospasm, other significant underlying cardiovascular diseases, uncontrolled hypertension (high blood pressure), uncontrolled diabetes, or Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Patient will be excluded if they take medications for acute migraine more than 10 days per month, had very frequent chronic tension type headaches for 15 or more days per month (or were unable to distinguish between tensiontype headaches and migraine) Patient has major depression, other pain syndromes that might interfere with study assessments, psychiatric conditions, dementia, or significant neurological disorders (other than migraine) Patient has a history of gastric, or small intestinal surgery, or has a disease that causes mal absorption Patient has a history or current evidence of any unstable medical conditions (eg, history of congenital heart disease or arrhythmia, known suspected infection, hepatitis B or C, or cancer) that, in the investigator's opinion, would expose them to undue risk of a significant adverse event (AE) or interfere with assessments of safety or efficacy during the course of the trial Patient has basilar migraine and hemiplegic migraine Patient taking narcotic medication History of alcohol, substance or drug abuse within the last year Uses an opiate as first line acute treatment for migraine attacks History of ergotamine, any acute therapy or triptan intake on greater than/equal 10 days per month on a regular basis for greater than/equal 3 months History of simple analgesic intake on greater than/equal 10 days per month for greater than/equal 3 months History of use of opioid or combination medication intake or butalbital containing analgesic greater than 5 days per month for greater than/equal to 3 months Do not receive migraine relief from a triptan migraine treatment Evidence of renal impairment calculated creatinine clearance &lt;60ml/min or clinically relevant finding on urinalysis</criteria>
