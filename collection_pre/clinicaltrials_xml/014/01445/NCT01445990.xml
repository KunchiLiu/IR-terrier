	<brief_summary>Evaluation of capillary glycaemia and lactataemia measurements for pedicle impairments diagnosis in free tissue transfers is realized. These measures are done after surgical reconstructions with free tissue flap, simultaneously with clinical examination. These biological data aren't available to make clinical diagnosis of complication; only clinical examination is allowed in this way. A posteriori, clinical and biological parameters will be compared in order to determine if capillary glycaemia and lactataemia measurements is a good procedure for free tissue flaps monitoring.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of Free Flap Monitoring Using Capillary Lactate and Glucose Measurements</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Free tissue flap reconstruction has become a reliable technique. Nevertheless, pedicle thrombosis is dreaded, and the earlier the diagnosis of such complications is made, the higher the surgical salvage rate is. Clinical monitoring remains the most useful and used monitoring method, but makes late and unreliable diagnosis. Numerous studies are searching for ideal monitoring technics with regard to free flaps. Nowadays, the most efficient ones often deal with expensive and invasive technics. In this study, capillary lactataemia and glycaemia measurements are evaluated for pedicle impairments diagnosis. Measurements of these 2 biological parameters seem to be a powerful screening test of pedicle impairments in microdialysis. But these parameters are measured in this case in interstitial tissues. Capillary measurements will probably provide different results, and needs to be evaluated. For that purpose, surgical reconstructions with free tissue flap will be clinically monitored during five days, every hours for the first 24 hours, and every 4 hours for the next 4 days. Simultaneously, blind measurements of capillary lactataemia and glycaemia will be performed. Biological and clinical data will be systematically written in the corresponding table of the individual register together with the time the examination is done. In this register, all complications and evolutions of the flaps will be recorded. A posteriori, parallel between clinical and biological events will be studied. This multicenter prospective study will show first if capillary measurements of glucose and lactate permit to screen pedicle complications of free flaps. In case of efficacy of this technique, thresholds of glucose and lactate permitting such diagnoses will be calculated in order to define a sensitive screening test. Moreover, temporal differences between clinical and biological diagnoses of pedicle impairments will be studied.</detailed_description>
