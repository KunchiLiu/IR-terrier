	<brief_summary>This study is designed to collect data about the SoundBiteâ„¢ Hearing System to answer specific questions. The hearing system has been cleared for commercial distribution by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Sonitus hopes to learn from a larger group of users what features and settings of this device provide the best hearing ability for people diagnosed with Single Sided Deafness (SSD) or Conductive Hearing Loss (CHL).</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients who are 18 years or older Clinical diagnosis of a Moderately severe, severe, or profound sensorineural hearing loss in one ear and normal hearing in the other ear (Normal hearing is defined as a pure tone average (PTA) airconduction (AC) hearing threshold (measured at 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 kHz) of better than or equal to 25 dB HL) Patients diagnosed with conductive hearing loss where the pure tone average boneconduction hearing threshold (measured at 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 kHz) is better than or equal to 25 dB HL. At least two contiguous molar or premolar teeth with no untreated tooth decay. Patients with tooth decay present are to first have restorations before being fitted for SoundBite Healthy attachment to those teeth with tooth pockets limited to no more than 5mm No mobile teeth Bone loss no greater than a 34% average on the mesial and distal sides of the tooth as measured on Xray on the teeth on which the device will be worn. The SoundBite Hearing System and all portions of it are contraindicated for use in an MRI Environment and should be removed prior to MRI exposure The SoundBite Hearing System is not to be used in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the components including allergies to polymers. The SoundBite Hearing system is contraindicated for vulnerable populations that are unable to sue their hands such as paraplegics or others that are unable to comply with the warnings in the product's labeling.</criteria>
