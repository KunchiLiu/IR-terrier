	<brief_summary>Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), or secondary scarring on and around the retina, is an important cause of retinal re-detachment. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of oral isotretinoin, which inhibits the growth of cells responsible for proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), on recurrent retinal detachment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Isotretinoin for Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Small retrospective studies have shown isotretinoin to be effective in reducing the rate of recurrent retinal detachment in patients with or at high risk for developing PVR. This is a prospective study to evaluate a low dose of oral isotretinoin in this regard. There are two arms to the study: 1) eyes with recurrent retinal detachment due to existing PVR, and 2) eyes with primary detachment and features associated with a high risk of PVR formation. Eligible and willing patients will receive a 12-week course of isotretinoin, and will be followed for retinal attachment rate, and PVR and/or ERM (epiretinal membrane) formation.</detailed_description>
