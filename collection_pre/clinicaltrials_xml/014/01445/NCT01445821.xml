	<brief_summary>ASSIST I was the first randomized trial in patients with scleroderma to not just slow disease progression but rather actually reverse it. It is the first treatment to have ever demonstrated reversal of lung disease in scleroderma with improvement in FVC, total lung capacity (TLC), high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), and QOL. We now, therefore, purpose to compare the ASSIST I conditioning regimen of cyclophosphamide and rATG to a less intense regimen of rATG/cyclophosphamide/Fludarabine. In the new regimen the cyclophosphamide dose is decreased to 120mg/kg (60mg/kg/day x 2) compared to 200mg/kg (50mg/kg/day) in the standard regimen. The lower dose of cyclophosphamide will be less cardiotoxic. This study will determine if the less cardiotoxic regimen will be safer than the standard regimen and as effective as the standard regimen.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mobilization. For patients in both arms undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) will be mobilized with cyclophosphamide (2 g/m2) followed by 5-10 mcg/kg subcutaneous filgrastrim daily from day 5 until completion of apheresis. Mobilized hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) will be collected by apheresis on day 10 and cryopreserved without selection or manipulation. There will be an interval of at least 17 days between mobilization of PBSC and start of conditioning regimen. Control arm. The control arm will have the same conditioning regimen used in ASSIST study. The conditioning regimen will be 200 mg/kg of intravenous cyclophosphamide given in 4 equal fractions on days -5 through -2 with intravenous mesna. Rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG) (Thymoglobulin®) will be dosed at 0.5 mg/kg on day-5 and then 1.5 mg/kg from day-4 thru day -1. Methylprednisolone 1000 mg will be used infused intravenously before each dose of rATG. PBSC will be infused intravenously on day 0. Filgrastrim 5-10 mcg/kg will be started on day + 5 and continued until neutrophil engraftment. Cytoxan rATG/Fludarabine arm The conditioning regimen will be 120 mg/kg of intravenous cyclophosphamide given in 2 equal fractions on days -3 and -2 with intravenous mesna. Rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG) (Thymoglobulin®) will be dosed at 0.5 mg/kg on day-5 and then 1.5 mg/kg from day-4 thru day -1. Fludarabine 30 g/m2 will be given IV on days -5, -4, and -3. Methylprednisolone 1000 mg will be used infused intravenously before each dose of rATG. PBSC will be infused intravenously on day 0. Filgrastrim 5-10 mcg/kg will be started on day + 5 and continued until neutrophil engraftment.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Age 17 60 years old at the time of pretransplant evaluation 2. An established diagnosis of scleroderma 3. Diffuse cutaneous scleroderma with involvement proximal to the elbow or knee and a Rodnan score (see Appendix V) of &gt; 14 AND Scleroderma with any one of the following: 1. DLCO &lt; 80% of predicted or decrease in lung function (DLCO, DLCO/VA or FVC) of 10% or more over 12 months. 2. Pulmonary fibrosis or alveolitis on CT scan or chest Xray (CXR) (ground glass appearance of alveolitis). 3. Abnormal EKG [nonspecific STT (pattern in electrocardiogram) wave abnormalities, low QRS (a pattern seen in an electrocardiogram that indicates the pulses in a heart beat and their duration) voltage, or ventricular hypertrophy], or pericardial effusion or pericardial enhancement on MRI 4. Gastrointestinal tract involvement confirmed on radiological study. Radiologic findings of scleroderma are small bowel radiographs showing thickened folds with dilated loops, segmentation, and flocculation +/ diverticulae, or pseudodiverticulae. A hidebound appearance due to valvulae packing i.e. dilated and crowded circular folds may be present. GI involvement may also be confirmed by Dxylose malabsorption, patulous esophagus on HRCT, or esophageal manometry. OR 4.
