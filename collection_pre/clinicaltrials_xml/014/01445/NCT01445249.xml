	<brief_summary>Forefoot surgery includes bunion surgery and similar reconstructive bone cutting surgery and is very painful. Local anaesthetic nerve blocks are used to provide pain relief after this work. The purpose of this study is to compare two techniques: one using anatomical landmarks alone to guide local anaesthetic infiltration, the other using peripheral nerve stimulation to guide local anaesthetic infiltration (termed medial forefoot block). The two techniques will be compared for reliability of postoperative analgesia.</brief_summary>
