	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesise that modification of the Atrial Fibrillation (AF) substrate by radiofrequency ablation would improve single procedure success rates for Radio Frequency Ablation (RFA) for Non-paroxysmal AF when compared to that achieved with short-term peri-procedural anti-arrhythmic drug therapy alone.</brief_summary>

	<mesh_term>Atrial Fibrillation</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Ongoing symptoms (European Heart Rhythm Association Class 2 or above) in spite of treatment with rate control medication Nonparoxysmal atrial fibrillation, as preclassified as Persistent AF: AF requiring Electrical/ Chemical cardioversion or that lasting &gt;7 days. These patients may be in AF or in sinus Rhythm at the time of their initial assessment and/ or at the time of their ablation. Continuous Persistent AF: These patients are persistently in AF with or without antiarrhythmic drug therapy, as confirmed on a 24 hour Holter. They may have undergone previous cardioversion(s). Sustained Paroxysmal AF with underlying substrate: Patients with Individual AF episode(s) lasting &gt;12 hours but less than 7 days plus one or more of the following: Age &gt;65 years 21 Individual AF episode(s) lasting &gt;24 hours Significant left atrial dilatation of &gt;45 mm on Echo (Parasternal Long Axis view) Obesity (Body Mass Index &gt;30), and/ or history suggestive of sleep apnoea Diabetes Mellitus requiring hypoglycaemic drugs and/or Insulin Inability or unwillingness to receive oral anticoagulation with warfarin Previous Ablation procedure for AF Unwillingness or inability to complete the required follow up arrangements Presence of long standing persistent AF with continuous AF longer than 12 months. This includes patients in whom sinus rhythm may have been maintained following electrical cardioversion for a period of less than 1 week at a stretch. Documented typical atrial flutter Prior prosthetic mitral valve replacement or severe structural cardiac abnormality Contraindications and/ or prior intolerance to both Amiodarone and Flecainide. Reversible cause for atrial fibrillation Known hypertrophic or infiltrative cardiomyopathy</criteria>
