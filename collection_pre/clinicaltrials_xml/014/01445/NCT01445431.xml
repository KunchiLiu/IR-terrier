	<detailed_description>Objectives of the Study: The general objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of virgin coconut oil (VCO) compared to mineral oil as a therapeutic moisturizer for uremic xerosis. The specific objectives are as follows: 1) to determine and compare changes in the over-all dry skin score within and between treatment groups at baseline, 2 weeks-post and 4-weeks post application; 2) to quantitatively measure the following skin parameters at baseline, 2-weeks and 4-weeks post application (skin hydration using a corneometer, skin lipids using a sebumeter); 3) to determine and compare changes in quality of life scores within and between treatment groups at baseline, and 4-weeks post application; and 4) to identify the adverse effects of virgin coconut oil and mineral oil when used as moisturizer for uremic xerosis</detailed_description>
