	<detailed_description>Hypothesis: The daily supplementation of a probiotic will increase weight loss compared to a placebo supplement in the post-operative gastric bypass patients. Study Design: All patients in this study will be scheduled to undergo the RNYGB (Gastric Bypass) procedure to assist in weight loss. Patients in this study will be randomized to one of two groups: Group 1 (Probiotics) or Group 2 (Placebo). Patients will begin supplementation at the beginning of their 4 week pre-surgery OptifastÂ© 800 diet. All patients will take supplements for a total of 12 weeks. Nutritional education and support will be provided to each patient enrolled in the study. Weight loss will be measured using a machine that measures body composition. All patients will complete a quality of life questionnaire with regard to gastrointestinal health and a hair loss survey pre treatment and at the end of the study.</detailed_description>
