	<brief_title>The Effect of Intravenous Lidocaine on Post-extubation Laryngospasm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During anesthesia practice, one of the common complications of airway management is laryngospasm. The etiology of laryngospasm is unknown but may be due to insufficient depth of anesthesia during tracheal intubation, light plane of anesthesia during tracheal extubation, pain, or presence of airway irritant like laryngoscope blade, irritated volatile agent, suction catheter, surgical debris, mucus, blood, or other foreign body. Laryngospasm occurs in both genders and all ages. Incidence of laryngospasm was reported to the Australian incident monitoring study (AIMS) was 5% with of 22% of them without an attributable cause. Currently, there is no proven prophylaxis for laryngospasm and the known treatments of laryngospasm are used post-occurrence. However, elimination of factors that lead to laryngospasm is the most indispensable item for reduction of its incidence. Intravenous (IV) lidocaine interrupts nerve conduction by blocking sodium channels. Recent meta-analysis study showed that IV lidocaine was able to prevent laryngospasm in children. However, in the literature, we found no randomized clinical trials addressing the using of IV lidocaine as prophylaxis for postoperative laryngospasm among adults. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of IV lidocaine on the incidence of postoperative laryngospasm of adults patients.</detailed_description>
