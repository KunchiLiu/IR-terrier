	<brief_summary>The objectives of this study are to develop research methods and corresponding materials for a study of the effectiveness of sitaxentan sodium (Thelin) in "real-world" settings; to pilot test these methods at three study centers in Europe; and to refine and finalize research methods and corresponding materials for possible use in a follow-on, full-scale examination of the effectiveness of sitaxentan sodium (Thelin) in "real-world" settings.</brief_summary>
