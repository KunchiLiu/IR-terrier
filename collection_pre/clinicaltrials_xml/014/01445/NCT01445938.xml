	<brief_summary>Primary Objective: To assess the antiparasitic activity of intramuscular (IM) SAR97276A based on parasite reduction ratio at 72 hours in pediatric patients with uncomplicated malaria Secondary Objectives: - To assess the evolution of clinical signs and symptoms (including the need for a rescue therapy) in pediatric patients with uncomplicated malaria receiving SAR97276A with reference to Artemisinin-Based Combination Therapy (ACTs) - To assess the pharmacokinetics profile of SAR97276A in pediatric patients with uncomplicated malaria - To assess the safety profile of SAR97276A in pediatric patients with uncomplicated malaria - To assess the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship of SAR97276A</brief_summary>
