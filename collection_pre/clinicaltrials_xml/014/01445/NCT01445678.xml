	<brief_summary>This is a Phase 3, multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, double dummy study of CXA-201 Intravenous (IV) infusions (1500mg q8h) and metronidazole (500mg q8h) versus meropenem (1000mg q8h)for the treatment of adults with Complicated Intraabdominal Infections (cIAI).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing the Safety and Efficacy of Intravenous CXA-201 and Intravenous Meropenem in Complicated Intraabdominal Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately, 500 subjects will be enrolled into this study, randomized 1:1 to receive CXA-201 and metronidazole or comparator (meropenem). Subject participation will require a minimum commitment of 38 days and a maximum of 45 days. An End of Treatment (EOT) visit will occur within 24 hours following the last dose of study drug administration/drug discontinuation. A Test of Cure (TOC)/Safety visit will be conducted 26 to 30 days following the first dose of study drug administration. A Last Follow-up (LFU) visit will be conducted 38 to 45 days after the first dose of study drug.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnoses of cIAI. Subject requires surgical intervention (e.g., laparotomy, laparoscopic surgery, or percutaneous draining of an abscess) within 24 hours of (before or after) the first dose of study drug. Simple appendicitis; acute suppurative cholangitis; infected necrotizing pancreatitis; pancreatic abscess; or pelvic infections. Complicated intraabdominal infection managed by staged abdominal repair (STAR), open abdomen technique including temporary closure of the abdomen, or any situation where infection source control is not likely to be achieved. Use of systemic antibiotic therapy for IAI for more than 24 hours prior to the first dose of study drug, unless there is a documented treatment failure with such therapy. Have a concomitant infection at the time of randomization, which requires nonstudy systemic antibacterial therapy in addition to IV study drug therapy. (Drugs with only grampositive activity [e.g., daptomycin, vancomycin, linezolid] are allowed). Severe impairment of renal function (estimated CrCl &lt; 30 mL/min), or requirement for peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis or hemofiltration, or oliguria (&lt; 20 mL/h urine output over 24 hours). The presence of hepatic disease at baseline. Considered unlikely to survive the 4 to 5 week study period. Any rapidlyprogressing disease or immediately lifethreatening illness (including respiratory failure and septic shock). Have a documented history of any moderate or severe hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to any βlactam antibacterial (a history of a mild rash followed by uneventful reexposure is not a contraindication to enrollment), including cephalosporins, carbapenems, penicillins, or ßlactamase inhibitors, or metronidazole, or nitroimidazole derivatives.
