	<brief_summary>A pilot evaluation of tenecteplase compared to alteplase in acute ischaemic stroke patients currently eligible for intravenous alteplase treatment in a prospective, randomised, blinded outcome evaluation clinical trial using brain imaging as a biomarker.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alteplase-Tenecteplase Trial Evaluation for Stroke Thrombolysis- (ATTEST)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Newer thrombolytic agents such as tenecteplase have pharmacological features (higher fibrin binding specificity and longer half-life) that may be advantageous when compared to older agents such as alteplase with respect to arterial recanalisation, ease of administration, and reduced bleeding risk. No other clinical trial is currently evaluating alternative thrombolytic strategies in patients who are eligible to receive standard intravenous alteplase, instead concentrating on extending the population for IV thrombolysis. The ATTEST pilot phase will use brain imaging as a biomarker for key clinical response variables, with penumbral salvage as the primary end-point and secondary end-points including recanalisation as well as conventional clinical scales. The findings of this study are anticipated to provide data on sample size and event rates to inform the design of a definitive, confirmatory, pragmatic, randomised, controlled trial with clinical endpoints.</detailed_description>
