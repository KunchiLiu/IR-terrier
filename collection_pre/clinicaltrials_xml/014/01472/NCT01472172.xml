	<brief_title>Pleural Cryobiopsies During Semirigid Thoracoscopy: A New Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim of this study is to determine feasibility of pleural biopsies with the cryoprobe during semirigid thoracoscopy. We will assess size, morphological features, immunohistochemistry and diagnostic yield as measures of the quality of the samples. The secondary aim is to evaluate safety with focus on bleeding intensity.</detailed_description>
