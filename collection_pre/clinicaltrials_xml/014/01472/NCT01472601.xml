	<brief_summary>This study is a parallel translational study of a Randomized Phase III trial Investigating the Role of Oxaliplatin duration (6 Cycles Versus 12 Cycles) in modified FOLFOX-6 Regimen as Adjuvant Therapy for Patients with Stage II/III Colon Cancer (MIDAS trial: protocol NCCCTS-467) . Patients participating in the trial will be provided with the informed consent of this parallel study, and peripheral blood and tumor tissue of those who signed the consent will be collected for germline polymorphism analysis and gene expression profile study .</brief_summary>
