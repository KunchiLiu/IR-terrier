	<brief_summary>Acne is one of the most common conditions that patients seek for help in dermatological clinic. Nowadays, conventional treatment including topical agents(retinoids, antibiotics ,antiseptics and keratolytic agents) and systemic agents( antibiotics and retinoids) give a satisfying result but not to every patient. Some patients are not well respond to conventional therapy while some patients are unable to tolerate side effects of the treatments. Therefore, interventions to reduce acne are vigorously experimented . Lights and lasers including intense pulsed light, pulsed dye laser with or without photosensitizer and infrared lasers have been found to be useful in treating active inflammatory acne. Although,pain ,downtime and poor response of comedonal acne are limitations of those lights and lasers therapy. 2940 nm Erbium:YAG laser which has both resurfacing and photothermal effects is our laser of interest to seek for its efficacy in the treatment of inflammatory acne.</brief_summary>
