	<brief_summary>The study Premature Termination of Resuscitation in Survivors of Cardiac Arrest focuses on using innovative knowledge translation strategies to improve appropriate neuroprognostication for survivors of cardiac arrest and prevent premature termination of life sustaining therapies. This is important because any early gains achieved during resuscitation will be nullified if clinicians terminate life-sustaining therapies prematurely based on inadequate prognostic information. An effective translation strategy for neuroprognostication will result in improved physician adherence to evidence-based medicine and an increase in the proportion of patients surviving to achieve a good neurological outcome following cardiac arrest.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design will be employed in order to properly evaluate the impact of this intervention. Each of the 18 participating hospitals will be randomized one of the four wedges according to a random schedule; each wedge will consist of 4 to 5 hospitals. With this design, the implementation of the intervention will be rolled out sequentially to the participating hospitals over a 5 month period for each wedge. All hospitals will have received the intervention by the end of the study. Note that the study design fields provided by ClinicalTrials.gov do not allow for describing this type of study design; therefore, the investigators have listed the study as a single arm. In reality, this study will have 4 wedges, each containing randomized clusters of 4-5 hospitals.</detailed_description>
