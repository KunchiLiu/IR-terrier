	<brief_title>Effects of Bortezomib-Based Therapy on Cellular Immunity and Response to DC/Myeloma Fusion Vaccines in Vitro</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects on this study will be receiving treatment for multiple myeloma according to the standard of care with a regimen containing Bortezomib. If a bone marrow sample is clinically indicated to guide treatment, an additional 1 tablespoon of the specimen will be obtained for further laboratory studies. Approximately 3 tablespoons of blood will be taken for research purposes before therapy with Bortezomib starts. When subjects return for follow-up after cycle 1, 2, and 3 and additional 3 tablespoons of blood will be taken for research purposes. Optional samples of blood may be taken at follow-up visits after cycles 4, 5 and 6 and 1, 3 and 6 months after completing therapy. This study also includes a medical record review.</detailed_description>
