	<brief_summary>Much of community transmission of seasonal and pandemic influenza occurs in younger individuals, because of their susceptibility and their social interaction patterns.Universities are places where transmission of influenza is facilitated because of the age of individuals involved, their close contact with each other, and low vaccination coverage. Staying home when you are sick (i.e., voluntary sequestration) has been identified as one of the most efficient ways to reduce influenza transmission, but there are still insufficient data on the effects of social distancing to be able to make recommendations for future pandemics or even outbreaks of seasonal influenza. The investigators are conducting a study on the effect of voluntary sequestration during illness on the transmission of influenza among social networks in University residence housing units at the University of Michigan. The sequestration interventions will be carried out during a period of influenza transmission that is defined by surveillance conducted at the University Health Service. Data will be collected on use of the interventions and the occurrence of influenza and other illnesses. In all selected residence halls, specimens will be collected when illness meeting a case definition for influenza-like illness occurs. This study in a university population will evaluate the acceptability and magnitude of effect that can be expected from such an intervention, and determine the number of days that sequestration should be practiced.</brief_summary>
