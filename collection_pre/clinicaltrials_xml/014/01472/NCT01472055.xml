	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Study of Fludarabine in Pediatric Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fludarabine is a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in children. However, no pharmacokinetic study has thus far been conducted in pediatric patients. Fludarabine can cause adverse reactions which include neurotoxicity, damage to lungs. Pharmacokinetic study is critical to predict the safety of fludarabine in pediatric patients. Through an individualized pharmacokinetic study (which entails numerous samplings) of fludarabine in pediatric patients, this study aims to develop a sampling-minimized analysis method and study the population pharmacokinetics. Through a pharmacokinetic analysis, we aim to evaluate whether pediatric patients show similar population pharmacokinetics of adults, for whom fludarabine is authorized, and evaluate the safety (toxicity) and efficacy (event free survival).</detailed_description>
