	<mesh_term>Asthma</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Written informed consent Adolescents aged 12 to 17 years (inclusive) and adults aged 18 to 65 years (inclusive) Documented clinical history of asthma (i.e. made by a physician) for at least 6 months before the Screening Visit Documented asthma reversibility in the 5 years prior to or during Screening, or if the asthma reversibility criterion is not met at Screening, then a repeat test may be carried out at the end of the RunIn Period Subjects with asthma who, in the opinion of the investigator, require maintenance therapy with ICS, are believed to have been regularly compliant with this therapy, and are therefore likely to deteriorate within 6 weeks following withdrawal of their usual ICS treatment Mild or moderate asthma, defined as: Mild good asthma control achieved by lowdose inhaled corticosteroid (daily dose 200500 μg beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent) with or without other lowintensity treatment (e.g. leukotriene modifiers or cromones) for at least 28 days before the Screening Visit Moderate good asthma control achieved by low to moderatedose ICS (daily dose 2001000 μg beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent), and long acting β2agonist (LABA) or other extra treatment, for at least 28 days before the Screening Visit Ability to use the new inhaler correctly, based on investigator's review of the completed inhaler operation checklist Ability to use the eDiary correctly, assessed by the investigator during the Screening Period Ability to perform technically satisfactory pulmonary function tests Ability to comply with study procedures, including blood sampling Body mass index (BMI) of 16.0 to 26.0 kg/m2 in adolescents, and in adult subjects recruited in the Philippines, and 18.0 to 32.0 kg/m2 in adults recruited in other countries Available to complete all study visits Oral peak inspiratory flow (PIF) of at least 60 L/min; using an appropriate device set to match the resistance of the nDPI Good health, except for the presence of asthma, according to medical history and physical examination Normal (i.e. nonclinically significant abnormality) 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) Negative drug, alcohol, and urine cotinine screen; subjects must test negative for amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, cotinine (unless related to nicotinecontaining therapies), ethanol, and opiates (unless given as a prescription medicine) Nonsmokers or exsmokers with a smoking history of less than 10 packyears (e.g. &lt;20 cigarettes per day for 10 years or 40 cigarettes per day for 5 years) and stopped smoking for at least one year prior to the Screening Visit. Smoking will not be permitted throughout the study Female subjects of childbearing potential must be using medically acceptable forms of contraception; approved forms of contraception are abstinence, hormonal (oral, implant, transdermal, or injection, in use for ≥3 consecutive months before the start of the RunIn Period), double barrier (condom with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide), intrauterine device, or vasectomised partner (≥6 months since vasectomy) Regular use (≥3 times per week) of topical steroids taken to treat dermatitis, rhinitis or allergic conjunctivitis, within 28 days of the Screening Visit Subjects who have or who have had an upper or lower respiratory tract infection within 28 days of the Screening Visit Subjects with asthma that required admission to an intensive care unit and/or ventilation within the previous 12 months History of lung cancer Subjects with "brittle asthma", defined as patients with asthma who either maintain over many months a wide variation (&gt;40%) in PEF between morning and evening measurements despite moderate to high doses of ICS, or are prone to acute, severe and often unpredictable attacks of asthma that may be fatal, on a background of apparently good asthma control History or current diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection Active chronic hepatitis B or C infection. If the patient's screening test is positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, the patient should be excluded unless the investigator, after a careful review of the patient's medical history and current laboratory tests of liver function, can exclude the possibility of recent or current infection Persistent arterial hypotension, with average systolic blood pressure (SBP) readings of ≤95 mmHg Subjects who have any clinically significant abnormality or finding from examination, tests, or history that may compromise subject safety, specifically any history of cardiac, renal or hepatic impairment Subjects with an abnormal ECG Persistent elevation of blood pressure, with average SBP readings of ≥160 mmHg or average diastolic blood pressure (DBP) readings of ≥100 mmHg Pregnant or lactating females Participation in another clinical study in the 28 days prior to the Screening Visit Current or a history of drug or alcohol abuse or dependence according to World Health Organization criteria in the 12 months prior to the Screening Visit or evidence of such abuse as indicated by laboratory assays conducted during the screening evaluation Evidence of clinically significant renal, hepatic, cardiac, pulmonary (apart from asthma) or metabolic dysfunction, e.g. diabetes mellitus, thyrotoxicosis, uncorrected hypokalaemia, or predisposition to low levels of serum potassium Inability to communicate well with the investigator Evidence of clinically significant renal, hepatic, cardiac, pulmonary (apart from asthma) or metabolic dysfunction, e.g. diabetes mellitus, thyrotoxicosis, uncorrected hypokalaemia, or predisposition to low levels of serum potassium Donation of ≥450 mL of blood or blood products within the previous 12 weeks prior to the Screening Visit History of allergy, intolerance or contraindications to corticosteroids, lactose, or severe allergy to milk proteins Consumption of alcohol or caffeinecontaining foods or beverages from midnight before or during the Screening Visit. The visit can be rescheduled once before the subject is excluded History of medically diagnosed chronic respiratory diseases (other than asthma) e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Subjects with previously clinically or radiologically diagnosed osteoporosis and/or those receiving regular treatment (more than 1 month duration) with oral or parenteral corticosteroids in the last year prior to the Screening Visit</criteria>
