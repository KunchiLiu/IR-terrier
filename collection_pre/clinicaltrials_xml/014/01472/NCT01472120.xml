	<detailed_description>In peripheral blood; monocytes and macrophages are found in two phenotype; proinflammatory M1 and anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes. M2 form is converted (or polarized) to M1 phenotype in various metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition, these forms also are related to insulin resistance and inflammation in adipose tissue. Today, there is no study that investigate the role of adiponectin an anti-inflammatory adipokine, on macrophage polarization in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</detailed_description>
