	<brief_summary>Recently isolated low PA varieties (lpa) in wheat, rice, maize, barley and beans might have the potential to alleviate iron bioavailability problems associated with PA. These plants have normal phosphate levels, but reduced PA phosphate due to various modifications of the biosynthetic pathway of PA. So far lpa crops are in an early stage of development, most of them exhibiting reduced yield and seed germination. However, the lpa bean isolated by Campion and co-workers 2009 by chemical mutagenesis exhibited only 10 % of the native bean PA concentration without any defects in terms of growth and yield. Crossing the lpa variety with bean varieties low in PP and high in iron might lead to the development of a variety which has the potential to improve the iron status of bean consuming populations. The following study will evaluate the relative impact of PA and PP on iron absorption from beans by comparing iron absorption from four different bean varieties. Iron absorption from a bean with normal PA concentration and high PP concentration will be compared to iron absorption from a bean with normal PA and low PP concentration as well as to two lpa varieties, one with high and one with low PP concentration.</brief_summary>
