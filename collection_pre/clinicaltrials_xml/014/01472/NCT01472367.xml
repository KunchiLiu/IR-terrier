	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to assess the safety of the addition of sitagliptin, and its effect on hemoglobin A1c (A1C), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and the proportion of patients requiring glycemic rescue therapy in pediatric patients 10-17 years of age (inclusive) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with inadequate glycemic control on metformin therapy (alone or in combination with insulin). The primary hypothesis is that the addition of sitagliptin reduces A1C more than the addition of placebo after 20 weeks of treatment. Participants who complete the 20-week base period of the study may choose to participate in the extension period of the study and continue on or off treatment assigned during the base period for an additional 34 weeks.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Has Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) Is on metformin monotherapy (≥1500 mg/day) for ≥12 weeks with A1C ≥6.5% and ≤10.0% OR is on stable doses of metformin (≥1500 mg/day) and insulin for ≥12 weeks with an A1C ≥7.0% and ≤10%. NOTE: Participants on a daily dose of metformin greater than or equal to 1000 mg/day, but less than 1500 mg/day may be eligible if there is documentation that higher doses are not tolerated. Between 10 and 17 years of age on day of signing informed consent with randomization to occur prior to 18th birthday. Participant and a family member or adult closely involved in the daily activities will participate in the participant's treatment and study protocol (i.e., available for telephone calls, study visits and administration of study medication as needed). Known type 1 diabetes mellitus or documented evidence of positive diabetes autoantibodies (if performed when participant was diagnosed with diabetes). Known monogenic diabetes, secondary diabetes, or a genetic syndrome or disorder known to affect glucose tolerance other than diabetes. Symptomatic hyperglycemia and/or moderate to large ketonuria requiring immediate initiation of another antihyperglycemic agent. Participant has previously taken a dipeptidyl peptidaseIV (DPP4) inhibitor (such as sitagliptin, vildagliptin, alogliptin, or saxagliptin) or glucagonlike peptide1 (GLP1) receptor agonist (such as exenatide or liraglutide). Exhibits abnormal growth patterns or is being treated with growth hormone. History of idiopathic acute pancreatitis or chronic pancreatitis.</criteria>
