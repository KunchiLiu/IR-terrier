	<brief_summary>Adaptive support ventilation (ASV) is a closed loop ventilation mode that can act both like PCV and PSV automatically. Some studies suggest that ASV can reduce the weaning time in ICU patients. The investigators hypothesized that using ASV from the beginning of intubation can reduce the total duration of MV and LOS in the ICU when compared to conventional modes such as PCV+PSV</brief_summary>
