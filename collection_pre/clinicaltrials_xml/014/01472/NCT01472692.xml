	<brief_summary>High normal blood pressure, also called prehypertension, is a significant problem. High uric acid in the blood, the same thing that causes gout, may cause higher blood pressures. The investigators plan to monitor the effects of the drug febuxostat(trade name Uloric) on blood pressure and stiffness of the main blood vessels and see if lowering uric acid has any effect.</brief_summary>
