	<brief_title>ZoNantax - Zolendronic Acid as Neoadjuvant Therapy Plus Anthracycline and Taxane in Locally Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial combines zolendronic acid with anthracycline followed taxane plus trastuzumab for neoadjuvant treatment of HER 2 positive stage II/III breast cancer. Zoledronic acid (ZOL) has activity of anti-bone resorption and shows diverse anti-tumor effects in vitro. Some chemical and biological characteristics of ZOL indicate potential for inhibition of tumor growth in pre clinical studies The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the residual cancer burden (RCB) with the addition of zolendronic acid to standard neoadjuvant therapy. RCB is calculated as a continuous index combining pathologic measurements of primary tumor (size and cellularity) and nodal metastases (number and size). RCB index is a significant predictor of distant relapse-free survival, and can be used to define categories of near-complete response and chemotherapy resistance after neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with currently used risk factors. Additionally, the study will collect tissue biopsies and blood before and after treatment in order to correlate clinical outcomes with gene expression and radiologic data to predictive response.</detailed_description>
