	<brief_summary>This study sought to investigate safety and efficacy of biolimus-eluting stents (BES) with biodegradable polymer as compared with everolimus-eluting stents (EES) with durable polymer through 3 years of follow-up.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Everolimus- Versus Biolimus-Eluting Stents in All-Comers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A group of 814 consecutive patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was enrolled between 2007 and 2010, of which 527 were treated with EES and 287 with BES implantation. Clinical outcome was compared in 200 pairs using propensity score matching. The primary endpoint was a composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI) and target vessel revascularisation (TVR) at two-year follow-up.</detailed_description>
