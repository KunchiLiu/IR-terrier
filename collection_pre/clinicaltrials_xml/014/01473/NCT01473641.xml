	<brief_title>Nexplanon Observational Risk Assessment Study (NORA)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nexplanon is a subdermal contraceptive implant containing the progestogen etonogestrel. It provides contraceptive protection for three years. In addition to the progestogen, Nexplanon contains barium sulfate and a Next Generation Implanon Applicator (NGIA). Nexplanon was developed to further facilitate correct insertion of the implant by using the NGIA, and to extend the diagnostic modalities for localization of the implant by making it radiopaque and visible via X-ray imaging and X-ray Computerized Tomography (CT). A large, descriptive, prospective, non-interventional, observational cohort study is planned to follow a cohort of new users of the contraceptive implant Nexplanon. Women will be recruited through health care professionals who have completed the Nexplanon Clinical Training Program. Baseline and follow-up information will be collected via a self-administered questionnaire. Data analysis will include characterizing the frequency of specific insertion-, localization- and removal-related events via point-estimates of the event rate as well as 95% confidence intervals. The impact of potential prognostic factors will be analyzed using multivariate regression models and/or stratified analyses.</detailed_description>
