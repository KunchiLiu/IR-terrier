Patient has received any prior antineoplastic therapy for BKM, except for the treatment allowed in inclusion criteria Patient has any tumor progression after definitive GBM resection/ biopsy, except for the transformation from previous low grade glioma. Patient with a concurrent malignancy or malignancy within 3 years of study enrollment (with the exception of adequately treated, basal or squamous cell carcinoma, nonmelanomatous skin cancer or curatively resected cervical cancer) Patient who had not recovered to grade 1 or better from any adverse events (except alopecia, nausea, vomiting) related to previous antineoplastic therapy before screening procedures are initiated, as allowed in inclusion criteria Patient has any of the following baseline mood disorders (not attributable to GBM) as judged by the Investigator or a Psychiatrist, or meets the cutoff score of ≥ 12 in the PHQ 9 or a cutoff of ≥ 15 in the GAD7 mood scale for reasons not attributable to GBM; or selects a positive response of '1, 2, 3' to question number 9 regarding potential for suicidal thoughts or ideation in the PHQ9 (independent of the total score of the PHQ9) Medically documented history of or active major depressive episode, bipolar disorder (I or II), obsessivecompulsive disorder, schizophrenia, a history of suicidal attempt or ideation, or homicidal ideation (immediate risk of doing harm to others) Active severe personality disorders (defined according to DSMIV). Note: for patients with psychotropic treatments ongoing at baseline, the dose and the schedule should not be modified within the previous 6 weeks prior to start of study drug. ≥ CTCAE grade 3 anxiety Patient who is concurrently using any other approved or investigational antineoplastic agent Patient who has undergone the following invasive procedures: Major surgical procedure, open biopsy or significant traumatic injury &lt; 14 days prior to starting study drug or has not recovered from side effects of such therapy, anticipation of need for invasive surgical procedure during the course of the study, biopsy within 7 days prior to starting study drug Patient has poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (HbA1c &gt; 8%) Patient is currently receiving increasing or chronic treatment with corticosteroids or another immunosuppressive agent Patient is currently receiving an enzyme inducing antiepileptic drug. The patient must have discontinued EIAED therapy for at least two weeks prior to starting study drug. Nonenzyme inducing antiepileptic medication is allowed, except those listed in the protocol Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply</criteria>
