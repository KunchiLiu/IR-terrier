	<brief_summary>This phase III, multi-centre, comparative, double-blind, randomized trial on 2 parallel groups is designed to evaluate a strategy for the prevention of HIV infection including "on demand" antiretroviral pre-exposure with Truvada versus placebo, associated with overall prevention (counselling, condoms, sexually transmitted diseases (STD) screening, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccinations and post-exposure treatment of HIV infection) in men who have sex with men (MSM), exposed to the risk of HIV infection. Indeed recent studies have reported a higher incidence of new HIV infection in MSM as compared to the general population, new approaches to the prevention of HIV infection are, therefore, necessary in order to consider the limits of current strategies.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The trial has been taken place in two phases in order to ensure the general feasibility of the study: - a first enrollment phase for at least 300 participants to ensure the possibility for recruitment in France and Canada and to validate the tools put into place as part of the trial to enroll and follow participants - a second phase of 1600 additional participants. This extension phase started on July 2014. The recruitment has been suspended following the recommendations of Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB): the placebo arm has been stopped and Truvada is available for all the participants of the trial since November 2014.</detailed_description>
