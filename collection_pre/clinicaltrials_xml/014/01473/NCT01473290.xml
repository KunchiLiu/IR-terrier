	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Probiotic therapy may reduce or prevent gastrointestinal complications in patients undergoing chemotherapy and pelvic radiation therapy. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well probiotic therapy works in preventing gastrointestinal complications in patients undergoing chemotherapy and pelvic radiation therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Probiotic Therapy in Preventing Gastrointestinal Complications in Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy and Pelvic Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine whether live freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria probiotic (VSL#3®) is effective in reducing the acute treatment-related bowel function disturbances, as measured by the FACIT-D diarrhea subscale score in patients receiving concurrent chemotherapy and pelvic RT as adjuvant or primary treatment for malignancy. Secondary - To determine whether VSL#3® can reduce chronic treatment-related bowel dysfunction following completion of therapy. - To examine whether VSL#3® appears to have an impact on disease-free survival. - To bank blood products for future studies. (exploratory) - To characterize changes in the fecal microbiota and examine for correlation with treatment assignment and symptom scores. (exploratory) OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are stratified according to site of primary tumor (rectum/anus vs other), history of anterior resection of the rectum (yes vs no), total planned cumulative dose (including boost of external-beam radiotherapy [RT] or brachytherapy) (4,500-5,350 cGy vs &gt; 5,350 cGy), and use of intensity-modulated RT [IMRT] for pelvic RT (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive live freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria probiotic (VSL#3®) orally (PO) 3 times a day during RT (5-8 weeks) and for 2 weeks after completion of RT. - Arm II: Patients receive placebo PO 3 times a day during RT (5-8 weeks) and for 2 weeks after completion of RT. Patients self-report symptoms using the FACIT-D, PBFQ, PRO-CTCAE, and Uniscale/fatigue weekly during RT, for 2 weeks after completion of RT, and at 12 months following the completion of RT. Blood and stool samples may be collected from some patients for correlative studies.</detailed_description>
