	<brief_title>Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation (PFNA) Versus PFNA Augmentation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To avoid the pain-causing relative movement between implant and bone, surgical techniques and devices allowing augmentation of the femoral head have recently been developed. Biomechanical studies showed that augmentation leads to a better axial stability and pull-out strength. In clinical practice, this might facilitate early mobilization and full weight-bearing with less pain. The purpose of this study is therefore to evaluate whether patients with trochanteric fractures being treated with a PFNA and augmentation can better be mobilized than patients without augmentation. In particular, it will be measured whether patients with a PFNA Augmentation can walk faster than the non-augmented patients, measured with the Timed up and Go test.</detailed_description>
