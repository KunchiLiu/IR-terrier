	<brief_summary>The relationship between cytomegalovirus infection and recurrence of hepatitis C in liver transplant recipients remains controversial. Although some studies (Teixeira et al., 2000; Singh et al., 2005)have not found an association between recurrence of hepatitis C and CMV infection, studies such as Rosen et al. show that 50% of patients with CMV infection suffered cirrhosis durig follow-up period, while between not-infected patients the rate was 11%. To clarify this question, a non-interventional study will be carried out in order to assess if CMV replication is a risk factor for graft dysfunction in liver transplant recipients.</brief_summary>
