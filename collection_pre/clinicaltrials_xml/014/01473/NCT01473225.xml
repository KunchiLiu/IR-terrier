	<brief_summary>This study is a test of possible mechanisms by which calorie labels might lead people to increase calorie intake. The investigators hypothesize that calorie labels might increase calorie intake because 1) people infer that higher calorie foods are tastier, 2) calorie labels invoke thoughts of dieting, leading people to overconsume as a reaction, 3) people try to maximize calories consumed per dollar spent, and 4) calorie labels change one's goal motivation toward food, causing people to eat more.</brief_summary>
