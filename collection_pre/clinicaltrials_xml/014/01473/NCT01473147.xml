	<brief_summary>Background: Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) has been demonstrated to be an effective clinical tool for intensive insulin therapy in Type 1 diabetic patients. Type 2 diabetes patients have been proved to have decreased of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels. Injection of GLP-1 receptor agonists are associated with improved glycemic control. Nevertheless, the clinical effects and mechanisms are still unclear when additional supplement of GLP-1 analogue in cooperation with intensive CSII treatment for poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes patients. This study is designed to understand the complementary pharmacological effects of GLP-1 analogue on intensive CSII treatment. Methods: Sixty poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes patients will be admitted to the ward for 6 days CSII intensive treatment. Following the normalization of blood glucose at first 3 days, the patients are randomly assigned with combined therapy with exenatide injection or saline for another 3 days. The clinical assessments of insulin requirement, insulin secretion, insulin resistance glycemic excursions and cytokines will perform immediately during or after the study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Additional GLP-1 Analogue on CSII Treatment for Poorly Controlled Type 2 Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the poorly controlled type 2 DM, insulin therapy is the treatment of choice to make sugar on target. Actually, however, the general control rate is not good and partially due to the complex etiology in type 2 DM. GLP-1 deficiency is the mostly emphasized in modern practice. In order to study the effect of GLP-1 analogue in insulinized type 2 DM patients, investigators have to optimize the insulin therapy in the first priority. Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) or insulin pump is a viable choice for patients with type 1 or type 2 DM who want close-to-physiologic insulin treatment. By means of the insulin pump therapy, standardized sugar control profile in type 2 DM patients could be achieved in a short time. Investigators can further evaluate the clinical response under GLP-1 analogue or not.</detailed_description>
