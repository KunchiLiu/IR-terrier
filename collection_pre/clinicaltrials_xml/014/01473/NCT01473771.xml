	<brief_summary>The purpose of this multi-site randomized controlled trial is to determine if the Caring Letters intervention is effective in preventing suicide and suicidal behaviors among U.S. Service Members and Veterans. The primary aim of this project is determine whether caring communications following inpatient psychiatric treatment reduce suicide and self-inflicted injuries among U.S. military personnel and Veterans. The investigators will also explore treatment utilization by comparing the frequency of treatment visits after enrollment into the study. The following specific hypotheses will be tested: Hypothesis 1: During a two year follow-up after the index hospital discharge, the frequency of suicide will be lower among participants in the Caring Letters group compared to those in the Usual Care group. Hypothesis 2: The frequency of medically admitted self-inflicted injuries will also be lower in the Caring Letters group compared to the Usual Care group. Hypothesis 3: The time to suicidal act, among those who do subsequently exhibit one, will be longer among participants in the Caring Letters group compared to the Usual Care group.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This social/ behavioral study is a five year multi-site randomized controlled trial that will compare the Caring Letters intervention (with usual care) to usual care without the caring letters. Participants will be recruited from inpatient psychiatry units of collaborating military and Veterans Affairs (VA) sites and randomized to either a group that receives letters (Caring Letters group) or a group that does not receive letters (Usual Care group). The methodology of the intervention is updated with emails instead of postal letters. This study fills an important gap in the evidence base for the Caring Letter intervention through a methodologically rigorous research design.</detailed_description>
