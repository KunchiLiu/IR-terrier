	<brief_summary>This study is being done to find out if it is possible to enroll minority women with breast cancer in a study of how chemotherapy may affect their ability to answer certain questions and perform certain tasks that measure brain activity. The investigators want to look at thinking and brain activity in patients to see if cancer treatments can cause any brain changes. For this study, women without cancer, are being asked to participate in order to compare the answers to the questions and the brain wave activity measured in the women with cancer to women who don't have cancer.</brief_summary>
