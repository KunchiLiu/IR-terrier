	<brief_summary>This study employs a Randomised Controlled Trial design to investigate whether a CBT-based guided self-help intervention can improve anxiety, depression, psychological well-being, quality of life, Diabetic self-care and adherence; as compared to controls. The study aims to recruit 42 individuals with Diabetes and mild to moderate anxiety or depression. Anxiety and depression are common in patients with Type 2 Diabetes, and has been shown to affect Diabetes control. Literature suggests that CBT can benefit individuals with Diabetes and comorbid mental ill-health, however little research has been done to date on the effect of guided self-help in this population. It is expected that this intervention will improve patient's mental health, as well as extend the limited knowledge-base on guided self-help in chronic illness.</brief_summary>
