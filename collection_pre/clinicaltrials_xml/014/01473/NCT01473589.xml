	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to see whether teriparatide, given for 6 months versus placebo, will improve the healing of hip (femoral neck) fractures that are repaired during surgery using certain types of orthopedic screws. The study will enroll men and postmenopausal women at least 50 years of age with a recent hip (femoral neck) fracture caused by low-trauma (for example, fall from standing height or less).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect of Teriparatide on Hip Fracture Healing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a 12-month, Phase 3, prospective, randomized, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, multinational study to evaluate the effect of 6 months of treatment with teriparatide on fracture healing in participants who have sustained a recent low-trauma, unilateral, femoral neck fracture stabilized by internal fixation. The study has 3 periods: 1. A screening period that must be completed in ≤ 14 days after operative treatment of the femoral neck fracture 2. A 6-month double-blind treatment period [teriparatide 20 µg or placebo given once daily by SC injection] 3. A 6-month observation period. The primary objective is to assess the effect of 6 months of treatment with teriparatide 20 µg/day versus placebo on the proportion of men and postmenopausal women of at least 50 years of age with no revision surgery 12 months after internal fixation of a low-trauma femoral neck fracture. All participants will receive supplements of calcium and vitamin D beginning at screening and continuing for 12 months.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Community dwelling men and postmenopausal women who were ambulatory before sustaining a lowtrauma, unilateral femoral neck fracture (displaced or nondisplaced) Other than femoral neck fracture, be free of incapacitating conditions and have a life expectancy of at least 2 years Have received or are eligible for treatment with internal fixation (sliding hip screw or multiple cancellous screws) for the femoral neck fracture (the surgical procedure itself is not performed as part of this study) Have given written informed consent (participant or proxy) after being informed of the risks, medications, and study procedures Increased baseline risk of osteosarcoma History of unresolved skeletal diseases affecting bone metabolism other than primary osteoporosis Abnormally elevated serum calcium at screening Abnormally elevated serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) (184) at screening Severe vitamin D deficiency at screening Active liver disease or jaundice Significantly impaired renal function Abnormal thyroid function not corrected by therapy History of malignant neoplasm in the 5 years prior to screening History of bone marrow or solid organ transplantation History of symptomatic nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis in the 1 year prior to screening Previous treatment with the following bone active drugs is allowed but must be discontinued at screening: oral bisphosphonates, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), calcitonin, estrogen (oral, transdermal, or injectable), progestin, estrogen analog, estrogen agonist, estrogen antagonist or tibolone, and active vitamin D3 analogs. Androgen or other anabolic steroid use must be discontinued, except for use of physiologic replacement testosterone Previous treatment with the following bone active drugs is exclusionary, if the stated treatment durations have been met: strontium ranelate for any duration, intravenous bisphosphonates in the 12 months preceding screening, and/or denosumab in the 6 months preceding screening Prior treatment with PTH, teriparatide, or other PTH analogs, or prior participation in any other clinical trial studying PTH, teriparatide, or other PTH analogs Local or systemic treatment with bone morphogenic proteins or any other growth factor Previous fracture(s) or bone surgery in the currently fractured hip Softtissue infection at the operation site Treatment with bone grafting or osteotomies Treatment with augmentation using any type of degradable cement, hydroxyapatitecoated implants, or with noninvasive interventions Associated major injuries of a lower extremity including fractures of the foot, ankle, tibia, fibula, knee, femur, femoral head or pelvis; dislocations of the ankle, knee or hip</criteria>
