	<brief_summary>Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is a multi-factorial disease process that is the end result of an immature, surfactant deficient lung that has been exposed to hyperoxia, mechanical ventilation and infection. These conditions initiate an inflammatory response characterized by elevated inflammatory cell infiltrates and proinflammatory cytokines that lead to the development of significant acute and chronic lung injury. The study drug, rhCC10, is a recombinant version of natural human CC10 protein. Native CC10 is produced primarily by non-ciliated respiratory epithelial cells, called Clara cells and is the most abundant protein in the mucosal fluids in normal healthy lungs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability and anti-inflammatory effects of a single intratracheal (IT) dose of rhCC10 to intubated premature infants receiving positive pressure ventilation for treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) to prevent long term respiratory complications referred to as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and, more recently, as chronic respiratory morbidity (CRM; asthma, cough, wheezing, multiple respiratory infections). CC10 regulates inflammatory responses and protects the structural integrity of pulmonary tissue while preserving pulmonary mechanical function during various insults (eg. viral infection, bacterial endotoxin, ozone, allergens, hyperoxia). Together these properties suggest that administration of rhCC10 may help to facilitate development of normal airway epithelia and prevent the inflammation that leads to CRM in these infants.</brief_summary>
