	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to evaluate safety and efficacy of a pericardial adipose pedicle transposition (adiFLAP) for the improvement of cardiac function in patients with a chronic myocardial infarct. Preclinical studies in the porcine model of myocardial infarction have shown that AdiFLAP reduces infarct area.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pericardic Adipose Pedicle Transposition Over the Myocardial Infarct (adiFLAP Trial)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This novel intervention consists of the pericardial isolation of adipose tissue maintaining its vascularization to create an adipose flap (adiFLAP) and its transposition fully covering infarcted myocardium.</detailed_description>
