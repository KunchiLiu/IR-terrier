	<detailed_description>The purpose of this study is to compare two fertility protocols in obese women with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome who are candidates for In Vitro Fertilization (IVF). These protocols carry less risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome which these women may experience.The patients in the IVM group will not be exposeD to gonadotropin treatment for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. In the antagonist group we will use GnRH agonist to induce ovulation which may reduce the risk for ovarian hyperstimulation.</detailed_description>
