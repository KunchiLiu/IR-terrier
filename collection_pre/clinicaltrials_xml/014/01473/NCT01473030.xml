	<brief_summary>The overall goal of this project is to quantify the long-term effects of dutasteride on the architectural and nuclear features of benign prostate tissue, using state-of-the art digital image analysis techniques. The ultimate result will be a multivariable morphological "signature" that could provide a useful indicator of an individual's degree of drug response.</brief_summary>
