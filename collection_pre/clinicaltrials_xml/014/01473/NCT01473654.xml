	<brief_title>The Avoiding Diabetes Thru Action Plan Targeting Pilot Randomized Control Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ADAPT (Avoiding Diabetes Thru Action Plan Targeting) trial is an innovative study that leverages persuasive technology to enhance the lifestyle behavior change counseling efficacy of primary care providers. Using principles of behavior change theory and persuasion technology, the multidisciplinary design team utilized in-depth interviews and in-vivo usability testing to produce a prototype diabetes prevention counseling system embedded in the electronic health record. The core element of the tool is a streamlined shared goal setting module within the electronic health record system. The system also utilizes a pre-encounter patient behavior change goals elicitation survey to help tailor the goal setting session to patient preferences and encourage shared decision making. The patients also interact with a website that collects their longitudinal behavior change data and visualizes their progress over time and in comparison to other study members. The ADAPT system utilizes the influential powers of goal setting, tailoring, reminders, social comparisons, testimonials and other methods to integrate evidence based behavior change principles and persuasion techniques into routine primary care clinical encounters. If successful, the ADAPT system may represent an adaptable and scalable technology-enabled behavior change tool for all primary care providers.</detailed_description>
