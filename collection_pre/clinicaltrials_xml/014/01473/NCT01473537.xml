	<brief_summary>Aim: to determine the optimal Ca2+ concentration with 905 ppm F as NaF. Study design: Experimental study in 10 volunteers. Single blind mouth rinse with calcium lactate solution (150; 75; 0 mM Ca-lactate) is immediately followed by a standard fluoride rinse. Procedure: Rinses are performed in the evening. The rinse combinations are given in a random order, and the subjects are unaware of the sequence. At least 3 days separates the use of each rinse. Dosage: 20 mL and 1 minute rinse with each solution. Saliva samples: Twelve hours after rinsing, unstimulated saliva samples are collected by expectoration. Analysis: The fluoride concentration in saliva samples are analysed Statistics and data handling: Fluoride in saliva 12 hours after rinsing are examined by one-way ANOVA, repeated measures design.</brief_summary>
