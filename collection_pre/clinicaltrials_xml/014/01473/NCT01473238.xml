	<brief_summary>Paper-based data collection for prospective clinical trials is associated with a poor quality of data collection. This typically involves missing or wrong data entry or a low recruitment rate, mainly due to the cumbersome and uncontrolled data collection. Electronic data collection is associated with improved quality of data entry in the cases of Electronic Patient Records (EPR) and patient handover among doctors during night and day shifts. However, a comprehensive direct comparison between web-based desktop personal computer (PC) and mobile (e.g. iPad) data collection has not yet been reported. The purpose of this prospective trial is to compare the users' experience with the web-based desktop PC and mobile data collection (iPad) tools.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Desktop Versus Mobile Data Collection in Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators designed a prospective randomized controlled trial where doctors from several randomly selected hospitals will use either a desktop PC or mobile (iPad) data collection tool. A validated user experience evaluation instrument will be used at the beginning, during interim analysis and at the end of the trial. The desktop-based data collection is built on Drupal, a renowned open source content management system (CMS). The same CMS will be used with a special interface designed for iOS/iPad. Both data collection platforms will be used in parallel to a prospective clinical trial.</detailed_description>
