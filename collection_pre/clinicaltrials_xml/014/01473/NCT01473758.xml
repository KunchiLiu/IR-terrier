	<brief_summary>The purpose of this trial is to investigate if roflumilast can reduce the neutrophilic inflammation at acute exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). In addition, the potential benefit of roflumilast on severity and recovery periods of acute COPD exacerbations will be assessed using patient diaries and questionnaires.</brief_summary>
