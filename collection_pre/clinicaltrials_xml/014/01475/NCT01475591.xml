	<brief_summary>The aim is to evaluate effects of early individually tailored web-based multimodal rehabilitation for persons with musculoskeletal neck/shoulder and back disorders in primary health care. The aim is also to study if this early web-based pain rehabilitation program is more cost-effective than only multimodal rehabilitation. Randomization will be done at each primary health care centre after screening to 1) Multimodal pain rehabilitation with web-based education and coaching support or 2) multimodal pain rehabilitation. The investigators suggest a clear rehabilitation chain where a web-based program is developed,evaluated and ready to implement if it shows positive effects on work-ability and/or is cost-effective. The research and implementation will be performed in a close cooperation with Luleå University of Technology.</brief_summary>
