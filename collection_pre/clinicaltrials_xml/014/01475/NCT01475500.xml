	<brief_summary>This screening study will address the lack of molecular strategies for the early detection of lung cancer and integrate those with epidemiological and imaging strategies. The hypothesis is that the repeated measure of biomarkers of risk obtained from the molecular analysis of biological specimens including those from bronchoscopy (bronchial brushings and biopsies) may contribute to the refinement of high-risk populations and allow an earlier clinical diagnosis. The goal of the investigators study is to provide screening for lung cancer in a high-risk population. In this prospective cohort it will be tested whether repeated measure of biomarkers of risk allows early detection of lung cancer.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It is proposed to test the hypotheses in a screening study of high risk individuals (characterized by an established prediction rule). The expected prevalence of lung cancer in this high risk group is estimated to be 2% per year. All individuals benefit from clinic visit, low-dose Chest CT, spirometry and auto-fluorescence bronchoscopy at baseline, Chest CT, follow-up doctor visit, and auto-fluorescence bronchoscopy at least at year 2 and 5.</detailed_description>
