	<brief_summary>The AdOPT Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) study is an acute, prospective, multi-center, non-randomized investigational study designed to compare indices of cardiac function at device settings optimized using the investigational Adaptive CRT (aCRT) algorithm versus nominal programming. The comparison will be performed during rest, atrial pacing and sub-maximal exercise. AdOPT CRT is a sub study of the Adaptive CRT Study (NTC00980057) being conducted in Europe.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject is age 18 or greater Subject is willing to sign and date the study Informed Consent form Subject has been implanted with a clinically indicated CRTD device (Medtronic Vision 3D or Protecta models) for at least 1 month but less than 7 months from the date of study enrollment Subject has a history of persistent or permanent AF for which pharmacological therapy and/or cardioversion have been unsuccessful or have not been attempted. Subject has atrial or ventricular tachyarrhythmias or frequent atrial or ventricular ectopy at the time of enrollment. Subject's resting heart rate at the time of enrollment exceeds 90 bpm. Subject had CRT system implanted for more than 7 months from the date of the study enrollment Subject has complete AV block. Subject had previous mechanical valve surgeries. Subject has congenital heart disease. Subject has contraindication for an exercise test. Subject is unable to perform a submaximal exercise test. It is not possible to acquire technically acceptable echocardiographic images. Subject has medical conditions that would limit study participation. Subject is pregnant (all women of childbearing potential must undergo a pregnancy test within seven days prior to the study visit). Subject is enrolled in the Adaptive CRT study Subject is enrolled in concurrent studies which could confound the results of this study.
