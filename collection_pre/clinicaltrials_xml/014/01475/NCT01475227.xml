	<brief_summary>The study is being conducted as the most common side effect of the HIV drug atazanavir (taken with ritonavir) is hyperbilirubinaemia. Bilirubin is a normal waste product from the body and gets broken down in the liver so it can leave the body through the gut. Atazanavir slows the breakdown of this chemical, which can cause jaundice (yellowing of the skin) and/or scleral icterus (yellowing of the eyes). This is completely harmless; in fact up to 1 in 10 of the UK population have an inherited condition that causes the same yellowing. However, some patients don't like this side effect and it is the commonest reason for switching off the drug. A study in people with Gilberts syndrome (the inherited condition that causes the same changes in the chemical bilirubin) showed that a mineral supplement (zinc sulphate) reduced the levels of bilirubin in the blood. The aim of this study is to see if using zinc supplements can achieve the same effect in patients with high bilirubin due to atazanavir use.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Atazanavir/Ritonavir and Zinc Pharmacokinetic Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atazanavir is a protease inhibitor (PI) and, like other agents in this class, requires pharmacological 'boosting' with the cytochrome p450 inhibitor ritonavir. Ritonavir slows the hepatic clearance of PIs, increasing plasma concentration and allowing the us eof lower, and less frequent doses. Atazanavir, boosted with ritonavir, is approved for once-daily use, is an internationally preferred first-line agent (in combination with a backbone of two nucleosides [NRTI]) and the most commonly prescribed PI in the UK. Once-daily atazanavir/ritonavir with two NRTI is an effective and well-tolerated therapeutic option for people living with HIV infection. The most common adverse event associated with atazanavir use is unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia. This is observed in over 40% of patients and up to 5% of patients discontinue the drug due jaundice and/or scleral icterus. Truvada is a fixed dose combination of two NRTI, tenofovir (245mg) and emtricitabine (200mg), administered as one tablet once daily. Truvada is a preferred NRTI backbone in national and international guidelines and the first line, therefore most commonly used, NRTI backbone in our unit. Benefits of atazanavir/ritonavir compared with alternative agents include once daily dosing, low pill burden, low rates of gastro-intestinal toxicity and, importantly in a patient population already at an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease, a favourable lipid profile. If a simple intervention could reduce the incidence of hyperbilirubinaemia this could reduce the risk of treatment discontinuation/switch. The aim of this study is to explore the benefit, and safety, of adding zinc sulphate in patients on a stable regimen of Truvada, atazanavir and ritonavir.</detailed_description>

This would include any active clinically significant renal, cardiac, hepatic, pulmonary, vascular, metabolic disorders or malignancy. 2. Body mass index (BMI) &gt;35 kg/m2 3. Presence of any current active AIDS defining illness (Category C conditions according to the CDC Classification System for HIV Infection 1993) with the following exceptions: â€¢ Stable cutaneous Kaposi's Sarcoma 4. Clinically relevant alcohol or drug use (positive urine drug screen, with the exception of cannabinoids) or history of alcohol or drug use considered by the Investigator to be sufficient to hinder compliance with treatment, followup procedures or evaluation of adverse events. 5. The use of zinc supplements for 1 month before screening and disallowed concomitant therapy (See Concomitant Medication and treatment, section 5.2) or medication that may interfere with the study results (as determined by the principal investigator). 6.

Previous allergy to any of the constituents of the zinc sulphate tablets administered in this trial. 8. Subjects with laboratory evidence of significantly decreased hepatic or renal function (as determined by the principal investigator). 9. Exposure to any investigational drug or placebo within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug</criteria>
