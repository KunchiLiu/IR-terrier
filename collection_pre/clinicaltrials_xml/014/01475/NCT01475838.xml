	<brief_summary>This study will evaluate the non-inferiority of Stribild® (elvitegravir/cobicistat/ emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (E/C/F/TDF)) single-tablet regimen (STR) relative to regimens consisting of a protease inhibitor (PI) boosted with ritonavir (RTV) plus Truvada® (FTC/TDF) fixed-dose combination in maintaining HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL at Week 48 in virologically suppressed, HIV-1 infected adults. This study will also evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the two regimens through 96 weeks of treatment.</brief_summary>
