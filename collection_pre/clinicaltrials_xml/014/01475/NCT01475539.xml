	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to generate data to support the registration extension of IMOVAX Polio to be used in a sequential vaccination. Primary objective: - To demonstrate the non-inferiority of Inactivated Poliomyelitis Vaccine (IPV)-(Oral Poliomyelitis Vaccine) (OPV)-OPV (Sequential 1) and IPV-IPV-OPV (sequential 2) poliovirus vaccine administrations versus OPV-OPV-OPV (Reference) in terms of seroprotection rate 28 to 42 days after the third dose of the primary vaccination series. Secondary objectives: - To evaluate the safety profile of the investigational vaccines after each administration in each group. - To describe the humoral immune response to poliovirus serotypes (types 1, 2 and 3) before the first dose and 28 to 42 days after the third primary series dose of vaccine in each group. - To describe the persistence of antibodies against poliovirus serotypes (types 1, 2 and 3) after the third primary series dose administration, at 18 months of age in each group.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sequential Inactivated Poliomyelitis Vaccine Followed by Oral Poliomyelitis Vaccine Versus Oral Poliomyelitis Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study participants will be randomized to receive either 3 doses of a commercially available Oral Poliovirus Vaccine (OPV), or 1 dose of Sanofi Pasteur's injectable Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine IMOVAX Polio (IPV) followed by 2 doses of OPV, or 2 doses of IPV followed by 1 dose of OPV. These vaccines will be administered at 2, 3 and 4 months of age as primary vaccination for the prevention of poliomyelitis. Participants will be followed up through their 18th- to 19th-month birthday.</detailed_description>
