	<brief_title>Phase 3 Study of GSK548470 in Patients With Compensated Chronic Hepatitis B With Poor Response to Other Drugs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multicenter, open-label study in Japanese patients with compensated chronic hepatitis B with poor response to other drugs in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GSK548470 administered at a dose of 300 mg once daily. The target sample size is set at 32 subjects. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily treatment with GSK548470 300 mg in subjects with compensated chronic hepatitis B with poor response to other drugs. The secondary objective is to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of once-daily treatment with GSK548470 300 mg.To evaluate the efficacy and safety of GSK548470 in the study, subjects receiving a combination of lamivudine (LAM) and adefovir pivoxil (ADV) will be switched to a combination of LAM and GSK548470, while subjects on entecavir hydrate (ETV) with or without ADV will be switched to a combination of ETV and GSK548470.</detailed_description>
