	<brief_summary>This is a stepped glucose clamp study designed to investigate the effect of treatment with albiglutide on counter-regulatory hormone responses and recovery from hypoglycemia in subjects with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. A single dose of albiglutide or placebo will be given prior to a stepped hyper- and hypoglycemic clamp. The goal of this study is to demonstrate that albiglutide increases insulin secretion and decreases glucagon levels in a glucose-dependent manner.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Albiglutide Glucose Clamp Study in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a Phase II, single-site, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, stepped glucose clamp study designed to investigate the effect of treatment with albiglutide on counter-regulatory hormone responses and recovery from hypoglycemia in subjects with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. A single dose of albiglutide or placebo will be given 3 days before employing a stepped hyper- and hypoglycemic clamp. The goal of this study is to demonstrate that albiglutide increases insulin secretion and decreases glucagon levels in a glucose-dependent manner. In particular, this study is being conducted to ensure that albiglutide does not impair counter-regulatory responses during hypoglycemia.</detailed_description>
