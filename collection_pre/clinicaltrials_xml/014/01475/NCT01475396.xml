	<brief_summary>Physical activity is thought to increase overall body functions and to decrease cardiovascular and stroke risk factors. Now the question arose, wether enhanced exercise could also exert positive influence on cognition in the aging brain. Therefore, 50 to 80 years old healthy subjects take part in a prospective study with regular sports activity during 6 months. Cognitive functions are detected with sensitive neuropsychological outcome measures, further investigations include MRT of the head, lactat- and other physical measures as well as detailed serum profiles. As a hypothesis, enhanced physical activity is suggested to predict better cognitive performance.</brief_summary>
