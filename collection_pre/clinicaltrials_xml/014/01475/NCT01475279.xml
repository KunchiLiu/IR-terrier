	<brief_title>A Study to Evaluate the Effect of T89(Dantonic®)on Steady-State Pharmacodynamics of Warfarin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Due to a large proportion of patients that could benefit from Dantonic treatment is likely to take warfarin concomitantly. And there is no systematic experience of warfarin drug-drug interaction between Dantonic and warfarin on humans. It is highly relevant to investigate the potential interaction of theses two drugs. Primary endpoint: •The change in INR with T89 (Day 25) compared with that without T89 (Day 18) Secondary endpoints: - The change in PK variables for R-warfarin and S-warfarin on Day 17 compared with those on Day 24 - Safety assessments across all time points</detailed_description>
