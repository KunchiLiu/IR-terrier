	<brief_summary>The current standard of care for bile duct stone are endoscopic sphincterotomy and stone extraction. Placement of plastic stents is an option for incomplete biliary stone clearance. This study will use the CSEMS in patients with complex biliary stones who failed stone extraction as they have the advantage of large stent diameter. CSEMS may offer a temporizing measure that allows more successful subsequent stone clearance. However, their use in benign condition has been limited especially for biliary stone removal. The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility, safety, easy removability, stent-stone formation rate, and migration rate of CSEMS for complex biliary stones.</brief_summary>
