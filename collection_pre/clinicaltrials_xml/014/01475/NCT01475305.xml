	<brief_summary>The primary goal is to evaluate the suitability of the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) challenge model in measuring the efficacy of MEDI-557 compared to placebo in healthy adult subjects for the reduction in the incidence of RSV through 12 days post-RSV challenge with the RSV virus.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intra-nasal Challenge of Healthy Adults With Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is designed to be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study. Up to 30 subjects will be randomized, dosed and followed. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive a single intravenous (IV) dose of MEDI-557 or placebo. Subjects will be inoculated with RSV. Subjects will be followed for efficacy for 12 days post-RSV challenge. Safety follow-up will be approximately 12 months from randomization.</detailed_description>
