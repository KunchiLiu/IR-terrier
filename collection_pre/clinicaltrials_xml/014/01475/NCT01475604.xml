	<brief_title>Impact of Noninvasive Targeted Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (tPEMF) on Opioid Use, Pain, and Joint Function Following Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgeons are continually looking for means to minimize postoperative pain following TKA in order to reduce or eliminate the need for opioid pain medications. Reductions in pain and edema along with improvements in range of motion encourage quicker recovery of joint function and normal activities. Pulsed radio frequency (PRF), a type of electromagnetic field treatment is proven to effectively modulate postoperative pain and edema in plastic surgery. Therefore, PRF has potential as an adjunct therapy for patients recovering from TKA. The purpose of the current double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial is to determine the effectiveness and safety of the Ivivi Torino II, a device that delivers pulsed radio frequency (PRF), a type of electromagnetic field treatment, in patients recovering from TKA for treatment of severe knee OA.</detailed_description>
