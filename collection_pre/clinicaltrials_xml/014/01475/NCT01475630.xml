Additionally, pain experienced during the first examination had to be â‰¥ 35mm on a visual analog scale (VAS) of 100mm. Patients were excluded if their medical history mentioned orofacial traumata (contusion or fracture), systemic disorders (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia), cervical disorders (operationalized as complaints, pain or referral patterns of pain provoked during movements of the cervical spine), neurologic disorders (e.g. trigeminal neuralgia, migraine or tension type headache), drug or alcohol abuse, use of antidepressant or hormonal medication. Participants did not receive therapy for symptoms of TMD within the last 2 months.</criteria>
