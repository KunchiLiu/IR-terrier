	<brief_summary>Approximately 33% of the US adult population can be classified as obese based on body mass index. This epidemic of obesity has resulted in over 200,000 bariatric surgeries performed every year for the treatment of "clinically severe obesity". Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is the most common bariatric procedure performed in the United States and has both restrictive and malabsorptive components. Despite the success of this procedure in creating long lasting weight loss, vitamin and iron deficiencies are common and can lead to significant morbidity if not appropriately addressed. Despite the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, The Obesity Society, and American Society for Metabolic &amp; Bariatric Surgery Medical Guidelines that include vitamin and mineral supplementation recommendations, there has been very little prospective research conducted to assess the efficacy and compliance of these micronutrient interventions. This prospective randomized controlled clinical study will evaluate the efficacy of a novel vitamin/mineral supplement in decreasing micronutrient deficiencies in post operative bariatric patients.</brief_summary>
