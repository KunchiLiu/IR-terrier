	<brief_title>Comparison of Remifentanil With Dexmedetomidine or Midazolam in Regards of Sedation Effectivity and Postoperative Cognitive Functions in Cystoscopies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Forty patients undergoing cystoscopy receiving remifentanil infusion of 0.05 microgram per kg-1 min-1 were randomized into two groups: Either dexmedetomidine 1 microgram per kg -1 (GroupD) or midazolam 0.2 mg kg-1h-1 (GroupM) were administered intravenously for the first 10 minutes. Subsequently anesthesia was maintained by using the bispectral index(BIS) as a continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine 0.2-0.7 microgram per kg-1h-1 or midazolam 0.05-0.15 mgkg-1h-1. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, MMSE, sedation and the patient's and surgeon's satisfaction were determined.</detailed_description>
