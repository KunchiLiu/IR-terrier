	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the ability of the IND One Step Strep A test to accurately test a throat swab specimen from a symptomatic patient for the presence or absence of Group A Streptococcus (Strep A) when compared to culture.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation of the IND One Step Strep A Rapid Test vs. Culture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Group A Streptococcus is a principal cause of respiratory infections such as tonsillitis, pharyngitis, and scarlet fever. Since pharyngitis can lead to rheumatic fever or acute glomerulonephritis, it is important to differentiate streptococcal pharyngitis from viral disease during early stages of infection. The Strep A Rapid Test is a simple and rapid test which can detect Group A Streptococcal antigen directly from throat swabs allowing physicians to make a rapid diagnosis and to administer therapy immediately. The IND Diagnostic Inc. Strep A Rapid Test is a lateral flow immunoassay utilizing colloidal gold reagents labeled with Strep A antibody. The test detects either viable or nonviable organisms directly from throat swabs within 10 minutes.</detailed_description>
