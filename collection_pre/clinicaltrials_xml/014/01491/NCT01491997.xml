	<brief_summary>Stress has been linked to chronic health problems, particularly diseases involving inflammation-mediated tissue injury and organ failure. Accordingly, it is not surprising that mind/body interventions are advocated for treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases. One such candidate disease is ulcerative colitis (UC) because: (1) UC is a life-long, relapsing, disabling inflammatory disorder of the intestine that lacks a non-toxic, efficacious treatment; (2) the therapeutic goal is to improve quality of life by ameliorating disabling symptoms and preventing disease progression by preventing disease flare-up, (3) stress triggers UC flare-up by modifying intestinal function and inflammatory processes, highlighting the potential therapeutic benefit of reducing physiological stress responses. The purpose of this study is to see if either of two 8-week mind/body medicine courses has an effect in reducing stress and affecting the course and severity of UC. Both have been shown to benefit other aspects of health and well-being.</brief_summary>
