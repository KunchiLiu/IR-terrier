	<brief_summary>Alcohol dependence is accompanied by several neurological mechanisms involving neuronal plasticity and neoneurogenesis, requiring Brain Derived Neurotrophic factor (BDNF) synthesis. The investigators found that serum BDNF levels in alcohol-dependent subjects increased to a greater extent in subjects who had remained abstinent at 6 months after withdrawal than in subjects who had relapse. To verify if the BDNF serum levels variation is linked to the way that abstinence is installed, wthe investigators will measure BDNF serum levels in alcohol dependent subjects at the moment of withdrawal, and 14, 28 days, and 2, 4, and 6 months after to establish its evolution in relation to alcohol consumption, and other clinical characteristics : depression intensity, anxiety, alcohol craving, biological markers of alcohol consumption or toxicity. Monitoring serum BDNF concentrations in link with other clinical data could help to characterize alcohol dependence profiles in clinical practice, help predict relapses, and assist in adjusting care to prevent difficulties in alcohol withdrawal.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor Serum Levels Evolution During the Six Months After Alcohol Withdrawal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total of 205 patients will be recruited at their hospitalization time for alcohol withdrawal during a 18 months period. The follow-up at 14, 28 days, 2, 4, 6 months after alcohol withdrawal will assess their BDNF serum levels, the levels of carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), urinary ethylglucuronide (EtG), and the scores to the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Montgomery Asberg depression scale (MADRS), the Hamilton'anxiety scale (HAM-A), the Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS).</detailed_description>
