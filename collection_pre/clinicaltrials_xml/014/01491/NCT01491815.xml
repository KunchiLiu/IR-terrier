	<brief_summary>This is an international (Nordic) trial designed to compare the safety and efficacy of active conventional therapy (ACT) and three biologic treatments in subjects with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The global aim of this study is to assess and compare 1. the proportion of subjects who achieve remission with ACT versus three different biologic therapies (Certolizumab-pegol, Abatacept or Tocilizumab) 2. two alternative de-escalation strategies in patients who respond to first-line therapy.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1. Subject is ≥18 years of age. 2. Subject has a diagnosis of RA as defined by the newly established ACR/EULAR criteria, 2010.

Subject must have DAS28 (CRP) &gt; 3.2. 5. ≥ 2 swollen joints AND ≥ 2 tender joints. 6. Subject must fulfill one of the following three criteria: RF positive OR ACPA positive OR CRP &gt;10 mg/L. 7. Female subject is either not of childbearing potential (postmenopausal, surgically sterile etc.), or is of childbearing potential and practicing one of the following methods of birth control throughout the study and for 150 days after study completion: Intrauterine device (IUD) Contraceptives (oral, parenteral, patch) for three months prior to study drug administration) A vasectomized partner 8. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at the Screening visit. 9. Subject is judged to be in good general health as determined by the principal investigator based upon the results of medical history, laboratory profile, physical examination, chest Xray (CXR), and 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at Screening. 10. Subjects must be able and willing to provide written informed consent and comply with the requirements of this study protocol. 11. Subjects must be able and willing to selfadminister s.c. injections or have a qualified person available to administer s.c. injections. 1. Subject has been previously treated with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for rheumatic diseases. 2. Current active inflammatory joint disease other than RA. 3. Subjects has had a dose of prednisone (or equivalent) &gt;7.5 mg/day or has had a dose change within the preceding 4 weeks. 4. Subject has been treated with intraarticular or parenteral administration of corticosteroids in the preceding 4 weeks. Inhaled corticosteroids for stable medical conditions are allowed. 5. Subject has undergone joint surgery within the preceding two months (at joints to be assessed within the study). 6. Subject has chronic arthritis diagnosed before age 17 years. 7. Subject has a history of an allergic reaction or significant sensitivity to constituents of study drugs. 8. Subject has been treated with any investigational drug within one month prior to screening visit. 9. Active infection of any kind (excluding fungal infections of nail beds), or any major episode of infection requiring hospitalization within 4 weeks of screening. 10. Subject has a poorly controlled medical condition, such as uncontrolled diabetes, unstable heart disease, congestive heart failure, recent cerebrovascular accidents and any other condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the subject at risk by participation in the study. 11. Subject has a history of clinically significant hematologic (e.g., severe anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia), renal or liver disease (e.g., fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatitis). 12. Subject has history of neurologic symptoms suggestive of central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disease and/or diagnosis of central demyelinating disease. 13. Subject has history of cancer or lymphoproliferative disease. Allowable exceptions: 1. Successfully treated cutaneous squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma 2.

Subjects will be evaluated for latent TB infection with a PPD or QuantiFERON test and Xray. Subjects with evidence for latent TB will not be enrolled but first assessed according to local guidelines. 16. Subject is known to have immune deficiency, history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or is otherwise severely immunocompromised. 17. Female subject who is pregnant or breastfeeding or considering becoming pregnant during the study or within 150 days after the last dose of study medication. 18.

Subject has a chronic widespread pain syndrome. 21. Subject is considered by the investigator, for any reason, to be an unsuitable candidate for the study. 22. Subject is unwilling to comply with the study protocol. 23. Screening clinical laboratory analyses show any of the following abnormal laboratory results: 1. Aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) &gt; 1.75 times upper limit of normal (ULN). 2. Positive serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). 3. Positive tests for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C serology indicative of current infection. 4. Creatinine levels &gt; 2x the ULN. If creatinine 12 times ULN, check GFR. 5.
