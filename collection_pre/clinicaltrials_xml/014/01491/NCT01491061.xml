	<brief_summary>It has previously been shown that pretreatment with ranolazine 1,000 mg twice daily for 7 days can significantly reduce procedural myocardial injury in elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The investigators tested the hypothesis that twice overnight high-dose ranolazine loading before PCI can reduce the peri-procedural myocardial ischemic damage similarly to long-term pre-treatment with standard doses.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ranolazine Loading to Prevent PCI-induced Myocardial Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Ranolazine is a novel antianginal drug that reduces intracellular sodium and calcium accumulation during ischemia thus limiting ischemic injury. It has previously been shown that pretreatment with ranolazine 1,000 mg twice daily for 7 days can significantly reduce procedural myocardial injury in elective percutaneous coronary intervention. It remains unknown, however, which of these two therapeutic approaches is more effective after PCI. Purpose The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that twice overnight high-dose ranolazine loading before PCI can reduce the peri-procedural myocardial ischemic damage similarly to long-term pre-treatment with standard doses.</detailed_description>
