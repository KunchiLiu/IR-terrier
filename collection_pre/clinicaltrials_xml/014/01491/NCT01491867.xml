	<brief_summary>Continuous intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement with a contact lens sensor may provide more information on the drug-related IOP change than 24-hour IOP measurement with Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continuous Intraocular Pressure (IOP) Measurement and Ability to Detect Treatment Effect</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Participants are washed ot from all glaucoma medication for 6 weeks - one eye per participant is investigated (study eye) - 24-h intraocular pressure (IOP) curve is obtained with Goldmann tonometry and Sensimed contact lens sensor tonometry twice, in 14 days - for Sensimed contact lens curves median values (in arbitrary units), for Goldmann applanation tonometry, mean and SD values are used to characterize the curves, for comparisions % changes are used for the corresponding time periods - treatment (travoprost 0.005% 1/day) is given to all eyes for 3 months 24-h Goldmann and Sensimed IOP curves are repeated - IOP curves are determined in arbitrary units and mmHg, respectively, and compared for reproducibility (untreated phase) and relative (%)change (untreated curve vs. under treatment curve) with both methods, respectively</detailed_description>
