	<brief_summary>The rationale for perioperative red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is based on the observation that anemia is an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality after cardiac operations. However, transfusions have been associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients, and some recent studies have shown worse outcomes, including increased occurrence of renal failure and infection, as well as respiratory, cardiac, and neurological complications, in transfused compared with non transfused patients after cardiac surgery. On the basis of past clinical observations, some authors have suggested that hematocrit should be maintained at around 30% and hemoglobin concentration at 10 g/dL. Recently, however, this hemoglobin threshold has been reconsidered because of recognized risks associated with transfusion and greater appreciation of the importance of individual physiological responses to anemia. In a comparative trial of 428 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft(CABG) surgery, Bracey et al reported that reducing the hemoglobin trigger to 8 g/dL did not adversely affect patient outcomes and resulted in lower costs. An important multicenter Canadian Study by Hebert et al that included a large number of critically ill patients revealed that A restrictive strategy of red-cell transfusion (hemoglobin concentration maintained between 7.0and 9.0g/dL) is at least as effective as and possibly superior to a liberal transfusion (hemoglobin concentration between 10 and 12 g/dL) strategy in critically ill patients, with the possible exception of patients with acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina, in terms of reducing organ dysfunction and mortality. The investigators would like to determine whether a restrictive strategy of red-cell transfusion and a liberal strategy produce equivalent results in orthopedic-oncology patients undergoing surgery.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Consecutive ASA IIII patients, with preoperative hemoglobin 12 gr% or less scheduled for major orthopediconcology surgery (one that is expected to carry moderate to severe blood loss) at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center will be included in the study. Patients will be excluded for any of the following reasons: an age of less than 18 years; inability to receive blood products; pregnancy; emergency procedures; hepatic dysfunction (total bilirubin value higher than 1.5 mg/d); endstage renal disease (receiving chronic dialysis therapy); acute coronary syndrome, active heart or lung disease and refusal to consent.</criteria>
