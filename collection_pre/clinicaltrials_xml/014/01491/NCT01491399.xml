	<criteria>1. Cervical disc disease defined as: intractable radiculopathy and/or myelopathy with at least one of the following items producing symptomatic nerve root and/or spinal cord compression which is documented by diagnostic imaging procedures: herniated disc; osteophyte formation; decreased disc height; thickening of ligamentous tissue; disc degeneration; and/or facet joint degeneration. 2. Has preoperative Neck Disability Index score &gt;= 30; 3. C2C3 disc to C7Tl disc level(s) of involvement. 4. One or two adjacent levels requiring fusion; 5. No previous surgical intervention at the involved fusion level(s); 6. Unresponsive to nonoperative treatment for approximately six weeks or has the presence of progressive symptoms or signs of nerve root or spinal cord compression in face of continued nonoperative management; 7. Age &gt; 18 years at time of surgery; 8. Is female of childbearing potential, who is not pregnant or nursing, and who agrees to not get pregnant for 1 year following surgery; 9. Willingness to comply with study plan and sign the consent form. 1. Has cervical spinal condition requiring surgical treatment other than symptomatic cervical disc disease at the involved level(s). 2. Has been previously diagnosed with osteopenia, osteoporosis, or osteomalacia to a degree that anterior plating would be contraindicated. 3. Has presence of spinal metastases. 4. Has overt or active bacterial infection, either local or systemic. 5. Has fever (temperature &gt; 101°F oral) at the time of surgery. 6. Has a documented titanium alloy allergy or intolerance. 7. Is mentally incompetent. If questionable, obtain psychiatric consult. 8. Is a prisoner. 9. Is an alcohol and/or drug abuser as defined by currently undergoing treatment for alcohol and/or drug usage. 10. Has received drugs which may interfere with bone metabolism within two weeks prior to the planned date of spinal fusion surgery (e.g., steroids or methotrexate), excluding routine perioperative antiinflammatory drugs. 11. Has a history of autoimmune disease (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus or Dermatomyositis). 12. Has a history of exposure to injectable collagen implants. 13. Has a history of hypersensitivity to protein pharmaceuticals (monoclonal antibodies or gamma globulins) or collagen. 14. Has received treatment with an investigational therapy within 28 days prior to implantation surgery or such treatment is planned during the 16 weeks following rhBMP2/ACS implantation. 15. Has received any previous exposure to any/all BMP's of either human or animal extraction. 16. Has a history of allergy to bovine products or a history of anaphylaxis. 17. Has history of endocrine or metabolic disorder known to affect osteogenesis (e.g., Paget's disease, renal osteodystrophy, Ehlers Danlos syndrome, or osteogenesis imperfecta). 18. Has a condition which requires postoperative medications that interfere with fusion, such as steroids, excluding routine perioperative antiinflammatory drugs.</criteria>
