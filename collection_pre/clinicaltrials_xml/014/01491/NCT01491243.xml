	<brief_title>N-GAL Allows Intensive Treatment of Contrast Induced Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Patients who undergo urgent/emergency coronary angiography can not receive any preventive treatment of contrast induced nephropathy. An acute kidney injury is generally detected too late to allow effective intervention in patients who undergo urgent/emergency coronary angiography. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a new biomarker predictive for AKI already shown to be useful for earlier diagnosis of contrast induced nephropathy. Purpose The primary objective of this study is to to test the hypothesis that a NGAL-driven early intensive strategy can reduce the occurrence of contrast induced nephropathy in patients with urgent/emergency coronary angiography</detailed_description>
