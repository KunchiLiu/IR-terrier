	<brief_summary>Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are still associated with high morbidity and mortality, despite several improvements in their management. This may indicate that important pathogenic mechanisms contribute to both stable and unstable atherosclerotic disease mechanisms. Based upon previous research, the investigators believe that providing a block in the damaging inflammatory loop though short term inhibition of Interleukin-6 receptor signalling, could be an attractive therapeutic target in ACS; and of particular interest in patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), a disease often characterized by widespread coronary inflammation with multiple unstable plaques. The investigators hypothesize that a single administration of the anti-Interleukin 6 receptor antagonist Tocilizumab, in patients with NSTEMI, may interrupt the self-perpetuating inflammatory loops which could improve plaque stability, with potential secondary beneficial effects on myocardial damage. This will be investigated in a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study, including a total of 120 patients.</brief_summary>
