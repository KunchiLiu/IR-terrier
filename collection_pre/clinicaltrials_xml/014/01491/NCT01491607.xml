	<brief_summary>The purpose of this Phase 3 clinical trial is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of BioThrax anthrax vaccine in healthy adults following 3 doses of BioThrax. Results of this study will be used to support a post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) indication for BioThrax. This study will be conducted in the United States (U.S.), in 200 healthy male and female volunteer subjects ages 18 to 65 years. The duration of study participation for each individual subject will be approximately 128 days (4.25 months), including a screening period of approximately 28 days followed by 100 days on study.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunogenicity and Safety Study of a Three-Dose BioThrax® Regimen for Post-Exposure Prophylaxis in Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BioThrax® (also called Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed or AVA) is the only FDA-licensed vaccine for the prevention of anthrax infection. This study will evaluate the immunogenicity of the vaccine using a post-exposure vaccination schedule. Correlations will be drawn to immunogenicity and survival data from animal models to demonstrate that BioThrax® can elicit a protective immune response for PEP.</detailed_description>
