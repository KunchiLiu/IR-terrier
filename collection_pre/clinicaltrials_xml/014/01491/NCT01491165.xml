	<brief_summary>Mainstream of current treatment of liver cirrhosis is liver transplantation, but there are high cost, risk and immune rejection and other issues. Umbilical cord mesenchyma stem cell with self-and directed differentiation capacity can effectively rescue experimental liver failure and contribute to liver regeneration, which suggests the feasibility of stem cell transplantation therapy. In this study, the safety and efficacy of umbilical cord mesenchyma stem cell transplantation through interventional procedures in patients liver cirrhosis will be evaluated.</brief_summary>
