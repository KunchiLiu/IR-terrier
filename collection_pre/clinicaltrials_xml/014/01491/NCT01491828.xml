	<brief_title>Study to Determine Results of Vibratory Stimulus on Subject's Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will validate whether an external vibratory stimulus applied to a subject's neck causes head, neck or jaw movement, and provide information regarding the optimum location and variable vibration parameters of vibratory stimulus on a subject's neck to cause head, neck, or jaw movement. The study will also provide information whether the subject experienced or did not experience a change in sleep stage or arousal by vibratory stimulus on a subject's neck. The data gathered from this study will be used for future studies in analyzing whether such vibratory stimulus can serve as a potential treatment for sleep disorders, such as snoring and obstructive sleep apnea.</detailed_description>
