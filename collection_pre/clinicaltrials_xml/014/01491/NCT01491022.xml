	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of AMPYRA on a number of symptoms in Parkinson's disease. AMPYRA is a medication approved by FDA for gait dysfunction in multiple sclerosis. There are multiple studies to suggest that persons with multiple sclerosis benefit from this medication and have major improvements in gait after taking this medication. However, this medication was never studied in Parkinson's disease. This study aims to learn about possible benefits of AMPYRA in Parkinson's disease (PD).</brief_summary>
