	<brief_summary>Postsurgical pain becomes chronic when it lasts more then two months after surgery. A neurogenic or neuropathic pathogenesis is hypothesized for this event that reaches high rates after urologic and gynecologic surgeries. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) binds to mast cells and regulates pro-inflammatory factors release, without adverse events. The investigators assume that perioperative administration of PEA can reduce chronic postsurgical pain incidence of patients undergoing to urologic and gynecologic elective surgery.</brief_summary>
