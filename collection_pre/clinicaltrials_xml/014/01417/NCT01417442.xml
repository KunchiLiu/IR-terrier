	<brief_title>BRAF V600E Mutations In Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common type of thyroid malignancy and BRAF V600E mutation is the most common genetic alteration identified in PTC, ranging from 25 to 80%, with the average rate about 45%. Various studies demonstrated a relationship between BRAF V600E mutation and aggressive characteristics of the cancer, including the worse patient prognosis. But,there are no studies from Turkey regarding this topic. So the investigators will examine BRAF V600E mutation in our patients with PTC and try to assess the role of this mutation in prognosis and further management of the patients.</detailed_description>
