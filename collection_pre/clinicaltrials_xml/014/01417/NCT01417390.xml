	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to compare induction chemotherapy (gemcitabine+cisplatin) plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), in order to confirm the value of induction chemotherapy using gemcitabine and cisplatin in NPC patients.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Neoadjuvant Gemcitabine and Cisplatin in Locoregionally Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients presented with non-keratinizing NPC and stage Ⅲ-Ⅳb T3-4N1M0/TxN2-3M0 are randomly assigned to receive induction chemotherapy (gemcitabine+cisplatin) plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy (investigational arm) or concurrent chemoradiotherapy (control arm). Patients in both arms receive radical Intensity modulated radiation therapy (Trilogy, Varian), and cisplatin (40mg/m2) every weeks for six cycles during radiotherapy. Radiation is delivered to GTV at 70 Gy in 30 fractions, CTV1 at at 60 Gy in 30 fractions and CTV2 at 54 Gy in 30 fractions. Patients in the investigational arm receive gemcitabine (1000mg/m2 on day 1,8) and cisplatin (20mg/m2 on day 1-4) every three weeks for two cycles before the radiotherapy. The primary end point is response rates after radiotherapy, failure-free survival (FFS) and toxic effects and treatment compliance. Secondary end points include overall survival (OS), distant failure-free survival (D-FFS), locoregional failure-free survival (LR-FFS). All efficacy analyses are conducted in the intention-to-treat population; the safety population include only patients who receive their randomly assigned treatment.</detailed_description>
