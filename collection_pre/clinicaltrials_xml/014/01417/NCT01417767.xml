	<brief_title>Efficacy Study of CHG Regimen vs Decitabine to Treat Higher-risk MDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) have a survival rate of 0.4 to 1.2 years as well as a high risk of their disease progressing to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The only treatment with a curative potential is allogeneic stem cell transplantation. However, in the majority of patients, this treatment is not applicable, mainly due to the age of the recipients and comorbid conditions. Low-dose chemotherapy CHG regimen (low-dose cytarabine, homoharringtonine with G-CSF priming)has been used to treat higher-risk MDS in China and achieve high response rate. Hypomethylating agents 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) is nucleoside analogs that covalently bind to the DNA methyltransferases, irreversibly inhibiting their function, leading to the progressive loss of methylation and reversal of gene silencing. The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of CHG regimen to Decitabine in higher-risk MDS.</detailed_description>
