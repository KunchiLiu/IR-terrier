	<brief_title>Renal Sympathetic Modification in Patients With Essential Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertension is a common cardiovascular disease, and is also an important risk factor for heart-brain-renal diseases, with relatively low controlled rate. Traditional pharmacological therapies are used in clinical practice without breakthrough for long time. Previous studies confirmed that sympathetic nerves activity contributed to development and perpetuation of hypertension. Renal ablation for sympathetic modification is a new method which is proved to be effective in decreasing sympathetic nerves activity. We assume that modifying renal sympathetic activity by ablation is effective and safe in treatment of hypertension. This trial is going to recruit 200 patients (Ablation group VS Control group = 1:1) with a follow-up duration of 3 years. Patients in ablation group will receive additional necessary anti-hypertensive medications besides expectant intervention, and patients in control group will receive appropriate anti-hypertensive medications only. We aim to observe the incident of composite cardiovascular events after renal sympathetic modification using THERMOCOOL® catheter in patients with hypertension, and evaluate safety and efficacy of the intervention.</detailed_description>
