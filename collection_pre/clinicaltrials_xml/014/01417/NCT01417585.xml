	<brief_summary>This is a cluster randomized controlled trial in which client-centered rehabilitation of activities of daily living (CADL) will be compared to usual rehabilitation of activities of daily living (UADL) regarding participation in activities of daily living, independence in activities of daily living and life satisfaction during the first year after stroke. In addition use of health services, caregiver burden and significant others' life satisfaction will be studied. Study design, methods and power analysis are based on our previous pilot study. Participating rehabilitation centers in the counties of Stockholm, Uppsala and Gavleborg have been randomized to supply CADL or UADL. Patients are included who are: &lt; 3 months after stroke, dependent in at least two activities of daily living, understand instructions and referred to a participating rehabilitation unit. Data are collected at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. For sufficient power 280 participants will be included. In addition qualitative longitudinal studies will be performed in order to describe how CADL is integrated.</brief_summary>
