	<brief_summary>The aim of this project is to establish whether magnetic resonance (MR) imaging can provide a minimally invasive approach for post-mortem assessment of the fetus, infant and child, with similar detection rates for anomalies and determination of the cause of death. This will be achieved by acquiring a database of whole-body, post-mortem MR images in approximately 400 fetuses, infants and children, over a 3 years period. Images will be acquired on a dedicated 1.5T research MR scanner. MR images will be reported by an expert group of paediatric radiologists, and compared, in a blinded fashion, with reports from conventional autopsy performed by expert perinatal and paediatric pathologists. Importantly, the post-mortem information will be assessed with reference to the needs of the parents, referring clinicians and HM Coroners. The detection of central nervous system abnormalities will be assessed separately. The study will be performed across two sites: A dedicated children's hospital (Great Ormond Street Hospital) and a teaching hospital, with large obstetric, fetal and neonatal departments (University College London Hospital), which are linked academically by University College London. Co-ordination of the project will be managed by a steering committee, which will ensure accurate collation and comparison of the data.</brief_summary>
