	<brief_summary>The objective of this study was to compare the fertilization rate between the combination of Menopur and Bravelle mixed in the same syringe and Menopur alone, both administered subcutaneously (SC), in subjects undergoing Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART). Additionally the study assessed subjects' ability to mix and store the combination of Menopur and Bravelle and to assess safety of the Menopur and Bravelle combination.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Main Infertile premenopausal female subjects Documented history of infertility (eg., unable to conceive for at least 1 year, or 6 months for women ≥36 years of age, or women with bilateral tubal occlusion or absence, or subjects who require donor sperm). Subject's male partner with semen analysis that was at least adequate for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) within 6 months prior to the subjects beginning downregulation with gonadotropinreleasing hormone (GnRH)agonist. Partners with severe male factor requiring invasive or surgical sperm retrieval or donor sperm could have been used. Antimullerian hormone (AMH) &gt; 1 ng/mL and &lt; 3 ng/mL at screening. Eligible for invitro fertilisation (IVF) or ICSI treatment. Main Oocyte donor or embryo recipient; gestational or surrogate carrier Previous IVF or assisted reproductive technology (ART) failure due to a poor response to gonadotropins. Poor response was defined as development of ≤ 2 mature follicles or history of 2 previous failed cycle cancellations prior to oocyte retrieval due to poor response. Inadequate number of oocytes, defined as fewer than 5 oocytes retrieved in previous ART attempts. Subject's male partners with obvious leukospermia (&gt;2 million white blood cells [WBC]/mL) or signs of infection in semen sample within 2 months of the start of subject's pituitary downregulation. If either of these conditions existed, the male was to be treated with antibiotics and retested prior to subject's pituitary downregulation. Undergoing blastomere biopsy and other experimental ART procedures. Body mass index (BMI) of ≤18 and ≥32 kg/m^2</criteria>
