	<brief_summary>Balance control, physical activity and health related quality of life will be assessed before and after a 10 to 12 weeks training program as well as 6 and 12 months thereafter in 200 elderly (&gt;60) with balance problems (100 with osteoporosis, 100 with Parkinson's disease). Osteoporosis subjects will be assigned to 3 groups (balance training, balance training and Nordic walking, or control group) and Parkinson's subjects to 2 groups (balance training or a control group). The training will be progressive and specific incorporating dual task exercises (directly related to an increased risk of falling). Clinical and laboratory gait and balance measures as well as questionnaires will be used to assess physical function and quality of life. An earlier study, investigating this training program in healthy elderly with balance problems showed that the training was well-tolerated and effective, with a significant increase in balance control, physical function and activity. In this study, we expect that an improvement in balance function, physical activity and health related quality of life, which will lead to a decreased number of falls, prevent and/or postpone incidence of a hazardous fall and thereby reduce the burden on the health care system. Our model for functional balance training and outcome methods will expand techniques and tools available to physical therapists and health care scientist treating and evaluating patients with loss of balance function. Elderly receiving therapy with the goal to improve or recuperate physical function and balance will benefit from this project.</brief_summary>

Parkinson's disease: All PD subjects will have a clinical diagnosis of ―idiopathic‖ PD (Hoehn &amp;Yahr scores 23), &gt; 60 years of age and no other existing neuromuscular disorders, including severely flexed posture. In addition, the subjects will have no history suggesting ―atypical‖ PD symptoms. Exclusion criteria's for all subjects are: moderatesevere dementia (MiniMental score &lt;24) respiratory, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal or neurological (except PD) disorders that may interfere with participation in the exercise program</criteria>
