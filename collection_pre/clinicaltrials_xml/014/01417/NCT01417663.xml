	<brief_summary>Healthy but sedentary aging leads to increased morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular disease. This is partly due to the accumulation of Advanced Glycation Endproducts (AGEs) and the stiffening of the myocardium and arteries. New medication has been developed to break these AGE-crosslinks to improve cardiovascular compliance. The positive influence of regular physical activity is well known for cardiovascular disease and aging. Therefore, what is the most effective intervention, physical exercise and/or new medication AGE-crosslink breakers, in improving the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular compliance and improving the endothelial function in healthy sedentary elderly.</brief_summary>
