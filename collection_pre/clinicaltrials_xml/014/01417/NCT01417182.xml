	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in the United States. Through early detection and improved local therapies a large number of men will be cured. The clinical needs include early detection, accurate initial staging and detection of local recurrence or metastases in order to permit application of the most appropriate therapy. Therapeutic monitoring and prognostic assessment are equally important. Imaging can play an important and crucial role in meeting these clinical needs. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has gained an important role in the clinical management of cancer patients. 18F-DCFBC is a novel low molecular weight prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-based radiopharmaceutical which is radiolabeled with a fluorine-18 positron emitter for PET imaging. Preclinical mouse prostate cancer tumor model imaging studies of 18F-DCFBC demonstrate high specific uptake in PSMA expressing prostate cancer cells. The investigators will assess the hypothesis that 18F-DCFBC, a new positron emission tomography (PET) radiopharmaceutical may possess pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that will represent an advance in imaging prostate cancer. This initial phase I study will determine the biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and prostate specific tumor uptake in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.</brief_summary>

PSA ≥ 1.0 ng/mL 5. Can be on androgen deprivation therapy if dose is stable for ≥ 1 week. 6. Platelet count &gt; 50,000/mm3 7. Neutrophil count &gt; 1,000/mm3 8. Patient is judged by the Investigator to have the initiative and means to be compliant with the protocol and be within geographical proximity to make the required study visits. 9. Patients or their legal representatives must have the ability to read, understand and provide written informed consent for the initiation of any study related procedures. Patients will be excluded from enrollment if any of the following apply: 1. Karnovsky performance status of &lt; 60 2.

Patient received a permanent prostate brachytherapy implant within the last 3 months (for Pd103 implants) or 12 months (for I125 implants) 4. Administered a radioisotope within 5 physical halflives prior to study enrollment 5. Serum creatinine &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal 6. Total bilirubin &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal 7. Liver Transaminases &gt; 5times the upper limit of normal 8. Patient has been treated with an investigational drug, investigational biologic, or investigational therapeutic device within 30 days prior to study radiotracer administration 9. Prior radiation therapy or chemotherapy within 2 weeks prior to study radiotracer administration (Washout is one halflife of the drug or 2 weeks, whichever is longest). 10. Prior history of any other malignancy within 3 years, other than skin basal cell carcinoma.</criteria>
