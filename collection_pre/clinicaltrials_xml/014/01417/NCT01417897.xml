	<brief_summary>The planned HERMES study is to investigate and compare the effects of Insulin Glulisine, Insulin Aspart and regular human insulin on postprandial nitrotyrosine concentrations and several clinical and laboratory markers of postprandial endothelial cell function, sub-clinical inflammation and cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 DM. The primary parameter in this study are the postprandial changes in the nitrotyrosine concentrations, a biomarker for oxidative stress. As vascular data on Insulin Glulisine vs. Insulin Aspart are missing, it is not possible to calculate sample size and statistical power. Therefore the goal of the HERMES-Pilot-Study is to generate preliminary data for statistical considerations and estimations on the probability of success of HERMES.</brief_summary>
