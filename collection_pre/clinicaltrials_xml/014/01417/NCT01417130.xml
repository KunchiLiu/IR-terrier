	<brief_title>Follow-up Study of the Alzheimer's Disease Anti-Inflammatory Prevention Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ADAPT was a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial designed to test the safety and efficacy of naproxen and celecoxib for the primary prevention of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) dementia and for attenuation of age related cognitive decline in persons over 70 years of age. The ADAPT treatments were stopped on 17 December, 2004, after the substantial majority of participants had been given treatments over an interval of one to three years. Participants remained under observation until May, 2006, using double-masked methods of case identification that were identical to those of the original ADAPT protocol. Results from the entire period of observations in ADAPT were ambiguous and suggested a need for additional longitudinal data to learn whether the dual-inhibitor NSAID naproxen can effect a long-term reduction in the occurrence of AD dementia. This ADAPT Follow-up Study (ADAPT-FS) is following-up the participants originally enrolled in ADAPT after a further interval of four years, thereby identifying additional individuals with AD dementia in each treatment assignment group, and then using time-dependent methods to estimate and contrast incidence rates by treatment assignment. The study is also extending prior observations on trajectory of cognitive performance on several psychometric measures, thus testing the hypothesis of differences in such trajectory by treatment assignment in ADAPT. ADAPT-FS is sponsored by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and is being conducted at the Roskamp Institute in Tampa, FL; the Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System in Seattle, WA; Boston University School of Medicine, in Boston, MA; the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, in Baltimore, MD; Sun Health Research Institute, in Phoenix, AZ; and the University of Rochester, in Rochester, NY.</detailed_description>
