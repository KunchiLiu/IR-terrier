	<brief_summary>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) encompasses two major forms of chronic intestinal disorders, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC). Diagnosis is based on several macroscopic and histologic features including patterns of inflammation, crypt abscesses and granulomas. i-Scan use an endoscopic image from the video processor and reconstruct virtual images in real time, resulting in an improved contrast of the capillary patterns and enhancement of the mucosal surface (so called virtual chromoendoscopy). The main objective of this study is to determine endoscopic features of mucosal healing in patients with IBD and to compare these features to clinical and histological data in order to establish a new endoscopic classification of mucosal healing and to evaluate mucosal healing as a parameter of remission and relapse.</brief_summary>
