	<brief_summary>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) encompasses two major forms of chronic intestinal disorders, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC). Diagnosis is based on several macroscopic and histologic features including patterns of inflammation, crypt abscesses and granulomas. Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is rapidly emerging as a valuable tool for gastrointestinal endoscopic imaging, enabling the endoscopist to obtain an "optical biopsy" of the gastrointestinal mucosa during the endoscopic procedure. The main objective of this study is to determine endomicroscopic features of mucosal healing in patients with IBD.</brief_summary>
