	<brief_summary>Background: - Hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM) is a disease that causes walking difficulties and increasing muscle weakness. It usually develops in young adults (between 20 and 30 years of age), and affects arm and leg muscles. HIBM is caused by mutations in a gene that may affect how the muscles function. Researchers want to learn more about the causes, symptoms, and effects of HIBM. Objectives: - To collect genetic and medical information from people with hereditary inclusion body myopathy. Eligibility: - Individuals between 18 and 80 years of age who have hereditary inclusion body myopathy and do not use a wheelchair. - Participants must be willing to stop any current treatment of HIBM while enrolled in the study. Design: - Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and neurological exam. - At the first visit, participants will have the following tests: - Questionnaires about the impact of HIBM on daily activities, mood, and quality of life - 24-hour urine collection - Blood samples - Heart function tests - Muscle strength and endurance tests, including walking - Imaging study of the muscles - Participants will return for followup visits at 6, 12, and 18 months. They may be asked to return for a final visit at 24 months. Not all tests will be performed at each visit. - Treatment will not be provided as part of this protocol.

	<brief_title>A Natural History Study of Patients With GNE Myopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GNE myopathy, also known as Hereditary Inclusion Body Myopathy (HIBM) is an autosomal recessive myopathy with onset in early adulthood characterized by progressive muscle weakness. The causative gene, GNE, codes for the bifunctional enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) that catalyzes the first two steps in the biosynthesis of sialic acid (SA). The subsequent paucity of SA production is presumed to cause decreased sialylation of GNE myopathy muscle glycoproteins, resulting in muscle deterioration. To date, the amount of prospectively collected and published natural history data on GNE myopathy has been minimal due to the rare nature of this disease. This natural history study seeks to further characterize the rate of progression of the disease and how it relates to age of onset. Additionally, the study is designed to elucidate functional outcome measures (endpoints) for future therapeutic trials, and correlate serum biomarkers and muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings to progression of the disease.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Age 1880 years, either gender, inclusive. 2. Diagnosis of GNE myopathy based upon: 1. Consistent clinical course, family history of GNE myopathy or characteristic findings on muscle biopsy, and 2. Identification of two GNE gene mutations. Molecular confirmation of the diagnosis will be obtained for all subjects in the study. 3. Subjects may be taking ManNAc at the time of their enrollment, but must be willing to stop treatment with ManNAc, sialic acid (SA), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and/or other supplements containing SA (e.g., St John s wort, sialyllactose) after the screening assessment and must be willing to remain off treatment for the duration of the study. 4. Ability to travel to the NIH Clinical Center repeatedly for admissions. 5. Subjects that are a carrier family member or a caregiver of a patient on the study are eligible to participate. 6. Must be able to provide informed consent. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Inability to travel to the NIH Clinical Center for repeated evaluations. 2. Psychiatric illness or other diseases that would interfere with the subject s ability to comply with the requirements of this protocol. 3. Hepatic laboratory parameters (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], gammaGTP) or renal laboratory parameters (creatinine, blood urea nitrogen [BUN]) greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal. 4. Presence of clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, hematological, metabolic, or gastrointestinal disease not related to the primary disease process.</criteria>
