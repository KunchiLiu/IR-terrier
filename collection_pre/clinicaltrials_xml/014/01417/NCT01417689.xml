	<brief_summary>Eye drop instillation is a problem from glaucoma patients. Studies reveal that 30-50% of glaucoma patients have problems instilling their eyedrops. These problems include not hitting the eye, spending many drops to get a single successful instillation and bottle contamination. The present study will evaluate the effect of encouraging patients to put their eyedrops using one of 2 techniques, randomly assigned, to determine which is more successful at instilling the eye drop into the eye while spending the least amount of drug. In one of the techniques the patient instills the eye drop with their eyes open in the inferior cul de sac. In the other technique the patient instills the eye drop with the eyes closed near the inner canthal region. Patients will be randomized to encouragement to use the drops with either of the techniques. Encouragement will take place over a visit where they will be subjected to: - Baseline evaluation of eye drop instillation using their usual technique. - Short (2-5 minute) educational session session for the assigned technique. - Followup evaluation immediately after the educational session.</brief_summary>
