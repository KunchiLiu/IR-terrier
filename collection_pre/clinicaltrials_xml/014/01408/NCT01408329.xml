	<brief_summary>Cyclic Variation in Altitude Conditioning (CVAC) is a new technique that uses a pod-like device to expose users to controlled fluctuations in air pressure. It is designed to promote quicker altitude acclimatization, thus promoting improvements in exercise capacity at altitude and, possibly, at sea level. However, over the past few years, anecdotal stories from users of the device suggest that the CVAC treatments might be causing changes beyond the expected endurance exercise performance benefits. Therefore, the purpose of the study is to obtain data on some of the previous anecdotal claims regarding the device (e.g. increases in strength, improved glucose tolerance, reduction of neuropathic pain and decreased joint swelling) as well as to obtain broad questionnaire data in order to identify more specific variables to investigate in future studies.</brief_summary>
