	<brief_summary>This clinical trial studies etoposide, filgrastim and plerixafor in improving stem cell mobilization in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Giving colony-stimulating factors, such as filgrastim, and plerixafor and etoposide together helps stem cells move from the patient's bone marrow to the blood so they can be collected and stored.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Etoposide, Filgrastim, and Plerixafor in Improving Stem Cell Mobilization in Treating Patients With Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether the addition of plerixafor improves the proportion of patients with lymphoma who collect &gt;= 8 x 10^6 cluster of differentiation (CD)34+ cells/kg within two days by 25% compared to the historical estimate of 42% with etoposide and G-CSF (filgrastim). II. To determine whether patients achieving collection of &gt;= 8 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg have a 15% one year survival advantage relative to the historical estimate of 68% among patients mobilizing &gt;= 2 but &lt; 8 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg with etoposide and G-CSF. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To demonstrate that patients receiving &gt;= 8 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg have more rapid neutrophil and platelet recovery and earlier hospital discharge than those receiving &lt; 8 x 10^6 CD 34+ cells/kg. II. To compare overall survival and progression-free survival between patients receiving &gt;= 8 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg and those receiving &lt; 8 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg. III. To compare number of days of apheresis required to achieve goal, transfusion requirements, hospitalization costs, need for remobilization between groups. IV. To evaluate whether peripheral CD34+ cell count correlates with graft content of CD34+ cells. OUTLINE: Patients receive etoposide intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on day 0, filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) once daily (QD) beginning day 1, and plerixafor SC 15-18 hours prior to apheresis. Patients unable to achieve target collection of &gt;= 8 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg receive another dose of plerixafor followed by apheresis. Following the second apheresis, patients achieving =&lt; 2 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg may continue filgrastim with plerixafor and continue collection according to the attending physician. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days and then for at least 1 year.</detailed_description>
