	<brief_summary>Alcohol abuse and dependence (alcohol use disorders, AUDs) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are both prevalent in Veterans. Treating AUDs in Veterans with PTSD may be more difficult than treating AUDs in the general population. The FDA-approved medication topiramate has been shown to improve drinking outcomes in people with AUDs. Topiramate has also improved symptoms in people with PTSD. This study is designed to investigate whether topiramate will improve drinking outcomes in Veterans with PTSD.</brief_summary>
