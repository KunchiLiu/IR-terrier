	<brief_title>Timolol Option for Ulcerated Hemangiomas (TOUCH Trial)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ulceration is the most common complication associated with infantile hemangiomas. Ulceration and the delay in wound healing places patients at risk for infection, bleeding, pain and permanent scarring. Currently, the care of ulcerated hemangiomas is extremely difficult and patients are often subject to multiple treatment modalities. In the past two years, the leading advance in the treatment of hemangiomas has been the use of the non-selective, oral beta-blocker propranolol to arrest growth and promote involution of hemangiomas. Recent literature also suggests beta-blockers may have a role in helping ulcerated wounds re-epithelialize. The use of a topical non-selective beta-blocker on isolated ulcerated hemangiomas may promote early healing and reduce the number of complications associated with ulceration. Investigation is needed to explore the safety and tolerability of applying a topical beta-blocker on an ulcerated hemangioma and whether topical beta-blockade may be more efficacious than conservative care with topical antibiotics. In this study, infants will be randomized to either receive a topical antibiotic (topical mupirocin 2% ointment twice per day) or a topical beta-blocker (Timolol 0.5% Gel Forming Solution) according to a dose-escalation schedule. Subjects will be seen in clinic on day 7, day 14, 1 month and 2 months into therapy and 1 month after therapy is completed. Photographs and safety and efficacy measurements will be taken at each visit to assess response to therapy.</detailed_description>
