	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to find out whether swallowing has an effect on the degree of urinary urgency and on the amplitude of detrusor contraction during filling cystometry in patients with detrusor overactivity (DO).</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>"Swallow my Urine Back" : Inhibition of Detrusor Overactivity by Swallowing Maneuver</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Consecutive patients with DO will be included in this study. During urodynamics, the amplitude of the waves of DO will be documented and compared. At the beginning of the 2nd wave, patients will be asked to perform 5 repetitive swallows. Following each wave, patients will be asked to grade the severity of the urgency by a visual analogue scale (VAS).</detailed_description>
