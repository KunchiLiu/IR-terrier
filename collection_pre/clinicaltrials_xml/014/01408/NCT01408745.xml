	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to establish if the SternumFix System improves sternal closure. The study should test the hypothesis that in a high risk patient population with increased risk for the development of sternal wound complications SternumFix will reduce the incidence of sternal healing complications. The control group will be treated with wire cerclage, the standard method of sternal closure.</brief_summary>
