	<detailed_description>This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and efficacy of MRC375 at 75 mg or 150 mg with matching placebo (taken tid with meal or light snack) in patients with moderate to severe RA. Patients will be randomized to one of the following study arms for 24 weeks: - Treatment 1, Placebo: 2 tablets taken tid - Treatment 2, MRC375: 1 tablet of 75 mg tetracycline HCL plus 1 matching placebo tablet taken tid.
