	<brief_summary>In this study will be examined whether alternating treatment between two classes of drugs (TKI's and m-TOR inhibitors) postpones or prevents drug resistance in patients with renal cancer.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rotating Pazopanib and Everolimus to Avoid Resistance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current practice is to treat with VEGFR-TKI or mTOR inhibitors until progression and then continue with the next active agent. From a biological perspective, TKI's will most likely activate compensatory pathways which, may ultimately lead to the development of resistance. Recent studies suggest that resistance to treatment with TKI may be reversible after stopping treatment. There is therefore a rationale to alternate treatment to prevent or delay the occurrence of resistance. Our hypothesis is that alternating active agents in clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC) may reduce side effects, improve tolerability and compliance of treatment and prolong progression free survival and overall survival compared to the standard of care.</detailed_description>
