	<brief_title>Plasma Exchange for Renal Vasculitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary systemic vasculitis associated with autoantibodies to neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens (ANCA), is the most frequent cause of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Renal failure at presentation often progresses to end stage renal disease despite immunosuppressive therapy. We investigated whether the addition of plasma exchange was more effective than intravenous (IV) methyl prednisolone in the achievement of renal recovery for ANCA associated systemic vasculitis presenting with a serum creatinine above 500umol/l (5.8mg/dl). 137 patients with a new diagnosis of ANCA associated systemic vasculitis, serum creatinine above 500umol/l (5.8mg/dl) and a renal biopsy demonstrating a focal, necrotizing glomerulonephritis were randomized to receive seven plasma exchanges or IV methyl prednisolone 1000mg/day for three days. Both groups were treated with cyclophosphamide and oral prednisolone. The primary end-point was dialysis independence with a serum creatinine below 500umol/l (5.8mg/dl) at three months. Secondary end-points included renal and patient survival at 12 months and severe adverse event rates.</detailed_description>
