	<brief_summary>To demonstrate that ablation with the Therapy™ Cool Flex™ Irrigated Ablation System is effective in the treatment of typical atrial flutter (cavo-tricuspid dependent) and that its use does not result in an unacceptable risk of intra-procedural, serious cardiac adverse events.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation of Therapy™ Cool Flex™ Irrigated Ablation System for the Treatment of Typical Atrial Flutter</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a prospective, multi-center and non-randomized study. All treated patients will receive ablation therapy for typical atrial flutter using the TherapyTM Cool FlexTM Irrigated Ablation System. Historical data from combined published (PMA P060019 Cool Path) and reported (IDE G090109 Cool Path Duo) Atrial Flutter studies will be used to determine performance goals for study endpoints.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A signed written Informed Consent Presence of typical atrial flutter (cavotricuspid isthmus dependent) If subjects are receiving antiarrhythmic drug therapy (Class I or Class III AAD) for an arrhythmia other than typical atrial flutter, then the subject needs to be controlled on their medication for at least 3 months. If the subject had typical atrial flutter before starting the AAD(s) (Class I or Class III) and then subsequently had another arrhythmia (i.e. atrial fibrillation), then the 3 month AAD criteria will not apply One documented occurrence of the study arrhythmia documented by ECG, Holter, telemetry strip, or transtelephonic monitor within the past 6 months In good physical health 18 years of age or older Agree to comply with followup visits and evaluation Prior typical atrial flutter ablation treatment Pregnancy Atypical flutter or scar flutter (non isthmus dependent) Significant coronary heart disease or heart failure; that is unstable angina pectoris and/or uncontrolled congestive heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV) at the time of enrollment A recent myocardial infarction within 3 months of the intended procedure date Permanent coronary sinus pacing lead Clinically significant Tricuspid valvular disease requiring surgery and/or a prosthetic tricuspid heart valve Evidence of intracardiac thrombus or a history of clotting disorders Participation in another investigational study Cardiac surgery within 1 month prior to the intended procedure date Allergy or contraindication to Heparin</criteria>
