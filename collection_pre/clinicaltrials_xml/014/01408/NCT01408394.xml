	<brief_summary>Ecopipam hydrochloride (HCl) is an investigational drug being studied for several possible diseases. To date, all clinical studies have been done using the ecopipam immediate release (IR) tablet. However, a controlled release (CR) capsule formulation of ecopipam has been produced that may be able to improve its effectiveness and reduce its side effects. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ecopipam CR capsules when given as single oral dose in healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ecopipam hydrochloride (HCl) is an investigational drug being studied for several possible diseases. To date, all clinical studies have been done using the ecopipam immediate release (IR) tablet. However, a controlled release (CR) capsule formulation of ecopipam has been produced that may be able to improve its effectiveness and reduce its side effects. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ecopipam CR capsules when given as single oral dose in healthy volunteers. Another purpose of the study is to measure how much CR and IR ecopipam gets into the blood stream, and how long the body takes to get rid of them. Information about any side effects that may occur will be collected.</detailed_description>
