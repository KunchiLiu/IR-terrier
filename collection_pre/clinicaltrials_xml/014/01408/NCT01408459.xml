	<brief_summary>The purposes of this study are to explore the dynamics of adherence, using a simple whole food intervention strategy, both prior to and during the intervention period and to identify nutrient shifts in self-selected diets and to determine health risks (blood pressure, hyperlipidemia, and body weight) that may have resulted from increased tomato product consumption.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adherence Dynamics for Whole Food Interventions in African-American Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>African-American (AA) men suffer the greatest proportion of health disparities of any studied category and adherence to advice among this group has been vastly understudied. Although there are several ongoing trials for behavioral change, either of diet or lifestyle, enrollment rates of AA men (&lt; 25%) often provide insufficient numbers to evaluate adherence issues separately. Tomatoes, more than lycopene alone, may have beneficial effects on prostate health, including BPH and prostate cancer. Efficacy trials would require long-term adherence to high levels of tomato product (TP) consumption.</detailed_description>
