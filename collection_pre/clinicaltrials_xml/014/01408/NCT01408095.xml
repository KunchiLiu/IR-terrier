	<brief_summary>The study is designed to see if once daily oral dosing of LY2608204 will help control diabetes as measured by the glycosylated fraction of hemoglobin A (HbA1c) level. It will also help to determine the safety of the medication and the most useful doses of the medication.</brief_summary>

Have poorly controlled hypertension, history of malignant hypertension, evidence of renal artery stenosis and/or evidence of labile blood pressure including symptomatic postural hypotension. Doses of antihypertensive medications must be stable for 30 days before randomization Have a QTcB (Bazett'scorrected QT interval) interval greater than 450 msec for men or greater than 470 for women at Screening or any personal history of ventricular tachycardia or unexplained syncope Have obvious clinical signs or symptoms of liver disease, acute or chronic hepatitis, or significantly elevated liver blood tests Are currently receiving renal dialysis, have a serum creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dL (177 Î¼mol/L) or a calculated creatinine clearance of less than 60 ml/min or in patients being treated with metformin, have other known contradictions to metformin use including, but not limited to, a serum creatinine above (or creatinine clearance below) what is approved in the metformin product label Have fasting state hypertriglyceridemia (defined as greater than 5.65 mmol/L, 500 mg/dl) at Screening. If taking lipidlowering agents, doses of these medications must be stable for 30 days prior to randomization.
