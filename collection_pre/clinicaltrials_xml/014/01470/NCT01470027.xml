	<brief_summary>The overall objective of this developmental/exploratory study is to use noninvasive proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) to determine (a) whether levels of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) are decreased in vivo, as has been found in postmortem brain, in the brain of 30 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) compared to matched controls; (b) whether GSH levels in PD brain increase significantly following 30 days of daily supplementation with 1800mg or 3600mg of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) compared to placebo and to baseline, and (c) whether any such increases in brain GSH would be dose-dependent and be associated with a change in the participants' oxidative stress profiles. In addition, a clinical assessment battery, including quantitative tests of motor function, will be performed to investigate potential associations between the NAC intervention, brain GSH levels, oxidative stress markers, and clinical presentation. If successful, this study will represent the first objective documentation of whether there is a GSH deficit in living PD brain that dietary NAC supplementation can mitigate, thereby providing a compelling justification for investigating such neuroprotective strategies in larger controlled clinical trials.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Multiple lines of preclinical, animal model, genetic and postmortem evidence have implicated oxidative stress in the chain of pathogenic events that lead to the progressive degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons found in Parkinson's disease (PD) - the hallmark of the disorder. These include evidence of membrane lipid peroxidation seen in increased levels of 8-iso-prostaglandin-F2a-isoprostanes (F2-isoprostanes) (Seet et al 2010), protein peroxidation in the form of nitration and nitrosylation of a-synuclein and parkin (Giasson et al 2000; Chung et al 2004; Yao et al 2004), and oxidative DNA damage measured as increased 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8OH'2dg) (Alam et al 1997; Seet et al 2010; Nakabeppu et al 2007). Importantly, replicated studies in postmortem PD brain by independent laboratories (Sofic et al 1992; Jenner 1992 et al; Riederer et al 1989; Sian et al 1994) have consistently found losses of up to 40% of nigral glutathione (GSH), the most abundant antioxidant in living tissue, suggesting that oxidative stress in PD may be the result of decreased intracellular antioxidant capacity (Bains and Shaw 1997). Therefore, there is currently great interest in neuroprotective treatment strategies aimed at maintaining, restoring and/or elevating intracellular GSH levels (Zeevalk 2008). However, GSH does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier or the membranes of most cells, including neurons, so that direct dietary supplementation of the antioxidant has not proved viable in increasing its intracellular concentration (Zeevalk 2008). On the other hand, since the bioavailability of cysteine, which does cross both the blood-brain barrier and most cell membranes, is rate-limiting in the GSH synthesis pathway, this amino acid and its non-toxic derivatives, such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC), are being investigated as potential precursors that can be supplied through dietary means to spur in situ synthesis and intracellular elevation of brain GSH (Zeevalk 2008). In support of the potential validity of this strategy, two recent studies in schizophrenia (Berk et al 2008b; Bulut et al 2009) and one in bipolar disorder (Berk et al 2008c) - disorders in which oxidative stress is postulated to play pathogenic role -- reported symptom amelioration following treatment with NAC. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study to date has measured in vivo human brain GSH in PD to confirm the up to 40% deficit in the antioxidant that has been found in postmortem brain, and to ascertain that NAC supplementation leads to elevation of brain GSH in situ. The overall objective of this R21 proposal is, therefore, to address this void or gap in knowledge by pursuing the following aims: Specific Aim 1: To directly measure, using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS), in vivo brain GSH in 30 unmedicated patients with idiopathic PD and in 30 sex- and age-matched healthy controls prior to and following 4 weeks supplementation with either placebo, 2000mg/day or 4000 mg/day of NAC. Hypothesis 1: (a) Baseline brain GSH levels will be significantly lower in the patients with PD than in the matched healthy control subjects. (b) Brain levels of GSH will increase significantly compared to baseline in all treated groups following 4 weeks of NAC supplementation. However, elevations of the antioxidant will be dose-dependent and largest in subjects with the largest deficit at baseline. Specific Aim 2: To measure a number of established markers of oxidative stress (Dalle-Donne et al 2006) in temporally concordant CSF samples obtained from all participants, at baseline and following 4 weeks of NAC supplementation. Hypothesis 2: (a) Four weeks of NAC supplementation will improve the oxidative stress profile in all subjects, with the larger improvement occurring in subjects with the largest baseline GSH deficit. (b) Because GSH does not cross the blood-brain barrier, its levels in CSF will better correlate with brain levels measured by 1H MRS than would blood levels, and provide a more accurate assessment of antioxidant capacity and oxidative stress in the CNS. Significance: Achievement of these aims will provide the first objective in vivo documentation of the reported postmortem brain GSH deficits and oxidative stress in PD, and whether NAC supplementation increases brain levels of the antioxidant in situ, thereby providing a compelling justification for larger placebo-controlled, randomized trials of NAC as a neuroprotective therapy. This proposal qualifies as "high-risk, high-reward" since it tackles a significant scientific and therapeutic roadblock that, if overcome, could open a new avenue for PD therapy development.</detailed_description>
