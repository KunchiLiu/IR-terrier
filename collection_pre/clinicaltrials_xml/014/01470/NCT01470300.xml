	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research is to investigate how using different methods to reduce the energy density of entrees affects daily energy intake in adults. It is hypothesized that reducing the energy density of entrees will decrease energy intake. It is also hypothesized that reducing the energy density by incorporating fruit and vegetables will decrease energy intake more than reducing the energy density by decreasing fat content or adding plain water.</brief_summary>
