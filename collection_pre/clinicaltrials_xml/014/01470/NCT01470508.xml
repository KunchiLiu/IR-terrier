	<brief_title>Engaging Latino Families in Eating Disorders Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research on culturally sensitive assessment and treatment of eating disorders among Latinos is scarce. This study is comparing individual Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) versus CBT with a family adjunctive intervention for eating disorders in Latina adults. All treatment will be conducted by trained professionals from either the UNC Eating Disorders Program (in Chapel Hill) or from El Futuro, Inc. (in Carrboro or Durham, NC) who have been trained in the treatment of eating disorders. Participants will participate in 25, 50 minute-long, face-to-face CBT sessions over 27 weeks. Participants will be randomly placed in one of two groups: CBT or CBT with family enhancement. Those participants who are randomly placed into the CBT group will participate in 25 individual therapy sessions, 3 sessions with a dietitian, and psychiatry and/or medical assessments as needed. Those participants who have been randomly placed into the CBT with family enhancement group will participate in 19 individual therapy sessions, 6 family therapy sessions, 3 sessions with a dietitian, and psychiatry and/or medical assessments as needed. All participants will also be expected to participate in baseline, week 6 (mid-treatment), end of treatment, and 3-month follow-up assessments.</detailed_description>
