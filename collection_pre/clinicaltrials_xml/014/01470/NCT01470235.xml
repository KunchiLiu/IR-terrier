	<brief_summary>The purpose of this project is to examine whether the risk of developing ovarian cancer is increased in Danish women with congenital missing teeth as a result of their failure to develop (hypodontia). Should this prove to be the case, these women could be offered regular clinical controls and prophylactic removal of their ovaries when menopause enters and the ovaries are no longer functional (producing hormones). If there is a connection between congenital hypodontia and the development of different types of cancer, the investigators will perform a genetic screening in families with increased risk of cancer and hypodontia for changes in relevant genes, based on the current literature. The investigators hereby search for new genes, which in a changed form leads to an increased risk of cancer and thereby enables us to perform genetic screening in risk families.</brief_summary>
