	<brief_summary>This study is a randomized controlled pilot of a work site weight control intervention. The purpose of the pilot is to obtain preliminary data for future NIH submissions. Four work sites were identified through a multistage recruiting process. Work sites were randomized to either the intervention group, which will receive the intervention immediately following randomization or the control group which will receive a shortened intervention over a 1-month period, 6 months after the active intervention sites have completed their program. The intervention will consist of a variety of activities conducted over a 6 month period, that are overseen by a work site-Tufts oversight group, including the following optional elements: For overweight and obese individuals, regular support groups for weight loss and prevention of weight regain. For all work site employees irrespective of weight, handouts and posted informational resources on healthy eating, monthly lunchtime seminars, and food sampling to facilitate healthy eating patterns for prevention of weight gain. Basic online assessments on health and nutrition will be carried out at baseline (week 0) and 24 weeks in all work site employees willing to provide information. More detailed online and in-person assessments will be performed throughout the 24-week study period in the weight loss support group participants (intervention sites) and individuals intending to enroll in the support group (control sites).</brief_summary>
