	<brief_summary>The primary objective is to establish the safety of the CO-rebreathing method for measuring total blood and plasma volume in CAD patients. The working hypothesis is that the CO-rebreathing method is safe in use with coronary artery disease patients and that it does not cause myocardial ischemia or cardiovascular damage.</brief_summary>
