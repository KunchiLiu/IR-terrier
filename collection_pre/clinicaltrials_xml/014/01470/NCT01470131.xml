	<brief_summary>The purpose of the study is to compare the efficacy and safety of masitinib 6 mg/kg/day in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone to placebo in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in the treatment of patients with relapsing multiple myeloma who have received one previous therapy.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 3 Study to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of Masitinib in Patients With Relapse or Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-parallel group, phase 3 study to compare efficacy and safety of masitinib 9 mg/kg/day to placebo in the treatment of patients with relapsing multiple myeloma who received one previous therapy.
