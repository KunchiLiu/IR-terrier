	<brief_summary>The diagnostic criteria for isolated left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy (IVNC) have been well established for echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance, such validation is lacking for computed tomography (CT). Such criteria are of great clinical relevance as a growing number of patients undergo a cardiac CT scan in daily clinical routine. The investigators aim to test the diagnostic accuracy of cardiac CT in distinguishing IVNC from lesser degrees of trabecular layering seen in potential differential diagnoses such as cardiomyopathies and left ventricular hypertrophy or dilation. The investigators hypothesize that echocardiographic diagnosed pathological trabeculation can be distinguished by determining the ratio of non-compacted to compacted myocardium on cardiac CT.</brief_summary>
