	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to measure systemic levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other proteins (e.g. IGF-1) in the systemic circulation of infants with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) following ocular treatment with either intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents or retinal laser photocoagulation. The primary aim is to determine if serum VEGF levels change after treatment.</brief_summary>
