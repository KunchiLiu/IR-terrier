	<brief_summary>The goal of this study is to improve how we estimate survival of people with cancer that has spread to their bone. There have been previous attempts to estimate survival of people with cancer that spread to the bone, but they have not been accurate. This study will try to improve the way we estimate survival in people with cancer that has spread to their bone by looking to see if a physician assessment and a patient assessment of the health status can be blended to give a better estimate of survival than patients or doctors alone.</brief_summary>
