	<brief_summary>This is an exploratory study. No formal hypothesis will be tested. The objectives of this study are to follow Lupus Nephritis patients over a period of 12 months to: - Establish the baseline biomarker characteristics of patients - Determine the variability of biomarker measures over time - Correlate biomarkers with disease phenotype</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Adults between 18 and 80 years of age, inclusive Diagnosis of SLE by ACR criteria and biopsyproven ISN/RPS Class III or IV lupus glomerulonephritis within 2 years Persistently active nephritis defined as proteinuria greater than or equal to 1.0 g/day for 3 months or more, AND at least 1 of the following: Hematuria (greater than or equal to 5 RBC/hpf) on 2 or more urinalyses done greater than or equal to 2 weeks apart antidsDNA positive or antiSmith positive, or low C3 or C4 complement level. (d) Stable immunosuppression consisting of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 13 g/day with/without corticosteroids up to prednisone equivalent of 15 mg/day, or azathioprine 13 mg/kg/day with/without corticosteroids up to prednisone equivalent of 20 mg/day. Stable dose of ACE inhibitor/ARB for 4 weeks prior to study enrollment, unless previously intolerant to or having a contraindication to ACE inhibitors and ARBs If using oral corticosteroids, must be on a stable dose equivalent to less than or equal to 15 mg/day of prednisone for at least 4 weeks prior to study enrollment. If currently not using corticosteroids, the subject must not have received oral corticosteroids for at least 4 weeks prior study enrollment. Clarification of inclusion criteria for controls: Any patient with an idiopathic glomerular disease who does not have lupus nephritis. This includes patients with minimal change disease, membranous nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and IgA nephropathy. Bcell depletion therapy in past 1 yr, or evidence of persistent B cell depletion at the time of screening. Received an investigational drug (including vaccines) or used an investigational medical device within 3 months of study enrollment or within 5 halflives of agent, whichever is longer.</criteria>
