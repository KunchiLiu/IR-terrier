	<brief_summary>Asthma is a chronic inflammatory bronchial disorder with three distinct components: airway hyper-responsiveness (respiratory hypersensitivity), airway inflammation, and intermittent airway obstruction. One of the characteristics of the disease is an inflammatory reaction of the immune system caused by cytokine production. A substantial number of asthma patients do not satisfactorily respond to steroid therapy and consequently have an unmet medical need for novel targeted therapies with improved specificity, tolerability, and compliance. Novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases by targeting early disease-causing mechanisms are a promising approach for the treatment of asthma. The transcription factor GATA-3 plays a key role in mediating the asthmatic immune response and has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for the production of cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13. The active principle hgd40 of the investigational medicinal product SB010 belongs to a new class of antisense oligonucleotide therapeutics, the 10-23 DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) zymes (antisense oligonucleotide). DNAzymes are catalytically active nucleic acids that cleave complementary RNA (ribonucleic acid) molecules. By cleaving GATA-3 mRNA hgd40 reduces specific cytokine production and thereby reduces key features of allergic airway inflammation. DNAzymes are completely generated by chemical synthesis and can be produced under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) controlled conditions. The DNAzymes are not biological drugs, i.e. they are not generated by use of any living organism including cell culture or bacteria. The molecules are highly water-soluble and will be applied as solution directly in their synthesized form. The current study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of increasing single doses of inhaled SB010 in healthy male subjects.</brief_summary>

Positive drug screen. History of previous administration of any registered or investigational oligonucleotidebased drug. History or presence of alcohol or drug abuse. Treatment with any known enzyme inducing or inhibiting agents (e.g., St. John's Wort (Johanniskraut), barbiturates, phenothiazines, cimetidine, ketoconazole, etc.) within 30 days before administration of IMP or during the trial. Use of any medication (including overthecounter medication, herbal products) except allowed concomitant medication within 2 weeks (for biologics: 6 months) before administration of IMP or within &lt;10 times the elimination halflife of the respective drug, or the duration of the pharmacodynamic effect, whatever is longer. Consumption of any enzyme inducing or inhibiting aliments and beverages (e.g., broccoli, Brussels sprout, grapefruit, grapefruit juice, star fruit etc.) within 14 days prior to the IMP administration or during the trial. Consumption of any caffeine or theophyllinecontaining product 48 h before administration of IMP. Consumption of alcohol within 48 h before administration of IMP. Vegetarian diet or other dietary habits, which would preclude the subject's acceptance of standardised meals. Surgery of the gastrointestinal tract except for appendectomy or herniotomy. Planned donation of germ cells, blood, organs, bone marrow during the course of the trial or within 6 months thereafter. Participation in another clinical trial with an investigational drug or device within the last 3 months. For biologics, the minimum exclusion period is at least 6 months or the time of duration of the pharmacodynamic effect or 10 times the halflife of the respective drug whatever is longer before inclusion in this trial. Blood donation within the last 30 days before screening. Lack of ability or willingness to give informed consent. Anticipated nonavailability for trial visits/procedures. Anticipated lack of willingness or inability to cooperate adequately. Vulnerable subjects (e.g., persons kept in detention).</criteria>
