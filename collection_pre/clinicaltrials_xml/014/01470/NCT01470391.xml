	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of the Adductor-Canal-Blockade versus the Femoral Nerve Block on muscle strength, pain and mobilization after total knee arthroplasty. We hypothesize that the Adductor-Canal-Blockade has the same effect on pain and morphine consumption as the Femoral Nerve Block, but without the same reduction in quadriceps muscle strength.</brief_summary>
