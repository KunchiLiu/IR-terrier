	<brief_summary>The primary aim of the study is to investigate whether a goal-directed resuscitation therapy in high-risk patients through cardiac index optimization using the LiDCO Rapid device reduces complications after cardiac surgery. The hypothesis is that there are better outcomes when achieving a cardiac index higher than 3L/min/m2 in those patients with an arterial lactate higher than 1.5 mmol/L.</brief_summary>
