	<brief_summary>Purpose of the study: To retrospectively determine the clinical results in an unselected group of consecutive patients with osteoid osteoma treated by surgery. Materials and Methods: In 150 consecutive patients with clinical and/or radiological evidence for osteoid osteoma at any location, the clinical symptoms and imaging findings (radiographs and computed tomography (CT)) were assessed before and after surgery. There were no exclusion criteria for this study. A good response was defined as disappearance of symptoms that were manifested at presentation and were attributed to osteoid osteoma. Clinical assessment after the procedure was performed prior to discharge; within 2 weeks after the procedure; and at 3, 6, and 12 months follow-up. After 24 months, a postal questionnaire was used for assessment. Radiographic evaluation (radiographs and thin-slice CT) was performed routinely pre-operatively and one year after surgery. In case of persisting or recurring symptoms the follow-up protocol was again performed according to the initial protocol. All patients gave their informed consent both for the surgical intervention as for the use of their patient data in this retrospective study.</brief_summary>
