	<brief_title>A Research Study to Assess if CC-930 is Safe in Treating Subjects With Discoid Lupus Erythematosus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Enrollment will occur in sequential, ascending, dose-sequence design, where a higher CC-930 dose level and longer duration of dosing (cohort) will not be initiated until supportive safety profile is demonstrated in the preceding cohort. There will be 4 cohorts as described here; Cohort 1: 25 mg once daily for 4 weeks Cohort 2: 50 mg once daily for 4 weeks Cohort 3: 100 mg once daily for 6 weeks Cohort 4: 100 mg twice daily for 6 weeks</detailed_description>
