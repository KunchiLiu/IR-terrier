	<brief_summary>Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and is the fourth leading cause of death among people 65 years of age and older. The global prevalence of the disease will increase significantly as the population ages, unless preventative treatments can be identified and marketed. The present study seeks to evaluate AZD3480 (TC-1734) compared to an approved medication (donepezil) shown to improve cognition and function in patients with Alzheimer's disease.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy, Safety, &amp; Tolerability of AZD3480 Patients With Mild to Moderate Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type (AD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a double blind, positive comparator, randomized, multicenter, parallel group study to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of AZD3480 as monotherapy in patients with mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer's type (AD). Approximately 300 subjects will be randomized and divided into 2 cohorts. Actual randomization was 293 subjects.</detailed_description>
