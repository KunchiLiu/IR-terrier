	<brief_summary>An alternative to systemic heparin anticoagulation for HD is citrate dialysate (CD). CD contains a small amount of citric acid rather than acetic acid as the acidifying agent. The use of citrasate may lead to lower heparin requirements in hemodialysis. This is a randomized, double blinded, two-period crossover trial in HD patients to compare the effect of citrasate dialysis (CD) and usual acetic-acid based dialysate (AD) on heparin dose.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect of Citrasate Dialysate on Heparin Dose in Hemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigators will perform a randomized, double-blind, two-period crossover trial in chronic HD patients to compare the effect of citrasate dialysate (CD) and usual acetic-acid based dialysate (AD) on the cumulative intradialytic heparin dose. There is a four week run in phase followed by two weeks of intervention AD or CD followed by the remaining AD or CD intervention. The primary outcome is change in intradialytic heparin dose achieved with citrasate compared with acetate dialysate. Secondary outcomes are the effect of CD compared with AD on systemic anticoagulation, bleeding time after HD, metabolic parameters, dialysis adequacy, inflammation, hemodynamic stability, and intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of the dialyzer clotting score.</detailed_description>
