	<brief_title>Bioabsorbable Versus Durable Polymer Drug Eluting Stent (DES): a Meta-analysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evidence supporting use of bioabsorbable polymer drug eluting stents (BP-DES) is uncertain. Previous studies suggested that BP-DES are at least as effective as durable polymer drug eluting stents (PP-DES). Thus the investigators planned a meta-analysis to compare outcomes of BP-DES versus PP-DES in obstructive coronary artery disease. Medline and Web databases were searched for studies comparing BP-DES and PP-DES for obstructive coronary disease, reporting rates of overall mortality, target lesion revascularization (TLR), myocardial infarction (MI), binary restenosis and late lumen loss (LLL) with a follow-up â‰¥ 6 months. Odds ratios (ORs) will be computed from individual studies and pooled according to a fixed effect (e.g. inverse variance weighting) or random effect model in case of statistical heterogeneity. Given the a priori heterogeneous nature of the observational analyses, separate subgroup analysis of studies with PLA bioabsorbable polymer loaded with biolimus A19 (BP-BES) is prespecified.</detailed_description>
