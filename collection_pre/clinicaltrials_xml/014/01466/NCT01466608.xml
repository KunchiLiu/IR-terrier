	<brief_summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics, lipid lowering effect and lipidomic profiles of 8-weeks rosuvastatin treatment by OATP1B1 genotype in hyperlipidemia patients.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Within 3 weeks prior to the first administration of study drug, volunteers who agreed the participation of this study by their written consent will undergo screening, including physical examination and clinical laboratory test etc, to evaluate whether they are eligible to participate in this study. Study drugs will be administered at about 9 A.M. in the morning of the first drug administration day, after blood collection for evaluation of pharmacokinetics, lipid profiles, metabolomics and urine collection for metabolomic and genetic analyses. Subjects should take the investigational product by themselves every morning for 8 weeks. On the days of 2nd, 4th, 6 and 8th week, blood collection for evaluation of pharmacokinetics, lipid profiles, metabolomics and urine collection for metabolomics will be conducted by visiting the clinical trials center. On the days of 2nd, 4th and 6th week, the study drug will be taken after blood and urine collection.</detailed_description>

Administration of lipid lowering agent within 2 weeks before the first study drug administration. A subject with a history of gastrointestinal disease or surgery (except simple appendectomy or repair of hernia), which could influence the absorption of the study drug. A subject with a history of drug abuse, or a positive urine drug screening test A subject who takes or should take any medication that can influence lipid lowering effects or metabolic profiles of the study drug during the study period. (Investigators judge the washout period of the previously used medication before the administration of the study drug.) A subject who has participated in any other clinical trial within 3 months before the study drug administration. A subject who is judged to be ineligible to participate in the study due to abnormal clinical laboratory results or other reasons by investigators.</criteria>
