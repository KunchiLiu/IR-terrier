	<brief_summary>It is hypothesized that there will be no difference in the breath hydrogen excretion between the 2 different prebiotic formulas.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fermentation Rate of Infant Formula</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study is looking at how a formula with one of two different prebiotic blends may alter the hydrogen level in an infant's exhalations in the hours after feeding. Higher levels for a longer period may signal higher levels of short chain fatty acids and bifidobacteria, both beneficial for gastrointestinal health. The higher levels may be the result of the formula undergoing a slower digestion, producing more fermentation. The study will compare a formula, similar to one currently on the market, with added prebiotics using a special breathing mask designed to be held to the infant's mouth and nose long enough to capture the infant's exhaled breath which will then be tested for Hydrogen content.</detailed_description>
