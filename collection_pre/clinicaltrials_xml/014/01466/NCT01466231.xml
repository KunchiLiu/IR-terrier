Everolimus 10 mg /day/ is administered to the patient until progression, unacceptable toxicity, complete response or inability of the subject to comply with study requirements. Feasibility of surgical resection will be assessed after every 2 cycles of the treatment in patients with partial response.</brief_summary>
