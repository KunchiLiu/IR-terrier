	<brief_summary>Approximately 50% of people diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) will develop problems with cognition. Currently, there are no FDA-approved treatments targeting cognitive function in Multiple Sclerosis. This trial will ascertain whether treatment with an estrogen pill, used in combination with standard MS anti-inflammatory drugs, can improve cognitive testing as compared to treatment with a placebo pill in combination with standard anti-inflammatory drugs in women with MS.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Estriol Treatment in Multiple Sclerosis (MS): Effect on Cognition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 50% of people diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) will develop problems with cognition. Currently, there are no FDA-approved treatments for cognitive function in Multiple Sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis relapses are known to be significantly decreased by approximately 80% during late pregnancy. This disease improvement may be due to estriol, an estrogen unique to pregnancy. Estriol blood levels go from undetectable levels prior to pregnancy, increase during pregnancy and reach highest levels during late pregnancy. Further, estrogen treatment has been shown to have favorable effects on cognition in animal models of other neurological diseases. This proposal will establish whether oral treatment with estriol, induces an improvement in cognitive functioning in subjects with multiple sclerosis when used in combination with the major FDA-approved standard treatments for MS, (Betaseron® (or Extavia®), Rebif®, Avonex®, Copaxone®, Gilenya®, Aubagio®, or Tecfidera®). The combination of standard MS treatment plus estriol pill (8 mg per day) will be compared to standard MS treatment plus placebo in a double-blinded fashion. The duration of treatment will be one year and the primary outcome measure will be cognitive testing processing speed ability. Secondary outcomes will be improvement in other cognitive tests, brain MRIs, cognitive evoked potentials, as well as relapse rates and disability measures (EDSS, 25 foot walk, 9 hole peg test, low contrast visual acuity, MS Quality of Life, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Level of Activity using accelerometry). Safety measures (blood tests and gynecologic evaluations) will also be followed. The overall goal of this study will be the development of an oral treatment, estriol, to improve cognitive function in MS.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis of clinically definite or MacDonald criteria relapsingremitting multiple sclerosis, secondaryprogressive multiple sclerosis or primaryprogressive multiple sclerosis. No relapse within 30 days before day of trial enrollment (month 0 visit). If steroids given for relapse, then the month 0 visit must be 30 days after last steroid dose. Females age 18 to 50, inclusive. Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS) = 0.0 to 6.0. Screening PASAT (3second) score 2550, inclusive. Must be mentally competent enough to comply with study guidelines and give informed consent. Must be willing and able to travel to the study center at frequencies in the protocol for a total period of 12 months. Patients must be on no treatment or be on a stable dose of one of the following agents for a minimum of 3 months duration prior to the month 0 visit: Copaxone®, Betaseron® (or Extavia®), Rebif®, or Avonex®, Gilenya®, Aubagio®, or Tecfidera®. The time spent in the screening period may serve as part of this 3month period. Patients who are currently being treated with ACTH, corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), plasma exchange, Lipitor® or minocycline may be included. If patients plan to start treatment with Copaxone® or an interferon [Betaseron® (or Extavia®), Rebif®, Avonex®] or an oral agent [Gilenya®, Aubagio® or Tecfidera®] and then they must be on for at least 3 months prior to month 0 (as above). Males Subjects on oral contraceptives (OCP), hormone replacement therapy (HRT) other sex hormones during screening and during the 12month study period (Mirena® IUD is permitted). Females who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant during the 12 months of enrollment, who wish to become pregnant within 3 months following completion of the study, or who will be within 6 months post partum at the day of first enrollment visit (month 0). Females who plan to breastfeed after first enrollment visit (month 0). Fertile sexually active women who are unwilling to practice reliable barrier methods of contraception other than oral contraceptives (i.e. condom, diaphragm, IUDs Note: Hormonal IUD [Mirena®] is permitted). Patients with surgical ovariectomy with no hormone replacement for 1 year or more. Menopause with no hormone replacement for 3 years or more prior to the first enrollment visit. Patients who smoke at any time during screening or during the 12 month study period.
