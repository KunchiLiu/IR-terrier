	<detailed_description>Ulcus cruris consists of pathologically changed tissue of the lower leg. Up to 80% are of venous origin. Because of the high prevalence of up to 2% the treatment of Ulcus cruris is of special economical importance. Depending on the size, depth and possible infections, the conventional treatment of these wounds consists of an adequate compression, preparation of the lesion, cover and of appropriate control of infections. All tasks are undertaken in order to faciliate the healing of these chronic wounds. Plasma consists of free ions or electrons and can be created by various techniques. Commonly, it is use in the sterilization of medicinal equipment, the cauterization of tissue and in the field of coagulation. Because of its bactericidal characteristics, the direct interaction of plasma created by temperatures below 40°C on tissue is intensively studied. Both in vitro and in vivo studies proved a significant reduction of bacterial contamination in different test systems. As bacterial contamination might slow down wound healing, plasma treatment might be a useful tool to complement conventional methods in the treatment of chronical wounds.</detailed_description>
