	<brief_summary>This research studies protein in tumor samples from patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Finding specific proteins in tumor tissue samples from patients with cancer may help doctors tell what type of lung cancer a patient has and plan better treatment.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study of Proteins in Tumor Samples From Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To validate a novel 4-protein signature's ability to subtype non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a treatment-naive, multi-institutional cohort, Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9761. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the NSCLC misclassification rate in a multi-institutional clinical-trial setting for stage 1 NSCLC (adenocarcinoma versus squamous cell). OUTLINE: Previously collected tissue samples are analyzed via hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC).</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must have been registered on CALGB9761 Stage I disease Treatmentnaive patients A representative paraffin block of the primary tumor must be available from patients on CALGB9761 and submitted to the CALGB Pathology Coordinating Office A separate consent form is not required for this study, as permission for research to be performed on the tissue blocks is included in the consent form for CALGB 9761 Institutional review board (IRB) review and approval at the institution where the laboratory work will be performed is required</criteria>
