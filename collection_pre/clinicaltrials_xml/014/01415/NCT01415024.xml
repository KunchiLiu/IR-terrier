	<brief_summary>Today patients with a Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) indication usually receive 2 ventricular leads, right ventricular (RV) apex and left ventricular (LV) (postero-) lateral, gaining a responder rate of approximately 70%. However, the physiological agitation of the left ventricle takes place over two pathways. Therefore single point stimulation might be insufficient for a dilated, insufficiently and asynchronously contracting left ventricle, resulting in either insufficient or no response to the therapy. In the "CRT ICD Dual LV" study the patients receive a second LV lead in an anterior vein. When this lead is placed, temporary dual LV stimulation is started. To assess the effectivity of the dual LV lead stimulation intraoperatively a LV dp/dt-pressure measurement is taken. If there is an increase in LV dp/dt, the patients will be stimulated with both leads permanently. If not they will be stimulated conventionally. The patients participating in this study are monitored for 12 months after implantation.</brief_summary>
