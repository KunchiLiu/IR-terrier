	<brief_summary>Background: The investigators have previously documented that patients at nutritional risk lack sufficient energy and protein intake. In 2009 the investigators conducted a non-randomized historically controlled intervention study of 40 patients at nutritional risk. The study indicated that a tailored food concept increased nutritional intake in this patient group. The objective of the current study is therefore to investigate these findings in a randomized clinical trial. Our target is for 75% of patients in the intervention group to reach 75% of their energy and protein requirements. Methods: The study will compare standard nutritional care (control group) with tailored nutritional care (the possibility to order small energy and protein-enriched dishes called "Delights of Herlev Hospital"). 96 patients at nutritional risk, according to the NRS-2002 criteria, will be included in the study.</brief_summary>
