	<brief_summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Others interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as bendamustine hydrochloride, also work in different ways to kill cancer cells or stop them from dividing. Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Lenalidomide may stop the growth of mantle cell lymphoma by blocking blood flow to the cancer. It is not yet known whether giving rituximab together with bendamustine and bortezomib is more effective than rituximab and bendamustine, followed by rituximab alone or with lenalidomide in treating mantle cell lymphoma. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial studies rituximab, bortezomib, bendamustine, and lenalidomide in treating previously untreated older patients with mantle cell lymphoma.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab, Bendamustine Hydrochloride, and Bortezomib Followed by Rituximab and Lenalidomide in Treating Older Patients With Previously Untreated Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES: Primary - To determine whether the addition of bortezomib (RBV) to an induction regimen of rituximab-bendamustine hydrochloride (RB) improves progression-free survival (PFS) compared to RB alone in patients ≥ 60 years of age with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma. - To determine whether the addition of lenalidomide to a consolidation regimen of rituximab following an induction regimen of RB or RBV improves PFS compared to consolidation rituximab alone in this patient population. Secondary - To determine whether the addition of bortezomib to induction therapy improves the positron emission tomography (PET)-documented complete response (CR) rate compared to RB alone. - To determine the objective response rate (ORR) for RB and RBV. - Among patients who do not have PET-documented CR at the end of induction, to determine whether the addition of lenalidomide to consolidation therapy improves CR and ORR compared with rituximab alone. - To determine overall survival (OS) in the treatment arms. - To determine safety, with attention to the addition of bortezomib in the induction regimen and lenalidomide-rituximab (LR) as consolidation therapy. - To collect paraffin-embedded tissue for creation of tissue microarray. - To collect and bank serum and blood mononuclear cells for future studies. - To collect formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue to analyze potential prognostic factors (Ki-67 proliferation index by immunohistochemistry and correlation with proposed 5-gene set of proliferation markers analyzed by RNA PCR; SOX 11 expression by immunohistochemistry; and Micro-RNA levels by microarray). - Using patient-reported outcomes data, to determine the extent and severity of neuropathy associated with the addition of bortezomib to induction treatment. - Using patient-reported outcomes data, to determine the extent and severity of fatigue associated with the addition of lenalidomide to consolidation treatment. - To evaluate the effects of the addition of bortezomib and lenalidomide on patient-reported health-related quality of life. - To evaluate the effects of bortezomib-related neuropathy on patient-reported health-related quality of life. - To evaluate the response of lymphoma-specific symptoms to treatment. - Using longitudinal patient-reported outcomes data, to describe the trajectory of lymphoma symptoms, neuropathy, fatigue, and overall health-related quality of life prior to, during, and following treatment among older adults with MCL. Tertiary - To assess the proportion of patients up and down staging when fludeoxyglucose F 18- (FDG) PET/CT is added to standard Ann Arbor staging. - To assess the ability of pre-treatment FDG-PET/CT (SUVmax) to predict response rate and PFS. - Among patients with interim (post-cycle 3) FDG-PET/CT imaging, to assess the correlation of interim FDG-PET/CT imaging with response rate and PFS both during induction and consolidation therapy. - To assess standard FDG-PET/CT metrics including SUVmax, tumor metabolic burden, total tumor burden, and association with pathology features (blastoid variant vs other, and Ki67) in the setting of MCL. - To assess differences in overall and CR rates when using Deauville vs International Harmonization Project FDG-PET/CT interpretation criteria. - To determine whether there is a correlation between FDG-PET/CT response and residual disease assessment by molecular and/or flow cytometric techniques. - To determine whether the number of malignant cells in circulation predict the number of cells in marrow. - To determine whether the number of malignant cells in circulation/in marrow at the end of induction correlate with CR and 2-year PFS. - To determine whether there is a higher rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity among patients randomized to RBV as compared with RB, and among patients treated with LR maintenance compared with rituximab. - To compare the two methods of MRD detection - molecular techniques and flow cytometry - as prognostic markers for outcome. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to mantle cell lymphoma International Prognostic Index risk score (low vs intermediate vs high). Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms. - Arm A: Patients receive induction therapy comprising rituximab IV on day 1 and bendamustine hydrochloride IV over 60 minutes on days 1-2. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm E: Patients receive consolidation therapy comprising rituximab IV on day 1. Courses repeat every 8 weeks for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm B: Patients receive induction therapy comprising bortezomib IV or subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 and rituximab and bendamustine hydrochloride as patients in arm A. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm F: Patients receive consolidation therapy comprising rituximab IV on day 1. Courses repeat every 8 weeks for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm C: Patients receive induction therapy comprising rituximab and bendamustine hydrochloride as patients in arm A. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm G: Patients receive consolidation therapy comprising lenalidomide orally (PO) daily on days 1-21 every 4 weeks and rituximab IV every 8 weeks for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm D: Patients receive bortezomib, rituximab, and bendamustine hydrochloride as patients in arm B. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. - Arm H: Patients receive consolidation therapy comprising lenalidomide PO daily on days 1-21 every 4 weeks and rituximab IV every 8 weeks for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may undergo blood and bone marrow sample collection at baseline and during treatment for correlative studies. Patients complete the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Lymphoma (FACT-Lym), the FACT/GOG-Neurotoxicity scale (FACT/GOG-Ntx), FACT-Fatigue, and FACT-General questionnaires at baseline and periodically during study and follow up. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 10 years.</detailed_description>
