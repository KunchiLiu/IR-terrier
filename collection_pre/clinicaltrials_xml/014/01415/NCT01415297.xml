	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and maximal tolerated dose of NKP-1339, a ruthenium containing compound administered intravenously on a weekly schedule, in patients with advanced solid tumors. The responses to treatment in this population will be evaluated. In addition, the PD and PK properties of the compound will be explored.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Study of NKP-1339 to Treat Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NKP-1339 is a novel GRP78 targeted ruthenium based anti-cancer compound which is intravenously administered. GRP78 is a key regulator of misfolded protein processing, which is unregulated in cancer cells. In nonclinical anti-tumor studies, NKP-1339 showed activity against many tumor types, including those resistant to platinum and other standard anti-cancer agents. This Phase I trial evaluates the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of NKP-1339.</detailed_description>
