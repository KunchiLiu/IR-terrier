	<brief_title>Efficacy of ATNC05 in Reducing Back Pain Compared With Placebo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Back pain represents one of the most common and chronic physical ailments. In the United States, acute back pain is the fifth most common reason for physician visits. In fact, nine of ten adults experience back pain at some point in their life, and five out of ten working adults report back pain every year. While only a minority of individuals suffering from back pain resort to surgery, there are only limited options for offering relief from chronic back pain. Heat therapy is one option for short term relief, as well as alternative cold compression therapy proximate to the location of pain. Alternative treatments such as massage therapy, acupressure and pressure point massage have also been used. Some pharmaceuticals have shown usefulness in treating back pain, including muscle relaxants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, analgesics and Opioid Agonists. However opioids are limited by side effects such as constipation and sedation, as well as by dependence, tolerance and scheduling issue. NSAIDs avoid some of the liabilities of opioids, yet they also have toxicities which can limit their usefulness. Accordingly, there is a need in the art of treating back pain for an alternative pharmaceutical composition that reduces the symptoms of back pain effectively and for longer periods of time.</detailed_description>
