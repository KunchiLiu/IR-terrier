	<brief_summary>The morbidity associated with scorpion sting intoxication presents an endemic pattern in the country, where there are highly venomous species of scorpions so the scorpion sting intoxication (IPPA) is considered a medical emergency. On the other hand, there is scarce scientific literature from different controlled studies evaluating anti-scorpion serum, considering clinical severity scales, lab results and their safety. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of scorpion sting treatment, using two sera, one produced by Birmex versus Alacramyn Â® (Bioclon).</brief_summary>
