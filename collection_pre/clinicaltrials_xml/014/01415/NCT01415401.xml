	<criteria>Willing to sign an Informed Consent form. Clinical diagnosis of ocular hypertension, exfoliative openangle or pigment dispersion glaucoma in at least one eye (study eye). Be on a stable IOP lowering regimen within 30 days of Screening Visit. IOP considered to be safe, in both eyes, in such a way that should assure clinical stability of vision and the optic nerve throughout the study period. Willing to discontinue the use of COMBIGAN® prior to receiving the study drug at Visit 1. IOP of between 19 and 35 mmHg in at least one eye (which would be the study eye) while on brimonidine/timolol fixed combination therapy. Best corrected visual acuity of 6/60 (20/200 Snellen, 1.0 logMAR) or better in each eye. Willing to follow instructions and able to attend required study visits. Other protocoldefined inclusion criteria may apply. Known history of hypersensitivity to any component of the preparations used in this study. Presence of primary or secondary glaucoma not listed in inclusion criterion #2. History of ocular herpes simplex. Abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry. Corneal dystrophies. Concurrent infectious/noninfectious conjunctivitis, keratitis or uveitis in either eye. Blepharitis or nonclinically significant conjunctival injection is allowed. Intraocular conventional surgery or laser surgery in study eye(s) less than 3 months prior to the Screening Visit. Risk of visual field or visual acuity worsening as a consequence of participation in the study, in the investigator's best judgment. Progressive retinal or optic nerve disease from any cause. Women of childbearing potential not using reliable means of birth control for at least 1 month prior to the Screening/Baseline Visit. Pregnant or lactating. Other protocoldefined exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
