	<brief_summary>The objective of INSTEAD is to compare long-term (5 years) outcomes of endograft prosthesis versus medical management in patients with dissection of the thoracic aorta.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation of Stent-grafts in Aortic Dissection (INSTEAD)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients &gt; 18 years with type B aortic dissection were randomized to either thoracic aortic endoprosthesis (stent-grafting) or antihypertensive management (medical treatment). Only stable patients without spontaneous false lumen thrombosis 14 days after index dissection were considered eligible for study inclusion. Long-term outcome measures included all-cause mortality, aorta-specific mortality and a cluster endpoint (reflecting progression of disease, conversion and additional interventions); the analysis is based on 140 randomized cases followed for at least 5 years.</detailed_description>
