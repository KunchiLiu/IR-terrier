	<brief_summary>The objective of this study is to uncover the prevalence of vulnerability among patients aged ≥ 70 coming to the medical oncology division of the Oscar Lambret Centre, according to the short screening test Vulnerable Elders Survey 13 (VES-13). The objective is to better understand the value of routine screening of patients before the consultation, it was proposed as a secondary objective of this study to assess the correlation between the identification of the vulnerability in the screening test VES-13 and the identification made by the clinician during the consultation. The correlation between VES-13 and opinion of the clinician for three categories of patients (self - intermediate - fragile) will also be studied.</brief_summary>
