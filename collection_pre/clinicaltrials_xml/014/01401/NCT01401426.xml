	<brief_summary>Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy has been shown to significantly reduce weight and has been approved as a treatment of morbid obesity. The standard laparoscopic operation requires five small incisions for the introduction of instruments and the band into the patient's abdomen. The investigators have developed a technique for performing this operation through a single incision at the belly button. This study compares this method to the conventional 5-incision approach.</brief_summary>
