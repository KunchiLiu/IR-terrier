	<brief_title>Feasibility Study Assessing The Ability Of An Insulin Pump-Controlling Algorithm To Minimize Hypoglycemia And Hyperglycemia In Patients With Type 1 Diabetes In A Clinical Research Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study is a non-randomized, uncontrolled feasibility study that looks to enroll people with type 1 diabetes who are currently using an insulin pump. During the subject's participation, the study staff will closely monitor the study subject in a clinical research center environment for approximately 24 hours, while controller algorithm determined insulin doses are delivered by an insulin pump, and utilizing continuous glucose monitoring results. Total subject participation approximately 1 week for screening to completion. This includes approximately 24 hours usage of the investigation device in the clinical research center under close medical supervision.</detailed_description>
