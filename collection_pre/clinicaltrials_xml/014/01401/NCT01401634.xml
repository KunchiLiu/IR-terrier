	<brief_summary>Diabetes and high blood sugar are extremely common among patients presenting to US Emergency Departments. Intravenous fluids with or without insulin are often used to treat these patients. However, simple, low-cost interventions, such oral hydration have not been studied in this context. Oral rehydration may be better than no therapy at all, which is often what these patients receive in the first few hours when presenting to busy, overcrowded Emergency Department (ED) with long wait times, or in resource-poor environments such as developing countries. The investigators propose a study to see if oral hydration for adult patients presenting to the ED with high blood sugar i.e. finger-stick (FS) values between 250 and 500 mg/dL can help lower blood sugar at the same rate as intravenous fluids. Half the patients will be given intravenous fluids per our department protocol, while the other half of the patients will be given 2 liters of water to drink over a 1-hour period. Both groups will have their blood sugar measured every 30 mins for 2 hours. The investigators will analyze the data to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in blood sugar between the two groups within 2 hours.</brief_summary>
