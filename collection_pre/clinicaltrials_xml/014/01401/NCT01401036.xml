	<brief_summary>Drug-eluting stents reduce rates of restenosis and reintervention, as compared with uncoated stents. Data are limited regarding the safety and efficacy of Nobori (Biolimus A9 Eluting Stent) in primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Accordingly, the investigators will compare the outcomes of primary PCI for AMI between patients receiving Nobori versus uncoated stents.</brief_summary>
