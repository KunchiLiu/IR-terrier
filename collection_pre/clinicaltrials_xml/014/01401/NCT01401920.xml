	<brief_summary>The trendelenburg position is usually applied to increase the cross-sectional area of the IJV. However, trendelenburg position requires a tilt table to place the head in the down position. Trendelenburg position could also increase intracranial pressure. Passive leg elevation redistributes more blood from the lower extremity into the central veins and is proved to increase the cross-sectional area of IJV in adults. However, the effect of leg elevation on the cross-sectional area of IJV in small infants and children has not been evaluated. The investigators evaluated the effect of passive leg elevation on the cross-sectional area of IJV in subjects undergoing open heart surgery for congenital anomaly.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Influence of Passive Leg Elevation on the Cross-sectional Area of the Internal Jugular Vein in Infants or Young Children Undergoing Open Heart Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Internal jugular vein (IJV) cannulation is essential for open heart surgery of small infants and children for transfusion or inotropics infusion. The trendelenburg position is usually applied to increase the cross-sectional area of the IJV. However, trendelenburg position requires a tilt table to place the head in the down position. Trendelenburg position could also increase intracranial pressure. Passive leg elevation redistributes more blood from the lower extremity into the central veins and is proved to increase the cross-sectional area of IJV in adults. However, the effect of leg elevation on the cross-sectional area of IJV in small infants and children has not been evaluated. Furthermore, the children undergoing open heart surgery due to cardiac anomaly have an altered hemodynamics and often congested right heart. Therefore, the response of passive leg elevation may be different from that of normal heart physiology. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of passive leg elevation on the cross-sectional area of IJV in subjects undergoing open heart surgery for congenital anomaly.</detailed_description>
