	<brief_title>Evaluation of Safety and Efficacy of Glaucoma Shunt (Aurolab Artificial Drainage Implant) in Refractory Glaucoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aurolab Artificial Drainage Implant is a non resistant tube device based on Baerveldt implant. It reduces intra ocular pressure by draining aqueous from anterior chamber into sub-conjunctival space formed around base of the implant. Reduction of intraocular pressure prevents further damage to optic nerve and functional visual field loss in advanced refractory glaucoma.</detailed_description>
