	<brief_title>Observational Program of Zemplar in Patients With End Stage Chronic Kidney Disease and Parathyroid Disorder on Hemodialysis in the Russian Federation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eighty-six eligible participants with secondary hyperparathyroidism will be enrolled at thirteen sites in Russia. Study drug will be administered per local prescribing guidelines. Planned therapy is six months. Intact Parathyroid Hormone will be measured at the Screening visit. All participants who meet the inclusion criteria and fail to meet the exclusion criteria will be included in the study. Adverse events will be monitored throughout the observation period (and up to 30 days after the last dose of Zemplar). Ability of Zemplar to lower intact Parathyroid Hormone level will be assessed throughout the study. Proportion of participants with the level of intact Parathyroid Hormone 150 - 300 pg/mL was stated as primary endpoint. Calcium and Phosphorus elevation will be also measured throughout the study. The selected population is representative in relation to those who will take Zemplar in routine practice. Participants with contraindications to Zemplar therapy (as per the local label) will not be included in the study.</detailed_description>
