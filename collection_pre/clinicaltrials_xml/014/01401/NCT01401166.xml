	<brief_summary>This randomized, open-label, crossover study will evaluate participants' preference and healthcare professional (HCP) satisfaction with SC versus IV Herceptin administration in HER2-positive early breast cancer. Participants will be randomized to receive either SC Herceptin or IV Herceptin every 3 weeks for Cycles 1 to 4, followed by crossover to the other treatment administration for Cycles 5 to 8. For up to 10 additional cycles (for a total of 18 cycles), participants will receive IV or SC Herceptin every 3 weeks.</brief_summary>
