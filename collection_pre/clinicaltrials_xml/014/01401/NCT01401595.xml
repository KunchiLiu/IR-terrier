	<detailed_description>This proposal explores the implications of our two recent major discoveries: the striking efficacy of the Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) sertraline in the control of the Night Eating Syndrome (NES) and the unprecedented elevation in the level of serotonin transporter (SERT) binding in the midbrain of persons with NES. Our overall theory is that NES is associated with a syndrome-specific increase in SERT derived from a genetic vulnerability which is affected by life stress. This increased SERT activity produces a fall in post-synaptic serotonin levels. The investigators hypothesize that these decreased serotonin levels result in a significant phase delay in circadian food intake manifested by evening hyperphagia, nighttime ingestions and morning anorexia. SSRIs that block this increased SERT activity increase synaptic serotonin levels and restore the circadian rhythm of food intake.</detailed_description>
