	<brief_title>Pancreatic Enzyme Suppletion in Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Weight loss in cancer is caused by primary tumour effects and secondary effects (e.g. side effects of treatment, mechanical and intestinal obstruction). In pancreatic cancer, additional weight loss and malnutrition may be due to the development of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). The presence of EPI in pancreatic cancer is frequently overlooked, because the focus of treatment is directed at possible surgery or chemotherapy and its potential side effects. Although studies have proven that pancreatic enzymes may prevent or decrease weight loss, they are seldom being prescribed.</detailed_description>
