	<brief_title>Antibiotics Study in Preterm Premature Rupture of the Membranes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite major advances in perinatal care, preterm delivery is still the predominant cause of perinatal mortality and a major cause of neurological morbidity and mortality. Although the determinants of preterm labor and delivery are uncertain, evidence suggests intrauterine infection is a contributing factor. Antibiotic therapy for women in preterm premature rupture of membranes has been a routine practice. However the optimal regimen remains unclear and the choice of latency antibiotic regimen is at the discretion of admitting physician. The group 1 is treated only with cefazolin (1.0mg iv every 6 hours for 7 days). The group 2 is given a combination of cefazolin(1.0mg iv every 6 hours for 7 days) and erythromycin(250mg p.o. four times a day for 7 days). In group 3, clarithromycin (500mg p.o. 4 times a day for 7 days) was treated with cefazolin(1.0mg iv every 6 hours for 7 days). This study is designed to compare the efficacy on maternal infection, chorioamnionitis and neonatal morbidity and mortality and to review the evidence and provide recommendations on the use of antibiotics, especially by comparing the combination regimen in PPROM.</detailed_description>
