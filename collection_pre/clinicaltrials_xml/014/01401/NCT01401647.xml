	<brief_title>Amiodarone, Lidocaine or Neither for Out-Of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Due to Ventricular Fibrillation or Tachycardia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective of the trial is to determine if survival to hospital discharge is improved with early therapeutic administration of a new Captisol-Enabled formulation of IV amiodarone (PM101) compared to placebo. The corresponding null hypothesis is that survival to hospital discharge is identically distributed when out-of-hospital VF/VT arrest is treated with PM101 or placebo. The secondary objectives of the trial are to determine if survival to hospital discharge is improved with early therapeutic administration of: 1. Lidocaine compared to placebo 2. PM101 compared to lidocaine The corresponding null hypotheses are that survival to hospital admission is identically distributed when out-of-hospital VF/VT arrest is treated with lidocaine as compared with placebo, and with PM101 as compared with lidocaine.</detailed_description>
