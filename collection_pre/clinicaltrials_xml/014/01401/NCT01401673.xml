	<brief_summary>The investigators hypothesise that cough reflex hypersensitivity, demonstrated in chronic cough patients, is due to a phenomenon known as central sensitisation. Central sensitisation is a hyper-excitability of the sensory nerves as they join the central nervous system, and is believed to be mediated by the N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor[1-3].</brief_summary>
