	<brief_title>GDT by Cardiac Index Trending Via a Radial Arterial Line in General Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a multi-Center, prospective, randomized Outcome Study comparing continuous cardiac index trending via a radial arterial line versus standard care in general surgical patients Clinical outcome of patients undergoing major abdominal surgery is explored in two different groups. In one group hemodynamic management is guided by the internal standard of the anesthesiological department. In the other group fluid management is goal directed by by continuous cardiac index trending via a radial arterial line and pulse pressure variation.</detailed_description>
