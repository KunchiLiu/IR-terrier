	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to assess what the participant understands about their illness, prognosis, the goals of the cancer treatment and their communication with their oncology providers. This study will help us to figure out how the investigators can improve how other patients understand their illness and goals of treatment and help us improve communication with their doctors. This research is being done because there is not a lot of information on how much patients understand about their illness and prognosis.</brief_summary>
