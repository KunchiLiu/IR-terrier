	<brief_summary>Rib fractures are a common injury of trauma patients and can cause significant pain which, if inadequately treated, can lead to impaired breathing, lung collapse, and respiratory failure. Hence, it is crucial to manage pain associated with rib fractures. Currently, epidurals are used to treat the pain, but placement can be risky as rib fractures are often associated with other injuries and complications. An alternative pain management option is the ON-Q® Pain Relief System. It is an FDA-approved device that automatically and continuously delivers medication to the region of the thoracic intercostal nerves. One study by Truitt et al (2010)demonstrated that the ON-Q® system effectively reduced pain and increased lung volumes after one hour, in patients with three or more rib fractures. However, that study sample was small and did not have a comparison group. In this study, we will compare two groups: 1) ON-Q system and 2) epidural analgesia. We hypothesize that trauma patients with three or more rib fractures, who receive pain management through the ON-Q® Pain Relief System achieve discharge criteria earlier and thus have a shorter hospital length of stay (LOS) when compared with epidural analgesia.</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criteria: 1. Age ≥ 18 years; 2. Three or more rib fractures; 3. Pain 1. Severe pain (i.e. causing deleterious affect on respiratory mechanics, respiratory rate, or oxygen saturations), OR 2. Mild to moderate pain (i.e. minimally affecting respiratory mechanics, respiratory rate, or oxygen saturations) that does not respond to oral or intravenous analgesics within 4 hours; 4. Patient has capacity to provide informed consent, as determined by: 1. Clinical assessment by study staff MD who will explain the study to potential subjects and then ask them to summarize the purpose, procedures, risks and alternatives back to the MD; 2. GCS 15; 3. Clinical assessment by independent MD who will explain the study to potential subjects and then ask them to summarize the purpose, procedures, risks and alternatives back to the MD. Exclusion criteria: 1. Lack capacity to provide informed consent; 2. Intubation at time of enrollment; 3. Contraindications to procedure (e.g. known allergy to local anesthetics). 4. Presence of infection at site of catheter placement; 5. Current use of anticoagulant medication; 6. Known allergy to silver; 7. Inability to obtain informed consent; 8. Body weight &gt; 300 lbs; 9. Pregnancy; 10. Significant comorbid medical illness that might alter the metabolism of the anesthetic agents and result in unexpected toxicity (hepatic, renal or cardiopulmonary disease). All women of childbearing age will receive a urine pregnancy test prior to the start of the interventional portion of the study. A positive test result excludes the patient from inclusion in the study.</criteria>
