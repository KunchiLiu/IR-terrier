	<brief_summary>An estimated 8% to 15% of patients hospitalized for a coronary pathology undergo coronary revascularization surgery with extracorporeal circulation (ECC). (1) Like most major cardiac surgical interventions, it is performed with the heart stopped; this leads to more or less severe myocardial ischemia. The heart is stopped (and therefore deprived of oxygen) for a duration that varies depending on the number of bypasses required, and on the local difficulties encountered. On average, myocardial ischemia lasts between 20 and 80 minutes. Heart protection during coronary revascularization surgery remains a crucial factor in limiting the heart's aerobic function during aortic clamping, and in minimizing the resulting post-operatory ventricular dysfunction. Its quality is a determining factor of the post-operatory issue. High-performance heart protection solutions such as Custodiol have been used by heart surgeons for a few years. They are used as an alternative choice to other cardioplegic solutions, the efficacy of which has already been proven (St Thomas). These two myocardial protection solutions have never been evaluated in an in vivo, randomized, comparative trial.</brief_summary>
