	<brief_summary>The purpose of this research study is to measure with CERSR® (Computerized Electrophysiological Reconstruction of the Spinal Regions) the electrical signals made by the muscles in the lower back 1) when the subject has no low back pain 2) during the time low back pain begins, or 3) during the treatment and resolution of the low back pain, and 4) to study the changes which take place in these muscles as the pain improves with physical therapy treatment as an intervention. The hypotheses to be tested are 1) The CERSR® scan parameters for normal (pain-free) subjects are different from those of subjects with low back pain. 2) CERSR® scan aids the physician in determining a directed physical therapy treatment which leads to relief of low back pain following no more than eight weeks of physical therapy, as measured by relief of pain using a Visual Analog Scale and symptom improvement as measured using the Oswestry Disability Index.</brief_summary>
