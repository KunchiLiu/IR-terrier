	<brief_summary>Major aim of this study is to add scientifically proven insights into cognitive effects of meals to the existing recommendations for school meals in Germany. As a first step the short-term effects of skipping lunch on children's cognitive functioning in the afternoon will be examined in a cross-over trial. The study is conducted in a large comprehensive school in Gelsenkirchen (Germany) including about 150 children.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Because of cerebral particularities, children may react sensitive to short-term variations of nutrient supply. Therefore, an optimised composition of meals at nutritionally favourable mealtime should be considered for optimal cognitive performance. The increasing implementation of all-day schools in Germany requires the children's catering at school. However, also the number of 'meal skippers' is increasing among children. Thus, the effect of skipping of the midday meal at school on cognitive functioning is examined in this experimental cross-over trial. As prior intake of food can have an influence on the physiological effect of test meal, the children's dietary intake in the morning is standardized. The intervention is integrated in the usual everyday school life: 9.15 a.m. standardized snack within the frame of the regular break, 9.45 a.m. to 12.25 p.m. everyday school life, 12.25 p.m. either lunch (control) or only a non-caloric beverage (intervention of 'skipping meal'), 12.45 p.m. to 1.15 p.m. regular lunch break, 1.15 p.m. computerized tests of cognitive functioning, 2 p.m. lunch for the 'skipping meal'-group. Parameters of cognition with relevance to everyday school life are measured by a computerized test battery of the 'Wiener Testsystem'. Usual eating behaviour, sleep behaviour, physical activity, parental education and migration background are determined as control variables by questionnaires for children, parents and teachers. Beside the Body Mass Index, the individual IQ is measured by a paper-pencil-test.</detailed_description>
