	<brief_summary>Anemia is the the most frequently extradigestive symptom for Inflammatory Bowel Disease. This is due to iron deficiency and inflammation. Most of treatments aim to control inflammation using anti-TNF alpha therapy which should theorically reduce anemia. The aim of the study is to show that perfusion of iron associated to anti-TNF therapy should reduce anemia and improve quality of life of patients.</brief_summary>
