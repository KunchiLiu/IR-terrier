	<brief_title>Influence of Treatment for Patent Ductus Arteriosus on Cerebral Oxygenation in Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In this observational trial the investigators want to examine whether clinical or echocardiographic parameters of patent ductus arteriosus are related to - cerebral tissue oxygen saturation, total hemoglobin, fractional tissue oxygen extraction and HbD - renal tissue oxygen saturation, total hemoglobin, fractional tissue oxygen extraction and HbD as measured by near infrared spectroscopy and to - stroke volume - cardiac output as measured by electrical cardiometry. The investigators want to examine the impact of surgical and medical treatment for patent ductus on these parameters. The investigators want to compare the change of these parameters between responders to medical treatment and nonresponders.</detailed_description>
