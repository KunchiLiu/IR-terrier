	<brief_summary>This is a study aimed to characterize [18F]PBR111 as an in vivo marker of microglial activation in Multiple Sclerosis. Regional binding of [18F]PBR111 will be quantified with PET in the brain of up to 24 patients with multiple sclerosis and up to 24 age- and gender- matched healthy volunteers.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>[18F]PBR111 and Microglial Activation in Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple Sclerosis is characterized by brain areas of focal neuroinflammation. Imaging of microglia activation in multiple sclerosis could represent a useful marker of neuroinflammation. A novel PET tracer with high affinity to TSPO, [18F]PBR111, is a promising tool for PET imaging of activated microglia. This is a study aimed to characterize [18F]PBR111 as an in vivo marker of microglial activation in Multiple Sclerosis. Regional binding of [18F]PBR111 will be quantified with PET in the brain of up to 24 patients with multiple sclerosis and up to 24 age- and gender- matched healthy volunteers. A subgroup of patients and healthy volunteers will be scanned twice in consecutive days, to test the reproducibility of the measure. Another subgroup of patients will be re-scanned with [18F]PBR111 after 4-6 months. MRI-based measures will be acquired at baseline and, in those patients with later repeat PET scans, also after 4-6 months. Data from this study will inform about the possible implementation of the [18F]PBR111 ligand to monitor the neuroinflammatory process, disease progression, and response to treatment in MS patients.</detailed_description>
