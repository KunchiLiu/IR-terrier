	<brief_title>Eltrombopag for the Management of Thrombocytopenia Associated With Tyrosine Kinase Therapy in Patients With Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) and Myelofibrosis (MF)</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive eltrombopag by mouth 1 time a day. Your dose may be increased every 2 weeks depending on your platelet count response. You should take eltrombopag on an empty stomach. You should not eat for 2 hours before taking eltrombopag. You should wait at least 4 hours between taking eltrombopag and taking other drugs (like antacids), dairy products, juices with calcium added, or supplements containing iron, calcium, aluminum, magnesium, selenium, or zinc. Study Visits: Some of the routine blood draws listed below may be done at a clinic near your home. Ask the study staff for more details about this. The dose adjustment phase is when the study doctor will change the dose of the study drug or your drug for treatment of CML or myelofibrosis. During the dose adjustment phase: - Before the most effective dose is found, blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn 1 time every week for routine tests and to check your platelet counts. - After the most effective dose is found, blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn 1 time each month for routine tests and to check your platelet counts. During the first year of eltrombopag therapy, every 3-4 months: - Your medical history will be recorded. - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your height, weight, and vital signs. - You will be asked about side effects you may be having and any other drugs you may be taking. - You will have a standard-of-care bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy to check the status of the disease. This sample will also be used for genetic research tests. If an aspirate cannot be collected, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for these tests. After the first year of eltrombopag therapy, every 6 months, you will return to the clinic and have the same tests and procedures performed as listed above. You will have a bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy every 12 months after the first year to check the status of the disease. Length of Study: You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the end-of-treatment visit. End-of-Treatment Visit: About 30 days after your last dose of study drug, you will return to the clinic for an end-of-treatment visit. - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your height, weight, and vital signs. - You will be asked about any side effects you may be having. - Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. This blood will also be used to check your platelet counts. This is an investigational study. Eltrombopag is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of patients with low platelet counts. The use of eltrombopag for the treatment of low platelet counts in patients with CML and myelofibrosis is investigational. Up to 39 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. CML patients in chronic phase receiving treatment with any FDA approved TKI; or CML patients in accelerated or blastic phase who are considered to be in this phase because of thrombocytopenia or because of clonal evolution and with no other criteria for accelerated/blastic phase or patients with myelofibrosis receiving treatment with FDA approved TKI and with peripheral blood and/or bone marrow blasts &lt;/= 10%. 2. Grade &gt;/= 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt; 50 x 10^9/L) after the first 3 months of therapy with the TKI for patients with CML and platelets &lt;100 x 10^9/L for patients with MF after the first 3 months of therapy. Thrombocytopenia must be either recurrent (i.e., second or greater episode of thrombocytopenia) or having required dose reductions of the TKI. 3. Subject is anticipated to have therapy with TKI continued for &gt;/= 3 months 4. Adequate organ function: Total bilirubin (except for Gilbert's Syndrome) &lt;/= 1.5 x ULN; ALT and AST &lt; 3 x ULN; Creatinine &lt;/= 2 x ULN 1. CML patients in accelerated or blastic phase except for those who are considered to be in this phase because of thrombocytopenia or because of clonal evolution and with no other criteria for accelerated/blastic phase; or myelofibrosis patients who have transformed to acute leukemia or have &gt;/= 10% blasts in peripheral blood and/or in bone marrow. 2. Thrombocytopenia that is considered to be unrelated to treatment with TKI or accelerated phase as defined above; 3. Age &lt; 18 years; 4. Stem cell transplantation within preceding 60 days prior to registration; 5. Patients with documented active hepatitis B or C infection; 6. Patients with known bone marrow reticulin fibrosis (&gt;/= grade 2) (only applicable to patients with CML); 7. Patients with palpable splenomegaly &gt;/= 16cm below coastal margin (only applicable to patients with CML). 8. Female subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential are required to have a BHCG serum or urine pregnancy test performed within 7 days prior to first study drug dose. A female of childbearing potential is a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months). Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use contraception prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. 9. Patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism (e.g. Factor V Leiden mutation, ATIII deficiency, Protein C and S deficiency, antiphospholipid syndrome, portal hypertension, etc.)</criteria>
