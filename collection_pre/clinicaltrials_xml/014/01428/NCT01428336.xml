	<brief_summary>The diagnosis of secondary AI is vital to prevent catastrophic events in patients. An optimal test should have a very low margin of error with high sensitivity and specificity, be easy and safe to administer, and have distinct cut off values. Both 1 ug and 250 ug doses have their limitations. Based on our experience over the past six years, we hypothesize that 25 ug ACTH stimulation test may eliminate some of the shortcomings of the LDST (1 ug) and SDST (250 ug). This is supported by our preliminary data and the study by Oelkers et al, which looked at ACTH levels following various doses of cortrosyn injections. Therefore we propose a head to head comparison of 25 ug, 250 ug and 1 ug dose using ITT as gold standard.</brief_summary>
