	<brief_title>Does Coronary Angiography Cause Cognitive Dysfunction?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We have previously shown, using transcranial doppler, that coronary angiography cause cerebral microembolism. Cerebral microemboli were more common using the radial than femoral approach. Previously, cerebral microembolism has been associated with new cerebral lesions on MRI. The clinical significance of these new lesions is not determined. The primary aim of this pilot study is to see if coronary angiography cause cognitive dysfunction determined by the MoCA-test. A secondary aim is to relate cognitive dysfunction to cerebral microembolism measured by transcranial doppler. A third aim is to study potential differences between the femoral and radial approaches.</detailed_description>
