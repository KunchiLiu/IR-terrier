	<criteria>Subject has moderate to severe chronic noncancer pain (duration of at least 3 months) requiring a continuous aroundtheclock opioid analgesic for an extended period of time. Conditions may include, but are not limited to, osteoarthritis, chronic low back pain, or other opioid responsive pain conditions. Subject agrees to refrain from taking opioid medications other than study drug during the study. (The exception is during the PreTreatment Period when the subject may continue current opioid therapy to guide first 4 weeks of the Treatment Period when the subject may administer immediaterelease oxycodone to support conversion to study drug.) Subject has moderate or severe chronic pain due to cancer, migraine, recent trauma, infection, or other pain expected to be shortterm (duration less than 3 months). Subject has a documented history of alcohol or drug abuse within 1 year prior to study entry that in the Investigator's judgment would impact subject participation. Subject has ongoing or active alcohol or drug abuse that in the Investigator's judgment would impact subject participation. Subject has a positive urine drug test for illicit drug use or medications at screening without legitimate medical explanation. Subject has a clinically significant medical condition (e.g., cardiovascular, neurological, renal, hepatic, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, endocrine, hematological, immunological, rheumatological, metabolic, or psychiatric) or physical examination, vital signs (VS), 12lead electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical laboratory abnormalities that in the opinion of the Investigator would impact the safety of the subject during study participation. If female, the subject is pregnant or breastfeeding. Subject has a known history or known hypersensitivity to oxycodone, oxycodone salts, naltrexone or acetaminophen,or pharmacological similar compounds. Subject is historically nonresponsive to oxycodone treatment or requires greater than 160 mg oxycodone in a 24hour time interval.</criteria>
