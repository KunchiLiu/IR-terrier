	<brief_summary>Antagonists of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway are effective in treating macular edema resulting from retinal vein occlusion (RVO). In the eye, the two most widely used anti-VEGF agents are ranibizumab and bevacizumab. Only ranibizumab has been FDA-approved for the treatment of macular edema from RVO, however bevacizumab has been used off-label by many ophthalmologists with good success. Furthermore, the cost of bevacizumab is less than one-tenth the cost of ranibizumab. Here the investigators conduct a six month randomized, prospective interventional trial comparing the effectiveness of ranibizumab with bevacizumab in the treatment of macular edema from RVO. Primary outcome measures are change in central retinal thickness. Secondary measures are change in visual acuity from baseline and change in angiographic properties of macular lesions from baseline after treatment.</brief_summary>
