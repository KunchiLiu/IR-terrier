	<detailed_description>Background: Several local registries seek to show an isolated clinical characteristics of patients hospitalized with heart failure (HF) in hospitals and communities in Brazil. Overall, the analysis of these data suggests that there are important differences in etiology, the factors of decompensation, treatment and prognosis of HF patients in different regions. Objectives: To evaluate the demographic, clinical, prognostics characteristics of 1,200 patients admitted with clinical diagnosis of decompensate heart failure in a group of 60 hospitals representative in different regions. Other specific objectives include describing the in-hospital mortality after admission, to describe the content and the reason for re-admission, to assess adherence to evidence-based guidelines (recommended by guidelines), to measure indicators of quality of care and establish a national registry data to allow for comparison with international records of patients admitted with ADHF. Methods: Observational cross (record) with longitudinal follow-up where patients admitted to public and private hospitals primarily defined in IC will be studied.</detailed_description>
