	<brief_summary>Open-vent jet nebulizers are frequently used to promote drug lung deposition but their clinical efficacy and indications are not clear. Our study aimed to compare inhaled mass, and lung deposition of amikacin by using a jet nebulizer (Sidestream) under two different configurations: vented and unvented coupled to a 110 ml corrugated piece of tubing.</brief_summary>
