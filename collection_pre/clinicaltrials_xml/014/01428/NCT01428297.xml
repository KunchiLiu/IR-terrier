	<brief_summary>The study is divided in 3 parts, starting with the safety assessment of BPR277 ointment in Healthy volunteers (Part 1). If found to be well tolerated in Part 1, BPR277 ointment will be assessed in two different patients groups to evaluate safety and efficacy in atopic dermatitis (Part 2) and in Netherton syndrome (Part 3).</brief_summary>
