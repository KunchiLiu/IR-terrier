	<brief_summary>The purpose of this study is to provide anti-hepatitis C virus drugs to patients who received placebo + peginterferon alfa-2a + ribavirin in prior Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) studies and determine whether addition of these drugs results in higher cure rates in patients who previously failed therapy. Approximately 100 genotype 1b patients who received placebo in BMS study NCT01428063 (AI447-028) will receive active drugs in this study.</brief_summary>
