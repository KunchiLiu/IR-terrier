	<brief_summary>The Whipple operation is a complex surgical procedure involving the removal of the head of the pancreas, bile duct, and a portion of the intestine (duodenum) that is performed for patients who have cancer or some other condition affecting this region of the body. The Whipple operation is associated with a significant complication rate. Previous studies have shown that in a broad range of surgical procedures, using a reduced amount of intravenous fluids along with a special type of fluid called hypertonic saline during and after the procedure can lower complication rates associated with the heart and lungs during recovery from surgery. The purpose of this study is to determine if using a reduced amount of intravenous fluids as well as hypertonic saline (a salt concentrated form of intravenous fluids) during the Whipple operation and in the immediate period after surgery can reduce complications.</brief_summary>
