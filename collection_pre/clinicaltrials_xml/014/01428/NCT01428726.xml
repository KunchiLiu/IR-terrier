	<detailed_description>This is a Phase IIa study, double blind, placebo Controlled, Multicenter Study that will involve up to 99 patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. After signing the informed consent form, subjects will be randomized to three treatments arms: placebo, NT-KO-003 low dose or NT-KO-003 high dose. Treatment will continue daily during 6 months. A MRI and a clinical evaluation will be performed monthly. Safety will be assessed during the 6 months treatment and until 15 days after the finalization of the treatment.
