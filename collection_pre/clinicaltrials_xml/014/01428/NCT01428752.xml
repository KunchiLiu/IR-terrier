	<brief_summary>Current guidelines for initiating screening colonoscopies in patients younger than 50 years of age who have a first relative history of colorectal cancer are controversial. The aim of this study was to prospectively define the prevalence of colorectal adenoma 30- to 49-years-old asymptomatic subjects with a first relative history of colorectal cancer and to compare the data with controls.

	<brief_title>Study of Prevalence of Colorectal Adenoma in 30- to 49-year-old Subjects With a Family History of Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer screening is recommended for average-risk persons beginning at age 50. A family history of colorectal cancer is recognized as a risk factor for colorectal adenoma. However, the strength of this association is uncertain. Current guidelines for initiating screening colonoscopies in patients younger than 50 years of age who have a first relative history of colorectal cancer have proved controversial. The conflicting recommendations are partly attributable to the lack of data about the prevalence of CRC and adenomas among 30- to 49-year-old individuals with a first relative history of colorectal cancer. This prospective study will quantify the prevalence of adenomas (any size) and advanced adenomas among 30- to 49-year-old individuals undergoing their first screening colonoscopy because of a first relative history of colorectal cancer and compare the data with controls(asymptomatic subjects without a first relative history of colorectal cancer).</detailed_description>
