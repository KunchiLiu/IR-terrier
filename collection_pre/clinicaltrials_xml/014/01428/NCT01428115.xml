	<brief_summary>It has been shown that emotional health issues, such as state anxiety, are more prevalent in patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) compared to physically healthy subjects. Such findings have to be taken into consideration when making an educated guess that psychological factors such as depression and anxiety in particular interact with the course of Crohns disease. Therefore the treatment of the underlying disease may have a significant influence on the level of psychological disorders. Several studies have shown that treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) antibodies ameliorates the emotional/psychological status of patients, however the impact of adalimumab therapy on anxiety correlated with the status of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains unclear. The primary objective of this study was to describe and evaluate changes in levels of anxiety assessed by validated patient questionnaires after 6 months of treatment with adalimumab.</brief_summary>
