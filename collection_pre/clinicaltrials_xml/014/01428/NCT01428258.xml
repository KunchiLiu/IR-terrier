	<brief_summary>For individuals with Phenylketonuria (PKU), the investigators hypothesize that glycomacropeptide will provide an acceptable form of low-phenylalanine dietary protein that will improve dietary compliance, blood phenylalanine levels, cognitive function, and ultimately quality of life compared with the usual amino acid based diet. The study is funded by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Office of Orphan Products Development Grants Program, R01 FD003711.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study of Glycomacropeptide Versus Amino Acid Diet for Management of Phenylketonuria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU) lack the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase that is needed to metabolize the essential amino acid phenylalanine (phe). When eating a normal diet they show an elevated level of phe in blood that is toxic to the brain. In order to prevent brain damage and cognitive impairment, individuals with PKU must follow a lifelong, low-phe diet that is restricted in natural foods and requires ingestion of a phe-free amino acid (AA) formula. Most adolescents and adults with PKU find the AA formula unpalatable and go off the diet resulting in elevated blood phe levels and neuropsychological deterioration. Glycomacropeptide (GMP), an intact protein produced during cheese making, is uniquely suited to a low-phe diet because it is the only known dietary protein that contains minimal phe. Foods and beverages made with GMP are a palatable alternative to AA formula. The long term goal is to assess the safety, efficacy and acceptability of GMP for the nutritional management of PKU. The specific aim is to conduct a randomized, two-stage, 11-wk, crossover trial comparing the GMP diet with the AA diet in 30 subjects with PKU â‰¥12 years of age treated since birth with a low-phe AA diet. The sites are: University of Wisconsin-Madison, Waisman Center (primary) and Harvard University, Children's Hospital Boston. Subjects will be recruited and randomized to begin the first 3-wk of the study with either a low-phe diet in which the majority of dietary protein is provided by GMP or AA medical foods and then, after a 3-wk washout with intake of their usual diet, begin the second diet for 3-wk. Dietary education will be provided in a 1-wk base period preceding initiation of each diet.</detailed_description>
