	<brief_title>A Study to Assess the Effects of Multiple-Dose Probenecid on the Multiple-Dose Pharmacokinetics of Canagliflozin in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This will be a single-center, open-label (identity of study treatments will be known to volunteers participating in the study as well as to study staff) study to assess the effects of multiple doses of probenecid on the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of canagliflozin and its metabolites in healthy volunteers. The study will last up to approximately 49 days (includes a Screening Phase of up to 19 days, an Open-Label Treatment Phase of 20 days, and a Post-Treatment Phase of up to 7 to 10 days). Healthy volunteers will take orally (by mouth) one 300 mg canagliflozin tablet once daily and/or one 500-mg probenecid tablet twice daily in sequential order as follows: Days 1 to 14 (administration of canagliflozin alone) and Days 15 to 17 (administration of canagliflozin + twice-daily administration of probenecid). On days when both canagliflozin and probenecid are taken, both doses must be taken at approximately the same time.</detailed_description>
