	<brief_summary>Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) programs have been introduced with aims of attenuating the stress response to surgery and enabling rapid recovery. There is strong evidence of the usefulness of the ERAS programs in patients undergoing colorectal surgery in terms of significantly reduced postoperative complications and shorter length of hospital stay, compared to the patients of traditional treatment. However, few studies exist about the implication of ERAS programs in major upper abdominal surgery patients. The aim of this study was to compare morbidity, mortality and length of stay in patients undergoing major intrabdominal surgery, including upper and lower gastrointestinal, receiving either conventional postoperative care or an ERAS program.</brief_summary>
