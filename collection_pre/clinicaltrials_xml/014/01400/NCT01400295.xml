	<brief_summary>To determine a relatively safe contrast media volume to creatinine clearance cut-off value to avoid contrast-induced nephropathy in patients following coronary angiography</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PREdictive Value of COntrast voluMe to creatinINe Clearance Ratio</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Contrast media volume to creatinine clearance (V/CrCl) ratios were obtained from consecutive consenting patients after coronary angiography. Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves were used to identify the optimal sensitivity for the observed range of V/CrCl. The predictive value of V/CrCl for the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy was assessed using multivariate logistic regression.Subgroup analysis was performed on patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 60 ml/min,diabetes,emergent angiography.</detailed_description>
