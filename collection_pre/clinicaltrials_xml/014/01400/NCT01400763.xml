	<brief_summary>Macular pigment is composed primarily of the xanthophylls lutein and zeaxanthin, which are members of the carotenoid family. Epidemiological evidence indicates that a higher intake of lutein and zeaxanthin is associated with a lower risk to develop age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The lipid matrix of an egg yolk is an excellent vehicle for the efficient absorption of dietary lutein and it is possible to increase the natural lutein concentration in an egg yolk. A fresh lutein-enriched egg yolk beverage has been produced using these lutein-enriched egg-yolks. However, this beverage has a limited shelf life of maximum three weeks. Drying this fresh beverage extents the shelf live, however, this should be without loosing its functional properties concerning lutein bioavailability. At WUR-FBR two types of drying procedures have been evaluated resulting in two different dried product formulations, which need to be tested. The question is, whether the lutein bioavailability is not affected by different drying procedures.</brief_summary>
