	<brief_title>An Evaluation of a Developmentally-Based Parent Training Program for Children With Autism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There are many treatments that claim to be effective for children with autism; however many of these treatments have not been investigated using scientifically rigorous methodology. A variety of developmentally based parent delivered interventions are gaining popularity as a type of treatment parents utilize to improve symptoms related to their child's diagnosis of autism. Pacific Autism Center for Education (PACE)is a agency that provides a developmentally based parent delivered intervention in the community. Currently, this parent training program has not been evaluated using scientific methodology. Investigation into this community delivered treatment and its effectiveness to improve social and communication deficits will aid clinicians in providing better care for children with autism.</detailed_description>
