	<brief_title>Aloe Vera in Irritable Bowel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There is limited knowledge of the IBS pathophysiology, absence of biological markers and therefore few effective treatment options. IBS therefore contributes to difficulties in the management of the patients. Aloe vera has a long association with herbal medicine, from the Ebers Papyrus from 16th century BCE. It is alleged to be effective in treatment of wounds, to improve blood glucose levels in diabetics, and it may reduce symptoms and inflammation in patients with ulcerative colitis. Evidence of the effects of aloe vera in the treatment of IBS, is however limited and contradictory.</detailed_description>
