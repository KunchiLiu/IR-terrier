	<brief_title>Relation of Blood-boron Levels With Body Mass Index</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In the results of our experimental study on mices we revealed that low dose oral boric acid intake cause seriously body mas reducing. Although blood and urine analyses support high glucose, lipid and middle protein catabolisms, but the mechanism was unclear. There are some diseases according to blood elementary deficiencies, like hypothyroidi in hypoiyodinemia, hiperparathyroidi in hypocalcemia, etc. We hypothesised that hypoboronemia may be corralated to body mass index level.</detailed_description>
