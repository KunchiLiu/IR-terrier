	<brief_summary>Diagnostic purposes of the coronary angiography is to detect stenosis (anatomy) and to detect ischemia related stenosis (function). Coronary angiography (CAG) is a gold standard invasive techniques, but has several limitations. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) provides tomographic intra-luminal images. Coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) is helpful to assess precise anatomical information. Optimal functional criteria and their accuracy of IVUS and CCTA by fraction flow reserve (FFR) have not been compared yet.</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Correlation between CCTA, IVUS and FFR will be evaluated. The presence of myocardial ischemia will be assessed by fractional flow reserve (FFR). Diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive/negative predictive values and diagnostic accuracy) of each modality will be assessed and compared.</detailed_description>
