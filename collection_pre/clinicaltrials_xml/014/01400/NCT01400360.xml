	<brief_summary>Cerebral vasospasm(CVS) after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) results in a considerable amount of transient or even permanent neurological deficits and poor outcome of the patients. Transluminal Balloon angioplasty (TBA) or intraarterial application of vasodilators represents a rescue therapy for severe CVS. Indication, duration and efficacy of this treatment, however, is still under debate. Aim of the study is to investigate if such a rescue treatment can significantly reduce new delayed ischemic cerebral deficits after SAH. Hypothesis is that the occurance of delayed infarcts can be reduced by repetetive intraarterial therapy to more than 50 %.</brief_summary>
