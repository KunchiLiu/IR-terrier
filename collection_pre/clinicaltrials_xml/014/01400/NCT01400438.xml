	<brief_summary>Many studies have been devoted to the quality of life of patients during adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer by highlighting fatigue, psychological distress and impact on the immediate environment (spouse, children) during this difficult time for women. Curiously, no study to date has been submitted or published about how women with a one-year treatment "extra" Herceptin ® live this period in terms of quality of life, in terms of psychological impact for themselves and their families. The investigators have no more data on how often they return to work during this treatment or on the psycho-social parameters which underpin them. It therefore seemed interesting to "give a spotlight" on this particular period in these women HER2 + by comparing a patient population of same age receiving the same adjuvant but with no Herceptin ®.</brief_summary>
