	<brief_summary>A prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label study will be carried out on 80 post-menopausal women affected by the metabolic syndrome (criteria are described in NIH ATP III). After a written informed consent, women will be randomly treated for 6 months with hypocaloric diet (control group) or with diet and a supplementation of myo-inositol 2000 mg plus cocoa polyphenols 30 mg and plus isoflavones 80 mg. will be given randomly Eighty post-menopausal women, affected by metabolic syndrome will be randomized into two groups: 40 treated with myo-inositol 2 g twice per day and forty treated with placebo for six months. The investigators hypothesize that the administration of myo-inositol would improve the insulin-receptor activity in these women, reducing insulin resistance.</brief_summary>
