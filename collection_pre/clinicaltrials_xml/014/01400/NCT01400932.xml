	<brief_summary>This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group study in Japanese subjects with acne vulgaris to demonstrate the efficacy of GI148512 (benzoyl peroxide [BPO] 3% gel) when applied once daily for 12 weeks. This study will also evaluate the safety of GI148512 when applied topically once daily for 12 weeks.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study STF115288, a Clinical Confirmation Study of GI148512 in the Treatment of Acne Vulgaris in Japanese Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Main inclusion criteria will be 12 to 45 years of age, who have an Investigator Static Global Assessment (ISGA) score of 2 or greater at baseline visit, and have both 17 to 60 facial inflammatory lesions (papules plus pustules) and 20 to 150 facial non-inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones), including nasal lesions. The primary objective is to demonstrate the superiority of GI148512 to vehicle gel in total lesion counts. The secondary objectives are to demonstrate the superiority of GI148512 to vehicle gel in inflammatory lesion counts, and to evaluate the efficacy of GI148512 compared with vehicle gel at each visit. A total of 360 subjects will be enrolled and randomly assigned to one of the groups.</detailed_description>

Received treatment with estrogens, androgens, or antiandrogenic agents within the previous 12 weeks (Subjects who have been treated with the above agents for more than 12 consecutive weeks prior to start of investigational product are allowed to enrol as long as they do not expect to change dose, drug, or discontinue use during the study). Used any medication that in the opinion of the investigator may affect this clinical study or evaluation of the study. Plan to use medications that are reported to exacerbate acne (e.g., megadoses of certain vitamins, such as vitamin D [&gt;2000 IU/day] and vitamin B12 [&gt;1 mg/day], corticosteroids*, androgens, haloperidol, halogens [e.g., iodide and bromide], lithium, hydantoin, and phenobarbital). *: except the using of topical corticosteroids (e.g., inhaled, intraarticular, or intralesional steroids) other than for facial acne.
