	<brief_summary>The Pizza-Salami-Study aims to investigate the efficacy of carbohydrate plus fat/protein (CFP) counting compared with carbohydrate (CARB) counting using normal and dual-wave bolus in sensor-augmented pump therapy in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. For fat/protein counting the model used by Pankowska et al. will be applied.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pizza-Salami Study in Children and Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This is a prospective, international multi-centre, open randomized clinical trial to assess whether the use of Paradigm REAL-Time System from the onset of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) leads to a better glycaemic control after 12 months of T1D compared with the use of Paradigm 515/715 insulin pump combined with conventional Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose finger-sticks in paediatric patients. Total randomized treatment duration of the study for a patient will be 12 months with an optional phase of follow-up of 3 months.Patients eligible according to inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized to one of the two treatment groups. A total of 160 patients will be recruited. Each subject will participate in the study for 15 months, which includes 12 months of treatment and 3 months of follow-up. Each patient is asked to use either the Paradigm REAL-Time System that provides a combination of insulin pump and the Real-Time continuous glucose monitoring or Paradigm 515/715 insulin pump combined to conventional SMBG finger-sticks. Main time-points of assessments are at baseline (within one month after T1D onset) and 12 months thereafter. In total, there will be 6 study visits at the local site. During study, patients will regularly attend the outpatient clinic according to local Standard care, i.e. every 8Â±2 weeks.</detailed_description>
