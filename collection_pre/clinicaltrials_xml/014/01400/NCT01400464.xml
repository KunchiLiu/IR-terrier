	<brief_summary>The factors underlying the large interindividual variability in response to glucocorticoids in Giant Cell Arteritis are poorly understood. The investigators hypothesize that a part of this variability is related to pharmacokinetic factors determined by genetic polymorphism: hepatic clearance involving cytochromes P450 of the subfamily 3A (CYP3A) and drug efflux leukocyte conditioned by P-glycoprotein involved in multidrug resistance drugs (ABCB1). The investigators have designed a multicentric prospective pharmacokinetical and pharmacogenetic cohort study to assess the link between prednisolone clearance and the relapse risk in giant cell arteritis.</brief_summary>

New onset or new type of localized pain in the head 3. Temporal artery abnormality (i.e., temporal artery tenderness to palpation or decreased pulsation unrelated to arteriosclerosis of cervical arteries) 4.
