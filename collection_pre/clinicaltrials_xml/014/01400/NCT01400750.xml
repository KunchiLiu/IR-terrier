	<brief_summary>Treatment of new Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) can postpone chronic infection. Aim of the study: compare 2 Pa eradication regimens in children with new Pa infection.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison of 2 Treatment Regimens for Eradication of P Aeruginosa Infection in Children With Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods: CF children (0-18 years) with a new isolation of Pa from the airway were randomized to tobramycin inhalation solution (TOBI® 2x300 mg for 28 days) (TIS) or inhaled colistimethate sodium (Colistineb® 2x2 mill U daily) plus oral ciprofloxacin (30mg/kg/day) for 3 months (CC). The primary outcome was eradication at end of treatment. Secondary outcome parameters were time to Pa relapse, total and Pa specific IgG, FEV1, BMI and Pa status.</detailed_description>
