	<brief_summary>This is Multicentre, Observational Study to study Adherence and Long Term Outcomes of Therapy in paediatric subjects using easypod™ electromechanical device for growth hormone treatment to assess the level of adherence of subject receiving SAIZEN® via easypod™.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Level of Adherence of Subjects Receiving SAIZEN® Via Easypod™ in Czech Republic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects will be enrolled in a multicenter longitudinal observational study. Parents/ subjects will provide their Informed Consent/assent to upload their data for population-based analyses and, ultimately, clinical outcomes. Adherence data will be primarily derived from the easypod™ device combined with physician data entry of outcome measures. Data will be collected retrospectively and prospectively. This will allow the establishment of adherence profiles and subsequent clinical outcomes. Collected data will be also analyzed in a multinational pooled analysis of comparable national studies. Primary Objective: • To assess the level of adherence of subjects receiving SAIZEN® via easypod™. Secondary Objective: - To identify adherence subject profiling - To describe the impact of adherence on clinical outcomes for subject receiving SAIZEN® via easypod™ - To asses the impact of adherence on Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF1) (i.e. above, below or within normal ranges)</detailed_description>
