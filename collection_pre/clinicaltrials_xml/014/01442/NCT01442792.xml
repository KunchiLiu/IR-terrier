	<brief_summary>Balloon angioplasty (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)) is commonly used to treat patients with obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Although PCI is highly effective for the management of CAD, it can potentiate an existing prothrombotic state around lesion areas. A certain level of anticoagulation is required to perform planned PCI safely and to minimize the periprocedural risk of thrombosis and its attendant complications, including myocardial ischemia and infarction (heart attack). Many different anti-thrombotic regimens have been investigated and are currently in use. The aim of this study is to explore whether Rivaroxaban, as compared to unfractionated heparin, on the background of standard dual antiplatelet therapy, can effectively suppress thrombosis and related adverse ischemic events, upon balloon inflation and stent expansion, during elective PCI, without increasing bleeding. The treatment assignment will be done in a semi-blinded design, eg, no blinding for randomization either to Rivaroxaban (one of the three arms) or the control (UFH) group. However, all will be blinded for the treatment dose of rivaroxaban (either 10mg or 20 mg).The 10 mg rivaroxaban plus 50 IU UFH arm will not be blinded.</brief_summary>
