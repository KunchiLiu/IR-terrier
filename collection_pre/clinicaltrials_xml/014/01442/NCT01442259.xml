	<criteria>Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed. Female subjects must be of nonchild bearing potential as defined as postmenopausal females with no regular menstrual bleeding for at least 1 year prior to inclusion Body weight: ≥50kg; BMI: 1834 kg/m2 Ability to communicate well with the investigator and comply with the requirements of the study. For subjects with renal impairment only No current clinically significant disease (other than renal impairment), except for stable underlying disease that caused renal impairment, as determined by clinical history and physical examination. MDRDcalculated eGFR of &lt;90 mL/min/1.73 m2 based on serum creatinine Vital signs (after 3 minutes resting measured in the supine position) should be within normal ranges as deemed by the Investigator. For healthy subjects only No current clinically significant disease as determined by clinical history and physical examination. MDRDcalculated eGFR of ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2 based on serum creatinine. Vital signs (after 3 minutes resting measured in the supine position) should be within normal ranges as deemed by the Investigator. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) females Use of any prescription or overthecounter (OTC) drugs, herbal (e.g. St. John's wort) ordietary supplements (e.g. broccoli, vitamins) within three weeks or five half lives(whichever is longer) prior to dosing with AFQ056 until study completion. This does not include drugs that are used as (symptomatic) treatment of renal impairment (e.g. antihypertensive and antidiabetic drugs) provided such drugs are: used at the same dose within three weeks or five half lives (whichever is longer) prior to dosing with AFQ056 until study completion. not known as inhibitors or inducers of CYP1A1, 1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4, 3A5 gp). Participation in any clinical investigation or use of any investigational drug within 30 days or five (5) halflives of a given investigational drug (whichever period is longer); or longer if required by local regulations prior to screening until study completion Donation or loss of 400 mL or more of blood within 8 weeks prior to first dosing, or longer if required by local regulation. History of renal transplantation History or presence of prolonged QTc interval (males: &gt;450ms; females: &gt; 470 ms), 2nd or 3rd degree AVblock or any other clinically significant ECG abnormalities as determined by medical history and 12lead ECG recordings at screening and baseline 1. History or presence of any clinically significant disease of any major system organ class, within the past 2 years prior to screening, except for renal impairment and underlying diseases causing renal impairment for the subject belonging to the renal impairment groups. Subjects undergoing any method of dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) History of or ongoing active substance abuse (including alcohol) within the past 2 years. Smokers (use of tobacco products in the previous 3 months). Urine cotinine levels will be measured during Screening and at Baseline for all subjects. Smokers will be defined as any subject who reports tobacco use and/or who has a urine cotinine ≥ 500 ng/mL at screening Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.</criteria>
