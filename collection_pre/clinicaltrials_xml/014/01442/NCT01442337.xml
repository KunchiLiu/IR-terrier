Donor had a history of hypertension 3. Donor's terminal serum creatinine concentration was &gt; 1.5 mg/dL 2. Donation after Cardiac Death (DCD) Donor was pronounced dead prior to procurement of the kidney 3. Standard Criteria Donor (SCD) i. Donor with terminal serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL where kidney is anticipated to have a minimum of 24 hours of cold ischemia prior to transplantation, OR ii.

For recipients where only a flow cytometry crossmatch is performed and is positive in either T or B cell testing, recipients are excluded only if donor specific, antiHLA antibody is detected by flow cytometry based, specific antiHLA antibody testing Subject has ABO blood type incompatibility with his/her organ donor Recipient or donor is known by medical history to be seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Subject has a known bleeding diathesis Subject has a International Normalized Ratio (INR) &gt; 1.5 times upper limit of normal at Screening Subject has a platelet count &lt; 100,000 platelets/µL at Screening Subject used antiplatelet agents [e.g., Plavix® (clopidogrel bisulfate), Brilinta® (ticagrelor)] (with the exception of aspirin &lt; 100 mg/day for cardiovascular prophylaxis), anticoagulants [e.g., Pradaxa® (dabigatran), Xarelto® (rivaroxaban)], antithrombotics, and/or bloodthinning agents within the 10 days prior to Screening; and/or subject is expected to require use of any of these agents during the first 15 days of the study period (with the exception of standard of care perioperative administration of heparin for DVT prophylaxis) Subject has an uncontrolled concomitant infection Subject has a current malignancy or a history of any malignancy (within the past 5 years), except nonmetastatic basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has been treated successfully Subject currently is participating in an investigational drug study, or participated in an investigational drug study within the last 30 days) Subject has a history of or is believed to have used an illicit drug(s) and/or abused alcohol within the last 3 months Subject has an unstable psychiatric illness Subject has previously received ASP8597 or participated in a study involving ASP8597</criteria>
