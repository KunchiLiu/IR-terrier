	<brief_title>Plasma Exchanges in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Relapses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses are usually treated by steroids but some patients did not respond well to this treatment. In more than 40 % of MS patients experiencing relapses, residual disability accumulates in spite of steroid treatment and did not recover. Plasma exchanges (PE) are frequently used to treat the severe attacks of inflammatory demyelination in the central nervous system resistant to steroids (Tumani, 2008). This strategy has been evaluated so far only in few studies. Only one randomized controlled study has been performed (Weinshenker et al, 1999) including patients with very severe attacks of inflammatory demyelinating diseases of various origin (MS, acute transverse myelitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, neuromyelitis optica), not improved after a treatment by steroids. A moderate or important improvement of incapacity was observed in 8 cases out of 19 (42.1%) after treatment by PE against 1 out of 17 (5.9%) after sham treatment. This study concerned only 12 patients having a relapse of MS. Based on this first controlled study and the experience of treatment of 42 MS patients in the department of Neurology of the University Hospital Pellegrin (CHU de Bordeaux) we designed a randomized controlled study of PE against sham PE in moderate to severe acute exacerbations of MS not responding to steroid treatment. The purpose is to compare plasma exchanges versus sham exchanges on residual disability in MS patients with a demyelinating inflammatory episode (MS or syndrome with high risk of MS) experiencing a disabling relapse not improved after steroid treatment. The primary end-point will be evaluated one month after start of therapy. Secondary endpoints include safety and evaluation of improvement at 3 and 6 months and evaluation of safety</detailed_description>
