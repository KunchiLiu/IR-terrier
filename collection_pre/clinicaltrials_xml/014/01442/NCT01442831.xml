	<brief_title>Evaluate the Absorption, Metabolism, And Excretion Of Orally Administered [14C] TR 701 In Healthy Adult Male Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study will be an open-label, single-dose study of the absorption, metabolism, and excretion of 200 mg [14C]-TR-701 (approximately 100 μCi) administered orally following at least an 8-hour fast. Subjects will receive a single dose of 200 mg [14C] TR 701 (approximately 100 μCi) administered as an oral solution. The dose will be administered following at least an 8-hour fast and followed by a 4-hour fast from food, not including water.</detailed_description>
