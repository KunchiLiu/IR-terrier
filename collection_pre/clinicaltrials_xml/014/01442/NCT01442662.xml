	<brief_summary>The aim of this research is to study the activity of pazopanib in second line after anthracyclines in extra uterus and uterine LMS in association with gemcitabine.</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy of Gemcitabine With Pazopanib as Second Line Treatment in Patients With Metastatic or Relapsed Uterine or Soft Tissue Leiomyosarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives: To determine the PFS using combination of gemcitabine and pazopanib in patients with metastasis or relapse leiomyosarcoma (uterine or soft tissue)who have already received s first line anthracycline based therapy. Secondary objectives: To determine the disease control rate To determine the response rate To determine toxicities associated with combined gemcitabine and pazopanib To determine correlation between metabolic response and PFS Design: All eligible patients entering the study will receive daily oral pazopanib at 800mg, supplied as 200 mg aqueous film-coated tablets and 2 intravenous gemcitabine every three weeks (8 cycles max). The treatment will continue until the development of unacceptable toxicity or evidence of disease progression or until patient's / investigator's decision of withdrawal.</detailed_description>
