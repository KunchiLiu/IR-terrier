	<brief_summary>Monocytes may be separated into phenotypically and functionally distinct cell types by the presence or absence of the lipopolysaccharide receptor CD14 and the FcÎ³-receptor CD16. The investigators hypothesize that the total numbers of CD16+ monocytes are significantly related to cardiovascular outcome in patients with angiographically proven coronary heart disease.</brief_summary>
